{"text":"Best pizza in town! The omg pizza is really omg big! Everything is fresh and there special dressing is so good. I will recommend this place to Anyone the likes real pizza."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pizza in town, they have good customer service and everything's tasty, pepperoni monster slice and calzone are my favorites."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere. I started coming here about two years ago and make it a point to get in there at least once a month. Everything on the menu is cooked perfectly, everytime. The only issue I have ever had is the place being too packed during lunch, but it should be packed cause the food is so good! Get a classic combo monster slice, grab one of the mason jars of lemonade, and get some garlic knots. You will leave full, happy, and they will thank you as you exit. Old School Pizzeria is exactly what a pizza joint should be."}
{"text":"Went back for another shot. Pie was great. Service was ok. I think I just have bad luck there. Everyone else seems to get good service."}
{"text":"The pizza here was delicious!!! It took around 15 mins to get our pizza because they make the pizza dough right before our eyes!!! We also tried the cannoli's .. They were delicious as well!! I will recommend this place to anyone who likes homemade pizza!"}
{"text":"I really loved Old School Pizzeria. The pizza was so great even the crust!! So many choices. I also love the rosemary lemonade. This is a must try pizza place."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good pizza place near Nellis AFB with little success.  Then a friend (from NY) recommended this place.   It's a little hole in the wall.  Blink and you'll miss it.  It only has 4 tables.  The decor is a little grungy.  The service was excellent. You can watch them make the pizza.  We ordered rosemary garlic knots and a 14in with pepperoni, sausage, olives, mushrooms, green pepper, and garlic.  The garlic knots came first.  They were amazing!  A good start that had us excited to try the pizza.  We would not be disappointed.  The pizza was absolutely delicious.  The crust is soft and fluffy on top and crispy on bottom. The toppings were perfect.  It was one of the best pizzas we have ever tasted.  This will definitely be our go to place for pizza from now on."}
{"text":"They were a lil expensive, but we thought it was delicious!! We ate the whole thing. Went back months later and tried the Vegas meets Italy, ohhhhhh my goodness...yeah, we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I was in town with my band this last spring and a bunch of us came in for dinner. They handled us very well. We ordered some garlic bread sticks and a bunch of pizzas. These are much better than your topical pizza. The owner personally came out to serve us and to make sure our orders were up to our expectations. Next time I am in town I will be visiting this place."}
{"text":"Old School is stepping it up ! Didn't have to wait for a table tonight. New seating and more tables makes coming here even better. We usually take our pizza home but now we don't have to. Fresh from the oven into my mouth ! OLD SCHOOL PIZZERIA is the BEST PIZZA IN TOWN !"}
{"text":"First time trying here I don't regret it.. It's bomb!!! Good pizza and the salad so good. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this pizzeria for over a year now, and I have to say, I am NEVER disappointed! The staff is very nice and attentive. The place may look a little rough on the outside, but please don't let that stop you.

I am one of those people who usually sticks to one thing on the menu (the original 5 cheese with red sauce, not pesto), but yesterday, I decided to take a suggestion from another yelper and try the Vegas meets Italy. OH MY. I think it may be the best pizza I've ever had. It was perfect in every single way.. Sweet, salty, rich, delicious. Their homemade ricotta is so heavenly. And while it may seem weird to put dates on a pizza, it was the perfect accompaniment  to the prosciutto.

Come and support your small businesses. This pizzeria is truly a gem!"}
{"text":"LOVE love love it here. It's a lil rustic country inside with benches and chalkboard walls. The pizzas are fresh so it takes just a little bit, but it's worth the wait. 
The garlic knots are a must!"}
{"text":"Decent pie.  They do make it right in front of you and it is decent pizza.  Fresh ingredients as well.  Could use just a bit more saucewhen making the pies; sauce is what gives it the base flavor.

I liked it, but will try the other myriad offerings in my quest fur the best pie in the area."}
{"text":"Some if the best pizza anywhere. Fantastic crust, unbelievable ingredients/toppings and some of the best cannoli ever. The pork reigns pizza, for example, is a wonderfully innovative pizza. Piling on the pork, but with each type adding a special flavor, as opposed to just checking the \"tons of pork\" box. Great spot."}
{"text":"Oh my god, Old School is the best pizza I've ever had. I love getting the solo combo with a garden salad. The presentation of the meal is beautiful. The ribbon of carrot on top of the salad is a classy touch but the dressing on the salad is amazing. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is also great. They play old music-like Sinatra- and the lighting is great. There is a big chalkboard wall for kids to draw on and there's seating in front of the kitchen so you can watch them cook. 

My only complaint is the lack of seating--if don't go before the lunch rush, you probably won't have a place to sit. Otherwise, I would've given 5 stars."}
{"text":"All we can say is wow. 

This was our first visit to Old School Pizzeria - from a 1st choice recommendation from Siri. We read through a handful of the Yelp reviews and decided that 4.5 stars by over 500 people was a good sign. 

We went in on a Tuesday night just before 8pm. About half the restaurant was full. We walked up to the counter and told the guy (Jose) that we were first timers. He walked us through the menu which was great since we didn't really know what to expect. 

We ordered garlic knots and a small carnivore pizza. Knots came out first. Piping hot which was great. (Our only suggestion is to ask for marinara for dipping since you get a side of ranch with it.) They were slightly crispy and soft in the middle. 

The pizza came a little bit after. It was a little greasy, but nothing less should be expected with all that meat and cheese. Nothing a napkin couldn't help with. The pizza was nice and hot also.

The toppings, what can I say about the toppings... as a first timer. I was impressed. There were strips of chicken, strips of bacon... and sure enough, the menu says homemade meatballs (that were sliced.) It was amazing. We were thinking cubed chicken with the bacon bits - like what you would get at a dominos/pizza hut setting, but this was NOTHING close to that. 

After the delightful app and entree we had to try the cannoli. Sure enough - it was just like the rest of the food - Spectacular!

And of course, I think Jose should get a lot of the credit too. He staff always makes or breaks the experience as a whole. He was our greeter, cashier, waiter, etc. We only talked to him a little bit each time he came to the table, and each of those times we learned a new piece of info... the conversation really rounded the whole dining experience. 

The only thing I would change is I wish you could have the option to pay at the end instead of upfront. I think we would've tipped more on the back end, then upfront when we ordered (before even trying the food or experiencing the service.)

We will DEFINITELY be coming back."}
{"text":"Just moved to town. Tried a handful of other places before finding this gem!!!!! The search is over. They know how to make pizza. Oh yeah their cannolis are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"It's always tough to find GOOD pizza and I mean really good. Old school knocks it out of the park. It is so fresh. The dough is made daily, the sauce tastes fantastic and the guys working here are so down to earth. Great spot. 10/10 would eat again...and again...and again."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time last week and it is 100% on the money. Best pizza place I've found in Las Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Writing this review based on a sandwich! I haven't even tried the pizza yet. This place is located down the street from my work so I went to check it out. I walked in thinking I was going to get the pizza, but when I looked up at the menu, I saw a sandwich called the Darrin. I don't remember everything on it, but it had applewood smoked chicken, pears, carrots, and some exotic cheeses all on a pizza crust/foccacia style bread. I thought it read delicious so I ordered it. Went over and sat by the window in the sun. Noticed a Tv with remote to my left. Also, there were toys for kids. Let me tell you this sandwich is AMAZING. Probably the most unique sandwich I've had. The bread first of all is delicious, but then you get the sweet taste of the pears balanced with the old time vintage flavors of the cheese. Every bite is a bit different. And to top it off,.. the guy, Darrin was cool as shit. He did tell me that the sandwich is only going to be around for about one more week tho, since he feels it is time to change up the menu. I'm excited to see what masterpiece will replace this badass sammich. Go and get one right now!. Let me know what you think!!!!!! This place is one of the few places that has surprised me since being in Vegas. no idea such good food at this unassuming location."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza! Definitely not your ordinary pizza place. They are very friendly and have fairly good prices. The best part of all they use square credit carder reader which is awesome!

I just wish they delivered on more days!"}
{"text":"Happened along this place and saw the owner who used to cook at another favorite restaurant we love.. the anitpasto salad, and crazy good chicken are our faves. The garlic knots and pizza are out of this world.. we will be back for sure the service was impeccable.."}
{"text":"I found this business through yelp (yay yelp!) and I started looking through their pics and got curious about their grilled Rosemary lemonade. I read some reviews and for interested a this business is about 35-40 mins on freeway from my place but I really wanted to check it out and I am glad I decided to go because it definitely did not disappoint! I got my lemonade and a tea to share, I ordered the small Vegas meets Italy pizza, and the half order of bread knots. 
The tea was good... The lemonade was refreshing and very different, I love rosemary and I wanted to try this... The pizza had really good flavor and had crispy crust, everything on it was delicious! And the garlic Rosemary bread knots were my favorite!!! Definitely  a must try!!! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a taste I haven't tasted anywhere else! 
The place is small and cozy, it's very clean and the decorations are nice, not overdone or distracting but it invites you get lost in the atmosphere of the restaurant. 
We got some cannoli to go. Those were delicious too!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! I was in vegas with my friend and his family and we decided to get pizza. When I was trying to order, the employees kept messing around and paid no attention to us. After a long wait, we finally got our pizza. We started to dig in and my friends wife noticed there was, what appeared to be pubic hair, all over the pizza. I took it up to complain and the employee told me that it is what it is and went in the back and started making jokes about it with the other employees. We left disgusted and completely unsatisfied! I'll never be back there if that's the way they treat their customers!"}
{"text":"I ordered three 24 in. pizzas with everything on it including hot peppers, after picking up the pizzas and a $144 dollars later they completely botched my order! Old school needs to be the new school, this place is OVERRATED and OVERPRICED!"}
{"text":"If this is your first time here, get the Vegas Meets Italy Pizza. I have ordered other things from their menu and they have always been great.  I have had the Crazy Good Chicken, Five Cheese Pizza, Antipasto in a Bread Bowl; Cannoli; Grilled Rosemary Lemonade; Garlic Rosemary Bread Knots. They were all wonderful, but it's hard to try something else when the Vegas Meets Italy Pizza is so unique and so out of this world. And when you're ordering for one, you can only handle one choice unless you are eating pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner for the next week (which I have done). I ordered one for a pot luck that I was going to and the owner squared up the shape and cut it into pieces for me. Everyone raved about it, asking for the address and trying to guess the ingredients. Try Old School Pizzeria and order the Vegas Meets Italy Pizza and it will be the yardstick that you measure all other pizzas by."}
{"text":"Place is small and cozy. Old school jars are used for lemonades and tea. The menu was my favorite. Everything is done exactly as the menu says it \"old school\". Nothing in their menu is fried. 
We started with the Gio salad which was served on top of sourdough bread. Very different and very tasty. We ordered chicken wings. 1 order has two large wings. They are stuffed with sausage. These were delicious. I would definitely order more next time. Last but not least the pizza was to die for. We created our own however they have a selection of specialty pizzas. Definitely worth the price!!"}
{"text":"From the moment you step into Old School Pizzeria you know you're in for a treat. The pizza starts with a 36 hour dough process that lays the foundation for their house made sauce and fresh ingredients. Leave the soda, take the Cannoli & Grilled Rosemary Lemonade- both are incredible. The menu is engaging and has you thinking about your order for the next time you visit-which will be soon!"}
{"text":"Picked it on Whim as we were staying close to LVMS, and needed a great vegetarian option. Didn't know what to expect, but was blown away! Awesome pizza, staff and ambiance!  Don't waste time looking around the area, head right over and taste what pizza should be like!"}
{"text":"Visiting from So. Cal and decided to stop in and have some dinner. First off the staff is very friendly. The place is clean & nicely decorated. The pizza and garlic knots were so yummy. You can definitely tell they use fresh ingredients, the dough was fantastic. Hope to visit again on a future visit."}
{"text":"Holy cow, how did I not get here sooner?

I found myself at The Cannery last week for the Blues, Brews, and BBQ festival.  As a vegetarian, I was enjoying the Blues and Brews, but found myself rather hungry and not having much to do about it.  I'm not one to visit restaurants in the local casinos, and then I remembered many a fellow Yelper recommending Old School Pizzeria which happens to be just across the street.  So off we went for dinner.

It's a tiny place, but nicely decorated.  My husband and I considered just ordering slices until we realized we could get a whole pie for a little more.  We got a 14-inch for $10 and added two toppings for $1 apiece.  They offer many specialty pizzas as well.

With all the glowing Yelp reviews, I had high expectations for this pizza.  My goodness did it meet them.  The crust was perfect- a little crunch on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside.  The sauce was fresh and had a nice flavor.  And the best part?  The just-delivered-super-amazing heirloom tomatoes that topped my pizza.  My only complaint is that I wanted more of those delicious tomatoes on my pie.

We capped off our meal with a homemade cannoli.  Over the years I have found that a cannoli is a tricky thing at a restaurant- they are either really, really good or really, really not good.  So I mentally prepared myself expecting the latter.  Well, guess who was trying to talk her husband into ordering 3 dozen more of these babies?  This girl.

The food was great and the service was even better.  I'm not sure who was taking care of our order, but he was one of the friendliest people I've met.  He alone deserves a five-star rating.

Thanks, Yelpers, for your help!  Looks like I've found yet another place to add to my rotation!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is so good and the dough they use taste so fresh. The pizza size I order is usually a small and it's a great deal, plus I have leftovers for like three days!! The service is also really good here too!"}
{"text":"Pizza was GREAT!  Atmosphere is okay - but, hey, you're in North Las Vegas across from the Cannery in a strip mall.  What do you expect? This is a REALLY small place.  Maybe 20 seats... a couple of tables against the front window and a couple more along the side. Not comfortable seats.

Not really happy with the plastic bag tablecloths that were neither cleaned off or changed between customers. And, not too happy about the silverware sitting on the table in a cleaned out huge tomato can.  What bothered me the most was that when the pizza came out of the oven it was set on the same counter you order from to be brought to your table.  Not necessarily a big deal, you say?  Well it is if someone is standing there about to order.  My husband pushed passed someone on line to get the pizza as she approached to breath all over it and smack her purse down on the counter right next to it.  YUCK. The guy came out of the back yelling he would get it and bring it to the table, but really, guys?  C'mon.  Carry it around through the back.  No one wants everybody waiting to order breathing all over their pizza. (If not for these issues I would have given it 5 stars.)

All that aside, pizza is GREAT!... Not thing stiff, NY style, but delious sauce and cheese.  Fantastic crust. Made fresh to order.

They have take out, but I suggest you go eat it there.  My husband brought it home once and it just wasn't the same"}
{"text":"The entire experience was AMAZING. They didn't even flinch when two carloads of us stopped. All 8 of us on our way to Cali. The Calabrese pizza, the garlic knots, the entire meal was good. The kids played with clean toys and drew with chalk. It was awesomely delicious and VERY refreshing in friendliness and convenience for Vegas. I'm seriously telling all my friends about Old School Pizzaria!"}
{"text":"I walked in considering dessert. When I walked in I was told they only had one dessert, which is the Cannoli. I am def one not too open to trying new things so I was considering leaving. The young gentlemen offered to pay for my first Cannoli and insisted I dined in to let him know if I liked it. Sure enough I loved it and ordered three more and Mac and Cheese. ZEB is his name. Shout out to him."}
{"text":"Normally I don't trust 5 star reviews, but I feel like this place is one of the few that actually deserves it. We purchased the large garden salad (lettuce, tomato, and dressing on top of a bread bowl), a half an order of garlic knots, and a build your own pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and roasted garlic. All very delicious, generous portions and freshly made. They also gave us a lot of ranch dressing that tasted fresh. The staff was attentive to our requests. The owner seemed a little stern and gruff with the employees, trying to keep them on their toes to provide the best product and service. I think they're doing a fine job aleady, so please ease up a bit on them!
Next time we're in Vegas, this will be definitely be on our family's must go to list."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Josh and Jim ROCK!! I entered their restaurant longing for pizza at 9:10. (They closed at 9.) They still had customers so Josh said..if you can wait 15 minutes, we will have a pizza for you. YAY!! I had just seen their article about their pizza from the LV Weekly and was craving to try it. Thank you Josh!!!! I got the \"Pork Reigns\" YUMMY....get it...consumed it..and made my stomach the happiest it has been in a LONG time!!!! The pepperoni is thinly sliced and had homemade sausage. I'm glad I got a menu!! I'm  trying every one of their pizzas!!! Yummy guys!!!! Above and beyond customer service. They thanked every customer as they were leaving. I thank you for great service and great pizza. I can't wait to try your wings:-)"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now and not once have a been disappointed!  The veggie pizza-Wow! Their home made dough- moist and yummy. The cheese- its cheesetastic!  And their olives.. watch out now- they're not your regular black olives. Zucchini,  cloves of garlic,  yellow tomatos.. made my veggie pizza out of this world. Also too i want to personally thank the chef and his staff for the complimentary ranch (also VERY YUMMY) dressing not only do i get one but i get two sides of ranch. Some pizza places dont even sell ranch. That's craziness but the only thing crazy about this place is how spicy the Italian sausage is."}
{"text":"This place is great and I highly recommend it.

I have tried all the salads and approve of all, except the one with fennel is a little strong.

Do yourself a favor and try the stuffed chicken wing. The mac and cheese is amazing; and will give you heart desease.

My only complaint is that they sometimes cook the pizza too long (monster slices). I prefer a softer rather than a crunchy crust.

They also recently installed a new soda/cola/pop machine and it has soda with lemon by Dasani. I recommend that to go with your pizza."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for work and yelped places near work;  Old School came up. I am really glad it did. 

If you like beautifully made, delicious, Italian food and pizza. Get in your car, boat or fly here; try the food at Old School....You will not regret it!

I had the Grilled Rosemary Lemonade and now I'm ruined. I will only drink lemonade like this for the rest of my life. The taste of the char on the slices of lemon add a dimension to the lemonade I can not describe, other than YOU have to try it. And rosemary in lemonade....Yes it works...I will now spend the rest of the weekend trying to duplicate that lemonade....As the guy behind the counter was describing how they make it I impulsively reached into my wallet and dropped a $20 into their tip jar. 

The Lentil soup was delicious, small dice(s) of ham, lots of lentils and other veggies, a great texture; seasoned perfectly. I licked the bowl clean and used those incredible roasted garlic/rosemary bread knots to make the bowl clean enough to use again. I've made lentil soup, and this is great lentil soup.

As I was plowing through that wonderful pizza with pepperoni, grilled onions, grilled italian peppers I commented on the great tasting pizza crust. Just then I noticed on the wall a sign that states they use only wild yeasts and long fermentation for their pizza dough..Right then I knew this was no ordinary pizza place....Doing that takes much too much time; so this owner must really love the details of making excellent quality food.

And it shows in the flavor of everything I ate here."}
{"text":"I'm baffled by the great reviews for this place. We ordered a half and half pizza with veggies on one side and meat on the other - beware, the meatballs taste more like gyro meat than meatballs.  The crust was chewy and soggy and had a weird sour taste to it.  The pizza had zero \"pizza\" flavor in general, and even adding my own spices and garlic didn't help. I am giving two stars specifically for the fact that the large pizza was huge, but we ended up throwing most of it away because it was just not worth saving. Next."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  The owner is from Italy and he has created a fantastic little pizzeria with outstanding pizza and salad.  We always go here when getting our oil changed at the car repair store next door.  His food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"My first order was carry out and had a not so good experience so the owner invited us back to try them again so here we are.
The dining room is small but very old school so it's great. The light fixtures give great light and the music sets the mood. Large plastic wall lets you see the pizza being made...my kids loved that. 

Bought a jar of rosemary lemonade and it was pleasant to the taste. Not powerfully sweet like regular but good tasting.  

The pizza arrived pipping hot and the plates were hot too so it stayed hot longer. The 24 inch pizza will fill your belly quickly. This time around it was a lot better....no paper  This time around we were impressed with the explosions of taste while devouring the slices.

Then to our surprise the five cheese baked mac came over. Sublime is the only word that comes to mind. You must, nay, have to order this dish. We were all full from the pizza but the mac made us eat it. Talk about good torture, this is the only way to die.

Great joint to sit and enjoy good food. This is a must visit if you want to be amazed. Thank you for the wonderful tastebud vacation to chesseville."}
{"text":"5+ stars!!
I'm always up for trying new places to eat, but after trying Old School Pizzeria last September, I'll avoid going anywhere else for pizza.  They have the most amazing garlic knots, with some kind of magical sauce that makes two people order more than they would normally eat.
And their pizza...lets just say \"addicting\" is an understatement.  It doesn't really matter what time of the week or day you go, they are usually always busy...but the wait isn't usually too bad...it just means lots of people know about this gem.  Best pizza in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This pizza was great!!! We got the huge OMG pizza and some garlic knots with homemade garlic cream sauce that was amazing. The owner was awesome and delivered to us with no problems at the exact time we needed for a huge party. 
The only negative is that it is not close to my house."}
{"text":"Don't judge this place by the way it looks on the outside. Once you pass through their front doors, you'll quickly notice that you're in a quality establishment.  These guys are serious about running a restaurant. The Decor is traditional and modern at the same time, the staff is helpful, and the pizza might be the best in Vegas - and I've had most. The dough is perfect.  Slightly crispy and full of layered flavors, this pizza is the dominatrix of my submissive palate.  I want more!!  And I'll chew through that rubber ball to get it.

Too bad I live up in hendo."}
{"text":"The pork sandwich on old world bread was simple and tasty. The pizza was done very well. 
As an executive chef for Hilton I most definitely go back"}
{"text":"It's something you eat w a lot of beer & friends watching a game @ home-
not a destination for pizza fans of Neapolitan style.

They are using a gas oven ;the crust should be chewy Inside & crisp/thin outside
Using coal or wood.

The peperoni was not high quality nor artisanal. Straight up a greasy mess-"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with fresh ingredients.  Thin crispy crust. We had the classic combo - pepperoni, homemade sausage, and various veggies. Good ratio of meat to veggies. While the pizza was really, really good, the cannoli was better. Best cannoli I've had in the US. It's a pretty small place, maybe 7 tables but you can eat there or take out.  The staff was really nice and the place was clean. Definitely low key with plastic table clothes. Maybe not a date place but an excellent pizza joint."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza joint in Vegas! Fantastic fresh toppings, the best dough I've  had in memory and delicious cannoli. For lunch I had a monster slice of the veggie with Gio's salad. The roasted veggies were perfect! I am already planning my next order...the hard core old school!"}
{"text":"Pizza was authentic with the best ingredients. They are not kidding when the say the large is big enough for four people."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time here and we will definitely be back.  The calabrese pizza was fantastic as well as the large salad served inside of their artisan bread. Pride in their service as well!"}
{"text":"The Best pizza and Salad in Town!!! The OMG is good enough to feed the whole Family!"}
{"text":"My husband I were feeling particularly lazy this Friday afternoon, so we decided to order some pizza.  After reading the reviews for OSP, it seemed the logical choice for us.  Good job us...thanks Yelpers...great decision.
We ordered the Pork Rules pizza, the Five Cheese pizza and garlic knots.  I'm not a huge overload of meat pizza kinda girl, but the Pork Rules was delish!  From whole strips of bacon (my husband is an enormous bacon enthusiast) to the pork all the meats were tasty and plentiful.  
The Five Cheese pizza, more my speed usually, was STELLAR!  I couldn't eat enough.  I wish I had a bigger stomach and my husband agreed (about both pizzas actually).  We spread the ricotta out over the slices and devoured them.  The sauce was light and flavorful and the crust was OUT OF THIS WORLD.
As other Yelpers have mentioned the garlic knots were fabulous as well.  However, after noshing on the pizza, I could barely get one down.
The delivery time was quite good and the food was still piping hot when it arrived.
My four-year-old proclaimed \"Mom, you made a GREAT decision for dinner!\"
OSP absolutely will be our new pizza destination!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go here one night when we were craving carbs, and we are thrilled a pizza place of this caliber is right in our neighborhood!  I want to try more things in the menu, but I CRAVE the Vegas Meets Italy and can't bring myself to order anything else. Great atmosphere. I feel like it's my kitchen and my family. On each of our visits, the owner has brought out something tasty for us to simply try. The customer service combined with the food make this perfect. I don't understand how this isn't consistently voted the best pizza place in town. Spread the word!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. I wish there were more stars. We go every time we visit Vegas and try not to eat any pizza at home because it's not Old School. No exaggeration. Everything we've tried has been unforgettable. The staff and ambiance transport you to another place in time. Bravo to the creators of this delightful dive."}
{"text":"Few days ago I stopped for lunch and I am glad I did. Pizza was awesome...I am glad that did not order two slices as I've seen the size before ordering...They are huge and that is not an exaggeration. Will be back to try the rest on your menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on our way home on a road trip based on the reviews. The ice tea is a mason jar was very good. It lasted the rest of our trip to San Diego. The pizza slices are HUGE - and it was $5 and the size of a small pizza actually. I wasn't a big fan of the crust. It had a sourdough flavor to it and the sauce was just okay. But I definitely recommend if you are hungry and in a hurry for a slice."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Vegas, I love the Vegas meets Italy- it's the best combo of toppings I've ever tried. Our kids love the cheese pizza. The omg size is perfect for parties. The veggie is a large step above other pizza places, really flavorful adventure! They also give you complimentary house ranch doing sauce- which is the best I've ever had & perfectly compliments the sourdough crust. We've also tried the chicken, pastas, garlic balls, and salads all of which were excellent. You can't go wrong, try it out!"}
{"text":"HERS: OMG. Okay this place is amazing!!! We came for lunch/dinner after I got out of work. I have been eyeing this place for at least a year and a half and have never came. BIG MISTAKE! The outdoor aesthetics aren't appealing but the inside is cute. When you walk in to the left there is a wall with chalkboard paint that you get to write all over and around the restaurant there are riddles written in chalk. The light fixtures are cute and give this place the homey feel is deserves. Okay on to food, we ordered the garden salad and small pizza. I don't recall what the name of the pizza was but it had prosciutto, cherry tomatoes, arugula, date cream sauce, and ricotta cheese. This pizza was definitely one of the BEST pizzas I've had in Las Vegas. The crust was crunchy but soft and not dense. The flavors played off of each other so well and you could taste all of the toppings in every bite! I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried the Vegas meets Italy pizza tonight. Wow what a combination of flavors! The slightly bitter taste of the cheese broken up by the smooth sweetness of those China Ranch dates made this the most wonderfully complex pizza I've ever tasted. An instant favorite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch and absolutely fell in love with the pizza. I now come here to order our pies. The cannoli's are to die for as well."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I would take this over the \"Big three\" any day. Fresh ingredients and I love the sausage! Missing that last star for location and ease of use, they only take cash and they are located in a auto repair shop. BUT, they do deliver in the local area. YUM! Also, there is a corner with toys for kids while you wait for your pizza."}
{"text":"Lots of Great Options - From Calzones to Pizza to Salads. Very high quality Pizza - a true gem! Now if your are looking for one of those Bargain Places where the Oil is oozing out of the Low Quality Cheese, Or Tomato Paste out of a Can instead of Freshly made, or No Dipping Sauce for their incredible Crust or Garlic knots - then this is Not for you Bargain Hunters. Just expect high quality food at a competitive price - this is unique for North Las Vegas where Dollar Burger Wonders Rule !"}
{"text":"Did not have a crowd to feed today, just myself so I decided to order a meatball calzone.  Crust was delicious, loaded with lots of cheese. Only complaint is the meatballs were slightly cold and only in the center otherwise it was outstanding. Also ordered 3 cannolis, they were fresh and awesome. Once again, highly recommend."}
{"text":"The solo meals are ridiculous! So much food! And it's good! They have a chalk drawing of the slice of pizza and it's actually that big. Maybe bigger. $8 for two meals. Definitely get the garlic knots. They don't mess around with their bread. If the pizza weren't so good, I'd come here just for the garlic knots."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I have ever had. The dough is amazing. You can tell that it is fresh, the fact that you can watch them make your pie doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place and I especially love how they make the pizza right in front of you. All of their ingredients are fresh and you really can't go wrong with any of their choices. 

The owner is very passionate about his pizza and he thrives for customer satisfaction. This makes me very happy and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"On our long drive from Phoenix to Provo, we looked up restaurants as we were driving through vegas and wanted to stop somewhere and grab some lunch.  We looked on our phones and found Old School in north vegas.  not sure what we were getting ourselves into we decided to stop in and have a bite.  We got the vegas meets Italy pizza and we were absolutely impressed.  The blend of cheeses, tomatoes and date sauce was a great change of pace.  We liked it so much we will surely stop by on our way home."}
{"text":"I had the handmade sausage pizza slice with the bread knots and a cannoli. It was absolutely amazing! The sausage was definitely fresh and the can plus were amazing. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this restaurant. I live near here and normally go to Manhattans but I heard good things so I thought I'd try it out. I walked in at 12:05 (five minutes after they opened and twenty five minutes ago) and they asked us to have a seat because they were short staffed. We smiled and understood, no problem. It happens. After 25 minutes they still hadn't even taken out order and four people walked in and they helped all four people before us. Terrible experience and I don't think that I'd go back. I was just sad when I left because I was really excited. Overall I thought it looked and smelled great but it just made me and my partner feed like crap that they waited on four men and made us wait until after all those people before even acknowledging our existence. Just sad."}
{"text":"Great pizza and garlic knots, awesome service.  I wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"Exactly what I have always wanted in a pizza.  Fresh local ingredients, great service, unique options."}
{"text":"What a great spot to grab a pizza! We made the trip from the southwest just to try it. So worth it! The grilled rosemary lemonade is awesome, just try it. Don't think about it, just get some. Thanks. 

As for the pizza, I've lived in Vegas my whole life. There aren't any good pizza places anymore. However, I will be making many more trips, until I've had it all! Nice to have a place to crave when  I want pizza in this town."}
{"text":"Decided to try this spot since my favorite pizzeria is closed today, and it had great reviews. Service was quick and I was greeted when I walked in, but this pizza just didn't do it for me. My sweetie loved his garden salad, said it was the best he ever had."}
{"text":"I visited Old School for the first time for lunch . Had a slice of pizza and the lentil soup.  The pizza is made from sourdough bread and it was obvious the ingredients were of high quality.  The owner waited on me and was very pleasant.  Place is clean and the employees hustle to get the food out.  I thought the price of the menu items  was high, but I will return to try the salads which looked really good and the garlic knots.  Lots of testosterone in the restaurant as it is patronized by Nellis Air Force Base employees and construction workers and run by men--
 I enjoyed the view!!"}
{"text":"2nd road trip, 4th visit.  Don't ask anyone here about pizza, they love their food so much, that you'll end up in a 45 minute discussion about the intricacies of dough and varieties of flour.  But, actually, if you love food as much as they do, it will be a well spent 45 minutes. The Chef gave me pointers on sour dough starters and my own homemade bread and pizzas are thankful.  Awesome place.  Will be back whenever we are in the area.  Try the homemade lemonade.  Best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have gotten take out and ate there several times. The stuffed chicken thighs are AMAZING. The fennel salad is AWSOME. The pizza is HUGE and a crowd pleaser especially with that creamy dipping sauce and the sourdough crust. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. The staff are always so kind and make you feel like a true valued patron of there establishment."}
{"text":"I got the smaller family deal. Food was great and inexpensive for the amount of food we got. Good place to bring your kids. They have a wall for them to write on with chalk and the guy working there let my little girl try some of their gellato."}
{"text":"Can you say AMAZING??!!!  I actually found this place by accident.  The outside didn't look like much, but I'm glad I didn't judge a book by its' cover.  Boy was I surprised!  I had the Slice and Salad Solo Meal with a mason glass of Grilled Rosemary Lemonade, and a Cannoli for dessert!  Everything was delicious, fresh, and \"Oh, so goooood!  I will definitely be going back...like tomorrow. 

The sign in the shop reads that they make their dough the old fashioned way, which is a 36-hour process.  I'm not sure what that means, but the pizza crust was some of the best I've ever eaten, and I grew up in the Pizza Mecca of Upstate NY.  The salad was their house salad with their homemade creamy garlic dressing.  My mouth is watering just writing about this meal. 

I had never heard of Grilled Rosemary Lemonade, but it was love at first sip.  I was really stuffed, but just had to try dessert.  I have no words for that Cannoli.  It literally melted in my mouth.  It was a bit embarrassing to hear the sounds I was making as I savored every bite. LOL. 

Last, but certainly not least, the service was great.  I was acknowledged as soon as I walked in, even though the cashier was finishing up with another customer.  While I viewed the menu, the cashier was patient and answered all my questions.  The plating for my pizza and salad, and dessert was much nicer than I've ever experienced at a pizza shop. I even got to keep my quart sized mason jar from the lemonade.  

I'd say that the only slight negative is that the shop is on the smaller size and I felt like I was really close to the table next to me.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying some more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review from the one I wrote last year because Old School has the best pizza in Vegas. I've tried several different pizza places who \"specialize\" in pizza making and they have all fallen short, no other restaurant has even come close. I absolutely love the upgrades that they've made to the resturant. One of the best things about this resturant is that you can taste and smell the freshness in their ingredients. I've even eaten this pizza cold from my fridge, still good! Great food, Great service this resturant deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Chicago style pizza so wasn't sure if I'd like this because it looks like NY style, but I couldn't be further from the truth.  They cook everything in house and is so amazing it deserves it's own category.  Their service is just as good and their homemade ranch is unbeatable."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great pizza off the beaten path, this is your spot.  They start with a great sourdough crust and elevate with bomb tangy tomatoes and have every combination available including homemade sausage and smoked BBQ.  What, BBQ at a legit Italian pizza spot?  YES!!!   Don't worry, the classics aren't missed with the Margarita and others."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and it's great!! Homemade meatballs. Perfect crust!  Finally!!  We also had a stuffed chicken wing appetizer. Crazy! Excellent job with texting communication. They make their own lemonade and iced tea and serve in mason jars. If you bring the jar back you get a discount on the refill."}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza is seriously bombin good. But the garlic knots and sauce, best I've ever had. I could probably just go for a Large order of those and call it good. Super nice owner/chef that cares about your experience at Old School Pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent! That one word goes for everything..... well everything except the soda. WHY DO 90% OF RESTAURANTS HAVE COKE PRODUCTS? But I digress.

The pizza was excellent. Even the olives that were only supposed to be on half the pizza were excellent. Not the black sliced outovacan olives, but small whole wonderfully briny olives..... me thinks calamata! The pepperoni was excellent. The sausage was excellent. I had my doubts at first. I do love chunks of sausage on my pizza and the sausage on this pizza was large flat ribbons............. BUT EXCELLENT! Excellent crust. The rosemary garlic knots were........ you guessed it...... EXCELLENT! The best knots hands down we have ever had. The antipasto salad........... wait for it.......... EXCELLENT!

Other than the soda, the only real issue I have with Old School is that it is soooo far away from my home. But no doubt, moving forward, when the night, or the day for that matter, calls for the best pizza in Vegas, it's over the river and through the woods to Old School Pizza we go.

One last thing, the owner needs to keep his son away from the Magic Mike video. Although we do enjoy dinner and show from time to time, that was one show we didn't expect. That said, the owner as well as his son have something to be proud of."}
{"text":"Really disappointed!  We have been here before and the food was great.  Unfortunately, we did not have the same experience this time.   We ordered a pizza, two calzones, and three canolis.  The cook dropped one of the calzones so we had to wait for him to cook another.  I totally understand that mistakes happen, but they did nothing to rectify the error.  We were starving and bad to wait another 20 minutes for a new calzone.   In the meantime...... Our other calzone and pizza sat.  So - by the time we got home the pizza was burnt, presumably from sitting on the top of the pizza oven and the calzone was soggy and cold.  BAD!  Additionally, the canoli cream was watery and ran out of the shell.  The guy told us it was because it was just made but I have made canolis and the cream shouldn't need to set -  not sure why that was?   Overall, just disappointed.  For $50 worth of pizza, it was not good."}
{"text":"This is a little gem. I came here for the first time with my family and the pizza is amazing. Whenever I think about you pizza I think of this place. Best pizza I have ever had I promise!"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best pizza in Las Vegas. We ordered a large cheese with mushroom and of course another to go. Every time we are in town we make sure to visit old school pizzeria. Josh, the owner/manager/chef runs makes sure everyone is happy and well fed! Thank You Josh!"}
{"text":"Never thought about even wanting to try this place after seeing the location and having had many other business fail in that location. After reading the amazing reviews my husband and I decided to give it a try. I really wanted to like it but it was just OK...It's super small and the decorating could have been better....We did not order pizza tho, we opted for the GIO salad which wasn't mixed greens like I was expecting...and we ordered a calzone which was just OK..the sausage in it I had to pick out cause it tasted funny to me. The plus about this place was the very nice guy that worked there...didn't ask his name, but he was helpful and nice and even gave us free fresh garlic knots while we were waiting for our food! l Also you must try the peanut butter gelato, it's BOMB! We might be back to try the pizza...one day."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing staff they are so helpful. If you stop by you have to Ty the rosemary lemonade."}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious pizza I've had in Vegas. It's a little more pricey but well with the price. Way better than any fast food chain. Everything that I've tried has been amazing, and I continue to go whenever I want a good slice."}
{"text":"Found this gem on our drive home to Utah. Great service and delicious food! We had the Garlic knots, baked Mac and cheese, monster pizza slices and side salad. The kids loved the pizza which the slices were really monster!- and probably best Mac and cheese I've ever had.. garlic knots are sour dough with a garlic sauce and wow- so good. Oh and the rosemary lemonade was super yummy. For sure coming back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! when they don't burn your Pizza
Owner can't take constructive criticism to help his store out as I eat there all the time.. Getto employees that don't belong at pizza hut...New lady working there steels tips and doesn't put it in the tip jar to share...Black kid works at night speaks in hoo-bon-ics and curses.....Salad is good and pizza the best in Vegas... There cheap with the special sauce give you 2 for a 25 buck pizza that has amazing ingredients. The 2 sauces cover 1 slice ask for more... Go at lunch time better service with exception to the owners slouchie not happy frowny ass look on his face ... laugh when they call there 8 dollar an hour helpers chef's hahaha...
Anyways food is good don't rest your back on the chalk board wall as it ruined my black Blouse ....

Good Pizza 
Poor Staff
Owner Un pleasant 
Forgot one  little Mexican boy at night constantly eating out of the salad bar!!!

There best employee is the short guy at night older Grey hair ultra nice 

Thanks"}
{"text":"Old School Pizzeria is a treat and a fun place to take our out of town company. Tonight we celebrated for a birthday. Service is above and beyond"}
{"text":"So good---so full...Had Garlic knots,  salad and a monster slice.  Can't wait to try the new place in the SW!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing and nothing less! The customer service is great, the food is wonderful, and the price ain't too bad either.  :) I wish I could give old school pizzeria 6 stars or just an unlimited number of stars! Every time I've ever been here I've been treated like family.  If you want an overall fantastic dining experience, get to Old School Pizzeria!!"}
{"text":"Still killing it after all these years! The latest pleasure for me if the lemonade sooo amazing especially with great pizza on a hot Las Vegas summer day. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"A few times a month I go to North Las Vegas for work. Food options nearby are pretty limited since I don't care for fast food. Once you start heading west of I-15 on Craig options greatly improve. Yelp led me to Old School Pizzeria. 

It's across from The Cannery. It's a quaint space that sits no more than 30. The have a slew of toppings and very large slices. I find one to be plenty for lunch. I've tried the pepperoni and a combination of veggies. I like the pepperoni a bit better than my choice of veggie slice with mushrooms, onions and tomatoes. Slices come with a side of garlic dipping sauce. A slice and drink is about eight bucks.

The crust is crisp and the crust to sauce and cheese ratio is pretty balanced. It's a good slice of pie. They also dish up salads, pastas and a few daily specials. They are pretty famous for their garlic knots, but I'm yet to try them."}
{"text":"Big variety of choices good pizza & beer. Ate here about a month ago.  Had a group of 9 & easily accommodated us. Pretzel & dip was great"}
{"text":"love this little gem. We have tried several different dishes.  Vegas  meets Italy  is amazing . Busy place but the wait is worth  it. The staff is friendly and inviting. I have never been disappointed by any of the dishes and always  looking forward to the next visit. Give them a try I guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tired of ordinary store front pizza or questionable pizza from the national chains Old School Pizza is the perfect place to jump off from the bandwagon.  The slice of Anchovies spinach olives and egg was delicious.  Great service and atmosphere.   The cannoli was perfect.  Right across from the Cannery.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that since eating at Old School Pizzeria, this is why I cannot bring myself to give many other pizza joints a 5 star rating. This is the pizza by which all others are compared. (in L.V. at least)

Pizza crust is light and crispy, sauce is delicious, ingredients are fresh... I haven't found a single thing that they could improve upon. Oh, and the garlic knots... the best I have tasted.

I hear the other food is good as well but I just can't get past the pizza to give anything else a try.

My only complaint - They are closed on Sunday and yes, today is Sunday damn it!"}
{"text":"The Vegas meets Italy pizza is one of the best tasting pizzas in the neighborhood. Also the guys there really care about the food they sell and will gladly elaborate on any questions you might have. Go, eat, and be merry."}
{"text":"This little gem is \"Old School\" with flavors guaranteed to induce old fashioned food-gasms. 
  The Garlic Knots, served with fresh Rosemary and roasted cloves of Garlic, are a personal favorite.  I highly recommend a combination of Garlic Knots and Gio's House Salad to wake your tastebuds and provide multiple mouthfuls of happiness. This salad is a combination of fresh Cucumber, Fennel, Caramelized White Onion, Cherry Tomatoes, Basil, and chunks of freshly made Mozzarella, tossed in a light, delicious, House Vinaigrette Dressing. Incredible! 
  The pizzas are covered with a variety of fresh ingredients, full of mouthwatering flavor, sitting upon a delicious House-made Tomato Sauce. The Classic Combo is a personal favorite, but you must try several pies for yourself before deciding upon your personal favorite. I will guarantee this, the freshly made, hand-tossed dough creates a wonderful crust. It is thin and crispy, but just thick enough to offer a soft bite of delectable deliciousness.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"The salmon I ordered was good with the fried spinach that it sat on. The salmon had an orange sauce, which was a bit too sweet for me, but it wasn't a big deal.. I wasn't expecting it, but the salmon came with a small bowel of plain spaghetti. I liked the buttery garlic bread they served before your meal. The service wasn't bad although I felt a bit rushed by the waitress on occasion. What I didn't like was the fact that they didn't offer my favorites, such as gnocchi and risotto (she did say later that they had gnocchi, but it wasn't on the menu). There were other things that I like that I didn't see, such as garlic prawns."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place while I was on my way to school and I was starving. Oh my god. This is some of the freshest, classic pizza I've ever had. Got two monster slices with pepperoni. I only finished one because they were so damn big (good thing). The sauce is incredible. So fresh and tomato-y. You can really tell that the chef takes pride in serving healthy, but incredibly tasty food. The pizza came with this white garlic sauce. At first I thought it was ranch, but the nice gentleman told me it wasn't as we were having a great conversation. What an amazing supplement to the pizza sauce, they complement each other perfectly. Great pizza, great people, would come again."}
{"text":"The slice that changed my life. Wasn't in the mood for pizza, but everything else was closed. Huge slice with half a salad was $8.50...a lot of food. Antipasto salad was perfectly dressed, super fresh with multi colored cherri tomatoes, arugula, and meats. The crust is a thick, almost sour dough; crunchy on the outside, soft inside, and really flavorful. Tangy crushed tomato sauce paired perfect. I added a few toppings for $0.40 each and all were really high quality (caramelized onions, roasted eggplant, house sausage). The house pies also look incredible-I saw truffle cured egg yolks as a topping on the old school...what?! This is artisan food on a layman's budget. Also, for ranch lovers, you will like the house to be sure"}
{"text":"Ate there last night and it was great! Monster slice and salad was plenty to fill me up. The roasted garlic was awesome!"}
{"text":"The pizza crust was crunchy and tasty although the margarita pizza was somewhat soggy. Sauce was really good. The Gio salad was yummy. The Crazy Good Chicken was excellent with the potato's. Very small place located in a small strip mall next to a barber. The staff was split, the girl very friendly and helpful, the small guy not so much. He seemed irritated that we had come shortly after they opened. Overall good pizza and chicken and would recommend."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere when in North Las Vegas must come try the handcrafted and special brewed lemonade and iced tea.    Food is fresh and fast."}
{"text":"I walked in last Wednesday with some co-workers, expecting to get my usual slice and a cannolo (Gio recently taught me the singular form of cannoli... lunch and a lesson, haha!).  Much to my surprise, they had a special treat that day that they don't make often:  porchetta, or Italian pork roast, with an au jus type sauce.  Offered in the form of a sandwich on their signature sourdough, my mind was changed instantly.  Why not try something I'd never had before, especially when it smelled so heavenly?

And what a good decision it was!  Juicy with a crispy outer layer and full of flavor from the herb mixture it was stuffed with, it had a bit of the \"au jus\" poured over it that soaked into the bread.  All the flavors mixed together into one of the most delicious dishes I've had in a very long time.  I rarely eat my entire meal, but this was one I couldn't stand to let go to waste.

The moral of the story:  If you ever happen to stop in on a porchetta day, forget about pizza and eat the pork.  :)"}
{"text":"Recently ordered, & picked for local customer factory crews. Crust is a flatbread type; not thick crust, but certainly not a thin crust. The OMG is 24\"; huge! I heard it was very good. Small business with just a few workers, so may need some patience."}
{"text":"I love pizza, garlic knots, and friendly people. Old school pizza has all 3. Chef Gio is as friendly as they come. Our waitress forgot out garlic knots and so Gio made another batch. She brought them to the wrong table and he quickly pulled her a aside and professionally corrected her with out causing a scene. Good price. Also it's a pizza place where you can personally get to know the employees. They're more than willing to chat if you're there by yourself or will ask how everybody is doing if you're there with your family. Only complaint is its a little small. If it were bigger he'd have more people in there at once. WAY TO GO OSP!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not messing around. Had every variety of food this place offers and it's all amazing. Welcome to food heaven. Hope y'all enjoy!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is enough to come back for. I have dreams about their sourdough crust and the garlic sauce. You have to try the grilled rosemary lemonade. This is hands down, my favorite pizza place"}
{"text":"Wow...I was really impressed.  I just started working in the area and wanted pizza for lunch.  Of course I turned to Yelp, and I will be coming back...often.  

I just had a Monster Slice and a soda, only a little over $5 for both, great value. ..but I will be back to try the other options like their \"crazy good chicken.\"  It looked and smelled fantastic and apparently it is cooked sous-vide, and then roasted...nice! 

They make their own dough and sauce, and the choices on your topping are above and beyond your typical pizza joints.  They have all the usual toppings, but many other great options such as Pulled Pork, House made Sausage, artisan made salame Calabrese, Canadian Bacon, apple-wood smoked Bacon, guanciale, etc.

Make the trip here if you can, I think you'll find it as good as I."}
{"text":"We've driven past this place for a long time, and had a recommendation from friends as well. Yesterday I discovered all the Yelp reviews so we had to try. We were not disappointed. We submitted an order online and picked it up to bring home.

We got the Slice and Knots, Slice and Stuffed Chicken Wing, and half order of Knots. 

It was all delicious and I believe it was around $20. After this place I can't imagine eating at those other pizza chains again. I've never had an actual \"pie\" before, but this place is better than I've ever tasted. Everything was so fresh and the flavor was amazing. BTW, one slice of pizza is big enough that I would consider it 2 regular slices. MORE than enough for one person."}
{"text":"Moved about 3 years ago from NJ to N. Las Vegas, tried many places and this is by far the best pizza out here, the pizza dough is great, service is quick and this is our go to place when ever we want pizza.

Just a note to owner, since I figure he may read these from time to time, make sure all of your male employees wear a belt, because the last thing I want to see is someone's rear end when I am eating"}
{"text":"Old School Pizzeria where have you been all my life!!! I almost lost my love of pizza! 
I started with the Gio salad featuring fennel and cucumbers. The presentation was classic and elegant not to mention delicious.  
Let me say that the pizza here is absolutely inspiring. We ordered a small pizza with sausage, red bell peppers and mushrooms. I can safely say that it was the best pizza I have ever had. The house made sausage and cheese were indescribable and the mushrooms were a blend of shiitake, oyster, and more sautéed in garlic and cracked pepper, all on a sourdough crust! Yummy!!
Then they go and top all the impeccable Italian cuisine with a true, old pizzeria ambiance complete with old, old school music. 
Simply delightful!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza spot love the atmosphere  here. Feels like I'm in a old Italian cafe felt comfortable  like home."}
{"text":"Delicious baked ziti. Would love to live closer to here to be able to treat myself to it more often."}
{"text":"Over rated. The pizza was not bad but it was expensive and there was very little meat on the pizza. For the price I was expecting more. The tea was good and so was the Ranch/Garlic sauce but I'm not sure if I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Two visits, two home runs. I tried the \"crazy good\" chicken on the first trip and found it moist and holding a lot of good flavor. I actually found the roasted potatoes and garlic that came with the chicken to be even a little better than the chicken itself. My next visit included two of the monster slices, one with meatballs. The ingredients all are high quality, from the cheese to the sauce to the dough. The meatballs clearly are made in-house as well. The crust is thin like New York pizza, but has a little more crunch. The service is friendly and helpful, and it's pretty hard not to like the place. I only wish I lived a little closer."}
{"text":"Super bomb huge pizza slices. Authentic Italian history lessons accompany each meal. Very good times."}
{"text":"I grew up in Jersey and after moving our here and trying all the recommended pie shops i was always disapointed. Then by chance i stimbled into old school. I thoight it would be another dud but i was wromg as could ve.  My hats off to this pizzeria staying true to our Italian heritage.  This pizzeria is the best in las vegas by far and puts demarcos to complete and utter shame and is tied for 1st for any pie i have had in a good shop in Jersey or New York.  Thank you sir and staff. Gratsi"}
{"text":"There are plenty of good pizza places in Las Vegas, and depending on what type of pizza you like, you can probably find it here. But this small restaurant in North Las Vegas is one of the best in the Valley, especially if you like New York-sized artisan pies that you can order whole or by the slice.

I went to lunch with three co-workers, and we each had a \"monster slice\" -- and they're not kidding with the name. These pieces were HUGE! I can't imagine what a \"double slice\" would be! I had The Veggie, which was a melange of fresh vegetables (including one of my favorites, roasted garlic). My boss had a traditional sausage and pepperoni, and my other co-workers each had the College Favorite (ham and pineapple) and the Calabrese (salami, peppers, and olives). 

These were all pretty tasty, and I didn't even go near the two menu items that piqued my interest the most: the Vegas Meets Italy (dates, pistachios, prosciutto, and triple-cream gorgonzola) and the Pork Reigns (name a pork product, and it's probably on there). But my husband is pork's biggest fan, so I thought I'd save that latter order for him next time we see a movie across the street at the Galaxy Theater. (LOVE that place!)

Our lunch quartet also shared some garlic rosemary bread knots (delicious) and cannoli (even better). Service was quick and pleasant, although I felt like a heel because I didn't leave a tip. (I didn't notice a tip jar on the counter, although my boss later said he saw it and tipped. Now THAT'S a first for Vegas -- an inconspicuous tip jar!)

As I said earlier, this place is small, so you might have to wait for a table. But it is definitely worth the wait. And next time I'll definitely tip!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Still looking for the perfect pizza. The sauce needs more flavor. It was better then most.The people are fantastic with customer service."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in las vegas period and the crew has the best personalty they really make the place. I had lost all hope for conolli but when i tryed it omg it was good the stuffed chicken wings are awesome everything is just great. already been there a couple of time. Best cheat day food ever. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Great quality! Foodies dream!! We get different stuff each time and never disappointed! Still love this place and the awesome vibe!"}
{"text":"Wow, thank god we missed our movie, because instead we found this place!
You will notice this place from the road from the nonconformast lighting and font used for their signage.
Once inside, you are greeted by the fresh herbs and chalkboards announcing the pizzas and other amazing treats.
We ordered the Vegas beats Italy pizza  as well as a plain slice for our 4 yearold.  A salad came along as well and It should not be missed.  Their pizza comes as slices and huge Pies! 
Our pizzas were devoured and even the 4 year old said it was the best pizza ever!
Fresh Pizza with fresh ingredients! Non commercial yeast. 
Amazing Cannoli made fresh for each order...
Lemonaid with fresh roasted rosemary was delightful.

Wow I can't believe this place has been here 4 years and I am just getting here...The love being shown in this resturant for the customer and food is detectable in the beautifuly prepared foods...as well as the care that is being made on the selection of what is being offered.  I wish more resturants took this much care.

I can't wait to come back and try the chicken and the others dishes."}
{"text":"Tried this place last week at the last minute due to yelp reviews.  This place is great and we will definitely be going back.  It doesn't look like much from the outside (I would really recommend new signage!) but we were pleasantly surprised with our dining experience.  We shared a large antipasta salad and a pizza. It came in a huge bread bowl and could easily be a meal by itself.  The pizza was fabulous.  You can tell it is made fresh, and we loved the open kitchen design.  The place is not very large which make dining in a little less comfortable than a typical sit down restaurant but we liked the unique decor and layout. The prices were very reasonable, especially for the quantity and quality of food.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Jan, 1 2016!
I haven't been in a while but the place just gets better and more innovative!
They sell beer now and Anchor was the perfect fit with the pizza I pulled off the toppings from the board. We tried their chicken wings that are stuffed with Geo's sausage and man were they good. I took my two kids and my seventy year old ma from green bay land and for an old fashioned girl like her she LOVED IT! She could tell that everything was homemade and was loving the fresh cannolis. I was impressed that Geo's boys were doing such a quality job!
A monster slice of pepperoni is enough for a teen and a five year old. I still can't solve Geo's wall puzzles without cheating.

Wow home made sauce!, it was great!
Ordered the Pork Rules pizza online.
Walked into the front door and there was a few people waiting for there orders, but I walked in and the owner says, \" are you Jason?, your pie is in the hole and out shortly.\" Offered a drink while I waited only 5 minutes. 
Pizza looked, smelled, and tasted GREAT! Fast service, GOOD quality product, Great normal price!. I'LL BE BACK!!! 
P.S. Hole in the wall joints are always better, and this is one of those!

You MUST ask why there name is Old School! You NEED TO LEARN ABOUT YEAST AND THE HISTORY OF, or if you are a wine, or beer brewer you will understand completely and realize your at the best pizza place in town!

Gio is not just a salad he is the head Chef that is in charge of chef's.

The Cannolis are freshly made I have NEVER!, NEVER!, had one fresh and thought that they were the most daft thing's on the planet earth till I had 4 of these things, now I have to run around the block due to the GREAT REAL Cannoli experience, \"they are really good!.

I have been just recently going to Old School(3-2013 4-2013) and asking the person taking my order to just make me the slice they feel fit to me...I just told that person whom ever what I liked and said make it what ever way chef's choice. EVERY TIME I had something that was tasty good full of flavor and hit the spot!  I asked one chef the convince me that anchovies can be baked on a pizza without over powering it and make it the most delicious subtle flavored piece of pie, and it was done!
The BY THE SLICE is the best value and the most flavored, I can NOT eat 2 but I have crammed 2 down and couldn't eat the rest of the day.
I now can say I HAVE ordered everything on the menu and never have I been disappointed. 
They have a really good thing going and I hope if  they make any changes they are subtle!, and  don't do like some businesses I have seen, get greedy and end up gone.  The way I see it this pizza place has a responsibility and a public service to remain part of the community."}
{"text":"The owners of this pizzeria have an absolute gold mine. Dont let the location fool you. There is seating for about 32 people and the atmosphere is inviting and authentic. I had the Antipasto and my husband had the Gio. They were both served on top of fresh baked italian sour dough rolls and were full of really fresh authentic produce. All of the other dishes we saw come out were incredible looking and judging from the faces of the patrons eating them, i would say they were. Maybe I was super hungry but if this place was in my home town I would eat here alot!"}
{"text":"So, since this review I was contacted by the owner apologizing for the experience, I've been back since and enjoyed my time. 

Sincerely hoping that the berating of people is over with. 

The food is really good."}
{"text":"A great place to get a huge slice of pizza! We had the solo meal which was a monster slice w/ one topping and garlic knots. The cashier misunderstood us when we placed our order and one meal came without the garlic knots. They were kind enough to make us an order of garlic knots at no cost to us. The pizza and knots are delicious! Slices are huge! Wish we could have taken a pic. The service is excellent! If you are looking for a great pizza place, Old School Pizzeria is it!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall pizza place. Pretty big slices and it matches with the price. More of an east-coast vibe and flavor. Pretty tasty. Love their signature rosemary lemonade that come in a jar. Return the jar and you get $.50 back. Really close to Nellis AFB and will be back again for another lunch date"}
{"text":"It may be that NY style pizza does not do much for me, but after hearing so many rave reviews about this place, I gave it a go and it was underwhelming. It is model NY pizza and nothing more."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is to legit let me tell you I tried it for my first time a few days ago and I cant stop thinking about it amazing I tried a small pepperoni pizza conlies and a calzone. I have personally worked for many pizzerias and have never been this impressed by the flavors of enjoyment this  place brought to my life if you havnt tried it I recommend it and if you have your a lucky person you deserve every inch of that monster slice deep in your flavor taster"}
{"text":"Amazing, dare I say \"life-changing\" pizza. We make a point of dining here anytime we visit Vegas, and while its not on the trip, its definitely worth the Uber-ride North. Have the grilled rosemary lemonade, have the garlic knots, and have at least one of every pizza on the menu (we're working our way through). This place will COMPLETELY redefine your idea of pizza!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service!! Authentic flavors will delight your senses! We tried a Specialty pizza, garlic knots, and Cannoli! it was fabulous! The Cannoli was the best I have ever eaten! Will definitely return and share will all I our friends!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Las Vegas. The food here is always top notch, made with fresh ingredients! If that wasn't enough I've always had great customer service here. When you eat here don't neglect the daily specials for the pizza. If you're lucky enough to show up on an Osso Bucco day...DON'T PASS IT UP! 

Please support this awesome local business so they can continue to thrive and I can continue to eat here!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the diamonds are right under your feet. A wonderful atmosphere. Very inviting & cozy. Alright,  let's get to most important part as my NY style pizza quest continues here in Las Vegas! I don't give 5 stars easily, however, the Old School Pizzeria got it today. I ordered a slice with pepperoni & sausage. The slice was one of the best slices that I've had in a while in general; definitely a home run as far as pizza in Las Vegas. The crust was practically baked to perfection! The quest still continues... This joint moves into the Top 3 category. Until next time..."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have had in a long time. Got the carnivore and a salad. I'm from the east coast and the pizza reminded me of the pizza back home, except better! The owner thanked us for coming when we left. I thought that was a nice touch. They are going to need a bigger building soon."}
{"text":"I have not idea why this fine establishment is located in North Las Vegas. This is by far the best pizza in Las Vegas. This is a five star establishment. The dough reminds me of my grandmothers. Treat yourself and friends and take a drive out to old school pizzeria. They are located across the street from the cannery casino in NLV."}
{"text":"We were out shopping and decided to find a Pizza place near home. 
Looked on YELP our go to online search,  and found Old School Pizzeria not too far away.

 It was Fantastic.
 (Most in the area suck big time, sorry I'm from NY where we know our PIZZA!) 

We entered the shop which had 4 tables with tablecloths and leather chairs. A big blackboard covered one full wall with the menu written out. 

So many interesting item to choose from. They have a fennel, mozz, grape/heirloom tomato and basil in a vinaigrette called Gio's Salad, It was delicious. 

Then our pizza came. So far I haven't never gotten roasted whole cloves of garlic on a pizza but this one had it. It was the 14inch veggie. More heirloom tomatoes, grilled mushrooms, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, eggplant and more stuff. The crust was crusty!! :) and really good. 

Loved the decor. 

If you find yourself in the area, you must get a pizza or any of the fantastic dinner selections.. They had osso buco, roasted chicken with a savory bread pudding.. stuff just sounds great. Need to try something else next time! 

Definitely a new spot for us. 

NLV is finally getting some good restaurants."}
{"text":"What a gem! The cannoli is in my top three ever, easily one of the best you'll find. The cream has an absolute perfect construction and the cracker has just a pinch of heaven. Get a smaller meal and two cannoli, they're that good. Onto the calzone; I got meatball and my buddies got meatball/sausage/ham. There was no grease in the calzone! The highest quality mozzarella mixed with a perfect crust with just a little flour on the outside to cost your fingers! The pizza dipping sauce was on point and warm. The setting is quaint, seven or eight tables with a soda machine and a television. Great music and the kitchen is right there to watch the dough fly into the air. Great service and good prices on top of it all!"}
{"text":"The staff is great and the 5 Cheese Baked Mac is worth driving from L.A. to get!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've eaten in 3 years.  Light, airy crust, beautiful toppings, cooked perfectly.  Now, this is light and thin, fresh, beautiful pizza.  It's not Chicago or any bastardized pizza.  This is a New Haven style, even more so than NY, due to its lightness and flavorful crust. 

I thought the prices were inexpensive and have def paid more for slop.  Small (2-3) people is around 20 bucks which includes two toppings.  

Their menu is small and compact.  They have sandwiches and some chicken dishes.  Nice tap beers and a few wines.  Nice workers too!   I can't wait to try another pizza topping."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great homemade sausage!  Best pizza I've found in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Delicious! Amazing pizza's and rosemary garlic knots. For $5.99 you get a huge basket of the cute knots that are seasoned to perfection. The pizza's are priced fairly for the quality and freshness that you are actually receiving in exchange. Seating can be a bit of a wait, but they accommodate you as much as possible! We had to wait at most 15 minutes but our food was just ordered so it didn't really matter too much as diners come and go. I planned to take it to go if nothing had opened, but alas, a nice table did! They also have a wine bottle deal if you take your order to go, so there's that extra if you do find yourself unwilling to wait for an open table. Everyone here is very nice, excellent customer service. The cashier even let us taste the wines so that we could pick the best one! How awesome is that?!"}
{"text":"Sometimes those hole in the wall places are gold mines. I have two favorite pizza places close to home that I frequent because they offer a great priced pizza and awesome service. However, this place offers a gourmet pizza with a side of sticker shock....ouch, a $30.00 pizza! But, what you are getting is not your typical pizza. 

I was amazed by the fresh ingredients, the amazing flavor of the cheese, and the fact that the pizza didn't ooze with oil all over my hands and face. All the sauces are made in the restaurant, they are organic, and the dough is made daily. I had the Vegas Meets Italy - this is a must try.

While there, I decided to try a couple other things. I had the Gio Salad. It is made with fennel instead of lettuce and was served in a sour dough bowl. I loved it! I also had the stuffed chicken wings. Curiosity got me on this one, as I had to try it just because it was such a foriegn concept. I was absolutely amazed by the flavor of this stuffed chicken wing. You will be too! 

I washed everything down with their homemade lemonade in a mason jar! Another big hit with me.

Somewhere between leaving a pizzeria restaurant and arriving at home, I usually have a stomach ache from too much dairy and bread. I firmly believe there must be some truth to the intolerance to gluten being in the gliadin and glutanin process, because I feel great. Honestly, I had just thought suffering to have pizza was a way of life :) 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough how thankful I am to have found this place. The owner AND the employees all are passionate about creating amazing food. Probably bar none some of the most creative pizzas I've ever had and far and away the \"most healthy\"... beyond that the daily specials are some of the best food I've had in Vegas and that includes some very overpriced meals from strip restaurants. I'm writing a review because I hope other people get lucky enough to stumble upon what is now my favorite place to eat out. Thanks guys for good food and conversation!

As far as the menu is concerned the best part is amazing options. The favorites are always available (vegas meets italy pizza for example).  And then there are the daily specials like Osobuco or home made macaroni and cheese (five different cheeses I believe). I'm still working through the menu and just can't get enough.

I can't recommend this enough if you are in Las Vegas / North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Top 3 best pizzerias in Las Vegas. One of the best doughs I ever had in Vegas or New York. If I lived closer I would at least once a month. Highly recommend this place. Excellent pizza."}
{"text":"By the slice. Amazing. 
You probably don't need a second slice. They are HUGE! Non descriptive building on the outside. Real nice on the inside. Great staff and service. They have a couple draft beers and a nice wine selection. If in the area, we highly recommend. 
And we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I've had pizza, calzones and the chef special (crazy good chicken).  All the food is amazing (really amazing).  The best and most unique thing about this place is the pride that the employees take in preparing the food, greeting the guests and just taking care of the establishment.  I'm very impressed with this place and always make myself a regular when in town."}
{"text":"I went last night with my family after rave reviews from trusted foodie friends.  I thought it was fine.  Just that- fine.  We had a our nephew's kids with us so we got a few pies.  A large cheese for the kiddos and a  large half Vegas meets Italy/ half Pork Reigns.  We also ordered a full order of the knots.  I will start with those.  The dipping sauce was delicious and the knots were good.  Ours were a little over done, but I like thinks crisp so I was pleased.  Our pizza's were good.  The crust was excellent.  There are only a few places that get the nod from me as far as crusts go.  (I am a Boston girl and we Bostonians care as much about our crust as all those New Yorkers do.) The rest of the pizza, sauce, cheeses, toppings, were just okay.  Nothing special, but good enough.  Hands down better than any chain in the valley.  It's REAL pizza, but not nearly as good as every mom and pop shop on the corners of the town I grew  up in Massachusetts."}
{"text":"If you are looking for gourmet ingredients and preparation OLD SCHOOL PIZZERIA is it! The pizza is enormous is size, quality and taste! Salad is also incredible! Be sure to try their homemade Rosemary lemonade!GOOD!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place. The menu seems pretty interesting. I walked in, at a time, when I thought it wasn't too busy. I was wrong. I guess they had some big catering going on, and they seemed to be racing against time. Working in the F&B industry, I understand. I ordered a Calzone with applewood smoked bacon and spinach. Also, the one thing that caught my attention, Rosemary and garlic Knot bread. with their ranch, that had a hint of rosemary spice to it, best part of the meal. Great flavor, they say that they use a natural leavening dough, meaning everything is natural even the yeast, takes longer to cook, longer to proof, had a sourdough taste to it. Great appetizer. Next, to the Calzone, it was average. I don't know what it was but nothing stood out. I've had different types of ricotta. This one was not appetizing at all. Dough was a little undercooked. I am not sure if it's just my personal preference but I wasn't a big fan of their dough, as other yelper's are stating that they have really good pizza dough. Maybe I am just so used to instant yeast and high-gluten flour, that I maybe missing something. anyways,  What saved it was the mozzarella and the other toppings. Great portion with the sauce, and bonus points for using Cristofer Columbo tomatoes. Great product, as I have used those in the past. I might try some other things here in the near future, maybe a slice next time. Service was kind of slow, but like I said It seemed like they were busy in the back."}
{"text":"I'm back in Vegas and as soon as I got unpacked this was the first place I went. I took my coworkers who haven't been lucky enough to come before and of course they weren't disappointed. Started off with one of my favorites, the super great garlic rosemary bread knots that come with the actual roasted garlic cloves and rosemary sprig they use to flavor them. Super warm, super aromatic, and of course super tasty. My coworkers were hooked already, I just smiled and told them to wait for the pizza. Once that came of course they became the addicts that I already was and I knew they would fiend for more Old School. Of course they are hooked and we've already brought plenty other coworkers here just to watch that shocked look on their face at how good everything is. On top of that, still a really outstanding staff. Really nice people, real funny, they just help give this place a nice relaxed feel.

Also to the negative reviews. If you don't like this place for any reason, or think it's less than 5 star worthy than I truly believe you just hate food. That's it. There's really no other explanation."}
{"text":"Ok. This place is legit!!!! We found it on Yelp!!!
Thank you YELP!!!! From the Pizza Crust to the Burrata Cheese, was such mouthwatering experience. The New York meets Vegas Pizza was definitely our favorite. Our son is a Heath freak, but they even had Roasted Chicken and Rosemary Fingerling Potatoes.  Huge portions and huge taste.  We went back 3 days in a road. 
I think we gained about 3 to 5 pounds but so worth every little bite.  This place is a must on a Las Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Great pizza, amazing rosemary garlic knots and delicious salad. The pizza crust was awesome."}
{"text":"First off, the food is  damn delicious. The monster slice combos are a great, affordable lunch option. Stuffed wings are a good side or app, but you can't skip the garlic rosemary knots- they're accompanied by several pieces of spreadably-soft roasted garlic! The antipasto salad is loaded with fresh ingredients and flavor, and makes a good lunch for those looking for a healthy option. 

This spot is noteworthy in that they use naturally leavened dough, as well as organic and artisan toppings and ingredients. The whole pizzas are pricey ($20-30) but use quality ingredients.. and can feed an entire crowd. If you want to impress at your next Superbowl party, this is definitely your spot.

I initially felt that serving the pizza with a side of ranch dressing went against that whole \"old school\" vibe, but it's actually a garlic-mascarpone dip! Unfortunately, the service has been borderline on every visit. Most recently, there were three people working and 4 tables covered in trash and dirty dishes in the middle of the afternoon and the space is already small with limited seating.

That said, the great food will keep me coming back all the way across town, regardless. Someday I'll get around to the porchetta sandwich, the grilled rosemary lemonade, and that chicken dish, but so far I'm in love with the pizza and haven't been able to resist ordering that."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, seriously. These guys know what they're doing. The 'Vegas Meets Italy' pizza is my #1. The garlic knots are also a must especially with that creamy white sauce they serve with it. YUM :P"}
{"text":"Living full time on the road,  one thing we do miss is real...good...pizza. This place nailed it!! From the antipasto salad for 2 served in a warm, fresh bread bowl (why has this not been done before??!!) to the vegetarian pizza.  Small place, no flash. Great food and friendly service. We will definitely return to this spot!"}
{"text":"Artisan pizza, This place is the real deal. You can immediately tell that everything here is made with attention to detail. This is how authentic pizza was intended to be served. Stuffed chicken wings were top quality as well. 

The place has a bit of a hipster vibe which I didn't care for but did not take away from the dining experience. Pricing was very fair and the portions were generous. One of my favorite pizza restaurants in Las Vegas. This place has earned its reputation. I will definitely drop by again."}
{"text":"I hadn't been home in 2 years and because of that I had created a loooooong list of places to visit (for food, of course - who cares about anything else?) and intended on visiting most of them during my vacation.

One of the places at the top of my list was Biaggio's. With everything going on, I just didn't find the time to do a lot of things that I wanted to, but I was adamant about trying a new pizza place. 

While looking up Biaggio's, I came across Old School Pizzeria and noticed it was much closer. We decided to save ourselves an hour of driving and we stopped in on a whim.

I took my cousin and her son, and we decided to dine in and split two large pizzas and bring any leftovers to our family.

We immediately chose the Calabrese and the Five Cheese. I like knowing that they let their dough rise for 36 hours. Awesome.

The kid that wanted CiCi's Pizza a few minutes earlier was in heaven eating Old School Pizzeria and his mind was somewhere else. He kept asking for more and more and more. Keep in mind - he is the pickiest eater I know.

I love their salame and the cheeses they put on the Five Cheese were top-notch.

We finished up, took our leftovers to everyone waiting at my Grandpa's house (aunts, uncles, grandpa, cousins, mom, dogs...you know), and they all started digging in. Apparently we didn't bring enough left overs for everyone, so my aunt called them and order two MORE pizzas for pick-up.

We returned AGAIN and this time I saw cannolis sitting on the counter, so I added 3 of those as well.

We were in a hurry, so we paid & grabbed the pizzas. When we returned, the pizzas weren't what we ordered. One of them barely had cheese and did not have the calabrese salame that we ordered. My aunt is Italian, so she keeps rolls of salame in the fridge. We sliced it and added it to the pizza ourselves. That part was disappointing. The other pizza was quite a bit smaller than the box. My aunt also ordered garlic knots...without the garlic. She's nutty.

They are becoming more popular by the second, the person making our pizzas was in training, and I'm sure they'll need to hire more people with the volume of food being ordered and made already.

I have high hopes for this place. Consistency is key. They will need to either expand or get more locations.
I don't live in Vegas, but I introduced my family to this pizza place on accident, and I'm sure they will continue to order pizzas here."}
{"text":"I had to try this place from recommendations from a fellow co-worker.  the outside is very underestimating as the inside is on a whole other level. It is comfy, cozy, and the music is awesome. keeps a positive train of thought as you wait for your pizza. the wait was long but expected as they make the pizza right in front of you.. Literally they have a glass wall and you can watch them make the pizza. I had no problems waiting as the final product was ridiculous! ! we had the 18\" with cheese, eggplant, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, roasted garlic, pepperoni, and olives. along with their garlic rosemary knots. the pizza was great, the marinara sauce was very flavorful but not overpowering.  the mozzarella cheese tasted fresh, the toppings were very flavorful and did not disappoint at all! pizza was on another level from others ive tried in my opinion and is highly recommended. the garlic rosemary knots are awesome. the knots are a bit dense and tough but after all it is a knot lol! but I didnt mind as the garlic and rosemary was very intense and was a great surprise as the knots ive had around town fall way short on the flavor category, not these though! They are perfect and a must try with their pizza. oh I also ordered their cannoli and I am currently waiting to try them as I am stuffed!! we finished half the pizza and there was two of us and I am satisfied! ! if you like pizza and havent tried this place, put your usual pizza spot on hold for once and go here it will not dissapoint!!

Update: so I had the cannoli!  It was good. It did however taste like a twist on what a canoli im used to taste like. It has the look. The shell is good and crispy, very dense shell. The filling to me tasted like a cream cheese/ cinnamon cream filling. It was good, just not what I expected. Try it out and let me know what you all think??"}
{"text":"THE best pizza I've ever had in my life. Hands down that dipping sauce did change my life ranch is never the same. Super fresh ingredients crunchy amazing crust I can't explain to you how good this place is:) you have to try it yourself! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, great quality! From the same family that owns Nora's Italian here in town. Drop by and grab a slice, but not during dinner Friday or Saturday, they get backed up with to-go orders. Grab a cannoli too, they're awesome!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. This is my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas. And they have such great service. Friendly staff, clean restaurant presenting a very welcoming environment. Food was ok and prices were fair."}
{"text":"It's in the dough! The pizza dough is incredible. It's springy yet chewy. Crisp bottom and crust. The pizza dough has the perfect amount of salt and there has got to be some fresh garlic or garlic powder in there somewhere giving it such a full bodied mouth watering flavor. When the dough is this good the pizza makes itself. The sauce and cheese are great too and fresh. I sat next to the pizza making window while waiting for my order and the smell of fresh basil nearly drove me insane (in a good way). This place knows what it's doing. Fresh, delicious and made with passion. The only reason I give 4 stars is while the pizza is awesome it's just too pricey."}
{"text":"Passed by the place dozens of times and always thought it was out of business.  Tried it tonight and its really good.  Tried the plain cheese pizza and was impressed, good pizza and good value as well."}
{"text":"July 9, 2015: Our good friends recommended Old School so we battled the mid-day traffic to check it out. We walked in the front door and stood at the counter for at least five minutes before a young man finally, and hurriedly took our order. FIVE MINUTES we stood at the counter with no one in front of us and four different employees said to us, \"We'll be with you in just a minute.\" Really? Then we realized that a tech from So. NV Health District had just walked in the door. Side note: When we walked in the door there were three dirty tables that had not been cleared. So the health district lady made the crew nervous. I get that but to put us off for over five minutes? Then I noticed the \"B\" Health District placard on the wall. It's always nice to see an \"A\". Food: They forgot to put a certain ingredient on my wife's slice and delivered two slices to me when I ordered just one. I wondered why I was paying $36 for three slices of pizza and two half-orders of garlic knots. Messy restaurant, B-rating, poor service, and the pizza is no better than our all-time favorite... (un-named). Would I drive from the Northwest to Craig & Cannery Row for pizza again from Old School Pizza? No. Oh ya, the guy behind the counter told us that the owner/chef is on vacation. Everyone needs some down time but Chef, find someone you can trust to maintain your business. After all, it's your name hanging out there."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was great ! Nice authentic pizza . Loved the geo salad and is literally the best pizza in Vegas ! You have to try it out can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Recommend it!

Reasonable price for an artisan slice of pizza.
Good quality and consistency.

Clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! They serve the best thin crust pizza I had ever had, if not the very best pizza. The crust was thin yet soft, the ranch dipping sauce made eating the pizza difficult in a sense that I didn't know which I liked better; pizza without the ranch was delicious and the pizza with the ranch was amazing, too.

5 stars in the sense that I need to call my dad and tell him about how amazing the pizza I had for lunch was!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked how I have 8 friends on Yelp who rated this 5 stars. Maybe I went on a bad day??

I've been wanting to try this place for a long time since it was highly rated by friends, but unfortunately it was a disappointment. It was a 40 minute drive from my house one way, so for driving that far for food it better be good. A friend and I ordered for 2 couples and we spent $80. I think that is pretty high to feed 4 people for this casual of a restaurant where you order at the counter and sit down to wait for your food. I would be fine with the price if the food was outstanding. 

Let me start with the positive-garlic knots. They were amazzzzzing! Everything about them I loved, they were perfect. 

Now on to the not so good-the pizza

Carnivore Pizza-this pizza had a pretty good taste (and I hate tons of meat on pizza). It was greasy. I would never order this kind of pizza on my own but it was for my friend's hubby and my hubby. I ended up eating a slice of this one because I disliked the one I got. 

5 cheese pesto- I love pesto and I love different kinds of cheese, and I love when I order this pizza at most other pizza restaurants. What happened? The taste was bland, how can pesto be bland? The pizza was so overcooked that the crust had a crunch to it. Not a slight crunch but a crispy cracker fall apart when you bite it crunch. I like when the cheese is gooey and soft on a pizza, but this was hardened if that makes sense and all the cheeses became one taste. The whole pizza was a no go for me or anyone in my group for that matter. 
The pictures on yelp of this pizza look soooooo different than what I got, so I assume our pizza was just overcooked. We also ordered a slice of pizza that was around $8, can't remember the exact cost but I thought that was steep for one slice. She wanted the white anchovy pizza and it looked like fake pizza when it arrived. The plastic food look. It was weird. I think they had a slide of cheese that they had maybe baked earlier in the day and put 2 anchovies on top and maybe one other topping, but the toppings were sparse and since it obviously was not made as a whole pizza and baked with the toppings, it did not have a really unique taste since the topping were just placed on top. I like the idea of being able to order one slice of pizza of the one you want, but for the price this is too high and the pizza did not seem freshly made. 

Looking back, I was trying one of the chef's specialties because I thought those would be the best. I always like to try the basic specialty for my first time before I go ordering something different at a restaurant and customizing it to what I want. Maybe I should have just customized in the first place. 

My friends at the next table ordered the Pork Reigns and this was a greasy greasy pizza-did not like. 

We ordered the Bruschetta with burrata (sounded soooo yummy) and paid for it, then the guy who took our order came up to us and said they don't have it. We got a different appetizer that was bread with a salty salty spread that I could not eat due to the high salt factor. 

My other friend ordered an octopus salad that I tried and did not like, and neither did she or anyone else. She said it was rubbery and tough. 

What also irritated me was the guy who took our order came to our table and started quickly cleaning up and grabbing things and grabbed the garlic knots in a flash before I could say anything! He stacked something on top and by then, it was ruined. I was irritated he did not ask if we were done and just assumed and took the best part of the meal away! The garlic knots!!!

I really wanted to like it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! You can't go wrong with any salad..they have amazing pizza and garlic knots with a dip..sooooo good! You have to try it!! YUMMMMMY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw the great yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. 
My husband called and placed the pizza order. I picked it up. The employees there are super cool, super nice. They even let me try the rosemary lemonade that's made in house. 
 
Got some paper plates, parmesan cheese, crushed peppers, and napkins to take home.
 
The pizza was DELECTABLE! We loved every bite. Couldn't finish the whole thing of course, but we'll save the rest for tomorrow. 
We'll definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! This place is truly a diamond in the rough. North Las Vegas has the pizza place that I have been looking for. The service was great, very friendly. The food was amazing! The crust of our pizza was great. The sauce was perfect. The ingredients were bar none quality. If you like bacon I highly recommend getting any pizza with at least the bacon."}
{"text":"Pizza was absolutely delicious. The staff was friendly and the place was cute and cozy."}
{"text":"Love the monster slice with home made sausage and roasted mushrooms. Sour dough crust is the best."}
{"text":"OMG this is by far the best pizza in Vegas! The crust is outstanding! The servers were so nice. I had the vegetarian pizza special and it was excellent. They serve beer and wine too. There are only a few tables so service is great. So glad they opened another in the northwest. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite pizza place until today.  My husband & I always order our pizza online & pick it up which is what we did today.  My husband gets there & is told they don't have a pizza for him they don't know what he's talking about, then they realize oh we gave it to the previous customer who just left.  The previous customer comes back after he realizes it's not his pizza and since it's the biggest sized pizza box drops it all over the floor.  My husband asks for a refund & the the response was it's an online order so it'll take 3-5 days to go back onto your card but I can make you another one if you wait.  Really?  As someone who worked in customer service management the correct answer would be I'm so very sorry that this has happened & I will reverse the charges and make you a new pizza if you'd please wait.  Guess we have to find a new pizza place."}
{"text":"Surprise gem in the area, very authentic!  Very fresh ingredients, amazing flavors. Antipasto salad comes in a delicious bread bowl. Large pizza has 10 slices and  our family of five left satisfied. Friendly staff. Dine in area is small but a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Old School Pizzeria has delicious pizzas and fantastic service. There is something about their dough is very tasty.  Their prices are a bit on the high side but they load up the pizza with quality ingredients. I always get my pizza to go as it is on my way home but think they offer delivery. There are several pizza places in the area and this is my favorite. I've been wanting to try some of their other offerings but always end up with a large pizza."}
{"text":"Exceptionally authentic pizza.  It's worth the price.  I rarely stray from the \"Calabrese\" because it is the closest taste to homemade food (from Calabria, Italy).  And to put them way over the 5-stars, they make the cannoli filling without contaminating them with chocolate chips - original cannoli's are made plain or with candied fruit, not chocolate!  Bravo!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars easy. They're pork pizza is rich and flavorful and they offer a huge size which is great for kids and parties.  Their mushrooms and topping seem super fresh and the garlic marscapone is icing on the cake.  I've been here at least 4 times and will keep coming back, it's even worth the drive for a nice date nite or lunch date."}
{"text":"The best I've had in Vegas...EVER! Such a small place with a HUGE following...everyone I work with LOVES  this place."}
{"text":"Things I love about Old School Pizzeria:

- Monster (and they mean it when they say it) pizza slices that were seriously, honestly, and truly the biggest pizza slices I've ever seen. The group of brawny construction workers next to us were moaning and whining that it was too much food for them (!!!) and I MAYBE ate half of mine. Major kudos to my boyfriend who conquered his whole slice. 

- The riddles on the wall. What a fun way to spend the wait for food! 

- The fresh ingredients, unique combinations, and amazing flavors. My slice of pizza came with this amazing salad that had a mascarpone garlic dressing -- I still dream about that dressing, and we ate there a week ago!

- Their sizes... Tonight, we are ordering the \"OMG!\" size pie for an informal dinner party. One pizza promises to feed 5 or 6 people. Where else can you find a pizza that big that still tastes amazing?!

If you're in the area, go go go! I just adore this little place."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious; the pizza with their garlic sauce is FANTASTIC!! We've been coming here since they first opened. Staff is amazing too and very nice!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot close across the Cannery movie theatre. Worth a stop before you go watch a movie!"}
{"text":"Just moved to North Las Vegas and oh man is it hard to find good food in this area! So happy I got to try this place out. 

FOOD:
Bruschetta (5 stars): Found burrata in North Las Vegas! Whatttt? And it was AMAZING!! Basically like a burrata caprese with bread on the side.  The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, the olive oil and aged balsamic had so much flavor, the heirloom tomatoes were so sweet and basil is just always good. Everything went perfectly together. I was in heaven. Just get it.

Monster slice of pizza (4 stars): Made a custom pizza slice with mushrooms, garlic, and tomatoes. The pizza is thin and crust is crunchy underneath which I liked a lot. The tomato sauce on it was really good, and the ingredients tasted fresh. The slice is huge!  Had some oil accumulating on top so I just soaked that up to be a little healthier, haha. You can do one of their specialty pizzas as a monster slice as well. 

Rosemary Garlic Knots (4 stars): You can definitely taste the garlic, and there's a hint of rosemary which is good so it's not too overpowering. Comes with ranch. 

SERVICE (5 stars):
Everyone was so nice and really cared if we enjoyed the food.

If anything go on Tuesday for the burrata bruschetta and you will not be disappointed. Especially if you love burrata as much as me. They have other specials for the rest of the week too. Such fancy dishes for a pizza restaurant, love it. I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"One slice and rosemary knits 10.00 not worth it. Pizza was soo freaking dry. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Is it truly that good? Answer: Yes, yes it is. Go, get the knots. Go, get the pie. Across the street from the Cannery Casino parking structure in a strip mall. Go. You only live once. This place needs to be on your piehole's bucket list. Full order of knots and a small pie with a fountain drink, less than $24. Worth...every...penny. Go."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review as the owner contacted me to resolve the experience I previously had. He was very friendly and very concerned with what happened on my visit to his pizzeria. 

I am very happy with him reaching out to me and asking for details about my experience. We wanted so much love this place and support little local businesses  . Plus, the lemonade is amazing and the decor is so darn cute. 

I am more than happy to go back and give this place another try on a good day. Perhaps, I just had a rare experience. With the customer service I received from the owner, I'm certain my next visit will be much improved. I look forward to trying a pie and more lemonade in the near future."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly! Food was amazing! Took my kids with me and for being small they made it comfortable and easy with kids!"}
{"text":"Great ,small ,friendly Italian restaurant. Our salad in the bread bowl was magical and the pizza was hot bubbly goodness. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"This place is so oooooooooooooh good! Everything is made fresh,  so expect to wait a little.  The staff is super friendly and helpful - if you don't know what to get,  just ask them. Also ... order the rosemary lemonade! It's super delish for a lemonade"}
{"text":"My first time going to this pizzeria place and I was actually pretty surprized, the food was really really good. Lot's of flavor on the pizza, the garlic knows were amazing. They have puzzles on the board you get to try and solve and if you guess it right they give you a free canolli. They also gave us free dessert from a catering that they did which was really nice to go way out of the way for us. I will diffently be returning here. Prices are very resonable and well worth it."}
{"text":"I love Old School Pizzeria! This place has never let me down once since first coming here! I bought some stuffed chicken wings with sausage and a traditional 14'' cheese pizza. The chicken wings are about 5-6\" long plus the chicken is tender and the sausage is sweet...but the best part is, NO BONES! [Just the end] 98% meaty! These wings are to die for! The pizza is perfect and my personal opinion is the crust makes or breaks the pizza and let me tell you OSP always delivers!"}
{"text":"this IS the best pizza in las vegas. Hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday. no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza. give this a try, you will not be disappointet"}
{"text":"I am going to give 5 start to keep that rating a 4.5 or more! They are not exactly a 5, but not 4..4.5 is where the place should be! Great crust, great salad, great ranch, great service and a great atmosphere of a non corporate pizza parlor! The only place in Vegas that is in any league with Grimaldi's and you can get it by the (MASSIVE) Slice!"}
{"text":"Oh man the pizza is delicious here! Fresh out of the oven when I got my order steam was just flying out the pizza as we cut it. The ingredients tasted very fresh and the customer service is pretty great too with complimentary dipping dressing. I loved the pizza and highly recommend and I will go back soon."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant because it was close to where we were when hunger struck, but don't let distance be the deciding factor on whether to come and try some of Chef Gio's amazing food, just come.   The menu offers pizzas with a myriad of delectable toppings such as homemade sausage, caramelized onions and roasted mushrooms.   We each had pizza slices with cheese and personalized toppings.   They were humongous and delicious with fresh veggies and meats and lots of flavor packed into the sauce and cheese.  So good.  Dip one of those slices in their garlic marscapone sauce and you'll forget ranch dressing was even a thing.  And it bears repeating that the pizza slices are ginormous.  They are serious about size and no one is going home hungry.  

I also had a Gio's salad on the side.  (Tomato, cucumber, fennel, onion and mozzarella with a house vinaigrette)  the salad was perfectly composed with a great balance of flavors from the acidity of the dressing  and the cool creaminess of the mozzarella.  Just yummy.  (Also, if you order a full size salad it is served in a bread bowl.  Yes please!)

So glad we found this place and I will absolutely be back!  I am looking forward to trying their organic chicken dinner with potatoes and stuffing or one of the daily specials.  This place was a pot of gold at the end of my google search."}
{"text":"Outstanding family recipes. Flavors you won't find just everywhere like pizza with mozzarella, dates, goat cheese, prosciutto and arugila. We will be regulars! Very good!"}
{"text":"The first time I went, it was absolutely delicious and couldn't wait to go back. The second time I went they forgot my cannolis. They do not deliver and I live a little over 20 min away so there was no point in driving all the way back to get them. When I called about it, instead of giving me a refund, they put a $5 credit attached to my number ( I paid a little more than that for them) and the food was not as good as I remembered it to be the first time around. I was disappointed in the results, so I have not been back since."}
{"text":"This place makes great-tasting pizzas and calzones made with fresh ingredients and old-school italian flavor.  We had the Pork Rules pizza and my sister-in-law had the Egggplant Parm calzone.  They have huge portions at reasonable prices.  Their salads are amazing too, served in a bread bowl.
The owner was super nice, and the free gelato (Yelp checkin) was a nice finish.
Delicious food and great value!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great, the service lousy. I've picked up at least a half dozen times over the past six months, and I don't remember once the pie being ready when they said it would be. Twice the pizza wasn't even started (like tonight). The employees are nice and apologetic, but I'm tired of \"we have an oven down \" and \"we are having system problems \" excuses. You are making pizza, not putting a man on the moon. Hundreds of establishments in LV are able to do this for their customers.  I'm going to find one of those."}
{"text":"This is an excellent pizza place. It's small, but has a cool vibe and decor. You can write on the walls with chalk! You order at the counter, take a seat, and they bring your order to you.

You can order pizza by the slice (and it's a HUGE slice) or a full pie in various sizes. They have a menu of speciality pizzas or you can create your own. 

When our pizza arrived, it was tasty, but completely burned all over the bottom. We weren't sure whether or not to say anything. We eventually did and they immediately apologized (numerous times) and made us a brand new pizza. Which was just great customer service.

You can eat in, take it out, or even have it delivered via various delivery services. I'll definitely be dining here again when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Im from Chicago and a Pizza fan.. I can eat pizza every single day all day long. This pizza is one of the best I have had.  Ever! (here in Vegas anyway).  Even though right in front of my face Owner Giovanni decides to pick up garlic knots that fell right to the ground and decided to put them back.  Yuk! Luckily for me, it doesnt stop me from coming back because I believe in 5 second rules.  Just ironic that he continued to do that despite the fact that I was standing and staring right at him.  Makes me wonder what other things he picks up from the floor."}
{"text":"My favorite casual dining place to bring clients, friends and family. Delicious thin crust, a good variety of fresh toppings and a friendly staff make this a place I'll happily return to again and again when in the area."}
{"text":"This was so delicious! Toppings are tasty and fresh. Pizza was served fairly quick, and the small was huge! Plenty for 2-3 and then some! Would definitely recommend, and plan to come back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place as you walk in is amazing, there is a smell of fresh ingredients and pizza. We ordered a small pizza 2 drinks and a single slice. The pizza was amazing hands down some of the best in Vegas the only complaint is the prices are extremely high. 

4 out 5 price the only downfall."}
{"text":"The best pizza joints in the area.  Their carnivore pizza is better than any other meat lover's pizza I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"We came here because it's across from the movie theatre, and the pizza joint inside is pretty lackluster. We ordered a small pepperoni pizza and a half order of the garlic knots. They came with a type of marscapone aioli that was really tasty and kind of reminded me of ranch dip. The knots themselves are sourdough based and come with roasted garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. So goood--I stole all the garlic! 
The pizza was really great--it had a slight char to the thin crust, enough sauce and cheese, a great texture, and the flavor was there. Everything was delicious. I wish I had room to try a cannoli or something, but alas. The garlic knots filled me up. 
We sat at the table next to the prep, so we could watch the chef whip up the pizzas. The drinks and silverware are self-serve, but they bring everything out. It's a quaint little place that has great pizza. Stop on in!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here....they never have slices of pizza...thwy always want me to wait 20 min for 2 slices of pizza....i couldn't tell you how the pizza taste cause they always leave me hanging...been there 3 times and Every time I've left empty handed....."}
{"text":"The grilled Rosemary lemonade will change your life. I had a slice of The vegetariana, which was good but I really want to try Vegas meets Italy (but you'll need a group to eat it since it only comes in full pizzas)."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, the Calabrese is one of our favorites. Place is clean and service is great. A bit small but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for GREAT pizza since moving to vegas. Not good pizza, not ok pizza... GREAT pizza. I think i finally found it in these guys. simply perfect and fresh. only down side of me is its far from my house. but absolutely worth the drive. probably better that its farther - otherwise i would gain 400 lbs eating here 4 nights a week :)"}
{"text":"I so desperately want to give this place five stars but the tiniest of seating area prohibits me from doing so. With that said the food here is absolutely delicious. As noted by other reviewers it is on the pricey side but I feel the quality ingredients makes up for it. Again the \"monster slice\" is enormous and the deal with a drink and salad is awesome. I've also had the garlic knots and stuffed wings and they are equally as mouth watering. A way more authentic pizza place in the heart of North Las Vegas is a true gem!"}
{"text":"The best cannolis in the world.  I don't even like cannolis.  I don't know what they do to the filling but it is simply amazing. I brought my mother and made her get one. She didn't want to but I insisted. She liked it so much she bought 2 more to bring home.  YUMMY!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Reminded me of pizza I had in Italy. Very fresh ingredients. Loved the olives they use."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. 

Walking in, the pricing seemed a little high for what I thought was a small local pizza joint ($18 for a small pizza?). Nah. I was wrong.

CRUST: For their pizzas and garlic knots they use a sourdough crust that they let rest for days in advance. Every bite has that CRUNCH outside and softness inside.
TOPPINGS: All ingredients fresh and high quality. Flavors worked great.

I also got a cannoli here which was pretty great. Seemed like a regular cannoli but the chef told me they do some kind of deliscious twist on it, but I don't know enough about cannolis to tell you what and I forgot what he said. I was too busy thinking \"holy ****, this cannoli is good\"."}
{"text":"I had a craving for arancini and this place came up. Unfortunately when I called,  they no longer make it.  :( however I was still craving old school Italian. So I called 20 mins b4 they closed and ordered a pie. Sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and extra cheese. I was just hoping it would be halfway decent because I have a hard time finding good pizza after living in Boston ... and being Italian. Boy what an awesome surprise! Fantastic sauce, fresh and well seasoned, thin sliced sausage instead of that crumble crap and sauteed mushrooms! And to top it off, they piped me three fresh cannoli I decided I wanted at the last minute. My Pops couldn't say enough good about the crust and toppings. And the cannoli made his night. We def will be back. Hopefully they will have a special and have arancini again some day :)"}
{"text":"I've lived by this pizzeria for many years and never thought about checking it out because the outside looks kinda sketchy, but me and my boyfriend where tired of all the same food places around us we decided to finally give this place a try. We called to put in our order but you can also go online, we ordered a classic small pizza  with pepperoni and it's good for 2-3 people (depending how hungry you are lol) it was about $15 bucks I think. It tasted great, you can definitely tell that it's all freshly made and it's honestly way better then the Pieology that's near by that place is expensive and the last time we went they pocketed the cash we gave them for the pizza in front of us (there employees don't care), so I'm glad I found a good pizza place to replace them, the people in this place seems like they care and are friendly."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! For real!! I've been a customer since it opened and I've never been let down. 

Chef Gio makes his own dough. A lot of the meats are also house made. Not only is the pizza good, but so are the other dishes. The salads are fresh and the garlic knots are delicious. The canolis are the best I've ever had. I would eat anything out of that kitchen. 

The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Service is quick and the atmosphere is good. 

I recommend this restaurant to all of my friends and have never heard anything but good news. I've hooked them all!!! Seriously can't think of anything bad to say. I wish my stomach was bigger so I could fit more Old School in it. Give this restaurant a try, you won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"I hail from San Diego, with plenty of old world style pizzerias. The Vegas Meets Italy is by far one of the most unique and flavorful specialty pizzas I've ever had. You might be spooked by the toppings, but trust me they make an excellent pizza become a superb pizza. The man at the counter bet me that I would come back before I return to CA- he's right, I will. A High five to Old School Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Bought a burned pizza, black on the bottom.  Took it back &  Dan replaced it free.  The 2nd one was still dark on the bottom.  Dan said it was undercooked on top & Chef Gio wouldn't let him sell it if he were there.  I said if it's too dark on the bottom & undercooked on top, there's something wrong with the oven.  Dan said what did I expect with a 25 year old oven?  I took the pie home & all my guests hated it.  Half the pie was thrown away because it was burned on the bottom.  I've had pies there that I believe were the best in town.  I think the problem is Dan's attitude/ego.  So I'm not going back until Chef Gio gets Dan under control or gets a new oven."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pizza. I like their different selection of toppings. Cool atmosphere and very nice staff"}
{"text":"i may not love pizza as much as other folks i know...hubby, ahem!  
i may not be able to eat pizza every single day for every single meal like other folks i know...hubby, ahem!
but i think i can safely say that i've had enough pizza in my time to know when i'm having a good pie.
and, boy, does OSP just tickle my pizza pickle.
that made no sense but i digress.

the dough is definitely the best i've had in vegas to date.
it has the perfect flavor, the perfect consistency, the perfect perfect perfect...it's perfection.
the garlic knots with that ricotta cheese whatever dipping sauce, i could probably eat a dozen by myself.
i've only had the pizza and the knots here but that's really all you need to have here.
i'm sure the rest of the food is great too and i'm sure i'll eventually get to other parts of the menu, but until then, i'm happy with pizza and knots.

now...when are they gonna open up more locations???
i think it's time. =)"}
{"text":"This comment is way overdue (since the summer). My family and I were  looking for a great pizzeria and we searched on Yelp. Based on previous reports we decided to try this place. The food is excellent! The only minus is that the place is hard to find. Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the North Town's best kept secret. It is an incredibly low key locale with a deliciously and surprisingly high quality food. It's a pizzeria with the most authentic tasting and looking pie in the whole Valley, but their best stuff is the sausage stuffed chicken wings followed by crazy good chicken and specialty salads. It's a quaint and cozy rustic feeling, hole in the wall where \"Vegas meets Italy\", \"The pork Reigns\" and \"old School is hardcore\" all in one place. The staff is courteous, hardworking and very down to earth.  Hand picked by the genius, Chef Gio himself, just like the high quality pure food ingredients, the crew are an extension of his genuine hospitality. Oh and I almost forgot the Cannoli and the grilled rosemary lemonade are out of this world. You must get some just go before it's gone. You'll thank me later. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"The crust wasnt the best.  It was like bubble gum. They didnt put any chicken on my pizza. It was basically a chesse pizza with olives. Mine you I order 3 toppings.  I can say they do put a nice amount of sauce on there pizzas. But next time im hungry ill get chipotles or my usual dominoes pizza. I wish that had chicago style pizza in las vegas. Home run inn would be blazing right now."}
{"text":"After my initial visit, I only praised the gelato at Old School Pizzeria. My first review is now obsolete because they no longer offer gelato. I've been back twice, and I still haven't had a memorable pizza experience, but I really enjoyed the rosemary garlic knots and side salad with mascarpone ranch dressing on my most recent visit. I was impressed by these items so I also ordered a cannoli to go. The crisp, homemade shell was filled to order with a light cinnamon-spiced ricotta cream and dusted with powdered sugar. With each bite, I was also dusted with powdered sugar. I'm sure that I will think of this simple, delicious dessert any time I find myself on this side of Craig Road.

They have also made some improvements to the dining area to make it more attractive. It's still a comfortable place to eat with children, as the chalkboard walls are a welcome distraction until your pizza comes out of the oven."}
{"text":"I love this tiny pizza place that offers giant pizza slices. Their OMG size pizzas are ridiculously huge! My favorite is the four cheese pesto pizza, which comes with toppings of pine nuts and Mediterranean olives (can substitute for plain boring black olives). The wings and cannoli are off the charts! Italian sausages stuffed wings with a hint of sweetness sprinkled with some pistachio crumbs. The cannoli has a cinnamon sugar coating (extra crispy) with again ...pistachio crumbs adding to the crunch in every bite. Now you know this place is \"crackin\"! 

While you wait for your food, take a look around and take in the rustic and hippish feel of this place. They've got fun riddles on the chalkboard wall for you to solve. The service is always consistently awesome, just like the food.

They offer wine by the bottle or glass and beer on tap. If you are a wine drinker like myself you can get the bottle of wine for almost half off if you purchase it to go. Yes....I said to-go!

If you are looking for an intimate setting (not big enough for large groups) and some real authentic Italian style pizza or pasta, look no further because this place has got way more than what you expect. You know they are authentic when you get a funny look for asking about ranch. Nope, they've got this yummy creamy and thick mascarpone dipping sauce for your pizza instead!"}
{"text":"My son and I went to eat here.  First the guy working acted like we were bothering him, not very friendly or inviting.  The pizza was okay, neither of us were that impressed. It seems to be way over cooked, and that atmosphere inside was small and cramped."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!!! Hands down!!! Gio and Darren and the rest of the staff are great! Anyone that puts less than 5 stars for their review of this amazing restaurant simply doesn't know what they are talking about. Can't wait to be back! Oh yeah and the garlic knots and cannolis and everything I've tried on the menu is outstanding so eat here and you won't be disappointed! :) I'm celebrating my wedding anniversary and Darren made the pizza into a heart shape for me to surprise my wife with! If you haven't been here it's time you do!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand people who don't like Old School Pizzeria. I read some negative reviews and frankly, I am shocked by them. I've lived near Old School for almost two years and have eaten there several times. The food is always DELICIOUS. The crust is so good that you can eat it alone if you like. Their menu is superb and they offer unique toppings. My personal favorite is the Vegas Meets Italy pizza.  

A couple of notes: they occasionally run out of dough or toppings. And yes, the restaurant itself is small, with just a few tables to sit at. If you want cheap, ready-made, mediocre pizza, go to Little Caesar's. For superb pizza, come to Old School Pizzeria."}
{"text":"We have been here on two occasions, and if it were a little bit of a jaunt from our house - we would be here every week! The first visit we tried the Vegas Meets Italy, which was fantastic! Smoked provolone, pistachios, ricotta, prosciutto, date cream sauce - delicious! We also got the to-die-for garlic rosemary knots, and I got a salad with their delicious mascarpone ranch dressing. 

Most recently we couldn't decide what to order, (besides the garlic rosemary knots) and the gentleman taking orders suggested the Pork Reigns. I was hesitant, as it had salami and pork jowl, two things I have convinced myself I would hate. He assured me that it was delicious, his favorite, and that pork jowl wasn't where I thought it was located - it's a cut from the neck and shoulder, not what I refer to as my pork jowls when I grab my double chin. 

I am so glad I listened to him because the Pork Reigns certainly reigned supreme on our pallets!! The crust is perfectly chewy without being tough, and despite a plethora of pork bounty and cheese, the pizza was not the least big greasy. 


Our only dilemma here is what to order next time, and who gets the roasted cloves of garlic from the garlic knots?!"}
{"text":"Best food . Dedicated staff. Carlos and Zeb are fantastic. The food is amazing, I love the stuffed wings. Give these guys a raise!!"}
{"text":"I had the classic slice with the garden salad while in Vegas for work. It was delicious, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While in North Las Vegas with my son, we were in the mood for pizza.  Saw this place on Yelp with the great reviews and decided to give it a try.  The ambiance of the place is very nice and we were greeted with a smile!  We ordereda small meatball and bell pepper pizza with garlic knots - DELICIOUS!  The crust was very tasty and tyre meatballs were freshly made.  Would definitely return next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"We saw this little pizzeria at the last second as we were looking for somewhere to eat before watching a movie close by. We walk in and the decor isnt the greatest and it was small, but thats not really a concern for me as ling as the food is killer. My boyfriend and I ordered a big pizza just with pepperoni and garlic rosemary knots. He also bought a mason jar of housrmade rosemary lemonade. The food came in a timely manner. Unfortunately my boyfriend did not like the lemonade; it was quite bitter. The food, however, was quite good."}
{"text":"I love Yelp. We flew out of Las Vegas after Zion hiking. It did not disappoint! Get out of the chain fast food crap and stop here!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is soooo good that I went to bed thinking about it. Now I understand why people order the biggest size pizza! The ingredients were fresh."}
{"text":"Imagine a tall Italian handsome Italian man telling you you can have it your way. My review just might be slightly biased. 

I came in when the place was closed.. I guess around three. The owner was very kind and accommodated me. I asked him for recommendations, and told him to make me something tasty. I had a vegetarian slice, a meaty slice and an order of garlic knots. I don't know if the items or on the menu or what they are called. I think he may have just thrown together some ingredients. 

The pizza is made right in front of you, and was still hot when I got home 20 minutes later. I can honestly say that I have never had pizza like this. The ingredients were very bold, and provided a unique flavor. I preferred the meaty pizza to the veggies pizza as the veggie pizza had some sort of broccoli that had a flavor too robust for my palate. The garlic knots were yummy. They were cooked with fresh garlic, and had an amazing sauce to go along. 

I will definitely return. I will probably not pay as much attention to the nice Italian guy, and choose my own slice. Which reminds me - one slice is more than enough! It took me three days to eat the 2 slices and the knots."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. I live in LA and stayed at the cannery and was looking for a good pizza place nearby. Ended up trying it with my brother and dad, the place inside is rather nice and casual, the staff is knowledgable and nice but the pizza and garlic rolls are just not what I'm used to. They had way too much Rosemary that basically took away all the flavors of the pizza, we had gotten a combination. My dad got a really good pork belly sandwich which was great but this is a pizza place so I would have expected much more from the pizza. The toppings were skimpy and there was a lot of sauce. This place has great reviews but it doesn't seem special to me, maybe because the food in Vegas is just bland and that's what people are used to. Anyways nothing spectacular, too much Rosemary in everything. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"I have nothing to complain about when it comes to this pizzeria. I first had their pizza for my birthday lunch and I can say it was the best pizza I've had that I've gone out of my way multiple times for a slice. The crust is amazing! It's almost like a sourdough crust. I could eat it all day! The customer service is great too! Kind and happy to be serving you. Seriously a must try!"}
{"text":"They make the best pizza on the planet.....I won't eat pizza anywhere else. The freshest ingredients are used to create each pizza masterpiece and made right in front of you!! Check this place out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly..., no comment. It's worth for y'all to come here and give it a try and you definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"The owner contacted me and apologized as well as tried to fix the situation.  For this I give 4 stars, to me this means they care about their cutomers!"}
{"text":"This to me is the best pizza in town! There are some close seconds but consistently, the pizza here is hot, great crust and the sauce is delicious. I am a fan of the simple cheese pizza and I have never been disappointed here. The owner is great and he is often seen being the one who makes the pizza."}
{"text":"super fast and oh my gosh their pizza is ridiculously goooood. dough is on the sweeter side than most places, but for some odd reason it worked and everything came together. . good service. fast. and fresh!"}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem by chance.  We have only ordered take out 2 times but I'm sold on their business.  First off the pizza is outstanding !! My husband likes thin pizza and pretty fussy...he loved it.  I placed a order on line and the experience was crazy good.  Fast and the smoothest take out I have ever experienced.  My order was placed and picked it up in 30 minutes.  They send you a text telling you they are pulling it out of the oven !! I was pleasantly surprised by the COZY atmosphere in the restaurant when I picked up the pizza.  I definitely will go back and eat in their restaurant."}
{"text":"We just moved back to Vegas from Reno and couldn't wait to come back to Old School. The food is amazing, service is fabulous! Yes it's more expensive than Little Caesar's but you absolutely get what you pay for! Highly recommend this place! Fresh, fresh, fresh!"}
{"text":"This is my official pizza place. I have been coming here  approx. once a month, for about 6-9months. 

The pizza is always fresh, new york style, served quickly. No complaints. 

But I decided to make this my official pizza spot because of the customer service. Every time I come in the same guy (i didn't catch his name but i will ask next time) greets me with an authentic smile (whether its lunch on a sat or right before closing time). Always makes pleasant conversation. Just a really genuine guy. 

Well a few visits back, I ordered the garlic knots (amazing!) and I asked for extra sauce (house made, equally AMAZING) of course he obliged. I came in again today, and he remembered my extra sauce! Its been quite a while since I ordered the knots so I really appreciate the gesture. 

This is the type of place you come to for the food and the atmosphere! I love this place."}
{"text":"if you're looking for vegas meets Italy this is the PLACE IT'S BOMB.COM everything is DELICIOUS we had the stuff chicken wings and had some of there freshly made pizza and its a must try !!!! I couldn't wait to stuff my face !!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to go into much detail with this review because the other folks covered it all. I will say that this is the best pizza I've ever had in my life. There's something magical and comforting about it. Staff is nice and friendly. 

I'm looking forward to trying Chef Gio's new place called Pizzeria Monzú when I can make it over that part of town.

TIPS: The pizza pairs great with a bottle of Rosé!
Make sure you ask for some extra house-made dipping sauce. OMG!"}
{"text":"I must be missing something here! What's all the fuss about? Is there a certain pizza I should be ordering?  I wanted to like this spot, but left a little disappointed.
 
Ordering by the slice is something I am used to at food courts inside of every mall in America. The difference is that the slices here are no joke!  One slice is enough to feed just about any person with a healthy appetite. 

I opted for a slice of pepperoni and sausage. Ok--here are the positives.....
The tomato sauce they use is light, flavorful, and what I have come to expect out of a good pizzeria. The dough is a good consistency and holds up without tearing or getting mushy.

What I didn't care for was the toppings they used. The pepperoni seemed cheap and greasy.   In other words, the kind of pepperoni you would find on pizza in the freezer section of your favorite grocery store. The sausage was fresh but lacked flavor. I ended up wishing I ordered a slice of cheese instead.

I will give this place another try, so I can sample the desserts that everyone talks about. The place is small and serves as a better take out place at the moment. However, it seems as though they may be renovating since the last time I was there. 

I am really searching for that can't miss pizza place in Las Vegas. I have been trying for 6 years and have not been successful.  Maybe next time, it will be better. Let's hope so!"}
{"text":"Come hungry!!! Great pizza and service is great. Come here from Cali. Talk about OG style. Thin and tasty. Fresh ingredients and is made in front of you. New York style pie."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas hands down. Real authentic and don't forget the desert. Creamy dreamy gelato after a hot meal is always a win."}
{"text":"Authentic & perfect Italian food in a quaint setting! Takes you to Italy for a few hours of delicious pizza, salads, calzones and Italian wine. The dough is homemade daily and the best I've ever had! The most friendly staff makes you feel at home while you enjoy some music, wine and indulge in the best pizza you'll have in Vegas. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"I admit it, I'm a big fan of this place. The pizza is always fresh and really delicious and if you order by the slice then you'll notice that they are humongous. The staff is also really friendly and you can tell they are trying hard to make their customers happy which I enjoy. Nice menu selection that will keep you from getting bored and in addition to the Pizza's I highly recommend the calzones which are really delicious and gooey. This place is a definite heart attack waiting to happen but who cares, finding a good pizza joint is hard to fine and I'm glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Went to eat here with some friends and the pizza was great. The crust had that nice crispiness to it and the peppers we added gave it a nice kick to it. Excellent tasting food. We also had the garlic knots with a creamy sauce that was awesome tasting. 
Its on the other side of town for us, but we all agreed that the drive was well worth it."}
{"text":"5+ STARS! BEST PIZZA EVER!
This place is so good that I feel guilty that I've ever given anyone else five stars.
We had the garlic rosemary knots (as another yelper said, \"just do it\") and they are absolutely glorious and after eating a few realize that there were cloves of roasted garlic resting in the bottom of the bowl. Totally awesome.
My husband and I shared a small pizza. And we are both pretty hearty eaters and we're completely full afterwards.
We shared the Vegas meets Italy pizza and I cannot imagine even trying anything else because I will never be able to not order it.
This pizza is the perfect combination of flavors with each by giving you another surprise and getting better and better. It has smoked provolone, mozzarella, ricotta, pistachio, dates, heirloom cherry tomatoes, arugula, prosciutto, and date cream. !!!!!!
We were fortunate enough to show up at a time when it was not busy which apparently doesn't happen very often so we got the best seat in the house right in front of the chefs preparing our meal. And as if you needed any other reason than the fact that the food is absolutely outrageously great they cleaned the entire time we were there. The bathroom was also very clean and well-stocked.
The service was impeccable with friendly people who absolutely took care of everyone in the restaurant.
We will absolutely be making this a regular on our restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and the customer service is on point! The boys are down to earth and aim to please. There menu is is very interesting and well \"old school\" which I love. They have wine and beer. We got a margarita pizza a couple of Stella's and some cannolis which were really good. My kids were happy and entertained by the black board which they could draw on w chalks given to them by the waiter. I will have to go back to try the rosemary lemonade. Thank you for the pleasant experience :)"}
{"text":"The service is always great the food is always hot and fresh the prices are great and I love everything on the menu you can dine in or take out not sure if they deliver but I really like the staff they are plesent and it's a great place to eat before going to the casino or movies."}
{"text":"This was bookmarked for a while as I've heard great things about it. Finally got around to going with someone. It was a lot smaller inside than I expected. Also, the price for a small pizza was $18 and a large pizza was $30. That's ridiculous. I'm no pizza elitist, but I've had my fair share of different types of pizza, and the Classic combo was nothing special. The rosemary lemonade was good, but I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon, especially as this is way out of my way."}
{"text":"Arguably the best pizza in Vegas. And been to NYC often know what good pizza is!  It's hard to find in Vegas.  This tops the list. Also porchetta sandwich is solid!  Garlic aioli for dipping is good quality."}
{"text":"Pizza is a passion of mine. I am a fan of all types and styles. I love thin crust, deep dish, brick oven, etc. That being said, this may be the best pizza I've had in Vegas. It's straightforward and built with very high-quality ingredients. My wife and I got a 1/2 cheese, 1/2 pepperoni and roasted bell peppers pizza. The service was super friendly. These folks clearly like working here, and we got our food quickly. The sauce was the star of the show. It had a clear and bright tomato flavor. A lot of sauces taste mostly like salt and seasoning, but this was all tomatoes. Incredibly flavorful tomatoes. The crust was also great. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. It was cooked perfectly. Can't wait to come back. We did have a wobbly table. Every time we leaned on it at all it tipped. I'd eat this pizza sitting on a chair missing two legs, with a tree stump for a table though. But seriously, they should fix that table."}
{"text":"The pizza here is superior, so tasty and 100% true to its name! The sauce is NOT the usual sugary, bland tomato sauce - it's savory and yummy, and the crust a nice mix of chewy and crispy and tasty, too! They have some very creative combo pizzas and the stuffed chicken wing is supergood. The salads are always fresh and the knots are great. The calzones are huge and worth the dough (sorry, couldn't resist!) and it's only 75 cents per topping added in. I never have ordered anything that didn't come out quickly and fresh. The pizza by the slice is huge, and the slice combos are very good deals! 

If you have time to eat there, the staff is very friendly and they play cute Italian music. I eat here every chance I get and am so glad it's in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I get excited about any place that can pull off a pizza that reminds me of New Jersey. I had heard a lot about this place and was anxious to try it. When I walked in the smell instantly brought me back to being on the east coast. They had a lot of different options but I kept it simple with a pepperoni, a ham and pineapple, and some garlic knots. However they did offer such toppings as: calabrese, guanciale, dates, gorgonzola, pecorino, and pesto cream. They had some specialty pizzas or you could order these items alone as toppings. Very unique creations. The chef here really seem to put his heart and soul into the food. Mom and Pop business at its finest."}
{"text":"Amazing is all I really can say! Fresh ingredients, the best dough ever and don't forget the canollis! I've been going there for a while now and can't get enough. I work with a bunch of real Italians who showed me this place and they give it their stamp of approval. 

I visit at least one a week for their monster slice and knots. The only thing I don't like is rosemary on my knots but I just ask for it without so no big deal. It's a smaller place just across front the cannery. Don't be fooled by the outside, it's such a cute little place inside. You MUST try it!"}
{"text":"My daughter just moved to Vegas and so we wanted to try some places close to her and we are so lucky to have found this gem! This is by far the best pizza I have had. Everything is made fresh there in this family owned pizzeria and everyone was super friendly. The place is small but can get take out if needed. Will definitely be back when we come back to visit our daughter!"}
{"text":"We tried 2 different salads, both fab! We wanted to get the Vegas meets Italy pizza but it was sold out.... But we got the classic? Sorry forgot the name. Best crust I have ever eaten. Will be taking everyone I know here, was that good..."}
{"text":"Single handily the best traditional pizzeria joint in town! Fresh ingredients with and old school flair! Their lemonade is the very best I ever had! Their friendly customer service is just magnificent and always makes me want to come back!"}
{"text":"Owner Giovanni emailed me, apologized for my experience and offered to refund any overcharge.  He obviously cares very much about his business and his customers.  I don't want a refund but do appreciate that he took the time to reach out.  


This is not your average pizza joint.  Huge monster slices, grilled lemons in their lemonade, killer homemade ranch, awesome toppings: heirloom tomatoes, artisan salame, guanciale, pistachios, dates, want garlic?  It's not minced, they use whole cloves.  Pizza was excellent.  So why the 3 stars?  They messed up my order twice and I think overcharged me.  That or they are waaay over priced.  I wasn't given a receipt so I am not sure.  We came in for a quick bite before going to the movies.  I got the Monster Slice (with 4 toppings) and Knots special and my friend got a 1/2 order of knots.  We both got drinks.  Our total?  $36!  Yikes.  Nice older guy helped us at the counter.  He had a little trouble with the POS system and adding my extra toppings.  I got pepperoni, mushrooms, olives and garlic.  When our food came out my slice only had pepperoni.  I asked if I was charged for the other toppings I ordered and said if I wasn't I would just keep the pepperoni, no biggie.  They were super nice about it, checked and I was charged so they made me a new slice to go and gave me the plain pepperoni on the house.  Only problem that slice was wrong too.  Instead of olives they put onions.  I didn't say anything, they were so nice and wasn't going to have them make me another slice.  We shared a Grilled Rosemary Lemonade and Passion Iced Tea.  The drinks come in mason jars.  He didn't mention it and we weren't sure if we could take or should leave them.  The jars are pretty big, we ended up leaving them and not finishing our drinks.  If I had known I paid extra for the jar I would have taken it.  I learned later they take $1.50 off when you return the jar.  So if you get the tea or lemonade, take the jar.  That shit is good.  Don't waste it.  I am not in this area often but OSP is worth the drive.  I'll be back to try their specialty pizzas and I'm sure update my review."}
{"text":"I gotta give it up for this little pizzeria.  Working on this side of town can be a challenge for a foodie, and Old School Pizzeria made my day today.  I went with a couple of coworkers, and was more than pleasantly surprised.  

I split a 14\" five cheese pizza with one other person.  The size was perfect for two starving fellas.  The crust was perfectly cooked; lightly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The inside of the slice was thin, while the outside was puffy and doughy. Perfect crust here folks, I enjoyed every bite!  Obviously the cheese was the highlight of this pizza, and it was an amazing one at that.  I have had a few five cheese pizzas in my pizza eating days, and this one is definitely the best.  All of the cheeses were high quality.  Lightly oily from the cheese itself, the \"grease\" level was moderate.  The ricotta cheese though... holy crap.  Just do yourself a favor and order anything with this ricotta cheese on it.  I've never had ricotta that tasted this creamy and delicious, almost as creamy as cream cheese!  

We also tried some of the pistachio gelato and cannoli. The cannoli was fresh and excellent, although not the sweetest cannoli I have had, which could be a bad thing or a good thing depending on your tastes.  Personally, I don't mind a less sweet dessert.  The crust was a dark brown and made fresh with coffee.  The cheese was fresh and lightly sweet.  The gelato though was a mind blower.  Words can't describe the perfect flavors coming from this pistachio gelato.  You gotta try this stuff!

Update: The \"Roast Chicken\" is actually Sous-Vide prepared chicken.  This is a special process that involves wrapping the chicken and potatoes in a vacuum seal and cooking in water.  This retains the juices of the meat and taters.. and it shows in the flavor. It is so juicy that the juices from the chicken collects in the dish as you eat it.  Yum!  This dish is very savory and full of garlic flavor.  Absolutely delicious and unique.  I noticed someone accused the chicken as being \"soggy\" or something like that, so I thought I would make this update to address this wonderful dish. 

I can't wait to start bringing my friends and coworkers to this little pizzeria.  It has trumped my previous favorite Italian/pizza in North Las Vegas and is now my go-to for pizza.  I'll be coming here frequently for sure!"}
{"text":"I thought there were great portions for the price but there needed to be more seasoning for an Italian restaurant. Great service and awesome Ambience but when it came to the food it tasted very Bland or plain but the portions were absolutely spot-on"}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome! I really liked the industrial/modern decor, it was a welcome break from all the casinos (it was on the small end, however). I had their lavender lemonade which was delicious and just the right amount of sweet. If you bring the mason jar back you can get your next lemonade at a discount. I drank that while I waited on my 5-cheese macaroni and cheese and watched the people working there make pizza behind the counter. The macaroni took a little longer to come out than I would have liked but it was worth the wait and since they pizza oven/prep area is visible through a glass wall, at least I had something to entertain me. As you can imagine, the dish is extremely rich so I couldn't finish it....or make room for any of the canoli's they also sell. Definitely worth your time."}
{"text":"Not your average pizza joint, but I wasn't super impressed either. It's a cute little place, simple decor and chalkboard menus circling the wall. 

The slices are huge, probably 3x your average slice and it tasted good. My biggest complaint is that they really skimped on the toppings (which are $0.40ea) and the cheese... So its really a lot of crunchy crust. I  ordered pineapple, ham, and bacon. Pineapple was small and sparse and I got two very small/thin pieces of fatty bacon :/ . Kind of a bummer but it was definitely filling and satisfied my pizza craving!"}
{"text":"I'm from Jersey so I'm a pizza snob off top.  I often preach about the qualities of a good pie to my husband (a Las Vegas native)- and this place makes good, quality pizza with premium ingredients. My husband and I came here for date night and LOVED everything we ate. We got the Hardcore Old School b/c we were feeling adventurous (he'd never had anchovies on pizza before =) and the Crazy Good Chicken, with the rosemary lemonade and a glass of white.  The chef was awesome and accommodating and took our questions with a smile. Cannolis were off the chain with lots of lightly sweetened cream and pistachios in a crispy sugar dusted shell. BONUS: Now my husband doesn't want to eat pizza from anywhere else!
I enjoyed a new experience AND upgraded my husband's pizza game. #winningatlife!"}
{"text":"Took my sister-in-law to eat dinner and she loved the veggie pizza. She said it was one of the best and loved the garlic knots too."}
{"text":"Chef Gio really aspires to make a top notch pie. He prides himself on using \"Calabrese Salame\", which is apparently the original pepperoni. Works for me. The pizzas start off at 14\" which is what the big chains like to call a large. I personally like the \"Extra Big\" (18\"), and think the OMG (24\") is just a bit big to be practical. I recently ordered a classic combo (the traditional everything-on-it sort of pie). Nothing about this was traditional (in a good way!). The mushrooms are marinated crimini mushrooms, his peppers are roasted, and the onions are grilled.. The side effect of all this yumminess coupled with a thin crust, however is a slightly soggy pie. A small price to pay for excellence!

But let's talk about the crust! I normally don't get excited about crust ( I usually feed it to the dog!). I noticed one day in his shop that he says he uses natural leavening, and on my last order I could really tell. It tastes just like sourdough. It is super light and airy, and just the right amount of chewiness. This takes 36 hours to prep, so his signs warn that one day he might run out of dough...

In short, I'm really glad Chef Gio has come to the North side of town, and really hope to see him succeed. He is super friendly with his customers, places a tremendous amount of care into his pizzas. Why order the $10 pizza from the big guys when you can have greatness?"}
{"text":"There are few times when you get to witness greatness in it's prime. This place consistently delivers on quality, I honestly am surprised I have yet to have a bad experience. The two guys there are the dynamic duo. The garlic knots, what can say other than that's how a finger food bready food is meant to be prepared and presented. The roasted garlic, pine needles, and ranch dressing make for an all around fulfilling experience. The garden salad, wow I've never had salad taste like that. Cannoli at the end, best I've had since my last trip to little Italy in NYC. And hey, the pizza is bomb. No joke this place is legit."}
{"text":"The first time I tried their pizza about a year ago I thought it was great. The crust was good and the sauce and cheese were perfect. The last two times I tried it, it was chinsey, very little sauce and hardly any cheese. Like everything else greed sets in. Old school has become greedy in the their product, they have cut back to just ordinary and over priced food stuff. I'd rather get dominoes!"}
{"text":"This pizza shop is great. It has an old feel with a new twist to it. The pizza is the best I've had in Vegas. All sauces in Vegas are a bit too sweet for my tastes but other then that, it's the closest you'll get to NY pizza. So my 5 star is basses on best pizza in Vegas, not the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"The Pizza is awesome and there are so many variations. They even offer you lemon water while you wait and. can even watch them make your pizza!"}
{"text":"best pizza in vegas!!! people are nice and you get your food super fast!!! plus you have to try their amazing lemonade!!!"}
{"text":"Simple review: The best pizza my wife and I have ever had. Worth the trip from anywhere in Las Vegas whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Vegas! Everything is so fresh and yummy!! The special ranch sauce is perfection!! Definitely a go to place if you are craving some amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"Wow, boy am I surprised to find such a great pizza place nearby!  Monstrous slices for a decent price, and you can't beat the sourdough bread. Yummy."}
{"text":"I would give them a 4 or 5 if they could ever make a pizza in time or correct. Once you get it if it's right it's great. But I have been here over a dozen times and every time I order ahead and come to pick it up rather it be online or talking to someone in the phone they mess up my order. It's not hard large pizza half pepperoni half cheese. If they don't mess it up then they say it will be ready in 20 mins and you get they 30 mins leather and they haven't even started your pizza. So you have to wait another 20-30 mins what's the point of having online ordering or even calling it in. They need to know their times and how long it take to make things and just make it right. Seriously 12-15 times here and I might say maybe just maybe only once has my order been right but that was only  because I came in and placed the order in the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"A small operation. two tables avaiable.Open kitchen. Too much garlic on the breadknots.Salad dressing same as the dip for the bread knots. So much that makes Your your eyes water.....Th Ziti i excellent.  Pizza average don't order meat topping if you like lots garlic.They must reduce the amount garlic..   ATM available."}
{"text":"So glad we checked this place out! We ordered a small pizza (which was big enough for two people) The pizza crust was so good, you can really tell it's homemade! The service was quick, a perfect spot before heading over to the cannery for a movie!"}
{"text":"...i  truly cant explain in words ...how beautbvibrant and how alive this pizza... Hands down in my book this is the greatest pizza in vegas...and second to none ..."}
{"text":"This place has some of the worse pizza I have ever had. They do make a extremely large pie but large dose not make good pizza. I did not enjoy the flavor of the pizza sauce which in my opinion ruined the taste. There staff is friendly though."}
{"text":"Oh My Goodness! I just ate the best Calzone ever! I was greeted with a rounding \"hello\" and loved the rustic decor with the chalkboard panels. I knew I wanted a calzone, just could not decide what to place in it. The friendly young man  at the counter suggested carmelized onions to complements the  chicken. We also added eggplant. 
Alll of that goodness made the car smell wonderful. I dug in to the calzone with rich mozzarella oozing out the sides. The tomato dipping sauce was the icing on the top! 
We are from New York, and miss real pizza. All of my east coasters this is the real deal! 

We also tried the rosemary garlic knots and cannolis. Equally as delicious. We will be back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Yay! I just happen to be their 100th reviewer!

First of all, shame on me for not coming here sooner because they have been here at least a year and half in this nice location across from the Cannery Casino. Old School Pizzeria is just that. Old school. They make everything from scratch right in front of you. 

I ordered the Rosemary Garlic Knots and a Monster slice of The Carnivore. 

The Rosemary Garlic Knots were exquisite! I have had garlic knots before but these babies are now the standard I will judge others by. Let me describe it. Please have a bib or a napkin ready because you will be drooling. These are not your basic garlic knots. These knots are baked with actual rosemary leaves and real garlic cloves tossed in a light olive oil. I had them sit in the oven a little longer so it would make the outside even more crispy. When you take that first bite, it's comparable to one of those scenes you would see in any basic movie when somebody has a flashback and relives all those fun, awesome times, all in fast forward because by then that first bite is on its way to your stomach. Oh, and don't forget about the ranch dipping sauce that comes with it. Definitely did not come from a bottle. I assume they made it fresh because it was really creamy and made me want to drink it.

As for the monster slice of The Carnivore, the description is very fitting. If you refer to my pic, I put a pepper shaker right next to it so you can comprehend its dimensions. Now I have had good thin crust New York style pizza before, but this crust was SOURDOUGH! Now sourdough bread by itself I am into, but as the crust for the pizza? Stupendous! As you can assume by the name, it has all the meats they have available. From my recollection it had sausage, ham, chicken, pepperoni, and bacon. Usually when I get to the end crust, I just put it aside, but this crust was so good especially dipped in the ranch dressing, that it would make other sourdough bread jealous.

As an honorary mention, I gotta say that their bathroom is nicely decorated, clean, and has a fresh scent to it. It's so nice that I hope to God that none of those idiot hooligans jack it up with their sharpies and scratch things up. Memo to those low lifes: What kind of jerk are you to vandalize things and make it a sight for sore eyes? Anyways, sorry I kind of strayed off the beaten path there.

So now that you got this far in my review, I just want to reiterate one thing. Whatever you get here, make sure the Rosemary Garlic Knots is one of them. The pizza comes in a very close second because it compliments the former. Sometimes, you just gotta go old school! Old School Pizzeria that is!"}
{"text":"Yum! Found this place by chance and super happy we did. Hit the spot!!!!! It's a cute little place with friendly staff and great pizza. The homemade tea is great too! So happy it had little or no sugar in it."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza on my side of town. The crust is sourdough and all pizzas come with housemade garlic ranch sauce for dipping. My only complaint is I wish they had hot wings. That's just me though, I love wings with my pizza"}
{"text":"Anytime I see four and a half stars; I'm skeptical. In my opinion very few restaurants deserve four and a half stars with 200+ reviews.  I often find that establishments with these numbers have a local cultish following which over rate the food.  

This restaurant deserves every one of the five stars.  The crust is amazingly crispy on the outside and sourdough chewy on the inside. The ingredients are chef quality.  The atmosphere and music is downright cool.  This is no run-of-the-mill ma and pa pizza shop, but a chef inspired gem."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. All fresh ingredients and worth the money. Service is just a good and consistently impressive. Highly recommend the garlic knots. Place never disappoints."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza restaurant on the north side of Las Vegas. The ingredients are fresh, I love the music, and the employees are always friendly.  Its a small hole-in-the wall joint, with a small selection,  but the food is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"The portions were extremely generous. The countermen (the guy who took my order and all the employees) were extremely nice. They were all pleasant and helpful. The pizza was okay, it could've been better as was the huge calzone. In my opinion the problem was not the sauce nor toppings, but the dough. In fact they're one of the few pizzerias to use quality black olives which is a huge plus in my book.

The mascarpone dip was freaking delicious as promised. You can't say you don't get your money's worth. 
BUT...
The baked 5 cheese pasta was UNBELIEVABLY, INCREDIBLY good...probably the best take on Mac n Cheese I've ever had. I could live on that stuff. 
The cannoli was also fresh and tasty and the guy was nice enough to pack the filing separate from the shell so it didn't arrive home soggy. 

I might go back for a second try especially for the pasta, but Darrin B. answered my wife's review kind of nastily thinking it was me. I should add that her review was written prior to tasting the pasta and cannoli so I don't agree with her 1 star either. His response to my wife's review which he mistook for mine was kind of insulting so I'll have to decide what's more important...my pride or that ridiculous baked pasta. Yum-o! Seriously!"}
{"text":"Live in the area stopped by with my wife and kids and was blown away everything was good  we had the sausage stuffed wings to warm up  

And the pizza we got was the chefs choice the Calabrese
Overall experience was A1 

Ps they have beer too 


Pizza +beer sign me up ...."}
{"text":"I have tried most high rated pizza places in town. This one I found on Yelp and it truly is the best in town. Fresh, fresh, fresh. Very authentic new york style pizza. Love it."}
{"text":"Walking in as a newbie and trying to read the chalk board menu was a little overwhelming until the guy at the counter, who was so pleasant, helped us out. I could tell he was really into all the products as he spoke so passionately about them and the process. We ordered garlic knots, pepperoni pizza, homemade (everything here is) pizza, an antipasto salad, porchetta sandwich and grilled rosemary lemonade. ALL delicious! They then treated us with the BEST cannolis! :-) GREAT experience!! We WILL return and ordered a large pie so the folks at home could experience this too. Great people!!"}
{"text":"It's the best pizzeria in Vegas... honestly tho, if I want pizza I go HERE, I normally go here for birthdays because who can with stand this DELICIOUSNESS? I truly recommend going here, you can even take the pizzas to go if you'd like. They freshly make the pizzas here from scratch. Their ingredients are fresh and the interior design is very nice and classy. I think it's also a good idea to have a chalk board wall, but you can get chalk on your clothing if you lay against it which can get annoying. Overall this place is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood pizzeria popular with Nellis folks. Little pricey but worth the cost. Small dining room. I came after 1 pm so I'm guessing I missed the lunch rush.  I had the solo meal with a stuffed chicken wing which was delicious. Service was quick and friendly enough. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS TIMES A MILLION!   If only this place were in other parts of town like Henderson or Summerlin....Pleaaase expand.  All of your food...and not just the pizza...is AMAZING!  Everyone should be lucky enough to eat such wonderfully creative tasting food.  If you haven't yet try the garlic knots, baked chicken, and fennel salad.  But my favorite pizza is the one with pistachios....YES PISTACHIOS!  OMG!  So good.  By the way, you can call ahead to hold the one big table for bigger groups...This is a very tiny place with only a few tables.  Don't miss out on this hidden gem."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for lunch and I'm glad we did. We shared a large Antipasto Salad which tasted great. We ordered the Vegas meets Italy pizza and it was delicious! All the flavors in one bite was so amazing, one of the best pizzas we've ever eaten. This place is awesome! Service was great and staff very friendly. The establishment was clean."}
{"text":"This place is no joke. Food is prepared right in front of you and it's all fresh ingredients.  Atmosphere is great and the employees are engaged to provide service. I had the classic combo with a side of garlic rosemary bred knots. Outstanding.  They even came around with fresh cut prosciutto to sample. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of a friend and I was not disappointed. We shared a small garlic and mushroom pizza, an antipasti salad, and garlic knots. Everything...every single thing was a delight to my taste buds! Whole cloves of garlic on the pizza and in the knots. They make a ranch mascarpone sauce that is so good my knees would have went weak if I was standing. To drink I had the grilled Rosemary lemonade. So amazing! I recommend everything I had. I can't wait to try different pizzas but next time I really want a calzone. I will be back most definitely. Again and again...

If you are a pizza lover this is the place for you! 

Also! Incredibly helpful and friendly staff! Had a great experience all around."}
{"text":"Authentic, genuine pizza. Flavors were amazing, tasted extremely fresh and you can't beat that. We also tried their green salad which came in a bread bowl, their garlic knots and their chicken stuffed sausage wings. My boyfriend loved them and it's crazy cause there's no bone just sausage and chicken. Crazy how they did that. Service was exceptional and the restaurant has a very cool vibe to it. It's a small location but it was full of people and the prices are reasonable. Especially for the freshness and quality of everything."}
{"text":"You can't find flavor like this anywhere else. From the Grilled Rosemary Lemonade that comes in a huge mason jar, the Marscapone dipping sauce that comes with all of their pizzas, to the sauce in their pies.. Everything has such a unique taste that surprises you everytime you return. The staff is also super friendly. The menu doesn't have a big quantity but it really doesn't need to because everything they do they do right."}
{"text":"By far theeeee best Pizzeria in Las Vegas!! Great taste, quality and service!! Very consistently the best Pizza in the entire state... Dont miss out on this pizzeria period!! The owner is a world class chef, culinary artist and a great person!!! Enjoy all of the great flavors!!"}
{"text":"Super busy Saturday night! So happy the bf and I decided to get food to go. Also incredibly happy that my favorite pizza place was packed! This trip to Old School we decided to try all new things. We ordered the five cheese Mac and cheese, the pork reigns calzone and the Mary's chicken. As always everything was AMAZING! Their Mac and cheese is now officially my favorite ever (and I make a damn good Mac and cheese). The pork reigns calzone was delicious. I prefer it as a calzone over the pizza...maybe because of the addition of ricotta. Mary's chicken was finger lickin' good with some tasty potatoes and stuffing. Overall another satisfying meal."}
{"text":"If it was possible, i'd give this place 10 stars. Hands down, the best pizza I've had thus far! This place seems pretty much like a hole in the wall and though it took awhile for our food to come out, i felt like it was well worth it. 

I ordered the monster slice and added bacon, ham, tomatoes, and garlic as my toppings. You could just tell everything was fresh and made from scratch. Even the side of ranch was a perfect addition to this slice of heaven. Wish we had a place like this closer to where we live"}
{"text":"New to this side of town and I LOVE pizza so stopped by Old School. I was shocked at the tiny size of the place. 6 tables squished together. Plus the front window faces south so there is no way to escape the heat and sun. We ordered a pepperoni and veggie pizza. The crust was great-- light and airy. But I just wasn't thrilled out of my pants with the overall taste of the pizza. The veggie pizza seemed to have too many toppings-almost a bit overwhelming with some many flavors. The employees were courteous and the place was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Best 5 cheese Mac I've ever had. Great pizza too! Right across the street from the Cannery. Don't let the small place fool ya. Great food!"}
{"text":"Old School is a breath of fresh air in a neighborhood of crappy chain restaurants and limited choices. It's not perfect, but it seems to strive for something close to that. 

I've only ever had the pizza and the salads here. I tried to order a sandwich they had on the menu once, but they were out of chicken. The specialty pizzas are unique and very good, I love the one with pesto, although drawing a blank on the name currently. Veggie pizza has lots of toppings, even eggplant! My only complaint is the crust; it's thicker than I prefer. Gio's salad is okay, and the house salad is truly delightful. That mozzarella though... Damn. Yes, I'm salivating over a HOUSE SALAD. Great lunch specials, big slices of pizza, decent prices. 

Small restaurant, therefore limited seating. Good, quick, friendly service. I hope you choose Old School over Pizza Hut. Dig deep in your wallet and just do it ... and try the salad."}
{"text":"Best pizza in vegas...hands down. Incredible crust _ flavor, texture. Their combinations are amazing...cheese, sauces, dough ..made in house."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!! Service is always friendly and food is amazing. I always look forward to their pizza."}
{"text":"finally a place with good food in the northside of vegas!! old school pizzeria is for sure a hidden treasure. the staff is super friendly, the menu is amazing, pizza slices are huge, and evrything is authentic italian. you'll find everything from pizza to calzones to gellato. for someone who loves pizza, this is hands down my favorite pizza spot in vegas!!"}
{"text":"Reading reviews one would think this is the best pizza West of the Mississippi.  This is far from the case and i feel sorry for the folks of Vegas if this is indeed the \"best\" pizza in town.  The pizza was average at best.   Ordered the specialty carnivore pizza and it was far from special.  Toppings and sauce were bland leaving much to be desired.  They charge a premium price for what is a sub par pizza.  Customer service was equally as poor as the pizza.  Hearing the way the couple after us was treated only confirmed the service I experienced.  High price + sub par pizza + poor customer service = won't be making the trip back or recommending to friends/family."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   It is quite a drive for us - about 40 minutes but worth every minute.  Located right across the Cannery, this place puts forth some of the best pie I've ever had.

Love their sourdough crust - it's crispy and soft and chewy on the inside.   All the ingredients are top notch - I loved the marinara they used.   So fresh with a little kick to it.

They allowed us to call in the order so the pizza was ready when we got there.   They messed our order up and brought out a Pep. and Sausage instead of Mushroom.   It looked so good I was fine with the mistake but they brought us a side of mushrooms and when they found that they did make the Pep and Mushroom pizza, they gave us the second pizza free!

I would be giving this place 5 stars with or without the mistake.  I ll have to come back to try their stuffed chicken wings and their octopus potato salad.   The garlic knots were so comforting and filling and paired nicely with the garlic aioli.  It was much lighter, refine, and better than a ranch or other dressing.

We spent about $20 for a 2 topping pizza  and would go back any day of the week!"}
{"text":"They were so good. Best pizza me and my husband found in vegas and we live here. I would recommend this place to everyone. They were very polite and helpful. I like that u can see them make the pizza. Great place that i will be bringing my children too for pizza."}
{"text":"Their pizza was really good, tasted fresh, and was just the way we wanted. And it was picky kid approved! Everyone worked super hard and were very nice!"}
{"text":"This little place is wonderful. I think the best part is actually the service- these guys are so kind!!!! You can do a single slice special and the slice is huge! Amazing variations, including a vegetarian option. I included a picture of the gio salad which was amazing. Garlic knots, salads, soups, cannolis, and bottles of wine. Perfect place"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the reviews on this pizza place, so I decided to try it out. I ordered the pizza solo meal. I had eggplant, olives, onion, and pepper on my huge veggie pizza slice and I chose the garden salad as my side. The salad has this delicious garlic marscapone dressing, which also comes with the rosemary garlic knots as a dipping sauce! I had to give the garlic knots a shot too based on all of the great reviews on them- definitely a must!!- I was further impressed by the service and passion for cooking of one of the workers--perhaps the owner's son? He enlightened me about the dough they make there and how it allows for a more colorful creation."}
{"text":"Out of this world delicious. When we're in town we have to pick up a pie & their stuffed wings from this place. Staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome dough, sauce and toppings.  Best pizza place I've had west of the Mississippi!"}
{"text":"It was our first time ordering and eating, and to be honest we figured it would be just like any other pizza place. Low and behold we were wrong. I couldn't have been more pleased with service, atmosphere, and the food of course. We first ordered a full order of garlic knotts, folllowed by an OMG carnivore pizza.  And after taking the first bite of those delicious knotts we knew we had something special.  The pizza came rather quickly and of course it lived up to the hype! Scrumptious!!!

I can say that the staff was really open in communicating with my family.  We really enjoyed the questions they had posted on the wall, as it made for small talk and thinking from all. We will definitely be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, likely one of the best I've ever had. The proportions and quality of ingredients were superb; for instance, there was just enough sauce but not too much, plentiful veggies and toppings but not so many as to overwhelm the cheese, sauce and dough. My husband reports that his half (my half was veggie combo and his a regular combo) featured a delicious medley of sausages/meats complimenting each other and the veggies. Every ingredient tasted fresh and crust/dough had a wonderful rich aroma. Can't think of a way this pizza could have been any better.

It's easy to overlook this place (it's right across the Cannery Row casino thingy in a small, very unassuming commercial building), but very much worth finding. We stayed at City Center on the Strip and it's only about 15-20min drive from Vdara/Aria/Bellagio area to this place and we'd recommend it for other visitors. What's neat is you can see your pie prepared behind a glass \"exhibit.\""}
{"text":"This has become my favorite pizza joint. It's a cute and quaint family owners pizza shop with comfortable seating and decor. I love the Pork Reigns pizza and Antipasto salad. The pizza is made with love and are huge but thinner slices buttering with flavor. The salad taste exactly how you envision it! I love the friendly and quick service!"}
{"text":"Old School Pizzeria is one of the most authentic and original pizza places I've gone to. I really admire and appreciate that they offer organic items on the menu. Their pizza, chicken, garlic knots and cannolis are seriously to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is a trip! I love the cooks and the owner! True east coaster. First off we get here during lunch rush hour and there is literally a line out the door. So in my freinds infinite wisdom he asked the Owner \"What's good here\" the owner responds \"Are you serious?! I don't have time for this and throws him a menu and says \"It's all good..when you're ready to order get back in line\" hahaha love it!\" I ordered two slice... should of got one, they are huge!! Just FYI order the double (two slices) it's cheaper than ordering two single slices. 
  While we were enjoying our meal, a guy comes in thinking he was all \"gangsta\" and tell the cook, \"Hey make me 3 of those!\" The cook who looked like Popeye! Just looks at him then points to the register and says \"Order there like everyone else!\" then Mr Gangster yells at the owner...\"Hey Bro!\".. without skipping a beat the owner yells back \"THAT'S CHEF BRO TO YOU!!\". You can't have old school pizza without the old school attitude! Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside but is surprisingly good and unique on the inside. I highly recommend the monster slice meal with a side of the antipasto (think salad with bits of game, cheese and olives + olive oil dressing), or a stuffed chicken wing, which is effectively a chicken with the bones removed and replaced with sausage I believe. Either way, great food for$20 or less usually."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent!!! A little pricy in my opinion $31 for a large classic, feeds 3-4people but it was worth it. [Large classic invluded pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms,onions, and olives.] Was sble to phone in order & picked up our pizza to go."}
{"text":"Bar none. My favorite place to eat in Vegas. Everything, literally everything is delicous, fun and exciting. Perfect atmosphere and service. Garlic mascarpone sauce is outta this world. You won't be sorry, worth every penny."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, hands down! The ingredients tasted fresh & delicious and the portion size is well worth the price. It was our first time ordering from here so we ordered one small Regina Margherita and a large build your own with housemade sausage, pepperoni and ricotta. We'll definitely finish the leftovers but a small of both would have definitely done the trick. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Everything Chef Gio prepares is tasty, fresh, abundant. Best anchovie pizza ever bcuz they're fresh, not canned. Salads are made with love and the best cannolis you have ever had, hands down! Don't forget to try the homemade lemonade!"}
{"text":"The pizza was phenomenal. We had half pepperoni half vegas meets Italy and if I wasn't so full after two slices I probably would've ate the whole large pie by myself!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza place in Vegas, but they have other incredible dishes as well. My favorite is the Crazy Good Chicken. I've been missing this place, and Chef Gio, since moving away. A must have whenever I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"So my fiancée and I were craving pizza and he mentioned this place. First off, I have to say I was impressed with the menu. There's a lot to choose from and it all sounds delicious in the descriptions. Secondly, I liked the friendliness of the staff and was happy we got there at a slow time, so seating wasn't a problem. 
I ordered a calzone with black olives and pepperoni. I was impressed with the size but felt it was lacking in olives and pepperoni. Tons of cheese, just the way I like it. 
The atmosphere was cozy and very nice. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Hands down, most amazing crust I've had. The place smells really nice, the environment has great, relaxing music, and the food is simply outstanding. Their sizes are pretty nice, large being 18\" and their OMG being 24\". The sauce tastes very fresh and the crust is not fought or mushy, it's well cooked and crunchy enough with each bite. The middle of the pizza was a little floppy, making a few ingredients slide off the slice, but that wasn't an issue on my end. Toppings were pretty delicious and fresh as well. I'm definitely planning on coming here again."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOOOO amazingly good!!!! The bread reminds me of traditional birote Mexican bread, THE BEST. Definitely will come back to this place, it's good, cozy, and the service is great."}
{"text":"The real pizza from Italy !! A bit pricier but well worth it! O and a 24\" will feed the entire family ! Great authentic pizza."}
{"text":"Such delicious pizza! So fresh and tasty! Friendly staff, clean restaurant, and reasonable price. I love how they make the pizza right in front of you"}
{"text":"I called in my order as we were driving through Las Vegas, and it was ready by the time we arrived (within 30 mins). They were so friendly on the phone, and made the ordering effortless. We ordered a OMG! size pepperoni pizza and it was delicious! Wonderful experience overall!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the grilled rosemary lemonade, they give refills for a dollar less. Vegas meets Italy pizza is our favorite. They were nice in a takeout order to put the toppings in a separate container so the arugula wouldn't wilt. 

When we ate in the restaurant the pizza crust was so much more crispy... If you do carry out maybe put it in the oven a bit to toast up the crust."}
{"text":"My favorite pizzeria in NLV. A little bit pricy, but well worth it. The unique taste from the sourdough crispy really sets it apart from its peers."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Garlic rosemary knots are delicious and the \"Pork Reigns\" pizza is superb. Great staff who are friendly and attentive. There's a wall of chalk boards for the little ones and also a basket of toys to play with. I can't say enough about this place, it's SO good! Will most definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza this side of Las Vegas! I have not been in awhile. Came back today and they did not let me down."}
{"text":"I posted something very negative about Old School but within a few minutes of learning about the problem Gio contacted me and made it right.  In fact, he went over and above.

Still love this place and will still give them my business and promote them.  Thank you for straightening the issue out!"}
{"text":"Old School Pizzeria serves decent pizza but it's no where near the best pizza I've ever had. The restaurant is pretty small and the lines (at lunch time) long, but the friendly staff do enough to make your experience enjoyable.

We ordered an order of garlic knots and 2 of the OMG pizzas for a group of 6 guys and 3 girls and found that it was more than enough which was fine by us because who doesn't love leftovers?!

Food:
Garlic knots - Basically garlic bread sticks. These were very tasty and I found myself wanting the garlic knots more than the actual pizza itself. If you're a garlic lover like I am then these are a must-try.

Pork Reigns - The pork reigns was definitely my favorite out of the 3 pizza types we ordered (we went 1/2 and 1/2 on one of the pizzas). With pulled pork, calabrese, sausage, and bacon this meat monster is sure enough to satiate any cravings the hungry carnivore might have. The pork meats all had a pretty strong flavor which was definitely a good thing.

Calabrese - This pie contained calabrese, olivers, and hot peppers if I remember correctly. The peppers were definitely a nice addition and I wish that they were added to the pork reigns. Overall the calabrese had a much more balanced taste than the pork reigns so if you're trying to go lighter this is definitely my recommendation. 

Five Cheese Pesto - I didn't actually try this one but the general consensus was that it was tasty however the ricotta was heavy; maybe a little bit too heavy. 

One thing to note is that all of my toppings kept falling off. This might have been due to the fact that the pizza was still hot and the slices so big. I also felt that the crust was too bland and didn't give enough flavor.

Overall: If you're hungry in N. Vegas and craving pizza, give Old School Pizzeria a try."}
{"text":"One of the top pizza places on Vegas! Perfect to eat there then go to cannery. The pizza has been perfect every time we go there as well as the garlic knots"}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza at best, definitely over priced. Would go as far to say that Little Caesars pizza is better. Cashier was rude to top it all off. Overall pretty bad place to get pizza. DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!"}
{"text":"Here is my final update...got the second pizza and it was delicious! Fresh with a crisp crust. Glad we gave this place another try, might even turn into one of our regular spots."}
{"text":"Okay so there pizza was pretty good, however I could do with out the half gallon of extra grease atop the pizza. Here was my main issue with this place: RUDE, IGNORANT, COCKY staff. First time I ever tried this place I ordered for pickup on their janky messed up \"website\". I ordered a HALF pepperoni and HALF just cheese. I wrote it in the \"special request to the chef box\" When we went in to pick it up, opened up the box, pizza covered with pepperoni. I brought it to the manager/owner's attention, I said \"I special requested half and half on the website\", the man looks at me and simply says \"No you didn't.\" Like are you f**king kidding me, no I didn't? I could not believe the blatant rudeness and ignorance. So instead he gave me two jumbo slices of cheese pizza. Whatever. We decided to try again about a week later because it was late and we we're in the area, we walk in and one of the staff members that was there last time says \"Ahhh, back again I see\", in the cockiest voice and smirk on his dumb face. Idk why but it set me off so we haven't been back since. It doesn't matter how good a places' food is, customer service is everything to me, and if your going to be a d*ck then you lose my business period."}
{"text":"I called old school pizzeria and I wanted to order a Greek style pizza. You know one with tomatoes and black olives. Instead the guy told me that I was calling an Italian pizzeria and then hung up. Wow what service."}
{"text":"OMG!! So good!! The garlic rosemary bread knots are fantastic with just the right amount of garlicky rosemary oil and the ranch is the perfect kind of ranch. The kind that isn't too creamy or too dilly or too anything - just right.  And the pizza!! The pizza is out of control delicious! It gives Secret Pizza (at Cosmopolitan) a run for it's money!! The carnivore double slice sounds like a lot of meat (house made sausage, pepperoni, house made meatballs, Niman Ranch bacon, shredded chicken and ham), but there isn't too much of anything! Well, except pizza! The double slice was way too much for even me to eat. And I can eat!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Well it appears my first visit was just an aberration. I have gone back and got a pie for lunch with some co-workers and took note that they got the toppings just right this time! 

To flesh out my review a bit more this time I have to mention the nice sweet and fresh taste to the marinara. This time around I got sausage, pepperoni and Canadian bacon and it ended up as a real good mix of meaty flavors. 

A last note, their crust is very good, crispy outside and the perfect ooey gooey chewiness I crave in crust...add in the creamy dipping sauce and I was in food bliss all day long!

3/5 star previous with today's update of 5/5 should yield a 4/5 for me but OSP has tipped the balance of my opinion and I'm giving 5/5!"}
{"text":"So good.  New England style pizza. You won't find better. I will come here every time I am in Las Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"This place is authentic and delicious! It's small on the inside but makes up for it in amazing pizzas and salads plus a wine menu that compliments everything nicely. Definitely a casual spot and would be great for take out too."}
{"text":"Among the Jack in the Cracks and Mickey D's on this side of town, this is the best spot to dine-in and grab a bite. Pizza is what they do best, but they also have other specialties worth trying.

Old School Pizzeria is a tiny hole in the wall shop. Unless you're looking for it, you'll hardly notice it while driving on Craig. There are daily specials written on a chalkboard slate that hangs from the ceiling, and one entire chalkboard menu wall. So far I've eaten here twice, and I've enjoyed everything I've ordered. 

Bruschetta (4 pieces): Crunchy slices of bread topped with mozzarella and balsamic oven roasted cherry tomatoes.  

Calabrese Pizza: Really, really, awesome pizza with a spicy punch. Don't doubt the spicy power of this pie, it really does have a kick to it. The toppings are Mediterranean olives, cherry and banana peppers, salami, and mozzarella cheese. I'm not a fan of olives, so I substituted them with caramelized onions. The thin slices of salami were the best I've eaten, and the crust was thin and crunchy. We were also given a side of garlicky sauce to dip our slices into.

Cannoli: Tasty, but it was a little tough to eat because it was hard to bite into.

Service - The service is quick and personable, but they do get a little annoyed if you want to swap out or omit pizza toppings -- I guess I can understand, considering how the pizzas are their masterpieces. 

Overall - In short, it's the best spot to eat at on this side of town."}
{"text":"We recently moved to this side of town, and for the whole have been disappointed by the dining in this area,  This hands down is the best pizza I have had in a very long time and is one of the saving graces to moving."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this places for a few years now, amazing quality pizza at a price that can be justified by the flavor and the atmosphere. The staff is friendly, always top notch service. It gets pretty busy at times, you may have to order to go if there is no seating space. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fair pizza. Good crust but they did not put much toppings on. Asked for green peppers and had three small pieces on a monster slice."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Chef Gio gave us personalized service and talked to us about the art of pizza making. He made his dough right in front of us using fresh, all-natural ingredients. The garlic rosemary knots were a perfect prelude to an amazing carnivore pizza. We concluded with the cannoli--one of the best I have had. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars. The place is cozy. It has a small leather sofa to sit on. Only no table to rest your plate or drink. The guy who helped me was great! 
Only problem and it's not a problem is its kinda pricey. 11 bucks with tip for 2 slices and soda. I got onion and pineapple toppings but still. However very very good pizza. 
I also tried a couple rosemary garlic knots. Very very good.  The pizza definitely reminded of good ole NY pizza. I like when you fold it the bottom lips \"falls down\". The passion ice tea,unsweetened, was delicious. I really did enjoy my pizza and if I'm in the area again I will go back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Actually I wanted to love it. Seeing all the reviews for this place I new I had to try it. I didn't think the pictures looked appetizing but with 4 and 5 star reviews I wanted to taste the pizza and judge that myself. 

I started out with a \"Side Antipasto Salad\". It was very fairly priced at just $3.49 and came served on a plate that was annoyingly too big but it tasted good. Nothing wow about it but good. 

For the pizza I was impressed that it is made to order right in front of you. I wasn't however impressed with the taste. I ordered a 18 inch \"1/2 Pepperoni & 1/2 Sausage pizza. When the pizza was brought to the table it was covered in grease. I used several napkins to mop what I could up. The first 2 bites I enjoyed the crust but after that it was just a greasy soggy mess. The pizza wasn't worth $17.49. I would like to give this place another try some other time since there was a sandwich that sounded interestingly good. I'm just not itching to get back too soon. 

They also offer calzones, sandwiches, chicken, pasta and desserts. If you have a large group then you should check out their family meal deals. Also that have a \"Monster Slice\" that is well, *monstrous*.  You can get the monster slices individually if you don't feel like a whole pizza or are just stopping by for lunch then you can combo it with a drink. Orders can also be placed online."}
{"text":"I came here because word of mouth. I ordered a Half order of garlic knots, a large pizza topped with sausage and mushrooms, and an order of the sausage stuffed chicken wing. I also tried the grilled rosemary lemonade that came with in a mason jar. The garlic knots was perfect with a flavor of rosemary. Next time I'll order a full order. The pizza tasted delicious And fresh. The cheese was superb. I also loved that there were puzzles, toys, and a chalk board for my two little girls to play with so it was very family friendly. Great eatery and will have to come back for more!"}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD! It can be a little bit expensive if you add a lot of toppings to your pizza but honestly the quality of the food is good that I really can't complain. We got a specialty pizza in the \"OMG\" size which was a LOT of food - our hunger was no longer a thing! They also sell home-brewed tea (which you can get a discount on if you bring in your own Mason jar). 

The vibe and atmosphere is also very nice and the size of the restaurant (while very small) helps to create a very intimate atmosphere and a closeness between the customer and staff. Definitely a place we will come back to in the future!"}
{"text":"I find myself gravitating towards the pork reigns specialty pizza.  Sometimes dough can be undone but nothing a little oven time can't fix at home.  The owner/manager is awesome, he REALLY cares about his customers and product he's putting out. The garlic knots I do find myself unable to share with anyone else but myself.  Plan on going back as long as I live in the area."}
{"text":"First off: I don't like pizza. I was a delivery driver for a year and that turned me off to most pizzas forever. I hate going out to pizza places because they all taste the same to me. 
So how did I end up going to Old School? It was not by choice, but I'm SO glad I happened to try it by chance. Their pizza absolutely does not taste \"the same\" as any other pizza place I've ever tried. The number one complaint I have about pizza joints is the crust. Well, Old School makes their crust themselves and it is perfectly balanced: crispy, light, flavorful, a hint of sourdough. 
I had the veggie monster slice and Gio's salad. The veggie was filling, healthy, and the best part was that the variety of toppings made every bite slightly different, yet no ingredients ever clashed with each other. 
Gio's salad was similar to a caprese but the addition of fennel elevated it to a complex level. I added just a tad of the garlic mascarpone sauce, but the salad hardly needed any help.
My dining companion and I both strongly agreed that we will be going back to Old School soon... which is quite a shock for me, since I don't like pizza!"}
{"text":"Service is the BEST. A hidden GEM! The food is amazing! This'll be the third time I've dined with Old School and they never disappoint. 

I see this establishment growing and expanding as long as your service stays the same. 

We had the garlic Rosemary bread knots which were delicious; the Calabrese delighted our senses shortly after. 

Keep up the great work Old School Pizzeria!!"}
{"text":"Giovanni Mauro is a man with passion for his pizza, and you know Las Vegas is very fortunate to have him when he has followers from New York, Philly, and California wishing that he was closer to them....If you read the other reviews, I'm just the second Yelp Las Vegas reviewer....

I am pretty sure many of you have already tasted Chef Gio's cooking already but don't even know it...Does
Nora's/Nora's Wine Bar ring a bell??? Yes, Chef Gio is Nora's son, and we were very surprised he recognized us from our few visits to Nora's(Crazy Alfredo....YUM!!!!)

You can get Pasta, Salads. Paninis and Appetizers here, but  to come here and not order a pizza is a crime!

His pizzas come in 3 sizes-Large(14\"), XL(18\"), and OMG!(24\") He has a few speciality pizzas, or you can customize your own. We got a  half classic combo, and half pork rules pizza(see pictures of menu items ) which was absolutely delicious! You can even chat with Gio as he makes your pizza right in front of you. He makes his pizzas the old school way by not using any commercial yeast in his dough,( it's better for you, easier to digest, and you don't feel bloated after eating his pizzas) and it goes through a 36-hour natural leavening process before it is ready. When he's out, he's out, and you have to come back another time.

Another thing to save room for is his desserts. Cannolis($1.99 each or 3 for $5)
Crisp, light , delicate, and the ricotta filling has the perfect sweetness.(\"better than my mom's\", Gio says) he also makes gelato when he has the time, and we couldn't have come at a better time. His flavor of the day? Nutella :) at $.75/ounce or $1.90 a scoop, it was definitely worth the calories! Unfortunately, they ran out of tiramisu, but
that's a good reason for a return visit!

Before you go:

Old School Pizzeria is located acroos the Cannery Casino, next to the Metro PCS Store, cross streets are Craig and Lawrence

Cash Only....

Thank you Gio and Diego, we will definitely be back....ALOHA!!!


YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(116/365) \"Old School Pie\""}
{"text":"We came here so excited to have the same amazing experience we have had in the past. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!! We walked in to not being greeted then by a nasty attitude female employee we found out that they no longer offered family meals.  Sad, but no biggie. My daughter grabbed a mason jar of lemonade that was in a bin in front of this \"nasty\" employee and sat down to look at the menu. My daughter then says her lemonade tastes weird. Initially my daughter tried to talk to this horrible woman but was blown off. So when my husband tried to explain that she didn't know it was rosemary lemonade and that our daughter did not like it we once again were answered by a nasty attitude in response.  My husband then asked to exchange it for something else and was responded to with a bothered tone telling him \"well\". Due to the obnoxiously nasty employee we paid for a lemonade we returned and are back on yelp trying to find a place to eat. No recommendations for this place anymore. Very sad, but one employee ruined  Old School Pizza for us."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Pizza place I have ever tried, feels like you eating homemade Pizza, screw Pizza Hut and all. this place can't be compared.."}
{"text":"Five Cheese Mac was the Pasta special of the day and was a pasta truly worthy of praise."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review maybe a week after my visit,  so apologies if it isn't very detailed. Their pizza is DELICIOUS. My friend and I ordered they're biggest pizza (OMG size) with cannolis and idk which I liked better. Usually I'm disappointed when I get cannolis from pizzerias but these were the best I've ever had. The storefront is beautiful and has a real pizzeria vibe. Their tropical tea is great as well! I'm surprised I've never tried this place or heard of it before! I'll definitely be going back to try other items on the menu (and of course, more pizza)."}
{"text":"Yes!! Very delicious authentic pizza! Didn't venture outside of the regular toppings. But was very happy with the pepperoni, pineapples, and extra sauce. And the garlic knots are addicting! A side of their special creamy dipping sauce makes it so flavorful. 
Finally a great local pizzeria that is not downtown or far west side! The ambiance is cozy and clean with an enjoyable New York kind of style. Went home with leftovers and an order of tasty canolis. We will be regulars - for sure."}
{"text":"Such a surprise! We took the \"Vegas Meets Italy\" and it was a great flavor profile we've never had. The sourdough crust was a nice thickness and had a good crunch. The extra cheese was the way to go and the dates added an extra texture. This chef definitely knows his stuff. The staff was also very friendly. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here after the movies across the street from Canery. Came around dinner time and it was busy, which means it's a good sign that this pizza place might be good.

Ordered a large pizza which is half carnivore and other half was vegetarian. The toppings were excellent! The dough was pretty good, just way too much crust and was little soggy in the bottom."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good.  Dough is light, crispy and yet still chewy. The stuffed chicken is really good. I'd go back just for the chicken alone. It's a very unique dish. Awesome service and prices are right on."}
{"text":"I'm a 17 year old girl who is turning 18 in two weeks. So I do know my pizza! Haha. I've been living in the area for many years now and I've always wanted to eat there. It seems like a very cute spot to eat! (which it is). My boyfriend and I decided to just eat at the restaurant. It seemed like a small coffee shop atmosphere. The workers were friendly. My only negative comment would be that the soda was quite flat. I don't know if it was the soda machine but it was just eh.

The pizza was INCREDIBLE! SO YUMMY! So rich in flavors! We ordered a large \"carnivore\" pizza with mushrooms and spinach. The total was about 35$. Quite expensive but TOTALLY worth it! I will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"I could only eat 2 of their \"monster\" slices.  These people care about pizza.  The ingredients were awesome.  The service was authentic.  Finally, they've got seating where you can eat and watch them make the dough and prep the pizza.  It was decently priced."}
{"text":"I love this place! The crust is so flavorful... Huge pizza by the slice and only .40 cents a topping I always get the meatball!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Vegas!!! All fresh ingredients dough is made overnight with traditional yeast.  We had a small 14\" that was perfect for 2 people with Homemade sausage and meatballs on top and it was amazing. The service was also top notch. You order and pay at the counter yet the waiter checked up on us more often then most places. If your looking for a great pizza place in Las Vegas this is the place."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious! Love the ranch! We're nice and full. Taking home leftovers. Kids loved it! We will be back."}
{"text":"Old School is my favorite restaurant on the Craig Rd corridor and makes the best pizza in the entire Vegas Valley. It's a great spot for a quick lunch, especially if you're at Nellis AFB. 

Chef Gio's crust is a superb sourdough base with the perfect mix of crunch and chew. He has a very creative mix of speciality pizzas or you can create your own. I love how you can see the \"magic\" happening on the pizza line through the plexiglass. I've also had the Crazy Good Chicken which lived up to its name; it's one of the most delightful chicken dishes I've ever had. The braised ox tail special (on Saturdays) is out of sight, the tenderest meat you've ever had. 

All in all, if you stop here once, you'll come back. It's a hidden gem in North Las Vegas, less hidden now that Yelpers are on to Chef Gio's genius. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! ! I love finding something fresh n delicious. . I watched him pick the basil for my pizza.. the customer service just as efficient!  My new favorite pizza spot!! Fresh everything. . Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!
Great garlic knots and handmade pizza dough! One of the best pizza places in Vegas"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Cali where I thought my local pizzeria was bomb, but I stand corrected and thankfully so!!! And it's only 5 mins from our new home! I will very quickly become a regular, he'll I've already been twice in a 2-day period 

Everything is super fresh and the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. I mean really, really transcendently amazingly perfect pizza. The chefs here cure their own sausages, make their dough using sourdough starter, and offers daily specials as diverse as Mac n' Cheese and Octopus, you know you are either in for a real treat or an overhyped hipster experience. Luckily, this place is a treat from the get-go. Unpretentious, the efforts are focused entirely on the food. And the efforts are well rewarded. The slice of Pork Reigns pizza I had was an epiphany.

And then we came back for a second visit. We split an antipasto salad, and I had the Crazy Good Chicken (dark), while the wife had the daily special Mac n' Cheese. Wow. Just wow. Drive across town. Come in from another state. It's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"So yummy!  The antipasto salad, regular, sits on the most amazing tasting roasted roll!"}
{"text":"Ok, well, clearly I should have tried the chicken. If I was still in the area, I definitely would, it sounds scrumptious and that's even without the reviews here, just looking at the piks.  But, for whatever reason, I didn't, I ordered a \"small\" pizza with meatballs, $14.05.  Gotta say, it was not very appetizing.  The crust was burnt, and the \"meatballs\" were uh, interesting--are they suppose to be flat and a thickness of a half dollar (and just looking at them, the texture doesn't exactly start the juices running)?  Neither the pizza itself, nor the meatballs, were very tasty.  Wouldn't order the pizza again, but if I happened to be back up in that area, would definitely try the chicken.  Just wish I had done so, instead of that pizza.  Suddenly Papa John's (I know, I know) is beginning to sound good.  Sigh.  I miss that $14.05. Sniff."}
{"text":"Wow, couldn't decide where to eat and we yelped this place. WELL worth the stop. They're not kidding about having \"monster slices\" of pizza. We had ours cut in half and shared. Garlic knots...if Rosemary is your thing than these are AMAZING! And we topped it off with some of their cannolis...never had one but good lord was it yummy!!!"}
{"text":"A little slice of comfort. Plus some (the cannoli).

Honestly, I didn't expect much when my friend invited me to this small place off Craig Road in front of the Cannery.  And I didn't really expect much once I entered either.  But looking at the menu, I saw that this little pizzeria had character.  Yeah, topics are 50 cents more on a slice (monster slice is gigantic by the way) and a dollar more for full pizzas, but quality definitely compensates.  I was about to get two monster slices (the only slices available), but the cashier advised me that people usually can barely finish one.  Skeptical at first, he was right.  I ordered the carnivore pizza with pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, bacon, ham, and chicken and I could barely finish the crust.  Be sure to get the altered ranch dipping sauce, which is a bit more watery than usual, but certainly an unassumingly amazing complement to any pizza crust.  Aside from pizza, they also have other Italian offerings dependent on the day.

Service was exceptional. It looked like the place was running only under two people. Granted, it's a small place, seating only about 15 - 20 or so, but it was always packed during the dinner time (stayed there about 2.5 hours talking to a friend).  Environment isn't too interesting-pretty plain. But the personalities of the employees really make the place.  One of the guys there was the owner, co-founder of Nora's Italian in Vegas on Flamingo.  He really keeps the Italian spirit alive, making sure the customers are enjoying their food and their experience overall.  Music was chill, a great kick-back from the long work day. There was a small tv showing the news.  All in all, with two staff up front, the place handled itself pretty well. 

Advice: Probably wouldn't come here for a formal, classy date, but would come here any other day.  Service was excellent and comforting, giving me that local business feeling you rarely see here in Vegas.  Food was mouth watering (honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten with the best crust I've ever had).  Price point-rationale.  Come!  I wasn't about to get the cannoli because the guy at the counter said it would take 30 minutes to make, but my friend and I ended up staying past that time anyways, and the place gave us two on the house.  Crisp, sweet outer shell and a hazel-nutty, cinnamon-ny filling creating a churro-like taste. Pretty satisfying end to the meal."}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed pizza critic from NYC, this was one of the most delish slices of 'za I've ever had. It was hot, cheesy, and flavorful. The crust was the most perfect combination of crusty and doughy. It's worth driving four hours from LA to get a banging pie."}
{"text":"Lived on this side of town for a few years now and just tried OSP if you live around here stop denying yourself the best pizza in vegas"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! The ingredients are fresh and everything is made in that kitchen, not brought in already prepped. I go here whenever I have a pizza craving. Staff is so nice and friendly. Love the atmosphere too. Recommend this place to everyone I meet."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in Vegas. Huge fan of sourdough. The ingredients are all high quality and fresh. 10/10 would recommend. I've had only positive interactions with the staff and the restaurant is modest and clean."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas.

Why? The pizza is fantastic. The crust is delicious and the dough is handmade in house. The sauce is also homemade and is different than any other pizza sauce I've had in this city. It tastes like exactly like fresh tomatoes. I'm having a hard time trying to describe just how much I love this pizza (and am getting seriously hungry in the process).

The grilled rosemary lemonade is out of this world, and the white sauce that they serve with the garlic knots is also something to try. (Get it. Fall in love. Dip everything in it. Take home as much as you can.)

The service is always great, the people behind the counter are friendly, fast, and seem to enjoy what they're doing. While this is definitely a tiny, hole-in-the-wall place in a kind of strange location for the fantastic things they're doing with pizza, the ambiance inside is cute. They play a lot of Frank Sinatra and it has good lighting. Not bad. 

I need to move closer to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Exceeded our expectations.  Instead of the predictable pizzeria fare, we dined on a gourmet-style of pizza and accompaniments.  My husband especially loved the stuffed chicken.  The pizza was excellent, particularly the sauce.  The rosemary infused knotted bread was exceptional, too, and a unique take on traditional pizzeria fare.  The only disappointing item was the cannoli.  The filling was somewhat sweet, but plain.  The addition of chopped pistachios wasn't enough flavor.  Still, it wasn't bad, but we had higher expectations after tasting the other dishes.  I highly recommend this place for casual dining or takeout.  The quality and unique style of their dishes took us pleasantly by surprise."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten here. Today I ordered a small classic combo. It was delicious the pizzas are generously sized the topping ingredients are of top quality. The service was fast and very friendly. The dining area is immaculate. The staff makes all customers feel welcome. Old School is the perfect neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"This is the real deal Italian restaurant with real Italians, more than pizza! I do love their pizza too get it by slice (huge) good deal! Chicken is so good with roasted garlic potatoes, and macaroni & cheese is the best in Vegas! It is always hard to find a place with good salad, but they put this amazing aged cheese on their salad you can really taste difference. Good Eats!"}
{"text":"Review yesterday was ambiguous so here's a clarification... Pizza and service was excellent... Fresh toppings and can see most of kitchen which is clean.... Have had garlic knots and the octopus salad (both great)...however this is not the \"cheap pizza night\" place...it is definitely worth the money and a great dinner...but u get what u pay for here...2 large pizzas was $60..."}
{"text":"Something different than those commercial pizzas; Pizzahut, Papa Johns etc. Anyways this was our first time trying this and wow, this put our perspective of pizza to a whole new level. Cannoli was amazing as well. Enough said, just get your tail here and try them yourselves."}
{"text":"5 stars isn't enough to properly rate this amazingly, delicious pizza! My family had the Carnivore OMG size and the garlic knots. The pizza crust was super good, crispy on the bottom and cooked perfectly. There were whole slices of bacon on this pizza! Great ratio of sauce and cheese. This will definitely be our go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"OMG.  Authentic, Italian style pizza.  This place is incredible- even better than the pizza I had in Italy! I ordered a slice of the veggie- fresh heirloom tomatoes, kalamata olives, spinach, and giant cloves of garlic. Had that perfect thin, crunchy crust that I Love so very much. $8 for the slice but HUGE and well worth it! Great service and incredibly fresh ingredients.  

This is the best pizza i've ever had.  Without a doubt...I will most definitely be back very soon! Can't wait to try their salads."}
{"text":"Real sourdough crust, crispy on the outside fluffy and airy on the inside, fresh toppings, homemade sauce, whole Mediterranean olives, fresh roasted garlic, I'm in HEAVEN! I live in Henderson, and I'd gladly drive out here to eat this pizza again, any day of the week!"}
{"text":"The pies and salads are delicious and I appreciate that the ingredients are fresh. In addition, each order is prepared when ordered and not just sitting around getting stale and old. However this poses a problem when the place is packed. Last time we went in each table was full and there was a line going out the door. The tables were dirty, silverware, lids and condiments were un-stocked and it took almost a half hour to even receive our salad. They were overwhelmed and short-staffed and it showed.

I must say that I've noticed a change since the first time we dined in about six months ago. At that time the owner was still cooking and it seemed as though there was more attention to detail. As long as the food remains delish, we will continue to choose them over any other local pizzeria. Let's keep our fingers crossed; North Las Vegas has been lacking in the good food arena for way too long."}
{"text":"A friend raved about this place and I can see why .. Very quaint and charming restaurant with pretty good food .. Let's start with the side salads ... Good lettuce to dressing ratio .. Not too soggy and pretty tasty .. We ordered the build your own pizza with pepperoni bacon and mushroom .. Small is enough to feed 3 people easily .. My only problem was the dough was very .. Doughy if that makes sense I'm typically a thin crust girl so it felt a little extra on the dough side and a little easy on the cheese side but overall a good taste .. The lemonade is to die for and they serve it in large mason jars ... The only thing I would do different is to maybe order my pizza well done .. And extra cheese otherwise a pretty solid place .."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place.    I kinda feel bad though, cuz I rushed them to get our cannoli order on the way out.  I didn't realize they had to make it,  most places have the cannoli ready to go.  A bunch of Air Force guys were in there and we thought we'd have to wait for them to get all their orders before we could get our dessert that we ordered to go.   Kudos to the staff for being friendly when I was rushing them."}
{"text":"The stars are for the cannoli. Which is amazing and the ONLY reason you should come here. Though the crust was good the pizza itself had little to no flavor. A big MEH. Salad--also flavorless."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with the most amazing live cultured crust. Their salads are different and superb! Their specials- like the stuffed chicken with pistachio crust are soooo good! I even ordered a whole pizza once to take on the plane with me for a gift. It's that good!"}
{"text":"Oh wow, this pizza is incredible. Hands down, the best in NLV. Top ten in the city- and it has a chic, nicely designed dining room. The kind of place u would actually want to go on a date or with friends. Ambient and cool. The menu is impressive- it hints to what will be an experience where people who actually care and have tastes are making your pie. I am getting wordy here, but trust me the salad was fresh and not prebagged greens. No shortcuts. The dressing also was delicious and the crust of the pizza..., perfect! Also, the guys and lady who run the place are welcoming and clearly take pride in their food.  Great vibe, nice ambience, kick-ass pizza."}
{"text":"So i came one afternoon to see how good the food was the a/c didnt work in there so i took the food to go had got pizza by the slice for me and my sister and it just didnt seem very cheesy or saucey we got hawaian i guess when u order by the slice they just cut off a slice of cheese pizza and add ham n pinapple stick it back into the oven i was ok, i wil have to try this place again to try the cannolis and maybe a whole pizza as of now its not my top pizza spot."}
{"text":"I came in once and had a plethora of things.

Vegas meets Italy is, hands down, my favorite pizza. A little sweetness, a little saltiness, and a little peppery flavor from the arugula. And hidden gems of crunch from the pistachios? All my favorite things in one! Don't be fooled by dates in your food. SO GOOD. 

Also tried the Pork Reigns pizza. Definitely a kind of pizza to hip your carnivorous friends too! Delectably meaty! 

You can't go wrong with the burrata and caponata bruschetta. If you LOVE eggplant, this is a must order. Burrata cheese just melts in your mouth. How do you NOT enjoy it? I can order this and eat this with a sausage stuffed wing for my lunch. 

Now the sausage stuffed chicken wing? Topped with pistachios! Nom nom nom nom. Need I say more?!?!"}
{"text":"Back for a second round with the boys at old school. It has been a few weeks since my last visit but they remembered me the moment I walked in. I love the product and I love the service. This time I ordered the Chicken, mushroom and spinach pizza absolutely amazing!

My whole family gets excited when I come home with one of these gigantic pies. The pizza dough/crust is amazing I love it. I have seen some talk about the toppings and some don't seem happy with the pepperoni/sausage choice. Generally I find pepperoni to be greasy by the nature of the product which is one of the reasons I have stop eating. 

However I have to say love the fresh nature of there products and I am really a fan!"}
{"text":"This really is a North Las Vegas gem! I got the solo meal (pizza with half an order or garlic knots) and it was absolutely delicious. My mom had the salad which had fresh mozzarella. The atmosphere is absolutely wonderful and the old school music really sets the tone. The staff is friendly and the pizza is huge. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"5  awesome customer serves! Sample the tea and lemonade, was very refreshing to drink on this hot day. Thought I was back east. The pizza was delicious. I will be back"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious cannoli's, great pizza crust!  Place is a little small and it gets busy."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner at around 7pm on Christmas Eve.  It was the only non-chain place we could find open on the North side of town. We were soooo glad we found it!

For three of us, we ordered the large Gio salad ($8.99) and a large pizza ($20.75) with one half caramelized onions and roasted bell peppers and the other half house-made sausage and black olives.

The salad was absolutely yummy, and the perfect appetizer before pizza.  The Gio consists of Tomato, fennel, cucumber, onion, fresh mozzarella and a very good house-made vinaigrette.  I've never had a salad quite like it.  It was very fresh, and a wonderful combination of flavors.  I could have eaten a large one of these myself and just called it a night.

On to the pizza.  I don't usually gush about pizza, but I feel obliged to make an exception.  This pie is really special.  First, the crust is absolutely the best I've ever tasted.  It's a sourdough recipe and cooked to absolute perfection.  It's light, fluffy and wonderfully crispy in all the right places with just the right amount of chewiness.  The toppings were sublime.  I'm a vegetarian, but I snuck a little bite of the house-made sausage and it was quite superb.  The caramelized onions and roasted peppers were extremely flavorful.  The olives and fresh mozzarella were very high quality.

Service was excellent.  The man we ordered from was very friendly.  Salad arrived within just a few minutes and the pizza very soon after we finished the salad.  Price was very good for this high quality food.  Total for 3 was $36.97 including tax and tip.  They use Square for checkout, so you get a nice emailed receipt within seconds of purchase.

We arrived very hungry, and the salad and the large pizza provided us with plenty of food.  You could probably stretch it to four people and you'd have room for dessert.

This is an excellent little place to get some seriously high quality pie.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  If we're ever back in Vegas, we'll be sure to stop by.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"So on a trip back from Utah our group was starving and needed a fast food place to stop in. Well we found old school pizza and decided to stop here. Walking up to the business we almost thought it was closed but when we opened their main door we were surprised to see one of the nicest decorated pizza joints around. This was was great and I would highly recommend if you are in the area. 

Their pizza here took me back to Italy easily, everything seems freshly made plus the slices are jinormous and one could be enough, however I ate two on my own. They make few teas and drinks that are in jars and are super tasty as well. The staff is really nice and helpful as well. Don't expect super fast service as they make everything fresh and fresh means time making it. 

They may need to do some work on the outside sign because it does not match the amazing food and atmosphere inside. I will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I would say this is very good in comparison to chains and other pizzerias, however it didn't quite hit the mark for me. The crust is perfect and the sauce is nice and sweet, however the pizza was overloaded with toppings (compared to true Italian pizza) and I found that the cheese didn't compliment the sauce well. The garlic knots and dipping sauce were very good though. 
The space itself is nice and the service was good."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Love the ordering system online very thorough it sends you a text confirming your order is being made and then one when your food is ready. The garlic marscapone sauce was great for dipping. Although I thought the pizza was great I still have had some better pies... I'm biased because I've spent a lifetime in NY not to mention our pizza is so much cheaper."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! From Rosemary infused lemonade, garlic Rosemary knots, Gio fennel salad and not to mention the bomb pizza, this place is the one of my favorite pizza places in Las Vegas. I highly recommend it everything is excellent. If you live anywhere in the valley or your visiting please stop in. You order at the counter the service is friendly. I will warn they get busy so it may take during the peak hour a short while to get a table if you're dining in but that's just because it's that awesome."}
{"text":"What a nice friendly atmosphere.  Loved being greated with an authentic Italian \"How you doing today?\"

The pizza was pretty good except for the crust.  It was tough to chew.  I'm hoping that was just a fluke and will give it another try.

I would suggest they get a merchant account so they can take credit cards at the register.  It's inconvenient, not to mention an addtional fee, to use the ATM...even if it's in house."}
{"text":"We placed our order online and the pizza was just coming out of the oven when we arrived. It was incredibly fresh. The salad dressing is very tasty and the cannoli is amazing. I'm not a fan of the usual chocolate chips on cannoli so this order made me very happy. Perhaps it was the hint of cinnamon that made it so yummy. I'm not sure but I'll definitely be back for that cannoli!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food. Homemade sauce and they're homemade lemonade with iced tea was amazing. Definitely recommend if you love pizza and also the wine is delicious!!! Very friendly staff. Perfect to take the family"}
{"text":"Gio and co. were amazing to us tonight! We had a group that literally filled the restaurant, and they were fantastic. Everything we tried was exceptional. The standouts for me were the Vegas to Italy pizza, the chicken and potatoes and the ziti. I can't say enough about that ziti!  I thought the hard boiled eggs would make it taste weird, but it was super! I also can't say enough about the atmosphere and the service. Definitely 5 stars on all fronts."}
{"text":"I've had this bookmarked since my last visit here for Thanksgiving. So I definitely had to check it out!! 

Walking in the place is smaller than I expected, but the cashier was very nice when we approached. We already knew what we wanted from Yelp pics. We ordered the small sausage/pepperoni, stuffed wings, & garlic Knots. 

Took about 5 mins for the garlic Knots which were tasty, fresh & hot. I don't think I liked the garnish on the knots tho (not sure the name of what that stuff was, but it thru the taste off). Stuffed wings came out next, they were fresh & hot too. We didn't enjoy them. The sausage it was stuffed with wasn't good. It was different & I'm glad I tried it. Then the pizza came out. I 4got to tell them well done so it wasn't as done as we like, but that was my fault. Pizza was piping hot, extra sauced. GOOD PIZZA!!!! 

Place isn't 5 stars, but with the good service & good pizza they're worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars, but I like to see local businesses doing well (especially in North Vegas), so I'm bumping up to 5.
First of all, the place is pretty tiny; we brought a group of 7 for lunch and almost took over the whole joint. The ambiance is total local pizza place, and I give them bonus points for having cute riddles up on the chalkboard walls. Answer correctly and get a free cannoli!
The older lady up front was friendly taking my order, but not the quickest. A couple minutes later, Chef Gio (I assume) came up from the back and was much more efficient.
Of course, the main reason I'm giving this place high marks is because of the pizza - the crust was really good, thin chewy sourdough, and they have an excellent selection of toppings to go with the tomato-y sauce and mozzarella cheese. The slices are not premade, so you can get any toppings you want. I got the chef's special 'Calabrese' - calabrese salami, banana peppers, black olives. Yum! Plus, the slices are HUGE, so one totally filled me up. I added a side salad and a drink, and the total came up to a reasonable $7 (which I paid via CREDIT CARD on the ipad at the counter!).
Others in my group ordered the baked ziti, which I didn't sample, but looked really good and cheesy (minus points because it had peas in it - ew) and the meatball sandwich, which looked awesome and huge. We did not get the garlic knots, which seem popular in the rest of the reviews...next time!
Overall, thank you, Old School Pizzeria, for bringing some local flavor to the land of chains!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a bazillion times since they opened and never stopped in... for some reason the name never drew me in. So yesterday I came home from work and my hubby told me there were leftovers in the fridge from the pizza place on the corner. Cool, I was hungry, and leftover pizza is always a good thing. I pulled it out, threw on the toaster oven, warmed it up, and (insert singing angels and trumpets blazing) IT. WAS. GLORIOUS. The sauce that came with the amazing garlic knots (with chunks of roasted garlic cloves!!!!) was better than a boring Ranch that I expected. The pizza.... the crust was actually flavorful, not just your typical white flour muck the big chains use. Almost like a sourdough. Amazing. The sauce was thick and also flavorful which was refreshing in itself. And the big chunks of, what was it, basil? that I found on occasion really sent my taste buds into ecstasy. And don't get me started on the meatball and sausage slices. I'll be here forever!! Why oh WHY haven't I ordered from you guys sooner???!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I've driven past this place for years and finally stopped.  The pizza is off the charts.  The bread is among the best artisan bread I have ever had.  The lemonade is very interesting and not like any lemonade I have ever had.  A small pizza fed three.  Prices are not bad.  A little high or pizza, but the quality makes up for it.  Toppings are also gourmet.  The cost of salads and sides is reasonable.  I'm going back as soon as I can.

If you are the sort of person who thinks Little Ceasars makes good pizza this might not be the place for you, but if you can tell a quality crust from a frozen crust you will like it.  I've had some high end pizza in my life and I'd put this place against any of them.  A real gem for North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Old School Pizzeria has won my heart a couple of years ago, but not for their pizza.  Their Crazy Good Chicken is just that, crazy good.  This meal comes with two thick and juicy pieces of baked chicken (roughly 8 oz.), big chunks of potato, and stuffing. Butter and olive oils is then drenched all over it.  It's crazy thinking about how good this chicken is. Where else can you get chicken this good at a pizzeria?  So far, only here. If chicken at a pizzeria is not your thing, then get a pizza.  Each slice is huge, especially their Monster Slice at $4.00.  Toppings will cost you an additional $.40.  Their pizzas remind me of an old school giant pizza that you'll find in the streets of New York City.  In my opinion, I think Old School is better.  You can't have a meal here without trying their Rosemary Garlic Knots.  6 knots cost about $3 or $7.99 with a Monster Slice.  

The service is always great.  There's usually a line at Old School Pizzeria and it's mostly for take-out.  Keep in mind that Old School is very popular and it takes time to prep a pizza and even longer to bake their Crazy Good Chicken.  

Prices:
Crazy Good Chicken - $11.99 
Monster slice (little over $4 - $.40 additional toppings)
Small Pizza (serves 2-3) - $11.99
Large (serves 3-4) - $16.75
OMG (serves 5-8) - $24.99
Calzones (serves 1-2) - $8.99
Five Cheese Mac - $12.50
Meatball Sandwich - $10.00
Monster Slice & Half Order of Bread Knots - $7.99

Overall, I recommend Old School for their pizza and of course, their chicken. 

2017 Yelp Review #83"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get thin crust pizza close to home. I love their super fresh ingredients and choices. I haven't had anything here I didn't like. Their dressing is delicious and so are their cannolis. I would highly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"What a treat!!!!  I have to give this place as many exclamation points as stars.  This is the best part of living in this neighborhood.  From the artisanal pizza to the irresistible cannolis to the Rosemary infused lemonade, this pizzeria elevates everyday food.  They have something for all taste buds.  It is a must on your Las Vegas foodie list.  Worth the drive."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place, the service is wonderful from the moment you walk in the door. The ambience is wonderful and quiet , it small but that's good because it gives it a homier feel & Let me tell you this is the best pizza I have EVVVVVVER eaten in my life. This is the one place my fiancé and I call at least once a week! If your ever in Vegas please try it you will not be disappointed (or don't, just more for me!"}
{"text":"Solid service! Delicious pizza! The young Hispanic kid at the cashier is an ultimate gentleman and scholar. Very very nice guy and clean place"}
{"text":"Hands down, BEST PIZZA IN LAS VEGAS. If you like New York style pizza, then you'll absolutely love this place. I saw some negative reviews, and I honestly don't understand how someone could not like this place. (they must be the type that thinks frozen home pizza is the best, LOL) Since I tried Old School, I can never enjoy a pizza from anywhere else. I'm always disappointed and think \"I wish I had Old School instead\". Unfortunately I no longer live close enough to get it as often as I use to. Hopefully sometime in the future Old School will have a chain, one of the locations being in the Centennial Hills area. HAHA, I know unlikely, but a girl can dream right? ;D"}
{"text":"Seriously this place does not mess around when it comes to great pizza. This is pizza to be savored. The best pizza I have ever had. It was a really great atmosphere, kinda romantic for mine and hubbies date night. The guy making our pizza was super friendly man can he make a good pizza. Totally worth your time and money, very delicious."}
{"text":"If you are looking for pizza that's delicious and more on the gourmet side then this is the place for you! The seating are is very clean and looks friendly and cozy. I like that you can see them making your food and that everything is fresh and tasty. You can tell they take time putting thought into their menu and it shows. I will go there many more times and encourage everyone to try them out. Their side salads  with garlic creamy dressing are wonderful because they aren't just bagged salad. Their pizza by the slice is like NYC pizza and customizable."}
{"text":"Living in Vegas for 3 months now, thought it was a pizza wasteland  Until we walked into Old School Pizza. Best pizza my wife and I have had in years. My wife almost cried because it reminded her of her Italian  grandmothers cooking. Thank you Old School!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try one evening when I was hanging out with some friends.

I ordered the Regina Margherita and I liked the very thin crust on it, but it was definitely lacking some serious flavor. 

I normally don't add any condiments to my pizza, but after eating this I quickly realized that it needed way more salt or some kind of seasoning to liven things up.

Overall this was not the worst pizza I've had, but it was not the best either. In all honesty I was a little bummed out to taste pizza that was pretty much flavorless. 

This experience won't deter me from giving this joint another try and next time I'll make sure to try something entirely different."}
{"text":"Old School has great pizza the sour dough crust and home made rosemary lemonade is addicting. The customer service is unbelievable, fast if you are not sure of what you want just tell the chef and he will tell what your having, I love it. The garlic knots and the crazy chicken are to die for...  I have sent many of guest to this palace of pizza. All who come from California and New York they agree with the great flavors and authentic yummy goodness.... Keep up the great work guys chef gio is the best..."}
{"text":"We were in the area at our favorite movie theater across the street and decided to see if this place lived up to the hype. 
We walked in and found a clean well Kaye's out little place. First off loved the chalkboard menus hanging throughout. And you can see the entire kitchen. 
I tried the Porchetta Sandwich and I couldn't eat it fast enough. This was excellent. My Sons tried the Five Cheese Pesto pizza and the Carnivore. They both gave thumbs up and say it the best pizza they've had this area. We also tried the Lentil Soup and was blown away on how tasty it was. This place is now our go to pizza spot for the NW Valley."}
{"text":"It's with a heavy heart that I say goodbye to old school pizza. We used to eat here at least once a week. No care or effort goes into the food anymore. The crust is over cooked nine out of ten times when we order now. I hadn't eaten here in months but I had a bad craving for their knots and mascarpone sauce. I ordered a dozen of them so I would still get a few and be able to share lol. I literally got next to NO mascarpone sauce. Guys, cmon. I've been in the restaurant business my whole life. The saucer had MAYBE a quarter of an ounce of sauce in it. Completely unacceptable. Thank goodness I had stuff in the fridge to throw an aioli together really quick. Secondly, since when do all the toppings for the vegas meets Italy pizza come on the side? I can see the arugula for sure, as that adds a great crunch when it's not wilted, but ALL THE TOOPINGS? Completely ruined the entire pizza. At least I can always count on the salad being ok. What a shame. You guys used to be the best spot in the neighborhood and I referred everyone to you for pizza. Not anymore"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is outstanding!  My boyfriend and I shared the Vegas meets Italy pizza everything was so fresh . Scamorza, mozzarella, ricotta, pistachio, chopped dates, heirloom tomatoes, arugula, prosciutto on a date cream sauce. Best Italian I've had by far. The stuffed chicken wings other homemade sausage was delicious as well.  I will be back  for sure !"}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this place for months after hearing how amazing it was. Just a sidenote, I'm a huge fan of thin-crust pizza, crispy on the bottom and edges, and a sucker for a good crust. My fave crust is at pizzeria mozza--tastes like French baguette crust. 

I personally wan't too fond of the garlic knots-- they were sourdough based, and though I love sourdough, I wasn't quite expecting it in a garlic knot or an Italian place, or at a pizza joint. But it had good flavor, and the sauce was to die-for. 

The pizza had fresh toppings, but again, because the crust was sourdough, it didn't live up to my expectations. The crust had a nice crisp, but, I have other places that I prefer more than here. 

A quaint place, and the pizza takes quite a while to get made. The prices aren't low either if you order the supreme or set specials. Would I go back? I'd give it one more shot. I also want to try other items next time, like the stuffed chicken wings."}
{"text":"Lots of character, pretty good pizza however don't expect prefect , other items are good as well definitely stop by for lunch , you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"It's old school pizza. So..  gotta be good, right. Wrong. It's ok cuz cheese is delicious. But other than that it's plain tasting. Hard to make pizza plain. But they did it. So, I'm giving them 3 stars for figuring out a way to make pizza taste plain. 
Not an easy task."}
{"text":"Stopped at this gem on the way to Utah. The pizza slices are huge, unique, and delicious. Classic setting: simple menu, simple decor, and very cozy. The staff was very friendly and the service was fast. Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"The only reason i am giving them 4 stars and not 5 is because we called in an order and 30 minutes later when we arrived to pick it up the cashier told us our order was not put in. However they did make it up by throwing in some free cannolies and lemonade. The pizza was really good! Had alot of toppings on it. The lemonade was delicious. A must try! We will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Not sure how to rate this.  The food was good but the atmosphere was to loud there was music and TV all the noise in the kitchen.  It was frustrating just sitting here.  Some of our food was burnt and the guy that was taking our order seemed like he was having a bad day and transferred that to me.... I did not enjoy myself here.  We are on a table that looked like particleboard.  I just seemed like they didn't want to put money into it...will not go back"}
{"text":"We were craving pizza and wanted something local - not a chain! We ordered the Pork Reigns and Vegetariana pizzas. Both were very good. They were served with what I would call a garlicky ranch-like sauce, which is amazing!!! They also come with their marinara sauce on the side, which is slightly sweet.

We liked our food so much we decided to go back. The second time we created our own calzones. I especially liked the calzones! I'd recommend creating your own with your favorite toppings. We also ordered the garlic knots because of all the good reviews. I personally thought they were a bit tough to chew. Maybe we got a bad batch?! 

I'd recommend them if you're looking for something different. The quality of the ingredients they use to make their pizza and calzones was evident in the taste! Prices were reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Super delicious pizza?! YES! 

Old School Pizzeria is seriously super yummy! Its right across the street from The Cannery on Craig and its not a huge place. The location, though far from my place, is pretty quiet and nice. Inside OSP it's VERY clean and bright! I love the chalk board walls and all the information throughout the inside. You go up to the counter and are greeted by the pizza maker and he gives you a quick run down of the menu. They have 3 sizes of pizza you can order, as well as single slices.

I chose a \"big\" cheese pizza and a side of garlic knots. You order off an iPad and it even has one of them card sliders on the side for convenience. Your receipt is also e-mailed to you! Santiago and I sat down to wait for our yummies as the pizza maker go to work. It was really neat seeing him knead the dough and get it ready for us. Before we knew it he was placing it into the oven and getting out knots ready. Whilst we waited Santiago drew on the chalk board and I watch tv. 

The pizza was ready in about 10-12 minutes and I asked for some ranch, which he informed me was actually homemade and mascarpone cheese and spices! YUM!

Off we went to Summerlin! I was a little sad because I figured the pizza was going to be gross and cold when we got home, alas it was still warm and yummy! Upon looking at the pizza you can tell its homemade and not the stuff from other chain places. On the walls it says the dough is made in batches every 36 hours so they do tend to run out. The dough here is perfect and chewy but not overly chewy, its seriously good! He put the right amount of sauce on the pizza as well as a good amount of cheese! The rosemary garlic knots were sooooooooo good! I seriously wanted more!

For the pizza and knots our total was around $14. I did also tip since it was 8:45pm and they were closing at 9pm. 

I will def come here again when I'm on this side of town! The cool thing is, even 2 days later the pizza still tastes amazing! 
YAY!"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place in all of Vegas! Every time we go through town we have to stop. In fact, my husband and I discussed flying in just for the pizza here. I like the Margherita and my husband gets sausage/pepperoni. The garlic knots with the garlic dipping sauce is delicious also. The sauce on the pizza is so so good. We love to try pizza to find the best. So far, this place has been the best!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Not the normal slice and it takes a little longer than your normal pizza place but it's well worth the wait. They have a mason jar grilled Rosemary lemonade that's pretty legit as well!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere with Excellent Food and the service was Great!  Simply Awesome.."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner tonight and both agreed it was the best pizza we've ever had in our entire lives."}
{"text":"When you walk through an Italian pizza parlor and the smell of fresh basil is in the air and the chef is busy rolling out pizza dough right behind the counter, you know you've come to the right place. 

The previous business located at this restaurant was a small bakery and it was pretty run down, but the new owners have really cleaned this place up and I'm really impressed. I know this place is known for their pizza, but who could resist apple-wood oven-roasted half-chicken with roasted potatoes for only $6.99? It did take a while to cook, but that just told me it wasn't sitting on a heater since that morning and it was being cooked fresh. The smell of the chicken roasting in the oven was INCREDIBLE, and when I brought it to work ALL of my co-workers said the smell was amazing. I found whole roasted garlic and rosemary in my plate, and the chicken fell off the bone. Oh man.

It's almost lunch break and I'm heading back over there in a minute to try out their pizza. Old School Pizzeria and I are going to be best friends."}
{"text":"Took a bite from my Giant Pepperoni, pepper, and sausage pizza, and i was like \"yup just found my new lunch spot.\""}
{"text":"Pretty good slice! This is a small mom and pop pizzeria with a lot of charm. The service is excellent and the chef is really friendly. 
Now the food: we ordered garlic knots, two slices and I had to try their cannoli!
The garlic knots are dipped in butter and have fresh basil on them, they also come with a side of house garlic sauce. They're pretty good but too fancy for me. 
The pizza, though not my favorite, is pretty good! The slices are huge! The sauce is on the salty side but blends nicely in the slice. 
Now the cannoli, excellent! I was pretty full after the huge slice (it's a meal in itself) but couldn't say no to a cannoli. It had a cinnamon flavor to it and was deliciously fresh! 
All in Ll, I def see myself returning here."}
{"text":"This was a great find! The restaurant is a quant little place and food was great! We ordered the OMG classic combo,  very good! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in all of Vegas. Try everything though. Noting here is bad. Mac and cheese is one of the best dishes I've ever had."}
{"text":"They leaven their own crust for 5 days! It is so good, slightly sourdough-y and crispy and stretchy. And they default serve the monster slice with house-made ranch, and the garlic knots have roasted garlic cloves in there with them... I was really surprised at the quality of everything and size of the slice, it's a really good deal."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but the lemonade wasn't my flavorite. Did not sit well with me. Don't really remember much else. But I remember not hating it."}
{"text":"The best pizza sauce!! Love the fresh basil on the pizza. The garlic knots are probably the best I've ever had! They were not over greasy like other places and the touch of rosemary is perfect. I love how cute it is inside too. It's very rustic and romantic for a small joint. I love the employees passion for the food and restaurant."}
{"text":"I'v been here several times. It's always fresh and delicious. \"EVERY TIME\". I tried about every thing on the menu during my visits. I'm here to tell you there isn't a better Pizza shop in town, And yes, I'm a local. I've tried them all."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Had half margarita & half pepperoni & sausage pizza the first time. Second time was the carnivore & the antipasto salad. Loved the salad. They chop it & put it in a bread bowl. Delicious! Pizza was good but a bit heavy. Will definitely try something lighter. Also had the homemade cannoli on the first visit. So good. Both times, the person taking my order was helpful & knowledgeable about the menu. Great pizza and great customer service. Only reason for the lack of a star is the parking but will always go back there."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with the pizza.  Then again I am a New Yorker so I have very high standards when it comes to pizza.  This definitely didn't make my cut...I suppose I do need to edit this review though...it was sent only after eating the pizza and before anything else.   I still stand behind my not liking it.( to each his own).but the calzone was very good and the 5 cheese mac and cheese was phenomenal.  Based on all of the other 5 star reviews it is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Rain and witnessing a drug deal go down in the parking lot did not deter us from trying OSP, and we are so glad we did!

I need this pizza in my life.
Where to start? It's not your ordinary pizzeria with items like \"date cream\" or \"scamorza\" and even a porchetta sandwich. 

Garlic Mascarpone cream? Yes, thank you for this delicious creamy dip for your pizza, fingers, whatever...you'll want to take shots of this stuff.

The place is small and comfortable. We sat in front of the pizza window to watch the magic.

They cure their dough for 1.5 days to give it a natural crunchy crust. It holds up to the cheese and toppings without going limp.

The sauce is perfect. Light & fresh pear tomatoes which is not overdone.

I can't wait to come back and take my North Vegas clients to lunch here. Helpers were right about this being a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Price is fair. Everything made from scratch. So come with time and patience. It can take little while for the food to come out. But you can count that it'll be fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Las Vegas that I've tried so far. I really like the Vegas Meets Italy, which has smoked mozzarella, ricotta, fresh arugula, heirloom cherry tomatoes, prosciutto, dates and pistachios. The crust almost tastes like a sourdough, which is really good. It's so good I order the X-Large size, which is huge and $45.00. The service is always friendly. 

The grilled rosemary lemonade is good, as is the passion fruit tea."}
{"text":"Best pizza place out in Vegas period, great food and great service. The rosemary lemonade is to die for and the pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Now I'm no pizza expert but this was some damn fine pizza.  The dough they use at this joint is very fresh and delicious.  It's just too bad that it's so far away from my side of town :/"}
{"text":"Omg! Idk where to begin. Best place ever pizza was amazing and so was the customer service i totally recommend this place must order the chicken wings only two but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Although this pizzeria is out in North town, the food should be the number one reason to trek here from other parts of the Valley. It's a small pizzeria tucked into a small strip mall next to an auto shop.

Once you step inside you are in a world of pizza pies of olden days. As you approach the counter you are greeted by men working recklessly at their craft. If you arrive when they are busy, you will see the older men yelling at the younger ones, \"Don't forget that cannoli!\" \"We've got more coming in!\", and they all run about behind the counter in plain view. Definitely \"old school\". 

I placed an order for take out on their online ordering system (YES! I LOVE IT!). And when I arrived my pizza was nearly done. Also of note - the system will keep you updated via text message on the progress of your order. 

Ordered: One Large pizza (serves 3 - 4), with half ham, and half ham + hot peppers. An order of Garlic Rosemary Bread Knots, and One Cannoli. 

While I waited for my pizza I got a fountain drink, not long after the young man at the counter helped me out to my car and placed my order into my backseat for me.

When the pizza arrived at my home it was beautiful! Perfectly cooked with a thin, crispy, and somewhat chewy crust. Really, it was just that perfection of pizza crust style. Tomato sauce and cheese melded in food harmony. The ham placed on top of the pie was plentiful, and the hot peppers (red and yellow) were fresh and gave my part of the pizza that extra kick I was looking for. 

Rosemary Garlic Bread Knots were unfathomably good for just being bread and some spices. The rosemary is the simple star here - changing regular old knots into a savory, aromatic eating experience.

Last - I split the Canoli in half to share with my husband (what a nice wife I am!), and it had a flaky exterior and a creamy inside. Absolutely delicious! I wish only I had gotten two instead of the one. Well, now I know for next time!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Quaint restaurant that is small, rustic but works. If you're lucky you'll get a table so take out might be the best option. Call your order in and pick up if you're in a hurry. If your lucky enough to get a seat or can wait it's worth it. Great feel in the restaurant watching people and the cooks!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is by far the absolute best in Las Vegas.  The source their ingredients locally as much as possible, use traditional sourdough crust and have a warm, friendly fly atmosphere.  This is the place to get a slice, or a whole pie!"}
{"text":"This is some damn good pizza. But again, pricey! Thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients, definitely your more \"high end\" pizza joint for the area. They serve rosemary lemonade in mason jars for purchase....you can even bring the Mason jar back for a cheaper refill next time. Small place inside...only about 6 tables. But the pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"This joint consistently has great pizza. The staff is friendly and greet you at the door like an old friend. The seating area is a little small but the atmosphere makes up for it."}
{"text":"Best pizza crust ever! Naturally leavened pizza dough.  Seriously delicious food in a casual atmosphere.  I came here for lunch on a Friday, based on the Yelp reviews. The restaurant was busy, but service was quick. Can't wait to try meatball sub Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Have been driving past the Old School Pizzeria for months and keep telling myself-I have to try that place!  So last night was the night, while the ambience in the restaurant is nice and you can watch them make your pizza, their menu was ala carte only. No family meal deals or pizza/wing specials.  I ordered a large pepperoni/sausage pizza and rosemary garlic knots.  I was not impressed with their homemade sausage and pizza crust was tough to chew.  The garlic knots were hard around the edges and equally tough to chew, not enough garlic and way TOO much rosemary.  For 10 knots they put an entire sprig of rosemary on top which made a few impossible to eat. Was very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and staff in the city! Authentic and original! Will be back again soon!
We had 3 small pizzas for the 5 of us and that was perfect! The grilled rosemary lemonade was scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Amazing the owner is super nice. Pizza Amazing, gelato is yummy and cannoli is to die for"}
{"text":"This is definitely a little hidden gem of North Las Vegas. When you walk in the location itself is super small so I recommend taking your order to go or getting here early to snag a spot. 

Their food is outstanding! The pizza slices are giant, one slice is about the same as 2-3 normal pizza slices and the taste is seriously delicious. The dough is unlike any other place I've found in the valley, it is the perfect amount of crispy and tasty. They have some other great food options too like mac n cheese, garlic knots, meatball sandwiches and salads. They also have some pretty great lunch specials like a slice of pizza along with a side salad or side of garlic knots.

I highly recommend checking this place out if you're a pizza lover like me!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good pizza spot in North Las Vegas. Fairly close to the VA hospital and convenient for lunch. The large slice is more than enough for lunch. The crust is good, very similar to sourdough, and is slightly on the thicker side. Overall solid pizza place."}
{"text":"What a great hole in the wall. From everything to the decor, games for the kids. A huge chalk board for them as well. All fresh ingredients! Our favorite spot is the table in front of the pizza prep window. The gentlemen who was making our pizza was so friendly. He asked my girls if the pizza looked good before putting it in the oven! This is our new favorite spot!!! You won't be let down. Guaranteed!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim as we were passing through Vegas on a road trip. We were craving pizza, but didn't want anything too fancy or takeout. This place was perfect! We ordered at the counter and got our food about 15 min later. They had basic toppings and some unique ones. We topped ours off with garlic and were excited when we saw the pizza adorned with giant cloves.  I'm not a big fan of crust and usually give it to my hubby. However, this crust was not shareable. I devoured every flaky last bit of it. The server offered us some garlic dip and I jumped at the chance because I never pass up sauce. This was some of the best pizzas I've had in a while!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing. Wine is available to purchase. Great music and the staff was very helpful and courteous. There is no pizza joint in Vegas."}
{"text":"their omg pizza is seriously crazy. it's GIANT. I've been here twice. I solved all the riddles and they gave me a free cannoli. the second time I came I ordered a monster slice. it is definetly worth the $5. the slice is HUGE and the pizza sauce/pizza crust is TO DIE FOR"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the city and a regular for work lunches. Quality ingredients, great service, and uncommon toppings like white anchovies and hard boiled egg. The monster slice and stuffed chicken wing are incredible. People say it's pricey but I've never left unsatisfied. Great portions. 

Also, the little bottles of almond and vanilla syrup for your soda are amazing."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Many times you have to choose between quantity and quality. Not here. Don't order two slices...I may never recover. Aside from having excellent food the staff is incredible and very polite which is certainly not what you get at most places. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey ...got calzone for like 15 bucks I feel it should be a bit bigger cause I'm still hungry ..:( so for that over all 4 stars I should be full for 15 bucks ..."}
{"text":"I am so mad at myself for not having been to this place sooner. 
 I loved it! It all started as soon as we walked in the door & were greeted by friendly staff who provided wonderful customer service.  We ordered antipasto salad,  pepperoni & mushroom monster slice & a meat lovers calzone. 
Every single ingredient was fresh, DELICIOUS and some even from local farms.  I wish more restaurants in Vegas worked this way.  
I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place with great food. Small classy and romantic.  Seems like it's in an odd location but that just means it's less crowded.  A little too expensive though."}
{"text":"This place has that pizzeria vibe to it for sure.  The best thing about this place is that it's right by my place!  The pizza is fantastic and you get quality in taste and portion size for the price.  The rosemary garlic knots are insanely good, a must have with your pizza.  A cool little hole in the wall with a few different size tables for different size groups to sit at.  The Cannery Casino is right across the street if you're staying there so walking distance is perfect.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"We still come here at least twice a month, so amazing!!:) My husband makes a quick phone call after work, I run and get it with my son and everyone's smiling faces greet and thank us:) LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"The first few times, this place was amazing. The last couple of times have been lackluster at best. I can't put my finger on it, but it just wasn't as good. I do like the crust of the pizza, but the rest, not so much. 

I do like the Chef Gio salad, but sometimes there's a little too much fennel. It also could use more acid, for my taste anyhow. The bead it sits on is awesome. 

The decor is kind of falling apart too, the chairs are rickety and while the pallet countertops are cool, they are a bit rickety too. 

I'm rooting for these guys to make it and hopefully they'll be in a position to open a bigger place."}
{"text":"Great little local pizza place... service was awesome. Staff seems to really care about the customers. Crust is Perfection with a slight sourdough taste. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Sauce and dough is homemade and packed with flavor!  Service was great. Everyone was very friendly! We will definitely eat here again. Drove an hour just to try it!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great pizzeria, thin crust pizza with a greasy top! We tried the pork reigns and definitely recommend it. The only downside, if any, is they make everything fresh so be prepared to wait at least 20-30 minutes for your pizza."}
{"text":"I first discovered OSP back in April of 2012. I've watched (and seriously enjoyed) seeing Chef Gio take on building this business after he left Nora's Wine Bar & Osteria. And just like Nora's which got rave reviews OSP sets the bar quite high for what a pizzeria can and should be. 

The dough is still prepared 36 hours in advance. The ingredients used are fresh, and your pizza is not made in some hidden back room. It's made right off to the side of the main counter where you can see everything that's put on it. There are no shortcuts. No skimping on quality. And the pizza you will find here is second to none here in Vegas. 

My 7 year old loves the huge slice of cheese pizza and his smile alone each time they bring it out to the table makes it worth the 45 min one way drive we make to get there. The garlic knots with roasted garlic and fresh rosemary and homemade sauce is a must try. If you're cautious stick to the Classic, but take a look at the chalkboard on the wall and the menu boards. You can go beyond the ordinary here and explore combinations of ingredients you won't find anywhere else. 

After two recent visits starting last weekend and the most recent being just 90 minutes ago, I'm going to put OSP back in 5 Star territory, and add it once again to my \"Mythical 6th Star\" list, for places that are so exceptional that 5 Stars just isn't enough. 5 years later I love OSP just as much as I did back in the day. Got no complaints (ultra rare for me), and nothing but love for OSP. Great food, great staff, might be a little crowded sometimes but that's because it's just so good."}
{"text":"I discovered this place by accident while looking due a nice pizza place on a date night and stepping inside I knew right away I was going to love it. The atmosphere is intimate in a family friendly sort of way and the staff exemplifies amazing service. When it comes to the food their garlic knots with sauce is to die for and their pizza is huge and delicious!"}
{"text":"We  always heard about this place and we've been wanting to try it out. OMG so delicious!!!!! Best pizza we ever ate."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place and I thought I had to check it out. My first visit wasn't anything to rave about but I came in again tonight and the pizza was great. I ended up getting a slice with meatball and spicy Italian peppers and I also got a stuffed chicken wing. I didn't think the chicken wing was anything special, I wouldn't order it again, but it was worth trying. This is a good place to come for a slice and a beer."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I lived in North Las Vegas for over two years without knowing this hidden gem even existed. It's in a small strip mall building across from the parking garage of the Cannery. The guys are friendly, the place is very clean, and the food is awesome!  I've done work lunch with some fellow Air Force folks and the service was quick enough to make lunch hour. AND I've taken the family and everyone enjoyed their meal. The pizza is loaded, the garlic knots are buttery, and the chicken is falling off the bone.  Sweet and go anytime you're on Craig Rd near the I-15."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good when they first opened, the staff is really friendly and the toppings are fresh but the pizza was really greasy and floppy."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and try old school Pizzeria and boy I tell you it was a great place to stop food was delicious I ordered a half margarita have vegetarian pizza and then their specialty chicken thighs which had a great flavor Rosemary sprig coming out the top the very wonderful presentation I love the intimacy of this restaurant and just the old school feel with a little hints-up upscale"}
{"text":"Cute little pizza place. Lots of fun different combinations. We just got a cheese slice, and it was delicious.  I had to give my husband half of mine because it was so large."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've ever had. The customer service was phenomenal and the atmosphere was exquisite. I drive 100 miles just to eat here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in town. Authentic, well fermented dough and fresh ingredients. Doesn't get soggy and doesn't make my tummy hurt the day after. The staff is really friendly and efficient. Love their OMG size pizza. They also brew their own Rosemary lemonade that tastes amazing!!!! So yum!!"}
{"text":"OHHHHHH Wow this pizza is so good today was my first time trying it somebody referred me, soon as I picked up a slice and it hung over I knew it was going to be good best so far yet I have some other places friends told me to try out but so far this place is winning!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible! A little bit of a drive out side of down town Vegas, but well worth it!! Amazing pizza and the garlic knots are unbelievable! It's a hole in the wall, very casual environment, always busy, but tables become available pretty quickly. If you're in the Vegas area, this is a must stop!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Old School! They know my husband by name!  haha! They food is delicious and service is excellent! Their cannolis are the best and you must try their grilled lemonade!"}
{"text":"Holy pizza!! You would never in a million years think that such pizza perfection would come from some place off of Craig in North Las Vegas. We'll...it does. I'm so glad we stopped in. Absolutely delicious! Amazing dough, sauce, toppings and service. We usually go very basic on our first visit to a pizza place. So we had a 14\" pepperoni and a cannoli. It's so cool that you can see the chef work his magic. The staff is friendly and the cannoli was a yummy extra treat. They also make tea and lemonades in mason jars...love love love. Cant wait to go back and try everything else on the menu. So glad we found a new neighborhood pizza spot! Oh and they have pizza by the slice!!"}
{"text":"Wow! That is the word I would use to describe this place. I came out from getting my haircut next door, and I was hungry. I looked up the restaurant and saw it's high rating on Yelp, and decided to give it a shot.

As I came in I was promptly greeted by a guy behind the counter making pizza . I threw up my flag of first time ignorance, and I was given a run down of the menu. After the menu was thoroughly explained I decided on the garden salad, the rosemary garlic knots, the double monster slice special, and the canolis.

The salad came out first, and it was so good, I ordered another one after I ate the first. All the vegetables were fresh and crisp. There was shredded cheese throughout that added a nice richness. The salad was already dressed, but it wasn't soggy. The nice creamy dressing wasn't the star but helped bind everything together, it still had good flavor though.

This was the first time I got garlic knots at a pizza joint. Bread side items normally seem like a waste to me, but I am glad I gave these a chance. I could taste the rosemary and garlic on them, and the bread was toasty on the outside while having a soft and fluffy inside. The \"white sauce\" that came with the knots was addictively delicious.

Then the two monster slices came. They lived up to their title, they could have been over 1/4 of a pizza. I topped one slice with sausage and one with pepperoni, and it is hard for me to decide which was better. I'll just say these two slices sold me, and I will definitely be back to order whole pizzas here in the future. They weren't greasy, they had a good amount of cheese, and both of the toppings had their own distinct flavor. The sauce was particularly good. It wasn't a sweet acid bomb, and had a good taste of crushed tomatoes and seasoning.

The only downside to my meal were the canoli. While the cream inside had a nice smooth texture with the perfect amount of sweetness, the pastry shells were fried too hard and had a burnt flavor. That single infraction would only bring my rating to a 4.5 star.

I am absolutely sold on this establishment, and I will definetly be coming back to try more items."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We came here after reading an article about it online. It is on the complete opposite side of town we live in, but well worth the drive. If they had beer or wine, it would have earned the fifth star. The staff was very friendly and personable."}
{"text":"We ordered over the phone .. they told us 15 mins .. we got there within 20 mins. .. upon arriving about 8:00 pm we didn't walk out with our pie for about 30 more mins ( LG sausage, shredded chicken,  and roasted garlic ) let me tell you,  they closed their doors at about 8:25 (35 mins earlier than closing) and I witnessed 4 people coming to the door mad as a hornet they couldn't get in. 
  Want to understand their frustration?  
Let me start by saying their dough is hand made.  The sausage is prepared in house , so fresh you can taste it. The shredded chicken was juicy , and the roasted garlic was cooked just right! I'd be mad too had I not made it on time! The pizza pie was damn good!  
 To be honest , they can close their doors whenever they like. They got it like that. Just be sure you order plenty ahead of time. They have families and want to go home just like us. 

  I will be back ... and I will try the garlic knots I forgot to order !"}
{"text":"The garlic knots are good with rosemary-delicious. The Rosemary lemonade, my boyfriend says was to die for. However, the pizza was mediocre. With a sourdough crust was cool, new. But the sauce tasted like tomato paste, I kinda wish I didn't order extra. We got chunks of garlic and chicken, it was ok. I tried to eat left overs and ended up just throwing the pizza away."}
{"text":"This is best pizza in town, hands down. (sorry Settebello!)

I came in here with my hubby on a weekend that we traveled to NLV. We make it to NLV every other weekend because my husband and son's barber is on Craig Rd. The last 2 times we tried to go here on a Sat, the place was closed for some odd reason. The first time their sign was being hoisted and it blocked the entrance, another time there was a personal reason. Finally, we make it on a weekend that they were open for biz.

The only bad part of this experience is that me and the fam weren't extremely hungry upon arrival. I ordered 3 slices of cheese and a side salad for 4 of us. We couldn't even eat the 3rd slice so we took it home (and I had to listen to Ray L. and Sydney B. fight over it for the next 12 hrs).

First let me address the salad. What a beautiful specimen of art and veggies!!! This salad was so deelish that I almost got too full for the pizza. When something is good most times I forget that there are other things on my plate. 

The pizza is heaven. I love the dough. It is a sourdough pizza dough and I haven't had it anywhere in town, only in San Jose (whoop, whoop, Toto's!). The sauce is so spot on I could probably drink the stuff after I take a bath in it. I simply love by-the-slice places and I hope this never changes.

The other items on the menu intrigued me. It is rare that I find a pizza place offering such delicacies as roasted chicken with rosemary potatoes. This type of cuisine really puts Old School a slice above the rest. I now look forward to the NLV haircuts every other weekend. The agenda begins with pizza, then haircut/eyebrow wax, and then Epic Thrift Store. I love those kind of weekends. PERFECT~!"}
{"text":"Maybe I've just been spoiled with amazing pizza, but Old School's pizza did not amaze me much, but I'm going to attribute it to a mistake in choosing the pizza flavor.

The crust/dough could have been thinner in my opinion, as it became a bit too much to chew after the first piece. I had the Vegas meets Italy pizza and really did not enjoy having ricotta cheese and dates on my pizza instead of some fresh mozzarella. Should NOT have listened to their recommendations.

The staff here is incredibly nice though. You can tell that they are trying to make food with integrity. I will definitely come back here if given the chance so I can try other flavors."}
{"text":"Giovanni is awesome! The Pizza is even more Awesome! The most authentic pizza I have ever had in my life. I live 160 miles away, and I travel there for the amazing food, the awesome atmosphere, and Giovanni's welcoming smile! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to North Las Vegas and thought we'd try this out. It is a hole in the wall. Right off the bat, Carlos welcomed us and let us try their homemade grilled rosemary lemonade and passion iced tea. We bought a Mason jar of the passion iced tea (which is a Arnold Palmer of goodness). I eat a lot and the combo filled me up tremendously. Their slices are monstrous!!!! Food is great, white sauce is awesome and the stuffed chicken wing is amazing. They really know how to maximize flavor with the use of some good herbs and spices. It felt fresh. Can't stress how much Carlos' hospitality made a difference to bring us in and the food Definately sealed the deal. Unique flavor, music and unique feel."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches and lemonade were really good but I wasn't impressed with the pizza. The dough was stretched so thin the pointy end couldn't hold itself up and the sauce was a little on the sour side. Good friendly service and nice atmosphere if you dine in."}
{"text":"I was seated at a charity dinner with someone that I ended up getting friendly with who was kind enough to tell me about Old School Pizza when she discovered I lived in North Las Vegas. I ended up trying this place out the next day after hearing about the amazing cannoli's this place has to offer. Turns out is three minutes from my house so I owe her a great debt  for telling me about this piece of heaven or a bill for the clothes I will need to buy after my waist line increases.
From the outside you would never guess what delicious food awaits but once you enter you quickly realize this isn't just a regular pizza place. They have amazing décor and fun riddles around. They have toys for kids to play with and tons of specials written up on the wall. 
We ended up trying the Garlic Twists and a pizza Half Cheese and Half Pepperoni plus of course Cannoli's.  They make their own yeast and it all tastes so freaking good. I can feel myself gaining ten pounds just thinking about it.
Everything was so yummy and the brothers who run the place are friendly and efficient. This is my new go to place for pizza. I can't wait to try it without my KIDS so I can eat some of the amazing stuff they offer that is more on the gourmet side of things. 
They take orders via ONLINE or in Person so don't hesitate to try it even if you live a ways away."}
{"text":"Chef Giovanni [sp?] just CALLED me personally to invite me to try his pizza fresh (not delivered as last time) and seemed genuinely concerned that we did not enjoy our experience as well as we could have.  I have to say, coming from California this NEVER happens and says a lot about this man's character....really impressed by him...NOW THE FOOD....Oh my slap your grandma goooood!  A serious feast...from salad to dessert the best Italian...so fresh...having been to Italy it was like being there again...GET the chicken...GET the gelato...but for GODS SAKE get the friggin cannolis or...well...you have missed a chance to taste heaven....not too much of anything...plenty of everything good...bring cash to tip...JASON and CHEF GIO deserve it and treat you like family...old school...the best school...manga!!!"}
{"text":"The crust flavor was not that good.. but was toasted well. Nice cheese and the sausage topping was ok. Too much hype for this place. large servings of blah, so-so pizza...... NEXT!"}
{"text":"Well the reviews are 100% right!! Incredible pizza !! The toppings are so fresh and flavorful you can taste everything,, nothing lost in the usual pizza mess! Sauce was on point! Best for last the crust may have been best pizza crust ever!! After the first slide I couldn't wait for another just to reach that bubbled up outer crust!! Great place fair prices! Wish I was in Vegas more often!! May go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"A super cool pizza place. Everything is house made. Bomb crust!! Next time we wanna try the sausage stuffed chicken wings! Yumm! It's gonna make a bomb munchies meal later."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to come here tonight. The pizza was amazing (and that's coming from someone from Chicago) !! We ordered the Vegas Meets Italy. The toppings were top quality and they pile on the toppings. The crust is also very good (I'm usually not a crust person! We got the small size and it was more than enough for 2 people.

The stuffed chicken wings were also good. The garlic knots and rosemary lemonade were alright. 

Service was good, staff was very friendly. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I lived in Manhattan and the Bronx for a time and after moving back to the west coast I starved for something to fill my New York Style Pizza Needs! Then a few months ago we were told about this joint. 

ITS
INCREDIBLE!

Everything I have tried here is divine. I love the pizza. It is the closest to how I had it in NYC. But the thing that blew my mind were the cannolis. They were just like I had them from my favorite little bakery in the Bronx. They fill them right in front of you so you know they are legit. And the cool thing is if you get the trivia question right on their chalkboard you get a free one!! 

The service is great! They are usually pretty busy but you are having so much fun waiting you don't even notice. 

O and I cannot explain how excited I am that a eatery as great as this one is in NORTH LAS VEGAS! 

Needless to say I am in love! I crave this place more than any other. I want it right now in fact... :D"}
{"text":"So far my favorite pizza place in North Las Vegas. Handmade pizza with fresh ingredients put together right in front of you. I had the Vegas meets New York, very tasty with out of the box thinking toppings. I will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this joint from all the reviews.  Crust was horrible. owner should order dough from the people that supply PAPA John'... I will not be back to this place..  The cheese and sauce were really good,, can tell the quality of the cheese, i like either lisanti or grande moz cheese...  My issue is with the dough..  Fix the dough and this can be a great place...

7/10/12

I tried this place again,, mainly because i wanted to give them a chance.  I hate giving a bad review to business owners who are try hard to put out good food and are trying to make a living...  The dough was the same,  seems to lack gluten, I have made dough in the past, and i thought the dough we produced, gave us a great crust that most of us are looking for.  Unfortunately i do not like this dough... If they used my dough and the ingredients they use,, this place would be the best in N Las Vegas...  Lisanti high gluten pizza dough is what we used... Just saying... Hope this yelps"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Was looking for something that I could actually reheat the next day if we didn't finish it and it still had flavor. It was a little more than I wanted to spend but it was well worth it. I had been getting the $5.99-$10 deals at pizza fast food joints and was getting tired of it. We just ordered online, picked it up, and WOW! Super huge! We stayed simple and got pepperoni and I only ate 2 pieces. Filling, yummy, cheese that actually tastes like something and it was cooked all the way through! Have been back two more times. This is our family's new fave!"}
{"text":"I heard the West Flaming location is about a month away. Can't wait"}
{"text":"Really great food! Probably the best pizza in Las Vegas! Highly recommend this place. I loved our fresh salad! And the garlic knots were top notch! A little bit of a drive but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great find.  Just off 1 15 and quality of pizza haven't experienced since we were in Rome.   Nice atmosphere and staff too."}
{"text":"Super yummy amazing and great salads amazing atmosphere right across the street from the cannery must go to"}
{"text":"Place is great! We had Vegas meets Italy pizza with bread knots. Amazing! Place has a great atmosphere. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"I like this place! Great staff and great food. I just wish they had the super quality of food in a restaurant setting. Man, this would be a great place for a date or special occasion if the atmosphere was a little more upscale. I highly recommend it if you are looking for some really good food and don't care if you order at the counter."}
{"text":"Yum for sourdough pizza crust! The slices here have a charred outside, but chewy inside...slightly thick crust...very good! They also use lots of fresh ingredients here.  We ordered a house made sausage slice and an eggplant + chicken slice....it was good!  Not mind blowing, but good!  Here is a pic :

But what I really enjoyed here were the rosemary garlic knots! These were the best I've had...and were very addicting! I will come back for the knots alone!  Seriously, why are they so good??  Check it out!

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/old-school-pizzeria-north-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#_ToU4xH13toGvqOuTnOmLw

We finished with the cannoli, which are piped fresh to order, and have a great filler. A great way to end a good slice of pizza and knots!  Pic :

They also had a cool little nook area for the kids to play.  They had some toys there and my little guy loved the fire truck.  It is the little things that count!

Prices are good too!  Check them out if you are on this side of town :)"}
{"text":"The Many times we've order from here we enjoyed it but today sucked! We order extra crispy but to my surprise I got extra burnt. I used to see the owner there really nice guy but now they got people who don't know how to cook to request at all. Please hire skilled people and then we will return our business there again!"}
{"text":"First time here, had a warm welcome from the lady behind the counter. I just order  the monster slice + extra slice. Little did I know the monster slice is literally a \"MONSTER\" slice and I was good with just one slice, now I have lunch. Honestly the best slice of pizza I have ever had. Their dough is made the old school way, no commercial yeast, all natural leavening. Which means your pizza will be healthy & flavorful. Just a warning as well, their dough takes 36 hours of preparation time, they occasionally run out. But I can definitely tell you once you get a slice it'll be well worth it. So if your in the Las Vegas Area no matter where you are in Vegas, you must come down to old school pizzeria off of Craig and Lawrence across from the cannery casino."}
{"text":"We tried their pizza- half pepperoni, half sausage and mushrooms. Good pizza with a tasty crust!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Vegas. I won't get pizza anywhere else! My favorite is the Vegas Meets Italy, but you really can't go wrong with anything. The Chef Gio salad is a great alternative if you're not in a pizza mood. Try their ranch dressing for dipping! It's literally THE BEST ranch dressing I've ever had.

However, the last 2 times I ordered a Vegas Meets Italy, I didn't find any dates on it... That was super disappointing because it's one of the best ingredients on the pie. I'm not sure if they stopped adding them or maybe they are out of season (since they buy them local)."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been enjoying it ever since I tried it. The pizza is made the right way, the garlic knots are amazing, their ranch is delicious, and their salads are fabulous. I've never had a problem or been disappointed and always tip well. Every time I have out of town guests we get our pizza here!

DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF NOT TRYING THEIR AWESOME RANCH.  Seriously, their ranch is soooo good."}
{"text":"Missed a movie across the street .. and to think I was going to have popcorn for dinner!  We ordered a salad which came in a bread bowl.  It was delicious!  Next we split a pizza with cheese and sausage.  There were a number of great looking specialty pizzas but we were in the mood for an old standby.  No prerolled, frozen crusts here--everything is freshly prepared.  Rather than us my packaged yeast, the crust is made from a sourdough starter.  It has a crunchy crust with a chewy crumb, a prefect crust for a pizza.  The tomato sauce has a fresh tomato taste with a hint of basil.  In short the food was delicious!

The ambience is relaxed and casual.  Chalkboard menus on the wall tell of all the food options.  Wine and beer are available.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great pizza as to be expected. But the service was even better.  It's like going to have a meal at a friends house. Oh and the cannolis are amazing"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker for 30 years I can tell you its as authentic as you will find here in Vegas. Chef Gio really knows how to harness the tastes of the old world. Its a bit more costly than other pizzerias but well worth the money"}
{"text":"I have been to Old School one other time. I got the Crazy Good Chicken. It really was good, maybe not CRAZY good!. The other day I called and ordered 2 meatball sandwiches. A friend of mine wanted to try the food here and I always like to try an Italian restaurants meatballs. The sandwiches are  $10 each which is a little pricey but I figured, judging by the size of the pizza slices, they were probably enormous. Was I wrong! The \"bread\" was just pizza dough (kind of like a Stromboli but the fixins were put in after it was cooked) But I thought that's ok cuz the pizza dough is good. There was sliced meatballs on it (sliced like a topping for the pizza) and there was MAYBE one and a half meatballs worth of meat. The sandwich was pretty much a whole lot of pizza crust with a little bit of meatballs and sauce. There wasn't even any cheese on the sandwich, they never asked if I wanted any either. For $10, I think that is absurd! My friends sandwich was exactly the same. We were both disappointed. I have yet to try the pizza. The slices are huge and they make their own dough which tales 36 hours so they have a sign admitting they may run out of dough some days. The place was very busy, all the tables were taken & people were waiting but it is a very small space so people were everywhere. It seems like they are caught between being a take out place and a sit down restaurant. I have yet to go back, I sent them an email regarding my visit but I did not get a reply."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have had in Vegas! We really really enjoyed our visit and will be back.

The ambience is casual. The walls are covered with chalkboards. They have the menu on one wall, and riddles around the room. Even their pop machine has a chalk board! There are pendant lights hanging from fun pallet boxes. There are only 7 or 8 tables, just FYI.

Now to what really really matters- the food!

We got an amazing tropical passion tea in a huge mason jar. Yum! 

We got garlic knots. Half order was plenty for the two of us. They came out with garlic and roast art in the bowl. And dipping sauce. Yum. But the best part was actually that they were REAL sourdough bread. No yeast!

And the pizza - same thing. This places uses no commercial yeast. They let nature do the work. And the taste is incredible! 

This appears to be the same with most of their ingredients. The sausage is made in house. The cheese is real. Now I don't know the source for all their ingredients. Or their recipes. But what I had tonight was delicious. And I look forward to supporting this establishment during our time here in Las Vegas! 

Edited to add: service was good. The staff was also very pleasant during our interactions."}
{"text":"Yum, fermented dough is the bomb! 

What we got...
- Pork reigns monster slice: guanciale on a pizza is the best! It's like a better bacon. The rest of the meats used to make a Pork Reigns are also tasty. The slice does get a bit salty, but I still enjoyed it because the sourdough helped contrast it. That sourdough crust is so perfectly chewy and crispy at the end. The quality of all the ingredients on this slice was top notch.
- Stuffed wing: really flavorful. I love that they debone the wing for easier eating. 
- Gio's salad: so fresh and so necessary. Full of yummy fresh crunchy fennel. The grape tomatoes and balls of fresh mozzarella, fresh herbs, so drool worthy. 
- Garlic knots: wow! LOVE. Served with whole roasted garlic cloves and their house-made ranch. This is also made with their fermented sourdough, and it's so good. 
- 50/50 iced tea lemonade: tastes a bit weird to me, I think there's a bit too much going on in this drink and I didn't like it. It also feels a bit expensive for this drink."}
{"text":"Holy cannoli ! Eat dessert first! The food is incredible - I had four slices of pizza and I'm lactose intolerant. Zebediah was our waiter and he was absolutely wonderful. We came with a party of about 25 and the service was impeccable, the food was unbelievable, and he even recommended what is now my new favorite wine. 

Bring your family and friends  - it's worth it !"}
{"text":"WOW this place is a hidden gem. I am so lucky that I live super close to it! They have one of the best sourdough pizza crusts and pizza sauce! I so far had the Pork Rules and 5 cheese pizza's and man... they are addicting!!! It's so hard to diet, when you have places like this around where you live lol. I wish they were open 24-7 so I can come here every other day for a slice of pizza after a long session at the Aria Poker room."}
{"text":"This Pizza, This Place AMAZING!!! Every time!! Vegas meets Italy my absolute favorite!!! Sounds a little crazy, the combination, I know but try it. BEST PIZZA EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Ran in for the first time 10 min to closing and grabbed 2 slices of the best cheese pizza I think I have ever had. This is Grimaldi's but WAY better. The slices were HUGE. The crust was perfectly flavored and had the perfect mix of soft plus crunch. Seriously...it was amazing. The vibe is chill but classy. Reminded me of an Italian restaurant I ate at in Paris. Will def be back."}
{"text":"Very trendy atmosphere, very clean and pleasant employees, but I was not impressed with the pizza. The slice was huge! But the sauce was too tangy. I was disappointed but I ate the $5 slice. Maybe the other items on the menu are more tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious point blank!!! I have passed by this place for years & finally tried it tonight. My only regret is not trying it sooner! I will definately be a regular. The pizza was yummy, staff was very nice, and it was clean. Everything made fresh right in front of you! A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight, great place. Our server (don't know his name), was a great guy he helped with everything, very friendly and a personable guy. Food was delicious, we got a build your own OMG! with half meat lovers, half Hawaiian type of pizza. The pizza itself is giant, absolutely amazing crust, plus the fact the use traditional leavening and no commercial yeast. The establishment was a bit small, so it would be hard for a big group to fit in there. Other than that, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love Pizza, Ive had it all over Las Vegas and other cities. I've got to say, this is a legit pizza joint. Hands down, the best pizza in the city. Now I cant have pizza at any other place. Those chain pizza places are a joke now."}
{"text":"This place is one of the gems in North Las Vegas. Their pizza is delicious and unlike any other. They have interesting specialties with topping combinations you wouldn't normally think of, but taste amazing together. The perfect example is the Vegas Meets Italy- it has the perfect balance of sweet (date sauce) and salty (prosciutto). Their dough is handmade fresh with no preservatives. Their rosemary lemonade and garlic knots are tasty as well. Definitely ask for extra garlic sauce!

The atmosphere and decor adds to the overall experience- rustic, quaint, like a true old school pizzeria. It's a perfect date night spot.

To top it off, the workers there are so nice and have the best customer service. Even when the restaurant is crazy busy, they still manage take the time to come out from behind the counter to personally deliver the food to the tables and ask how your meal is going. We asked for a to-go box from over the counter and the server actually came out to hand deliver it to us at our table. It was such a small gesture but we really appreciated the extra effort. 

There seems to always only be about three workers, and I noticed that the younger guy (didn't catch his name, but he's always there) goes above and beyond. He seems to do it all- he's the one taking orders, answering the phones, running the line, taking the food out of the oven, and even busing the tables. You can definitely tell that they all take pride in their restaurant and quality of their food.

I don't think you can get better than this. They were even featured in a Las Vegas magazine as one of the best restaurants. Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"sooooo i wasn't too pleased with it this time....the first time i had it the service was excellent and the food was delicious and fresh.....not so much this time....the customer service was bad...nobody greeted me when i came in and the pizza was super overly greasy and chewy...like eating rubber....i know pizza is supposed to have some grease but geez....we could hardly bite through it....Sad part is i actually recommended this place and now none of us want to ear here again... :("}
{"text":"Love their pizza! Fair price for what you get. Rosemary garlic knots are also very good. Stella on draft is always a plus too. Inside is very small but has a cozy feeling to it."}
{"text":"As soon as I stepped into Old School Pizzeria, I knew I was going to like this place. Located on Craig across the Cannery and nestled alongside a barber shop, Old School Pizzeria is a nice surprise. The menu is written along the walls on chalkboard, the lighting fixtures that dangle above the tables adds an interesting touch, and the seating is bench-style. We were warmly greeted by the cashier who took the time to answer any questions we had about some menu items. He came off a genuine person who was passionate about food - you don't get that often.

CALZONE ($8.99): This calzone was made with love! The calzone comes stock with 3 types of cheese. Toppings are an addition $0.75. I got mine with black olives, bell peppers, and mushrooms. The smoked and ricotta cheese were amazing, and the veggies were of the high-quality artisanal variety. Served with a side of marinara sauce. I was only able to eat half. 

PIZZA COMBO ($7.99): When they say Monster slices, they aren't kidding. This slice of pepperoni pizza was humongous! Thin crisp crust and perfectly cheesy. There's a few different combo options you can choose from, the mister got his with a half-order of garlic- rosemary knots. 5/5

GARLIC ROSEMARY KNOTS ($3.45): Probably the best garlic knots I've ever tasted. A half-order comes with 6 knots, each one brushed with olive oil and topped with rosemary and soft garlic cloves. You could literally spread a clove like butter on the knots. The side sauce served with knots was to die for. It wasn't ranch, but some kind of fancy sauce (the name escapes me). 

I regret not coming to Old School Pizzeria sooner. This place is officially my new favorite pizza spot!

Located in North Las Vagas, across from Cannery North which is essentially just south of Siberia according to many Las Vegans, Old School Pizzeria had long been bookmarked for a visit, and stopping in after an early movie at Galaxy Theaters I found the small pizzeria just over half full - a couple of folks already enjoying a meal while others awaited to-go orders, an Air Force Squadron from nearby Nellis entering mere moments in my wake.

Small in size and modest in décor, the menu by Gio Mauro written in chalk with locally sourced produce and top-quality purveyors like Mary's Free Range Chickens featured prominently amidst options both classic and creative, a visit to Old School starts at the counter across from stainless-steel ovens and tempting with several individual orders plus several items to share the only question is where best to invest, my order of one appetizer, a 50/50 small Specialty Pie, and a trio of cannoli tallying just shy of $25 though a mistake in preparation would instead see two full pizzas arrive for the price of just one.

Using only naturally leavened dough, the sort which maintains great stretch and subtle yeast even when nicely charred, it was with a small order of garlic knots that the meal began and with ample butter serving to carry notes of rosemary high on the palate my original skepticism for accompanying \"ranch\" was quickly dispelled, the rich aioli far lighter than I'd ever expected...though perhaps best avoided for those on a first date as the garlic aromatics are indeed quite profound.

Having mentioned the small hiccup in my half-and-half pie it was after perhaps twenty minutes of surfing free WiFi that the first single-style pizza was served, and quickly offering to make amends with my second choice free of charge it was only at the Pizzaiolo's insistence that I finally agreed, the Regina Margherita served just fifteen minutes later and offering a whole lot of leftovers eventually gifted to a homeless man out front of Santa Fe Station en route home.

Speaking to the quality of both pies, and beginning with the crust as any great pizza should, one would be hard pressed to name a better electric fired pie outside of Dom DiMarco's, but with a crust even more crisp yet pliable plus far less 'branding' the smoky rim at Old School ups the ante substantially in both texture and taste, a similar compliment offered to boldly acidic tomato sauce virtually devoid of sugar on a Margherita that could have perhaps used a bit more time to melt the cheese, and even moreso to the sweet meets savory \"Vegas Meets Italy\" that finds fresh arugula providing an apt foil to thinly cut pork plus figs and their infused cream, the pistachios and ample ricotta rounding out textures in each hearty bite.

Limited in desserts, but offering cannolis that they proudly boast as 'filled to order' it was without hesitation that a trio was ordered and packed as if to go I assured the young cashier that such a thing would be entirely unnecessary, each crisp shell packed delicately with whipped ricotta and sweet mascarpone on par with those at Naked City for best in the city - a trio costing less than just one soggy pre-filled tube at Carlo's Bakery on the Strip.

Forgiving the mistake in my order as service recovery went well beyond what was necessary, I'll officially label myself a convert in naming Old School Pizzeria the best in a city with no lack of designer pies from which to choose.  Family owned and operated, without the benefit of a celebrity chef boasting ten ovens or an address including South Las Vegas Boulevard, Old School Pizzeria is the sort of place doing things 'right,' each hand crafted pie receiving careful attention and quality ingredients in a less than likely location well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Wow really good pizza. I didn't expect them to be so good and I'm not even a pizza person. We also got their garden salad and garlic knots. The salad was good I loved their dressing. The garlic knots were ok I thought it would be doughy-er but it's like their pizza crust in bread form. Prices are reasonable and I really like that this restaurant has personality. You'll know what I mean when you walk in. Great place to go for pizza and food in general. We will be back."}
{"text":"We had the pesto five cheese and it was really good. After eating half of it the person I think was the owner came to our table and said he had another pizza in the oven for us because the one he gave us was over cooked. The first pizza was good; I just thought it was a little crispy but nothing wrong with it. You can tell that they only want to serve the best food they can make. I can't say anything bad about the place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Old School Pizzeria. Everything from their pizza to their service was excellent. I ordered a small pizza (half cheese and half five cheese pesto), a half order of garlic knots, and 2 grilled Rosemary lemonades that came in a VERY large mason jar which you can take home, for $30. Everything was delicious. I really had nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Best Pizza on the planet. Can't wait for them to take out a business loan, invest in growth, and take over the world. They have great salads and excellent pizza. I love how they always figure out a way to incorporate the sourdough in the dish if you're not ordering pizza. The slices are large and you can't go wrong with this top of the line pizza joint. I remember when they first opened and had a kinko's banner as their sign. A year later, still the same great food."}
{"text":"This place by far is the best pizza EVER!!!! I'm from Cali and I don't know any other place but this one that's the best. It's freshly made. The pepperoni pizza is sooo amazing , the crust is thin and crunchy. The pizza just melts and sooo yummy. Just absolutely amazing . I can't wait to visit this place again when I come to Vegas. It's about 25 minutes away from the strip, but it's soooo worth it. Trust me"}
{"text":"Tonight, we got the Classic Combo pizza and the Vegas Meets Italy pizza.  They were both fantastic.  One is traditional and the other quite unusual.  The Classic Combo has pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms and olives.  Vegas Meets Italy had gorgonzola, ricotta, mozzarella, arugula, cherry tomatoes, dates and pistachio - unbelievably delicious!  The sweet and savory flavors complement each other. I remember the pizzas in Italy all had the same quality: they were not greasy because they use FRESH and REAL ingredients.  That's what you get from Old School!

As a fan of all things Nutella, I had to get the Nutella gelato.  It's creamy but light...almost like soft-served/frozen yogurt.  Lurv it!!!  Something good in North Las Vegas.  Yay!  Best of all, they deliver.

The pizza place that was previously in this spot went out of business a few years ago and I'm hoping Old School is here to stay.  I'm pretty sure they'll do well since they have great food."}
{"text":"Driving from Utah to Los Angeles and needed a place to eat. The yelp reviews were right on!!! The food was excellent and guys were very friendly. Definitely hitting this place up the next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"They burnt the hell out of my pizza! I know their crust is darker than most places as I eat here fairly often, but this particular time my crust was black and the cheese was dark brown and hard in several places. To make thinks worse I ordered from postmates so I paid $28 for a $16 pizza to be delivered, only to have to drive back there to get another one. When I get to the restaurant the manager has the nerve to lie to me and say \" I told you over the phone our pizzas are dark\" while there were 3 pizzas being cut behind him, and 2 pizzas on people's tables that looked absolutely nothing like mine . I didn't even ask for anything free to offset the delivery charge, or the inconvenience, I just wanted to exchange my pizza and get a i'm sorry about that man. Anything but a bold face lie."}
{"text":"Had pizza here many times, it is awesome the garlic knots and mascarpone suace are great!!!! The cannolis are to die for! Happy everytime we order here"}
{"text":"We've lived in North Las Vegas for over 6years and this is by far the BEST pizza spot around. You can definitely tell the pizza is made from scratch. We've also had their amazing rosemary garlic knots with their special dipping sauce. I definitely recommend trying it out if you want a real authentic meal."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place since they use a sour dough culture rather than conventional yeast, it takes few days to prep the dough. I liked the restaurant it had communal tables. It also seemed like they use farm to table ingredients, I saw that they use free rage chicken for their roast chicken. 

So your order at the counter and then they bring the food to you. They have daily specials and the day I went they had the porchetta sandwich. It was $10 and for those don't know what it is I will explain. Porchetta is the whole pork belly with meat rolled with Italian herbs and spices then string tied and roasted till the meat is tender. It's an amazing piece of pork and hard to find. I have been longing to try this dish for a long time since I had seen it on food network. Definitely did not disappoint. They give it to you on a wooden cutting board with some au ju dip  that sandwich and it's so good. I enjoyed it more than the pizza. The bread was made in house, even though they use a sour dough culture the bread is chewy but very light and airy. 
Now the pizza it was good but I like that they gave you some house made ranch dressing to dip the crust which is tasty. 
I also had one of their salads the gio it was okay. 
Finally I tried their house made canoli which was good. 
Over all I had a good experience and definitely going back. The porchetta is only available on Wednesday as a special. 
Want to try the chicken next time."}
{"text":"I am always in search of a good pie. I have had this bookmarked for well over a year. It might even have been longer. Every time I was on this side of town; it was on a Sunday, and lucky me, they were closed.

Well, fate has finally worked in my favor! A Saturday at the movies gave us plenty of time to grab a slice of pizza. Yes, a slice runs a little over $4. Yet it is the size of my face! The first time I tried them, we got a regular cheese pizza. It was fantastic. The blend of cheeses gave the pie the right amount of salt. The crust was good enough to eat on its own or to use their crack \"ranch\". I am not even a fan of ranch and I liked it.

Since then I've tried the Las Vegas to Italy and the Three Cheese Pesto. Both are flavorful, but a simple pie is all that you need. Their mushroom and sausage is up there on my favorites. 

Good thing a friend works up there. It is totally worth bribing him with alcohol to bring down here."}
{"text":"Best pizzeria in North Las Vegas!  (Maybe even Las Vegas)  We always enjoy their garlic knots, sausage stuffed chicken wings, and their various pizzas.  The quality of their ingredients really shows in the taste of their food.  This is a must try if you like pizza and who doesn't?  Watch out on Friday and Saturday nights--it is often standing room only."}
{"text":"It's not often, actual just about never, that pizza gets thrown away at our house...but sadly enough it has happened a few days after our visit to Old School.

So we were coming back from a hike in Moapa, we were both hungry and tired, pizza sounded like a good option. We were gonna go to our go to place, Grimaldis but I knew we'd be passing Old School Pizzeria and have heard rave reviews, so we agreed to give it a try. The website has an online ordering service so while my husband was driving I was ordering. It sent me a confirmation text that the pizza would be done by 5:57pm. Well we got there about 5:50, so I ran in, it didn't seem too busy so I ran to the restroom before I picked up my order.
When I came out I stood at the counter for a few minutes before I was greeted and asked what they could help me with. I showed him my order confirmation on my phone, he couldn't seem to find it, then printed a slip, and whispered something to the chef. I heard the chef say it was in the oven. I was told it would be a few minutes, so I ordered a Coke and sat down, well it was about 15 minutes later when I actually got my pizza. They really didn't seem that busy, but watching the 2 men making the pizzas, I could see why it took so long, they were very slow!
First of all I have read many reviews on this place that say \"This is a legit old school type pizza place\", it's not at all. The inside is a bit \"done up\" for a pizza place, the cooks were definitely not Italian, they don't toss the dough old school style. Old school pizza places don't give you ranch dressing with your pizza. But I digress.
The pizza looked delicious. We got home and dug in and we were quickly underwhelmed. We got a Half Carnivore and Half Sausage. It was very \"meh\". We ate so we weren't hungry and hoped that in the morning the leftovers would reheat better. Oh and that side of ranch was not good, it didn't help the crust...it may have made it worse.
Well we tried to reheat it the next day, well there was no improvement. We both ate a piece just to eat something. the next day we collectively decided to throw it away, my husband will usually eat anything and he didn't even want it.
So the service and food was subpar, I will never waste my time with this place again."}
{"text":"Damn fine New York style pizza. Sauce was fresh and tangy. The toppings (pepperoni, sliced bacon and mushrooms) was wonderful... The meats and veggies obviously fresh. 

The house salad and the garlic Mascarpone dressing was unique and yummy (good for pizza bone dipping too)... But needs more veggies like tomatoes and carrots and less veggies like raw onions.  

Considering how much it all cost tho, you best be prepared to pay!"}
{"text":"The poor guys at this place seemed to be having a day. First, the internet was down, so the order I placed online did not go through. No biggie, I'm not against pizza right out of the oven, so I waited. Once my pizzas were ready, it was discovered that there was only one cannoli shell for my three cannoli order...gasp! As I was about to be refunded for the cannolis, one of the guys came up from the back and asked if I had 5 minutes as he was making fresh shells as we speak. My fiance would not have forgiven me if I didn't wait. Five minutes later, I was walking out with hot pizza and fresh cannolis. The staff during this time were nice and accommodating, they even gave me an extra cannoli for the trouble, score! We ordered two smalls (which are 14\"!), one with onions and the other with pepperoni and sausage. Both were fantastic and the leftovers reheated well. As for the cannolis, I am waiting for a verdict on that, but only two of the four were left by the next morning, so I assume they get a thumbs up as well. We will defititely be back!"}
{"text":"The only thing that stops me from giving this 5 stars is the small dining area that can sometimes get a little crowded while people wait for their pizza (whether dining in, or dining out), other than that...This is by far the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas so far! An original New York style pizzeria that meets the hype.  The ambiance is so relaxing with soft Italian music playing, the menu creatively decorated on a large chalkboard on the wall, along with the ability to watch their pizza maker make the pizzas.  It comes out with the most amazing, crispy crust, packed with amazing seasonings..really cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Went here a year and a half ago or so and it was OK. Today was something special! It was packed for a reason at lunch time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Forget the strip, we'll be coming back every time we drive into Vegas. House made cheeses, imported meats, amazing fresh toppings. Each dish we tried blew us away. Vegas meets Italy pizza is in my top 5 pizzas ever! Salads were delish! Stuffed chicken wings were a MUST ORDER!!! My 15 old son had another order for desert. And top it all off with the best cannolis I have ever tasted, awesome! Service was friendly and helpful. Must go here!"}
{"text":"The pizza tasted like pure salt and it was too greasy, I needed a lot of napkins. I also didn't enjoy the sourdough garlic knots. Way OVERPRICED"}
{"text":"The online ordering system was way too much of a hassle for the mediocre pizza! The sausage was too spicy and the crust was too thin and too chewy. We will not get carry out pizza from them again!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing . F*$&ingg delicious. Fresh ingredients and the crust is perfection. I can probably consume spoonfuls of the sauce. Just sayin."}
{"text":"Just had the best pizza, bread knots and service. Place was busy but so worth it. The crust is so yummy and the sauce they give you, I will totally save this place for my next time in Vegas"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place... the garlic knots are the best I've ever had and I always get the antipasto salad (it is served in an amazing pizza crust)!!! I've been going here for years and the food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. I just noticed it about a week ago, and went there with my girlfriend. We both enjoyed the smell of the pizza cooking in the oven and the staff was polite. I enjoyed the pizza and garlic knots, but I really liked the calzone I got a few days later. The prices are better than most places in north Vegas. This is my new place to order pizza from. Give it a try"}
{"text":"We ate here today and got the Big 14 inch , Pork rules (meet lovers with/pulled pork), Seriously put all the other pizza places to shame! Hands down one of the best in town. Me and husband had 4 slices each and it was just perfect!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? From the moment the door opened and smell hit me I know it was going to be great. Get to the counter and we're welcomed like I walked into a family members house. We ordered the OMG (36 INCH) pizza Conover.  Basically the all meat pizza and an order of garlic rosemary knots. The garlic knots came out first the smelled great but tasted even better. The bread was some of the best I have ever had. Then the pizza arrives. The pizza stand is 3 empty gallon cans of peeled tomatoes. The pizza is the best I have ever had. You can taste the love and passion these guys put into it. The fresh herbs and spices. The sauce was great tasting. The toppings were fresh.  The atmosphere is like being in the kitchen of my best friends house. I have to say everything just perfect and  how I would want it. If I ever owned a restaurant. Thank you for the one of my best eating experiences ever. Can't wait to recommend and be back to dine again ."}
{"text":"We came to this pizzeria after visiting the China Lights display.  This is far from our home but next to Craig Ranch Park. Best lemonade, best garlic knots and best pizza. You need to try their Hard Core Pizza. We are definitely going back even though takes us 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Awesome stop... fresh and unique. Not your typical pizza shop. Ordered some stuffed chicken wings to go!  Headed back to Oregon would defiantly come here again!!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews. 
I absolutely love the decor & ambiance! 
Staff was friendly one gentleman in particular, wish I'd have gotten his name..

Antipasto was delish! Pizza is pretty good. Lemonade (I got bc of reviews) was just okay, a little too sugary for my liking but the presentation was on point!"}
{"text":"Well I have to admit I have never gone to north Las Vegas for a meal...probably because there are way more options on my side of town but since my friend always comes to my side of town I figured it'd be fair to try eating on her side of town for once. 

I was pleasantly surprised! The place is small and quaint, it's quite homey.. You can see your pizza being made which was cool, they have big bread bowls they serve their salads in, and homemade  cannolis!! The pizza was really good And the cannoli was ok too! I liked the place and will def. be back!! :)"}
{"text":"Great authentic thin crust pizza with fresh toppings. The Vegas meets italy was fantastic. Large sizes. Small fed two of us"}
{"text":"This by far has been the pest Pizza I have ever had. The food is very fresh and has excellent taste as well as value really enjoyed the dinner will be coming back soon you have to try this place you won't be disappointed with the quality and service"}
{"text":"One of the better pizza we've had.  The place small but clean.  Service is excellent and the food is above average.  If you want wine you must take your own glass and pay dollars for the glass.  We will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Great customer service.My first time here  with the family we loved it. We order a large pepperoni pizza  a three-piece stuff sausage chicken thighs, large side order of the garlic knots and everything was tasty. we were really satisfied with the food and the service that we will return again and try more of there menu."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, cool atmosphere and great service. Prices were very reasonable and the wait was typical for a pizza to bake."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing about this place! Atmosphere, the employees, and the food. I can't wait to come back. 
Even the music playing is so soothing. Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"This is what happens when you are too hungry too function so for the first time in your life you don't read people's individual reviews and/or look at photos on yelp...

You believe the menu that says that an OMG size pizza feeds 5-6 people. So you muster up the brainpower to do the math and order 2 OMG size pizzas for your group of 10 because I mean, 10/5=2 right? And I'd like to think we are big eaters.

SO WRONG. SO SO SO WRONG.

My boyfriend goes to pick up the pizzas and calls me with shock in his voice double checking that he was picking up the right order because apparently the pizzas are HUGE. I didn't really imagine how huge until they came home with the 2 boxes and we were shocked at how they even fit it in the car door.

Each pizza slice is 1.5 times bigger than your head. I'd say easily 1 foot tall and 8-9 inches wide in the crust! 

The pizza itself is thin and flimsy, so even though we asked for it well done, there is no structure for you to shovel this behemoth of a thing in your mouth. So I had to roll up the pizza onto itself and then later opted for a knife and fork. 

We ordered the Pork Reigns: House Braised Pork, House Made Sausage, Ham, Guanciale, Applewood Smoked Bacon and Salame Calabrese with Mozzarella and Tomato Sauce. This was the better of the two, although I did not find/see any braised pork at all.

and the Classic Combo: Caramelized onions, Roasted bell peppers, Roasted Mushrooms, Black Mediterranean Olives, House made Sausage, pepperoni, tomato sauce. This pizza was just okay. This one is definitely not as loaded as the Pork Reigns. The olives are fresh so be careful many of them still had pits!

The red sauce in general was full of flavor and so were all of the cured meats. The crust is definitely chewy and leaves something to be desired. And if you don't like rosemary, don't get the garlic knots, because they are packed with rosemary flavor.

For 2 OMG pizzas + regular size of Garlic Knots = $102. It was good but it wasn't the best. But we were grateful for how quickly it was prepared along with the convenience of something other than Mexican fast food in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza.   This is not Pizza Hut or dominos.  This is real pizza.  You pay for what you get.  Best pizza in town.  Real cheese and a little taste of Italy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had this for dinner last night and it was one of the best pizzas we have had! We got a large (which looks like an XL) vegetarian and garlic rosemary knots, it was delicious. Definitely will eat here again."}
{"text":"After hearing all the positives about Old School Pizzeria I set off on the 7 mile drive from my office in hopes that I would find that elusive thin crust pizza quality I grew up with back east.

You enter the strip mall encased pizzeria and it is like walking into an italian pizza shop.  Rustic breads line a shelf behind the smallish counter.   The benches are stained wood.  The smell of fired crust seeps out of the ovens.  OSP uses only natural leavening ingredients in their crust and avoids artificial ingredients like Xanthan Gum.  This means if you think you need Gluten Free products, don't go to OSP.  (See their website blog for their discussion of Gluten Free).

Blackboards hang on the wall with brain teasers and messages.  In addition to the garlic knots and breads, empty Cannoli shells are piled high. The counter is made of a stone slab with chalk outlines of pizza.  A slice is drawn on the counter so you can see the size of the slice you are getting.  The staff is very friendly and willing to explain the process.  On the counter is a paper with specials.  I opted for a monster slice (smallest size) and a stuffed chicken wing.

I can't tell you what I expected from stuffed chicken wing but the description of a deboned chicken wing stuffed with sausage sounded good.  A part of me feared getting a chicken nugget with a hot dog sticking out but if we don't try new things, we cannot be pleasantly surprised. 

Well, pleasantly surprised is not strong enough to describe how happy I was with the wing.  It was a large wing with a small part of the bone left in as a \"handle\".  The sausage stuffing was worth the extra wait while it was stuffed and cooked.  I could have eaten a dozen of these tender bites of delight.  I could have done without the bits of pistachio or pistachio similar substance, although it isn't a negative, I didn't think it added to it.  (for those with nut allergies be forewarned, the nuts are not mentioned in the description).  The sauce was light and flavorful but did not overpower the wonderful chicken taste with a slightly crisp skin that gave way to the italian sausage.

The pizza was flat with a crisp bottom crust and very fresh ingredients on top.  I had the homemade meatballs as my topping.  These meatballs appear to be cooked with love and care and are not too dense.  OSP doesn't skimp on the topping either so this one large slice was more than filling.  The sauce is sweet but the pizza could have used a bit more flavor.  Also, while I could definitely taste the quality of the crust, there was a slight burnt aftertaste to the thinner parts.  I did enjoy the thicker outer crust portion however.

For dessert, I opted for a cannoli.  I won't eat Cannoli's that are prestuffed for two reasons.  1) you never know how long ago they were stuffed and the filling is usually made of ingredients that have short shelf lives and 2) the shell becomes soggy.  OSP does it old school, filling the cannoli only after you order it and you can watch them do it.  It tastes as good as it sounds.

I also enjoyed the tea. They have jar's of unsweetened tropical tea and rosemary lemonade.  You pay for the tea and the jar the first time, then you keep the jar and if you bring it back the next time, your tea is 1.50 cheaper.  If you don't the jar is perfectly usable to package tea, preserves, or other items if you want to.  The tea tastes great too.

Finally, a shout out to the staff and owner(s?).  Everyone in the place was friendly and truly cared about what they were doing.  Although you can expect your pizza to take a bit longer here, you know it is because they are making sure your fresh ingredients are properly made, placed and cooked thoroughly.

The website offers some interesting cooking tips and blogs and games   The last event was October 2013 so I hope they post a new one soon.

Looking forward to doing it old school soon. (I have to, I bought the tea jar. )"}
{"text":"I don't understand all of the 5 star reviews for this place. We have been looking for a good pizza place for a long time and we decided to try this place based on the reviews. I don't know what it was about the pizza but it just was not good at all. I ordered the vegetarian pizza and it had a strange taste. The prices were ok but I guess my taste buds are different."}
{"text":"Seriously - this is a real pizza joint!

I had the pork rules slice.  The crust is thin but not too thin.  The crust has a nice body too it with a crusty bottom, a bit of chewiness and a nice flavor. The slice was huge.  The pizza was topped with roasted pork, bacon, sausage, ham and pepperoni.  This is a great pie!  I know I could stop there. 

I checked in on yelp and cashed in on a free gelato.  Holy smokes - \"I, Jason C. hereby solemnly swear to never eat regular ice cream ever again.  I do declare to eat only handmade gelato from Old School Pizzeria.\"  The pistachio gelato was that good.

I was ready to leave when I asked the guy behind the counter if those were \"homemade cannoli shells?\"  I asked because the shells were dark.  Real cannoli shells have a darker color because they are made with red wine.  It is rare to find homemade cannoli shells.  He said, \"yes.\"  I said, \"oooo I want one.\"  

Goodness - Authentic gelato and a real cannoli.  The pizza.  This place is legit.

Bring cash."}
{"text":"our second time here but it has been a few years since our first visit.  Our first time the slice was so greasy that the crust was barely crust anymore, hubby stopped in for a slice and some wings and got a dessert and brought it home didn't finish any of it and swore we'd never be back.  The past year or so friends have mentioned OSP a few times and last night we were looking for something 'new' decided to give it a try. This time was a whole new experience I ordered on line and went to pick it up pizza and them delicious balls of garlicky dough.!! Walked in and was waiting my turn in line and the pizza maker asked if I was ordering or had ordered when i gave him my name he repeated my order looked in the pizza oven and gave me an time estimate.  The estimated time when I placed the order was dang near spot on! While I waited the last couple of minutes and others came in to order or pick up you could tell that the two guys working have worked together for a while and do it well.  It was nice to hear sincere friendly chatter to themselves and to the guests.
Got home and enjoyed our grub while the center of the pizza is 'floppier' than our preferred we did really enjoy it for what it is, we're just not the fold my pizza type as per normal if we were or are to be this would be the pizza that convinces us :)

Keep it up OSP :)"}
{"text":"This has been a bookmark FOREVER, so it was with much anticipation that I finally got to dine here with my b/f.  We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch and it was busy, but not so much that we couldn't find a seat.  We were greeted heartily by the guys behind the counter.  I already knew from other reviews and pictures that the Rosemary Garlic Knots were a must, so we had a half order of those (6 for $2.99) plus I had a monster slice with tomatoes and mushrooms.  The $4.60 monster slice is a large slice of pizza which you can add toppings to for $.30 each or 4 or more for $1.20.  The garlic knots lived up to the hype and I would definitely come back for those again.  The pizza itself was alright; I found my slice to be a bit too greasy.  I did like the b/f's Crazy Good Chicken, which he also ordered; I'd have that again.  For a first visit, we were very happy with our food; I'll be looking forward to more of those garlicky knots and maybe a calzone the next go-round."}
{"text":"Horribly rude staff. They lost my order, denied ever receiving it until I showed them the confirmation I received on my phone. When they realized they were wrong they scrambled to try and make it right which was ok, still took 90 minutes to get my order (only 10 minutes to actually cook the pizza, wtf?) garlic knots were soggy and had a weird tinge to the taste. The pizza was alright but the headache to complete an order with them and being treated poorly just isn't worth it. I don't think I'll be making the trip again."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients make the food good.  The salad was made for us and not just pulled out of a bag. The treat of going for take out or eating there is the brain teasers on the blackboard.  we could not get this right- 'What gets broken but is never held?'   the right answer is so simple"}
{"text":"Delicious, quick enough for a weekday lunch and excellent service!

We had the carnivore pizza and garlic knots, both were so fresh, awesome ingredients, and tasted fantastic.

The guys were super friendly and explained everything to us, and seemed genuinely grateful we had visited for lunch.

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid! Really liked the \"old school\" Italian pizzeria motif. Service was very friendly and the pizza itself was good. Def one of the best pizzas in this area. My fave was the ranch actually. It came complimentary with the pizza and it was super delicious"}
{"text":"This is an update to my original review after having eaten here again on 12/26/15 - I dont know what happened to this place but it went downhill from our previous visits. They must have changed cooks. We always order the Classic Combo. This time there were hardly any ingredients on the pizza , hardly any cheese , and the pizza was the thinnist of the thin pizzas I've ever seen. It was so thin and also  mostly just sauce on crust that it sagged and fell apart. It was also kind of flavorless. Unless this place steps up their game again I doubt I'll be coming back. It's sad as I used to recommend it as being the best in Vegas. Now I'm embarrased to recommend it. I have to say that as it stands now the BEST pizza in Vegas award goes to Linos Pizzeria on Tenaya in NW Las Vegas right off the 95 and Ann rd.The following is my original review from over a year ago. - My family is an old Sicilian family and I am picky when it comes to Italian food. This place is the absolute BEST pizza in the entire valley. It doesn't get any better then this in Vegas. Fuggetaboutit !!"}
{"text":"This place is really great and very authentic.  If you like thin crust east coast style pizza, there is just nowhere better, and they have some amazing unique entries.  The owner is clearly passionate about what he is doing over there, and it has a true Italian vibe.  The salads are amazing, and they have a chicken wing stuffed with sausage that is equally amazing.  I grew up on the east coast in the Philadelphia area and know good Italian pizza, and this is it!  I looked all over Vegas for this place, and I drive over there regularly.  The only feedback I have that is not overwhelmingly positive is that one night I was in there and the music was up a bit too loud.....normally it is at an appropriate level so you can talk to others without shouting, and normally it is the appropriate music...(i.e. Frank Sinatra, or classical).....for the place.  If I had three thumbs, I'd point 'em all up.  Dave S/North Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This pizza establishment is a cross between almost upscale but very self help casual. 
The music, furniture and decor makes it feel upscale and the help yourself to drinks and order at counter makes it casual. 

There are very few tables, seven small to be exact.
and a counter that fits three. 
The floors are a bit dirty and the tables have plastic wrap on them. I'm guessing to keep clean up to a minimum.  

Inside was incredibly hot and uncomfortable, this is why I'm leaving four stars. I know it's vegas and summer but I've been to plenty of places that weren't that hot inside.  


The drink machine is one of those coke mixed drinks, I unfortunately don't like these. The coke always tastes terrible to me, even when I let it run before filling up cup. 

The staff was very friendly, the owners cousin Steve was super friendly, caring and was very attentive to all the customers.  

The pizza, I was recommended by a friend to come try it out. It was good, the crust was a little burnt, I however am picky about pepperoni and the pepperoni was actually very good! There wasn't a lot of grease from the cheese either.  I have to say the dipping sauce was pretty amazing!! 

The restaurant is kind of in a sketchy area but for sure try it at least once!! I know a lot of people that rave about it, my son is a picky eater and he said the crust was delicious and wanted to always get his pizza here!"}
{"text":"Dank pizza!!!

Their dough is made in house and they have the recipe down!
 
It has a good amount of chew and softness to it with a touch of salt. And it's baked in a stone oven!! 

One of my friends recommended this place to me many times and them being right the st it was only right to try it! 

I'll definitely be back soon for a slice!!  

I regret not taking a picture. 

That slice didn't stand a chance."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this fabulous pizzeria.  The pizza, garlic knots and cannolis are so delicious; pure perfection.

Service is awesome, excellent customer service.  I guess I'll keeping making my 20 minute journey to/from in order to enjoy fresh, quality food.  No need to go anywhere else, this is the only pizzeria worth visiting and giving my business to."}
{"text":"My first time. Had the monster slice + stuffed chicken leg. It was delicious. What is not to like here. Everything looked good. I need to come back and explore the menu more. 

Yum Yum :-)"}
{"text":"Sooo bomb!!! Pizza and those rosemary garlic knots are amazing!!! Definitely worth it"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best all around pizza places I've been to. Homemade crust, homemade ingredients, and the best lemonade I've ever had.  Additionally, I'm not a salad guy but this place has the salads!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Definitely old school Italian style, the marinara is made with fresh tomatoes!  If you are partial to American style pizza, this place may not be for you.  Nice guys too.  I wish they had beer on tap but it's cool that they let you bring your own.  We will definitely come back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"After stubbornly avoiding this place for several months I decided to give them a second chance, and I'm glad I did.  This restaurant is located in a tiny strip-mall on Craig & Lawrence (accross from the Cannery).   Went on Saturday 9-26-15 at about 7PM to get some pizza.  

The place is kinda small but in an intimate, swanky-bistro kinda way.  The light fixtures are really cool, the lights are dimmed, there's some classy italian music playing in the background.  It's the kind of atmosphere that makes you instinctively lower your voice and act like a damn lady for a minute.  The atmosphere and food screams expensive but it's not at all.

So here's how it goes...you go up to the counter and order and they'll call you when it's ready then you go over and pick it up.  I really like their way of selling pizza by the slice.  Instead of making a ton of different pizzas and selling slices, they have cheese pizzas ready and they add the toppings you want and then pop the slice in the oven for a minute.  Genius.  

$8.64 got me a slice of cheese pizza and a small garden salad.  I love that the salad came already dressed and on the same plate.  The pizza had a great crunchy bottom and a gooey top.  A bit too much sauce for my liking but that's just a personal preference. AND THEY GIVE YOU RANCH DRESSING AUTOMATICALLY!! And not just any ranch...tasty ranch like wingstop.   I tried my friend's garlic knots and I was hooked.  I don't even like rosemary but them knots are legit.  They have an almost sourdough quality to them and they're buttery and basically irresistable.  I'm pretty sure I'm in love.  When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan of their pizza and believe it or not, because the crust is so delicious, the best pizza is their cheese pizza; the way good old fashioned pizza originated and was intended. If I need to add a lot of toppings it is because the good old basic pizza is not good enough. 

Con, it is very expensive pizza. Yelp rated is $$ it is definitely a $$$ pizza joint and the ambience is just a simple basic strip mall facility with limited seating and bright lighting.

We waited 57 min. for our pizza to be made and served and they weren't busy, only two other tables were seated, one party already had their food and one got their food shortly after we arrived. I bought one soda for my son when we got there because I am not a big soda drinker but after waiting and waiting we ended up going to the register two more times to buy sodas for others. You would think that because of the extensive wait they would have just invited us to help ourselves to the soda fountain but that was not the case. I just think it would have been a nice gesture for good customer service. Yes, the one guy at the register was friendly but they should probably rethink their business model.  When your menu prices are that expensive, you need to make people feel like they are getting value elsewhere instead of feeling squeezed for every penny."}
{"text":"Very Yummy Pizza!!
We are never unhappy with this pizza, it is always so delicious and everyone is super friendly. 
Highly recommend trying this place if you have not!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed w/ the food here.  The outside is a hole in the wall but once you step inside I started to get a better vibe about this place.

Calzone $12 - Exceptional - I was able to try the Calzone ($7.99) and add any toping I wanted (additional +$4 for unlimited topping).  I added bacon, sausage, garlic, extra mushrooms, pepperoni, and cheese.  While this wasn't cheap, it made up for in quality.    This thing tasted great!  It was cooked perfectly.  Baked on the outside, cheese creamy on the inside, all the meats cooked to perfection.  I was 100% satisfied w/ this dish.

Pizza slice -$4 - Above average- A \"monster\" slice of pizza runs about $4, and the name should be taken seriously; the size of the slice is about the size of a football!  I was able to try my friends pizza slice and it was delicious.  Thin-crust, crunchy, and not over the top oily.  Fresh ingredients too.  A slice by itself should make any person full.

Tips:
-Not good for large groups.  The inside probably houses about 15 people to sit."}
{"text":"What a find! We tried this before a show at the Cannery after a friend rec it. We had a salad and slice combo and i tell ya it was the biggest slice I have ever had. Delicious too!. Salad was very nice and fresh and the service was terrific too. There are a couple drawbacks.....NO wine or beer which would be a very nice addition. The other problem is that it is so small that it would be tough to bring a group of friends to show off this little slice of heaven in the desert."}
{"text":"Seriously.   Best.  Pizza.  In.  Vegas. 

You have to try this place! 

The dough is incredible.  Soft.   Flavorful.   Delicious. 

The quality of the ingredients is on point.   You can taste that they are quality and fresh. 

There are some interesting selections for pizza or you can build you own to suit your tastes. 

Of course there are negatives.   The price is pretty high for a pizza.   We got 2 smalls and paid over 40 bucks.   Also, the cooks are the servers so it wasn't the cleanest (I sat at 3 different tables looking for a clean one and my bf found dead and one live cricket in the bathroom.)

But overall I'd eat here everyday that's how good the food is and that's why they still get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza with fresh ingredients. The decor sets up a really nice vibe and the music compliments the experience. 9/10 will eat here again."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN LAS VEGAS HANDS DOWN!! My family and I always come here before a movie and share a pizza and house salad. They have generous portions and the best part is the sourdough crust... it's THAT good."}
{"text":"I can't believe we have overlooked this place the entire time we lived in North Vegas. I had always seen this place on the corner of an awful little business building, and never once went in. I wish I had A LOT sooner....WOW!!!

The food here is beyond authentic. Everything is fresh, and the menu offers a lot of choices with most ingredients being organic, everything is homemade. Very reasonably priced and great portions. Love the \"old school\" feel of this place. We love the pizzas (both whole pies and by the slice) the salads, and the neat fresh lemonade they serve in canning jars. Fresh pizza dough and bread....YUM!

We have been back several times since discovering this place on a whim....The staff here is gracious, friendly and very customer service oriented. Every single one of them. Absolutely impressed every time. Anytime we are in North Vegas, this is our spot. My highest recommendation, it's great on every level!!!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Great dough. Great sauce. Great ingredients, Great service. One of the best places for pizza in the city, state, and country. And that is coming from someone who lived in NYC for 45 years and visits regularly, and has tried at least 500 different pizzas over my life.
Also, the crazy good chicken is awesome."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza! Great service! A definite must if you're in the North Las Vegas area. All the pizzas are made before you're eyes to order. The bread knots are also incredible."}
{"text":"In the old school pizzeria lives up to its name truly traditional pizza and fresh garlic cloves. We watch them make your food grinder cheese cut your meat and a fantastic restaurant. It just happens to be across from on of my favorite theaters app deal worth a trip. Cozy dinning area. The garlic rosemary knots are extremely addictive. More to follow.

They made some sliced tomatoes with homemade vinaigrette with fresh mozzarella.... Yummy!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! Classic Combo was perfect. Crust was crisp and light. Garlic knots and salad were super as well."}
{"text":"After seeing all the rave reviews, I looked forward to trying this pizzeria myself.  Living in North Las Vegas, where good dining out options are quite limited, a fine pizza shop is a welcome addition.  And, unlike many all-purpose Italian restaurants that serve pizza almost as an afterthought, Old School has a lazer-like focus on pizza.  Plus, it produces excellent-tasting pizza!

But before I get ahead of myself, let me backtrack a bit--because I started out with an Old School Antipasto Salad, which turned out to be salame, ham, Provolone Cheese, onion, black olives, tomatoes, peppers, Mozzarella Cheese, and lettuce in a large, hollowed out bread bowl.  It was huge and the combined flavors were excellent.  I wisely ate almost none of the dough, and would have been just as happy to have had all of the ingredients presented on a plate.  It seemed like a big waste of bread.

Just after I placed my order for an 18-inch Pepperoni, Mushroom, & Sliced Tomato Pizza, chef/owner Gio began to turn away, and seemed surprised when I mentioned a second 18\" pizza for my wife.  I then told him that we \"don't mess around when it comes to pizza.\"  We almost always order two larges, eat as much as we can, and gladly take the rest home for additional meals.  Plus, from my experience large pizzas taste better than smaller sizes, just like it is harder to get a Petite Filet Mignon done right compared to an 8 to 12 ounce Filet. 

My 18\" Pepperoni, Mushroom, & Sliced Tomato Pizza was a little greasy on top (which I actually don't mind) but excellent New York style pizza with mild pepperoni, tasty flat mushroom slices, good cooked sliced tomatoes, and both Romano and Parmesan Cheese dropped upon a delicious red sauce--except some spots of char on the underside of the dough made parts of my pizza taste a little bitter.  Neither of the other two 18 inchers at my table--a Cheese Pizza and a Sausage Pizza with Extra Cheese--were noticeably charred on their bottoms.  The sausage on top looked a bit unusual, because it was spread in the form of thin, flat, and long strips rather than small elevated clusters; the sausage itself was mild.  The cooked pizza dough was just right for a New York style pizza--not too thick and not too thin, pliable, foldable, and with just a slightly upraised outside edge.  All three specimens were mighty fine pizzas!  

My small group of four also asked for some Cannoli and gelato.  For 4 dollars Chef Gio said he would take care of this for us, after which we were generously presented with three really excellent Cannoli and six small dishes of gelato, including Nutella (Chocolate Hazelnut), Peanut Butter with Coffee Crunch, and Pistachio.  Of these, the Pistachio Gelato had the strongest flavor; the Nutella was very good but not as rich as others I have recently sampled elsewhere; and the Peanut Butter with Coffee Crunch variety was fortunately muted in flavor rather than overbearing.

Be forewarned.  This establishment is very small in size, with seating for only 9 or 10 diners.  So I advise getting here before or after the dinner rush.  It will be worth the trip.  Only slight burning of parts of one of three pizzas precluded a five-star rating on this initial venture.

A solid 4-1/2 stars!"}
{"text":"My GO TO pizza place in north Vegas. The staff have always been friendly, whether it was on the phone or in person. The pizza is so good, the crust reminds me of sourdough. (Which makes the crust the best part) their garlic rosemary bread knots are a MUST. Be sure to ask for extra white dipping sauce for them!"}
{"text":"Wow. Up there with Home Slice Pizza, Austin. Quality, top to bottom. Chewy, fresh  sourdough crust. Beautifully designed sauce with a hint of basil. The meats are top notch. Safe to say it's the best in Vegas. The homemade lemonade doesn't let you down. Pride in ownership. Only complaint is the AC. It's always warm in here."}
{"text":"I'm from New York, so I know good pizza. That said, this is probably some of the best pie your going to find this side of the Mississippi."}
{"text":"Husband decided to order the OMG sized pizza here because even though the Large was plenty... I'd like  to think he was mildly curious because there was only 3 of us, and more MIL doesn't eat much. The pizza was great, NY style crust which is what we like in our house but the garlic knots lacked chopped garlic and seasoning so it was a miss but not enough to keep me away. Just had 4 cloves of oven roasted garlic with them which for garlic knots is weird to me. That part was my only complaint. Will order from again, not  h OMG size but a reasonable size for 2 adults.. if we do parties for our kids it will be the OMG because that size could feed an army!"}
{"text":"Super impressed by this tiny spot.

I was invited to join a friend for dinner and I went a little nuts. House Garden salad, rosemary garlic knots, pizza. I ordered all the things. 

The parking lot is a bit of a squeeze, which was also a preview for the pizzeria. It's counter service with someone floating around to food run. The menu is written on chalkboards on the walls and also above the register. The staff is friendly and knowledgable, and I think they were just as excited as I was that this was my first time.

The pizza was delicious. I mean, it's pizza. I went with the Five Cheese Pesto and added their house-made sausage. Melt in your mouth good. The knots weren't as garlicky as I hoped, but they were fluffy little balls of bread heaven. I will 100% be ordering the Garden salad again. I'm not sure what the creamy dressing is, but I want to bathe in it.

I'm now plotting to get pizza from here, since reminiscing about this experience, tonight for dinner."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we stopped into this place for a pie. The small size is gluttonous for two adults, the sauce is just the right amount of sweet and the pizza itself a hearty thin with great bones.  Oh!  I almost forgot, they serve with a garlic infused creamy dip with is an amazing compliment to the cost and knots!!  

The garlic knots are artisan sourdough  with toasted garlic cloves.   The dough, knots, cannoli are all fresh made.  The sausage is made in shop and sliced thin like salami, along with fresh roasted peppers and everything else.  

Old School is the perfect name for the product and service we received.  We come through Vegas with regularity and this spot is sure to be on the list for future trips being a quick hop from i15. Please support and #eatlocal you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"You can tell they take pride in the pizza that serve.  Everything was fresh & well made. We enjoyed the Classic Combo pizza & The Carnivore pizza & a Old School Antipasto Salad.  It was absolutely worth bypassing the strip, as we were in route to Utah. 
The decor is perfect repurposing pallets as bars tops for bar seating, & large cans as pizza holders.  The only minor drawback is that they only have about 4 tables which means you may have to wait for a table or take it to go. But either way, worth the wait.  
The next time we make the trip we are trying the Crazy Good Chicken & the Pork Reigns pizza.  Until next time...."}
{"text":"This place definitely has good pizza and their sauce was my favorite !!
Inside was nice but I think they need a bigger venue, they get too busy to seat all their customers."}
{"text":"Went to Old School Pizzeria a few weeks ago with a dinner group.  What a wonderful experience!  They went an extra mile to accomodate us and really make our experience one we will none soon forget.  The food was delicious and the service was great!  I have been back already and will back again soon!
Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pies!!!!  I have been here a few times, each time, different order, food was great!  The garlic knots are awesome with plenty of Rosemary.  Parking on the side street is easiest.  Buy by the slice or whole pie.  They also sell homemade ice tea in mason jars."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas.  It smells like an East Coast Italian restaurant!!  I will be back to try other items on the menu.  Had to get the pizza again!"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing. I can't say enough about this place! Don't let the exterior or the location fool you, these guys are serious about their food. It's the dough, and the water they use to make it--out of this world good! Ordered take out ~2min before they closed (like peasants) and they STILL had great customer service and food quality. Run, don't walk to old school."}
{"text":"Went in to see Chef Gio tonight and was amazed. We had the Pork Rules pizza - we loved all the different pork toppings and the dough was brilliant. The Antipasto is served in a breadbowl and was better than I expected it to be. My real Favs came in some unusual places - Garlic Knots, Gelato, and Canoli. The ingredients and technique used in this casual establishment far surpass expectation.
There are some older reviews saying cash only, but we found today CREDIT CARDS ARE ACCEPTED!!! BONUS!
Let's keep local businesses going!"}
{"text":"Had a lunch date here with my husband and I didn't want to go. I had just labored through three miles (running) and I didn't want to ruin what I had just accomplished with pizza. Wow, was I surprised! The decor is pleasantly surprising given the area. I had Gio's salad, the garlic knots, a cannoli, and the grilled lemon and rosemary lemonade! I could eat this over and over. I will definable be a return customer. The service is outstanding and it really feels like you are in someone's kitchen."}
{"text":"WOW! My taste buds are singing!!! Fresh! Flavorful! DELICIOUS!!!! This has to be one of the BEST pizzas I've ever experienced!"}
{"text":"Great little gem hidden in the middle of a strip mall. Hub & I split a calzone and a cannoli. Both were delicious. You can tell they really use fresh, quality ingredients here. 

Only two downfalls that made this not a five star rating:

1. Ambience. Dining in area is extremely tight. There's only about 7 tables in this restaurant, and patrons extremely are rude. Taking up a table for an extra pizza box so no one can sit next to them? Ridiculous. 
2. Barber shop next door attracts ghetto people. I came out to find my car had been leaned on and hand prints all over it from teen kids playing around it. 

Great food. Crappy ambience and location. Might want to consider an new location if they want to continue grow their business."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever, vegas meets Italy simply does not tasty like any pizza! It tastes like an Italian fancy dish!!! AMAZING! And healthy too! The dough is delicious and it can be eaten by itself and the atmosphere is great! Definitely, one of those places you go once a week!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza place I have or had it was so amazing. The dough is  the greatest I've ever tasted and extremely delicious better than any other pizza place I ever had! I just had a cheese pizza. And my boyfriend had some wings that were stuffed I honestly could go there again and again!"}
{"text":"I don't live in Vegas, but my mother moved there a few months ago and was complaining about the lack of good pizza in her area. So I took to yelp, read the great reviews for Old School Pizzeria, and dragged my family over to experiment while there on a visit. They were not all too keen on the experiment since they tend to judge books by their covers, but am glad to report it was worth the trip...

Despite the plain exterior and the tiny interior, this place is a gem! I have no idea how people can find the slice and soda deal expensive...$5 and the slice is monstruous! We went for lunch and I could not bring myself to eat dinner, hours afterward.

The rosemary garlic knots are to die for, and my BF answered a riddle and got a free cannoli! All and all my family was quite pleased, ran out of there with a take home menu, and have proclaimed this place their new neighborhood pizza joint. 

Great find, thanks yelpers!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious. Today was my second visit and both times we saw the owner. First time he was seated next to is. We order the carnivore, and the garden salad. Both are very fresh and tasty. The salad came in a bread bowl that appeared to be baked in the restaurant. The pizza itself is pretty greasy due to the fact that it's all meat, but it still has that fresh meat taste. I had bacon on the pizza that I've never seen so thin, just melts in your mouth. 

I will be returning, and I would definitely recommend them over any of the big name pizza places."}
{"text":"So I've since left Las Vegas...but I can't stop thinking about the quality of ingredients at old school as well as the atmosphere. Bring your own bottle of wine, share with the chef and enjoy dinner how it should be."}
{"text":"Handmade pizza the way it was meant to be! Not bastardized and has fresh ingredients. My favourite is mushroom, garlic and olives. Their pastas are super tasty as well; however you haven't lived until you've tried one of their AMAZING CANOLES!!!!!! Crispy golden casing dusted with warm cinnamon and a rich creamy texture on the inside- not too sweet. I'm hungry!!!"}
