{"text":"First time at baton Rouge,  I was not really impressed. The decor was just blah, the tables were chipped yet the service was decent. I ordered my steak medium well which came back medium rare, vegetables were half raw. The best thing on my plate was the baked potato. Don't think I'll be coming here again"}
{"text":"I ordered the ribs and they were delicious the food was not the issue it was the service. Our servers name was Sean H. He was nice but put an order wrong, he forgot a beverage that was asked at the beginning of the evening and brought it near the end of the meal as I reminded him. Our friend asked for her bill 3 times and we asked for ours twice and he came and gave us our bill but left again to go get the machine and that took an extra half an hour. some of our friends got their food burnt and the house paid but they didn't get a new plate. overall horrible horrible service and the food for me personally was good but for others it was a hit or miss."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much , I initially wanted to visit a different restaurant but it was closed already.  Food was decent and service the same although it was definitely on the slow side."}
{"text":"First time eating here... I loved the lobster poutine I chose for my appetizer. First time ever having lobster and savored every bite. Absolutely delicious. My girlfriend had the Thai shrimp. They were good but a bit pricy for the small serving. Followed up with the steak and crab cake dish. The crab cake was good but a bit greasy. The steak was a perfect medium rare as requested. My girlfriend had the bacon burger and she thought it was delicious aside from the arugala that come on the burger.  The customer service was good, waitress always asking if we enjoyed the food or if we needed anything. Went for a special occasion and it was a bit out of the way but if ever in the area I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to go to Baton Rouge for a dinner to celebrate and to hang out. The theme and decor was quite nice and the dim lights making it pretty relaxing to just be in, noise level was a little loud but it was perfect for a friends get together of sorts.  The service was good in my opinion, I ordered a top sirloin covered with goat cheese crumble (medium rare), the food took a time to come but considering the amount of people that night I'd consider it to be okay. But my steak came overcooked, I mentioned it to the waitress and she politely took it back and got me a new one which again took some time but this time it came to a perfect medium rare. Overall, besides my steak being over cooked, everything else was amazing."}
{"text":"My visit to the Front street Baton Rouge has got to be one of my all time worst restaurant experiences.  I really wanted to enjoy myself since I love eating at the other locations but this place was horrible.  Other than my girlfriends meal which was 'ok' everything was wrong with this place.  My meal was cold. They forgot my appetizer twice. My manhattan was mostly ice and probably not made with bourbon (as i requested). Oh well, i'll stick to the Eaton Centre and North York locations.  Those places are great."}
{"text":"Service was alright, no problems. She served our entrees within 15 minutes of order. The mood is good for dates. Although I went with multiple People. The drinks are refilled by a waiter timely. Overall the entrees do fill you up. If you are looking to have dinner here bring atleast $30. Also lunch is served from 11-4pm"}
{"text":"Ribs are decent, pulled pork sandwich is decent, potato cheddar soup was good, rib steak was terrible: sinewy and tough as hell, virtually inedible. Order correctly and you'll probably be happy, but order the wrong thing and you'll be going for fast food afterward."}
{"text":"Very similar to the chain Friday's in America.  Huge portions.  Didn't like that they wouldn't substitute even though what I had requested was the same price and I even offered to pay an additional fee.  Food was decent, nothing that left me wanting for more but decent.  Friendly servers.  The decor is a bit dark, could definitely use a bit more lighting."}
{"text":"Came here for a Birthday dinner, I was very unhappy with the Lobster Risotto, risotto is supposed to be creamy,this looked and tasted like they used instant rice and threw a can of niblets corn on top. It was dry and the corn added nothing to the dish.There was sufficent lobster, on the whole it didn't even resemble risotto. Service was good and attentive.  Would definately not recommend this dish to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party and had the lobster poutine a Baton Rouge burger. The poutine is not the best but it's ok. The burger is pretty good. Similar to other Baton Rouge. Good for groups and small gatherings"}
{"text":"We were looking for good quality, reliable fare while on vacation in Toronto are last June 2014, visiting from Montreal. Baton Rouge delivered as expected. Service was great; food was great. My three kids were well taken care of by the waiter. Only the size of my delicious filet mignon was very small compared to the price... but else, was great as usual."}
{"text":"I went last night.  Service from waitress (Sarah E) was very good.  Fries and burger also good.    But one MAJOR COMPLAINT:  I had purchased multiple Dealfind offers ($20 for $40 voucher) and was told I could not use one of them as it was a \"game night\" (the Blue Jays were playing).  This was very, very, very disappointing as the fine print on the voucher noted the only exception dates were: New Year's Eve, Mother's Day and Valentine's Day.  If game nights were to be excluded, this should have been noted up front with the Dealfind offer!  I am very disappointed with Baton Rouge as a result, including the one male server who told me of this news!  Completely misleading!  No apology, and poorly communicated!    I will only go to Baton Rouge again to use up my vouchers, but after that never again!"}
{"text":"Great service but disappointed in the food.  My dining companion ordered the potato soup.  He said it was delicious but only received a half bowl.  Next - the fall off the bones ribs.  He ordered the larger size.  I guess if you order the smaller portion, you will receive regular size ribs but if you order the larger size, you receive one normal size rack and then a few bones on a rack that was less than 2 inches of over cooked ribs and burnt sauce.  The normal rack was very good.  I ordered the chicken tenders.  Fries were undercooked.  My margarita was delicious.   The restaurant is looking tired.  In need of some polish and re-staining."}
{"text":"Food had no taste , the steak had no flavour and it was not cooked properly. The mashed potaoed only had garlic and no salt. Also the br cookie wasnt fresh. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Good signature chicken salad.  Service is good.  Price is a bit high.   No parking validation."}
{"text":"Great service good food Really, awesome servers, great manager. The food we ordered was good, not spectacular. I had a minor issue with one dish and the manager was a sweetie and took it off our check. The staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive and the atmosphere was nice after a long day. Great place to go before a bluejays game or if you are staying at the Renaissance."}
{"text":"Very nice ribs, pretty much fall off the bone  The chicken with the ribs are also very moist and tender."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my anniversary with boyfriend. We were looking for a place that we can use our Cadillac gift card, and yeay! We don't need to eat food court food. He had a devil's burger and I had the top sirloin along with sweet potato fries.  Steak and burger were average they were not bad not great. The highlight of my meal was the sweet potato fries they were so good and fluffy! I also had a cup of coffee and the trio creme brulee. And they were also average but the atmosphere was great for a date."}
{"text":"Fabulous experience! Service was excellent. There was no waiting to be seated or waiting for our food even though the place was getting pretty busy. The waiter was very friendly and offered menu suggestions when we asked for them. Me and my wife both had the ribs. They were delectable. Meat falling off the bone. I didn't have to use the knife at all. The price was very good at $87 and we were stuffed. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I will never EVER eat here again!    Whilst I truly enjoy Baton Rouge's product (at almost all of their other locations), I won't be coming back to this location ever again.  Rude Hostess.    A hurry-up-and-eat mentality from my Waiter throughout the entire meal - which was supposed to be a leisurely evening out.  And food which was strictly \"so-so\".    Not what I am accustomed to from other locations in the Baton Rouge chain.  Nope.    Never ... ever ... again."}
{"text":"I only rated it one star because no star is not an option. If you like cold fries, with alright service then come to this place.  My boyfriend had a chicken tender salad with grilled chicken breast instead. It was so dry and cold that he sent it back. Instead of a fresh breast they re-cooked the old one.  What a health code violation since he had already started to eat it. The salad was missing the palm hearts and artichokes,and the lettuce was brown. The oil and vinegar that was used as dressing were so oily and dirty that he opted to have one of their house dressings. I had ribs and they were only a little warm. It's hard to believe considering they are supposed to be slow cooked for hours. Fries were cold and super greasy like they were cooked in cold oil.  I've been a Baton Rouge customer for over 10 years and it was such a horrible experience that I will never return to this location . The manager told us that the front street location was bought over by new owners. In my option Baton Rouge head office should take away this location  before the new owners ruin it completely."}
{"text":"When we walked in, the first thing we liked was the atmosphere. It is very warm and classy, without much restaurant noise. We ordered the seafood platter and lobster & ribs. The food is pretty decent, gave more mashed potatoes than we can eat so we wasted most of it. Had the trio creme brûlée for dessert which was delicious. The only downside is that the service is very slow.   The restaurant is almost empty, yet our server doesn't check upon us. I was thirsty during half of the dinner experience. Paying the bill took long too, server took a long time to bring the debit machine."}
{"text":"The worst customer service. The place is dirty. Please pick another restaurant. The staff are terrible. Worst lunch."}
{"text":"My third time here and always around Christmas with a group of co-workers.  The 12 of us had a reservation so we were quickly seated at lunch time (just before noon), but I was surprised at the fact the place never got more then half filled.  Previous trips had seen it packed at lunch time.  The waiter was quick with our drinks and order taking and the food arrived within 10 minutes.  Everyone got what they wanted, nobody complained and nothing had to go back for more cooking or any changes which was a nice difference from my first time here.  I was all prepared for a nice sirloin streak, but when reading the menu the Portobello and Goat Cheese Burger caught my eye and I had to try it.  I'm glad I did.  It was 8 ounces of Angus beef with a huge mushroom on top of the meat in a nice, fluffy bun.  Cooked medium just as I'd ordered it, I expected the mushroom to be grilled too, but it didn't seem to be and it had a bit of a stringiness to the texture which I initially didn't find appealing when biting into the burger, but it got less stringy towards the centre of the mushroom and tasted quite nice.  Over all the burger was quite good and I didn't bother putting any condiments on it so I could really taste the beef.  The goat cheese provided a bit of tanginess to it, but I also tossed in a few of the golden fries to help add crunch.  The fries were very good, hot and crispy, but not too hard.  I was able to eat them all before they'd cooled down too much and they didn't seem to get soft like some french fries do within minutes of being served.  Four others at the table also had the burger and everybody seemed to like it, so it seemed to be a good choice.    Most people simply had one of the beers on tap.  The selection was small for a GTA restaurant-bar with just the standard big brewery brands and Keith's, Rickard's and Sleeman's.  I had a pint of Rickard's Red which goes well with most beef dishes.  It's a decent beer, but nothing to write home about.  I had the Decadent Chocolate Walnut Brownie for dessert which comes with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream on it.  Very rich and filling, but surprisingly not too sweet.  Total damage with tax and tip was around $35.  Not bad for a once in a while lunch outing, but there are definitely better and cheaper places for a burger and beer throughout the GTA."}
{"text":"Good and quiet restaurant. I had to wait a little more than expected to get my Filet Mignon; but at the end the wait really paid off. It was a juicy cut of meat, which you'll hardly get juicy if you ask for it well done like I did."}
{"text":"My husband and I were out for a stroll during busker fest (Friday) and wanted a quiet spot for a some drinks and a few apps. We weren't dressed like slobs but still causal as we hadn't pre-planned our night. Considering this, we asked to sit at the bar. My husband inquired about a particular beer and the bar tender was obnoxiously rude! He stated they didn't carry that brand, actually never had. My husband then asked for a suggestion for anything similar. He replied that he couldn't remember what that beer tasted like. Didn't even say what he had available. Then he paused for a bit and said \"why don't you try the Firkin across the street\". Besides the fact that he was putting my husbands selection down, clearly didn't want to sell him another option, then had the audacity to basically tell us to leave I couldn't even be bothered with this jackass of a bartender. He should be fired for the WORST SERVICE EVER. If u don't want to serve then why r u there? I know we weren't buying steak dinners but I know we would have dropped a good amount of money and tipped well on top of it. Needless to say, we walked out and didn't order a damn thing. Never will. It begs the question if this was the bar service, how is the dining room?! After this experience we'll stick to (and I highly recommend) places like The Keg, Jacobs or Ruth's steakhouse.  Don't waste you time and money on this place!"}
{"text":"Took myself out for lunch on a Friday to this place. It was not busy. I was seated quickly by a friendly and effervescent server. I ordered a Caesar with chicken and a glass of wine. Both came very quickly. N'goni was my server. Ask to be seated in his section. He was friendly, attentive and always smiling. He really looks like he loves his job.  Would I go back? For sure! The only thing I found was this place is dark, even at mid-day."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers are the worst things I have ever eaten - actually I could hardly eat 2 of them. Yuck.  Also 5 fingers and a garden salad for $22....insane."}
{"text":"Complete Rip-off!  Well Baton Rouge has a knack for serving nice food in a nice / elegant atmosphere wrapped in a fancy menu but the thing with this branch of the chain is the location. It is near CN tower so it is bursting with tourists who all are willing to pay ridiculous money for ridiculous things ( i mean the menu a prix fixe for the CN tower's restaurant, what the fuck, it is a disaster. ) Try the one on the Yonge St though, it is better.  Food is okay, prices are too much for what they serve and waiters / waitresses are curt and rude generally and expect big bucks for tips. Do not eat meat here, complete rip-off and sirloin was very dry and had a disturbing aftertaste, though the side dishes are great like mashed potatoes and fried sweet potatoes ( you can have either one of these two or other 2 side dishes depending on your mood to accompany your entrée. )  And if you are new in toronto, it has nothing to do with louisiana cuisine so do not let the name baffle you.   Deserts were the better part of the menu, they were decent and worth the price, if you do not like something too much sugary, this could be well your place."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a work conference with some colleagues.  Our hotel gave us \"free appetizer\" vouchers so we went to Baton Rouge.  That free app was per table, not per person, and did not include seafood - so basically one dip between 4 people?  Although it sounded at first like a nice gesture, it ended up feeling like a trick.  Service was cold and unfriendly. Food was less than mediocre.  Pork chop was overcooked. Will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Went on Christmas Eve with a friend for dinner.  Called ahead to make a reservation about 2 hours before we actually planned to be there, and we were warned that there might be a 10-15 minute wait before we were seated.  But once we got to the restaurant ( the parking lot was packed, so I had to park in the overflow parking next door), we were seated relatively quickly.  Our server was nice; not particularly knowledgeable about the dishes, but pleasant nonetheless.  She was attentive enough to stop by the table a few times to check if we needed anything, but wasn't overly intrusive.  I ordered their lobster risotto, and my friend had the filet mignon.  The risotto wasn't quite what I expected (it had corn as one of the ingredients), but it still tasted pretty good, and there were some sizeable chunks of lobster in it too.  The filet mignon was also cooked very well, and had some really nice flavour to it.  Price-wise, it wasn't out of the common way amongst chain steakhouses, so I would recommend this restaurant for a night out with friends or for date night, as long as you're not looking for anything overly special."}
{"text":"I know it's not their specialty, but I had their linguini primavera dish. I was very pleased! The sauce was thick and buttery, mushrooms were juicy and delicious. Our waiters were also great considering they were so busy we were placed at the last table in the crowded bar.   I also had an apple martini to drink. They cut up a nice crisp slice of green apple and put it in there. It was good!!!  Overall, pretty good experience, I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"Two months ago, I came to this restaurant for a special occasion with my friend at lunch. When I first stepped into the restaurant, I was definitely attracted by its beautiful environment- nice decoration and delightful ambiance. The server who served us on that day was very nice and friendly.  As usual, we ordered our favorite dishes- one medium rare New York steak and one medium prime rib.   The New York steak at Baton Rouge served with coleslaw, mixed vegetables and special gravy was so tender and delicious and plus chicken noodle soup.   The Prime Rib I ordered with baked bean, mixed vegetables and special gravy was the best in town and sooooo yummy!!!!    We both enjoyed our food and had a really great time on that day. I certainly will recommend this place to all my friends and other people. Will come back for sure whenever I crave for best prime rib or steak...."}
{"text":"Located within Eaton Centre, Baton Rouge makes for a great spot to eat after shopping or visiting the downtown area. My most recent visit was while Christmas shopping with my sister. The restaurant has a cozy feel and is appropriate for large groups aswell as just two people.  We were seated at a booth and served quickly. The food was average, there wasn't anything that stood out. I order the Atlantic Salmon Filet as my entree which came with a salad. The service was excellent with my drinks taken care of regularly."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and service. The food is fresh and delicious.  Definitely try the ice cream desert :)"}
{"text":"I should say the taste is not good enough. The steak is not fresh.. poor experience.the environment is good. The service is ok."}
{"text":"I've been a long-time customer of Baton Rouge since this location opened many years ago. The consistently good food and service is what has kept me coming back. I most recently dined here with a friend to celebrate our birthdays over the weekend.   We had a coupon for a free appetizer that we obtained online, specific to this location. Upon trying to use it, our waiter (who was fabulous) checked with the manager. The manager claimed that it should have stipulated no seafood on it. Nowhere in the fine print of the coupon did it mention anything about restrictions on the choice of appetizer. The manager went so far as to bring his own cell phone over to the table to show us what the coupon apparently should have said. The starter that we wanted was the same price as one of the three that they were limiting us to ordering. Instead of admitting their error, the manager was insistent on trying to prove us wrong instead of apologizing and trying to fix the coupon from his end. All we got was a simple \"I created the coupon myself and it should say this...\". Our bill totalled well over $100 between the two of us, so this attitude was even more shocking.   We were so put off with this experience with the manager that we were hard-pressed to enjoy the remainder of our meal! Our server was great (and was surprised by what the manager had said!) and the food was good (even though the steak was slightly under-done).   Unfortunately, we likely won't be back to this location. We were highly disappointed by the manager's attitude and it spoiled our whole experience. Not a way to keep your customers, Baton Rouge!  ETA: I emailed the address provided by \"Julian B\" in response to my review, and approximately a week later, I have yet to receive a response from Baton Rouge."}
{"text":"I've been to this location before and even though nothing was fantastic they were not horrible either. But my last visit was nothing short of a nightmare...the waitress was terrible, the order was wrong and when it came back it got worst. I would never go back.....they get NO STAR."}
{"text":"Food is always good at Baton Rouge but the service at this location is way below average. Main entree was placed before I could finish my appetizer. The server came multiple times to rush for settlement of the bill when we were there for less than two hours. Definitely not a pleasant experiencce."}
{"text":"Ordered Ribs - hmhm Ok - nothing to write home about  I had better and much less  good place for a bus./lunch  meeting  good service"}
{"text":"Lunch was quick and tasty - for roadhouse food. i had the salmon and salad.  The fish was nicely cooked.  My only issue was with the price.  2 people - lunch mains only - coffee - $62 plus tip."}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken Tenders with fries and baked beans during lunch with a very large crowd. My meal was disappointing. The chicken were stripes of chicken breast deep fried in batter. The chicken itself was watery and the batter didn't keep together. The batter is what made the chicken disappointing for me because it was over cooked and didn't taste great, it was ok, but not much more. The fries too were disappointing because they were too greasy and appeared to also be over cooked. The baked beans were good. The prices are expensive but you do get very large portions.  A friend of mine who arrived and ordered late her fries looked good and she said it too tasted good. Perhaps coming as a big group may have played a factor in the overall quality of the food.  As a big group, we were seated in a private room and it large enough to hold over twenty people easily. There seem to be two floors for dinning and a general causal atmosphere.  Staff were friendly.  I would go again only to give them another chance, maybe when they are not so busy, because my first visit was with a big group and my late arriving friend did have better looking food than the rest of us."}
{"text":"Pros:  Nice looking restaurant. Food came promptly. Grilled calamari was good. Chicken salad was somewhat palatable.   Cons:   Salmon & mashed potatoes were bland & boring with no presentation. Potato soup was more like mashed potato with milk and water poured on top. Waiter could have used a pep talk before his shift started. Thought I needed to check for a pulse at one point.  Don't waste your money; there are plenty of better food locations around this area."}
{"text":"Be weary of this place.  We just left there, dropped in after the blue jays game to have a beer and were sitting at the bar and watched the bartender pour 2 different wines (mirrasou pinot noir and robert mondavi cabernet) into one glass!!!!!!!!!!  We asked him about it and was told it was the house wine... \"when you order the house wine you get whats left\".  Asked for the manger and he said that the house wine is the house wine.  We did not eat here so I cannot speak of their food..... but if that is what their policy is on alcohol, I wouldnt even want to know what the food is like.  And the cheapest glass of wine is $9!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here a year ago.   The ambience was nice.  The place was clean.  However given the price you pay for the food and the quality you get is not very good.  I ordered wings and steak here before on two separate occasions.  They really do not know what their doing with steak.  I asked for my steak to be medium rare.  Instead they totally over cooked it.  Definitely do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.   Many of the sides are extra and not included in the meal.    The service was acceptable but definitely could be improved.  The parking was fine."}
{"text":"I have heard good reviews from friends about Baton Rouge so decided to give this place a try after work one day. And....disappointment.  The food was....I don't want to say awful, but it wasn't good. The appetizer that we got, the grilled calamari, was meh. The chicken that we ordered had no flavour other than the glaze of barbecue sauce on the outside, and not only was it bland but it was hard and dry. The ribs (which came with very high recommendations from the server) had a charred after-taste. Yuck. And even if the food was cooked properly, I don't think I can justify the prices that they charge. Decent portions, but even so, definitely overpriced.  The server that we had was very friendly. Too friendly. Not five minutes went by that he didn't come to check on us to see if we were okay. Admittedly we were sitting in a section where there were only two occupied tables, so undoubtedly when he usually makes his rounds it would take more than five minutes for him to get back to us, but it would have been nice to enjoy dinner without the server hovering over you asking if you needed anything.  All in all, I would like to give Baton Rouge another try, but at another location. This location is a definite pass for me."}
{"text":"Always a great meal at Baton Rouge!  The restaurant is clean, the food is great, and the staff are friendly! They are also very accommodating when we request a large table!"}
{"text":"Too bad -  bad service and problems in the kitchen I guess Ribs are good  Steak could have been good but not done the way asked - well done instead of medium for a 39 dollar steak! Fish. Came cold after selling me on the catch of the day which turned out to be different and then not served properly.  Worse part though was the wait and the service which was terrible - you get the sense that they are not honest and don't really care  I am not sure what they did right"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, attentive if brusque service, mediocre steak.  Perhaps the ribs would have been a better bet."}
{"text":"I've only been there once, but I'd definitely go back.  My burger was cooked really well, and the service was great."}
{"text":"Went here for a party with about 20 people.  Although the service was great, I can easily say that this was the poorest quality Resteraunt food experience I have had.  It would seem that almost every item was reheated and not made fresh.  The dishes depended on salt for taste.  Ascetically the plates had no visual interest.  Overall it was unappealing and inedible.  It was also not cheap.  Location is likely the only reason this chain still exists as they have done well leasing key locations."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove all day from Wisconsin to Toronto last Friday. Needless to say we were both exhausted and hungry. Because our hotel was located in downtown Toronto, we decided to walk around the block in search for a restaurant. We quickly came across Baton Rouge Restaurant. We were both sold on its location and decor. Situated in the heart of the city, how can it possibly afford being bad?  We were seated promptly, and I asked our waiter for what dishes the restaurant was known. After she mentioned \"ribs,\" I knew my husband would be able to order a decent meat dish. I, on the other hand, favor fish. \"The catch of the day\" was swordfish. Who am I to turn down fresh fish? So, I ordered the swordfish served with a side order of \"seasonal vegetable.\" The seasonal vegetable was asparagus served with some sauce (I can only recall its bright orange color and mustard-like texture now, and not its name). Again, when someone says \"seasonal,\" I think FRESH. My husband ordered a prime rib steak with a side order of mashed potatoes. Both dishes came with a choice of a house salad (and your choice of dressing) or a Caesar salad.   While waiting for our dinner, we ordered two 9 oz. glasses of wine. Our server brought us the salads. While my husband ate his, I couldn't get over the wilted lettuce in mine! The salad looked \"pre-made,\" as if it was kept 24 hours in the fridge before being served. I couldn't even recognize the eggs that were supposed to be in the salad. The grayish-whitish-yellowish mass spread over the wilted lettuce with a few stale croutons - this is the house salad description they should include in their menu.   When our waiter brought us our main course dishes, my jaw dropped. Picture this: a big white plate with a trapezoid slab of something formerly known as fish, 5 wilted asparagus upon which an orange mustard-like substance was squeezed hot-dog-style. My husband's prime rib steak was not cooked \"medium well\" as he ordered (it was red in the middle, and not pink). It was hard to cut through, and there was a lot of fat left on the \"steak\" (70% meat, 30% fat). The taste of bacon bits and pepper was overwhelming in the mashed potatoes. You couldn't taste the vegetable anymore! The quality of food was simply unacceptable. The cooking skills were missing entirely. And there was nothing \"fresh\" about their \"seasonal\" vegetables and their \"catch of the day.\"   I dared to cut off a small piece of the swordfish, and I was sorry I did. The 9 oz of wine that I drank afterwords did not help me wash down the taste of something that was not completely defrosted while being grilled by someone who should not be allowed to cook in the first place. I couldn't force myself to try the asparagus.   When I refused to pay for the fish, the manager did not even try to disagree that whatever was on my plate was simply inedible. He, however, insisted that we pay for the steak, and we did. We were too tired to argue. $60+ later we were still hungry and extremely dissatisfied with our first restaurant experience in Toronto.  One last piece of advice: avoid the place at all cost, pack a peanut butter sandwich, if you have to, and you'll receive more pleasure from eating it than from paying $$$ for something that should be against the law to serve."}
{"text":"Environment is good for party. For the night besides our Birthday boy there are at least another 3 o 4 tables with birthday celebration.   Here is famous for its ribs. There is a special today $21 for a big rack of ribs stretching from one end to the other end of the plate. The rib is tender and juicy. Once you touch it the meat just comes off.  If it can be marinated longer, it will be even better.  The Tilapia is cooked just right with the top broiled a bit. The Tuna steak is a taste of a kind. It is between sashimi and cooked fish. If rating it as a steak, I would say it is blue to rare. The apple cinnamon is good. Salad is a large portion.  The only missing part is its burger.  It used to cost around $10 and now $14.   Service is good."}
{"text":"It's Monday and sure enough only a few tables in this restaurant on Front.  The waiter service is very polite and smile always on his face.  We order the famous Baton Rouge burger.  The side dish of Cinnamon Apple is very good.  Of course the burger is so good that it is even better than HeroBurger. The disappointment comes the last part of the meal on the dessert.  We order the Apple Crumble with the ice cream.  It doesn't look like what we used to order.  It has a very thin layer of crumbled apple pie with a few pieces of apples sliced on the dish and vanilla ice cream on the top.  It used to be a roasted crust with apple inside that is so delicious.  It's definitely is one big disappointment.  Other Baton Rouge seems to be better than this location."}
{"text":"They make a great chicken tenders salad. The portion size is gigantic and can easily serve two people.  I liken the contrast of the warm chicken and cool salad complimented by the sweetness of the honey mustard. This combination works! :)  The restaurant is surprisingly not busy during the weekday. It's close to the CN Tower Metro Toronto Convention Centre and Rogers Centre.  Inside its dim, even when it's sunny out, so the darkness is intentional. Decorated with red leatherette booths, brass rails which give it that iconic steak house look. They have a wrap around bar - good for after work drinks and an outdoor patio too. The grade of service varies.   So far the chicken tender salad has been consistent on my visits  If they keep that up I'll be coming back.   Random fact, this was the former location of Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"No complaints. Nothing special. I had the steak salad and the red velvet cake. Both were good. Service was alright. The whole experience is not very memorable. I would visit again."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for a couple of years now and I highly recommend the ribs.  Best rib I have ever had.  They are so fall off the bone you can probably eat them with a fork.  Service has always been very good and the washroom has always been clean.  Tried a couple of steaks and was very disappointed.   I would stick with the ribs and go to a steak house for steak.  Just make sure when you order to ask for a 16 oz rack of ribs because they don;t understand the full rack lingo."}
{"text":"I've only been there twice but I'm pretty sure I'll come back more often because it is just amazing! This restaurant has such a nice atmosphere and comfortable surroundings. Their baked potatoes are so large and delicious, probably the best I've tasted. Also, I will always recommend others to try their seafood pasta, the sauce are creamy and tasty and the seafood are just the bomb!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times for family functions and so forth. It is quite big and can get extremely packed during the weekends or occasions. I was such a big fan of this place until an incident happened for a reserved dinner for 14 people here and guests who were out of town. I had reserved a table a week and a half prior to the date and reconfirmed my reservations at least 2 times with the restaurant and they assured me they were looking forward to serving me.   I got there approximately 15 mins prior to my reservations and they said that the table wasnt ready because another group was there prior which was understandable and we were early so no complaints and we waited.. and waited, and waited for a total of 45 mins AFTER the time of our reservations (so a total of 1 hour). I had asked for a manager (asian gentleman) and he apologized that it was the only table that would seat all 14 of us in a row and is trying to rush the service of the current people who were sitting there (this was at the 15 min mark after our reservations). I then wanted to speak to the manager again.. I assume there was more than one because when I asked this gentleman he said he was the manager (not the same person) and I explained my reservation was at 7:30 and 30 mins of waiting past my reservation time was ridiculous. You could only imagine what his reply was after \"maybe you could get yourself a drink at the bar\" and my response back to him was \"is it on the house?\" and he shook his head and i replied back \"what makes you think that I want to give your restaurant more money after this service\" and he walked away.  After when we finally got seated the original manager who apologized to us got all staff to clean up and serve our table first which was much appreciated after the hour wait. We then started receiving all these appetizers on our table (5 total) and I had asked one of the waiters who was this for because we didn't even order anything and they told us that they were just sent to bring to our table. The manager comes back and says that it was complementary for the wait and apologized again. This was really nice of them and I didn't realize how expensive some of the appetizers were (i think there was 3 calamari dishes and 2 dip dishes which totaled over $120). The waiter took our order and was very pleasant as I think from previous stays he served us before. Usually they per-authorize a 15% gratuities for parties over 7 and was very considerate over the wait and said that he didn't charge any tip to the amount which was nice but he honestly deserved the entire 15% he was great serving to my family.   Although that beginning portion of waiting was extremely long I appreciated the (asian) manager speaking to me and clarifying that he was sorry for all the inconvenience and also the free appetizers. On the other hand I dont think I will ever look for that second manager (who told me to get a drink at the bar) for any complaints again.. ridiculous responses from him.   This place wasn't all that bad the food is consistent and overall the atmosphere was nice. I always love going to baton rouge just for the consistency of their quality in food."}
{"text":"The food was very flavourful and well prepared. Our waitress was extremely friendly knowledgeable and efficient. Between the bery relaxed atmosphere very tasty meal and exceptional staff I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge always sets the bar high on atmosphere and service and this location is no exception. The staff are friendly but professional -- in short, dignified but not stuck up. A blessed relief from the fake good humour and over the top antics of wait staff at other places (ahem, Jack Astor's).  The menu is very much geared towards carnivores, so vegetarians watch out. The Louisiana Chicken Tender salad is my personal favourite. If you think salad can't fill you up, think again. This whopping mountain of greenery, fried (or grilled) chicken pieces, artichoke hearts, and much more is enough to satisfy 3 or 4 people. Absolutely delicious, especially with the lime dressing.  For me Baton Rouge is a rare but always welcome treat."}
{"text":"The premier location in the whole GTA. The GM, Paul, is the epitome of excellent customer service from his person approach, timeliness, and attend to detail. He offered us a complimentary dessert, which we graciously excepted and enjoyed at the end of our delicious meal. Do it I would definitely return for another meal the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had dinner here before with friends and it was busy then. My solo visit last night after my yoga glass is ok but nothing fantastic neither. The steak is alright and I wish it aged with more spice to add the flavor. Sweet potato fries aren't't crispy anymore when it is served. I guess it is a pretty slow night since I only saw a couple of tables at the dinning area beside of me."}
{"text":"This is my first attempt at a review but read them often.  Should have heeded the warning but wanted to give it a chance....just had dinner at the Baton Rouge on Front Street.  The service was terrible, wrong drink order, no check backs until it was time to bring the bill. Gave it 2 stars because the food was okay."}
{"text":"Wir waren kurz vor Weihnachten in Toronto und haben durch Zufall dieses Restaurant beim vorbeigehen entdeckt. Das Ambiente ist faszinierend, die Bedienung typisch Amerikanisch einfach extrem freundlich! Die Gäste waren alle gut gekleidet und haben einen ordentlichen Eindruck gemacht.  Das Essen (ich hatte Steak) war einfach grandios. Muss ehrlich sagen das es eines der besten wenn nicht sogar das beste Steak gewesen ist was ich je hatte, ich hatte viele Steaks ;-) Ich möchte jetzt auch keinen Roman schreiben, das Restaurant ist echt mehr als gut!"}
{"text":"Our favorite downtown spot, especially on Saturdays. Love the staff and service. Prefer to sit in the bar area."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening in December.  Food: I had the Rib eye steak, medium-rare, the meat tasted great. I had it with a corn chowder soup and a side of seasonal veggies (will not get as a side next time). The waitress highlighted the special features and catch of the day.  Service & Atmosphere: The waitress who served my friends and I that night was really friendly. Service was quick and formal. A waiter asked me to cut into my steak to check if it was cooked to my satisfaction. As for the atmosphere, the lights were dim and the environment felt festive.  Pricing: A bit expensive than what I am used to, but no complaints here."}
{"text":"I didn't expect a ton from Baton Rouge but it was OK. I had a tasty meal of a Louisiana chicken sandwich with French fries and scored a free side of the baked beans thanks to my friend who didn't want his. He was actually quite jealous of my meal. He got the Louisiana chicken, just chicken, and the breast was not much bigger than mine plus I got all the sandwich fixings. And mine was at least four dollars cheaper!   The sandwich components went well together though the chicken could have been cooked less and it tasted fresh. The French fries were a heap of pepper, crunchiness and just what I was craving but you could tell they were not homemade. The baked beans were good, a bit hot-doggy tasting if anything but the \"presentation\" it came with the awful! It came in a ramekin on a plate but it was as though someone had dipped the entire bowl in a huge pot of baked beans; the thing was covered and dripping the bean sauce. Luckily I could get past that.   The service walking in seemed quite professional with the greeting and seating but it went downhill from there. It was quite late in the night and the server still had to look at his paper to look at the specials, all three of them. No fancy descriptions either! Just \"Cajun chicken\" or \"Mahi Mahi\". I also had to ask for ketchup and mustard when we both had French fries. He was also quite awkward about taking plates. Like, he put a lot of thought into it before going in for the kill.   Honestly, I was thinking of giving this 3 stars but upon further inspection and reflection, I don't know if it's worth that and there are no 0.5 stars. It is a nice looking restaurant and seems like a good spot for certain occasions. But alas, it has a ways to go before this becomes a destination spot for me."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! From head to toe apps, entrees and deserts were phenomenonal! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been there 4-5 times and every time I was there I received great service and great food and beverages. All of my special food requests were handled spot on. Never had to return any dishes/plates.   Im really fond of their decor it def suits the vibe theyre trying to give off. Dim lighting also works well during nighttime.   Only concern is its pretty pricey. Also there seems to be two entrances (main and side). So could be confusing to new customers. Other than that no real complaints.  Would def visit again!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner many times and it's the same experience each time. Great food, great service and you leave having a good time with friends.   Prime rib is what I usually get with au jus. I like mine rare and they always give it to me that way. Side of mash potatoes is always very flavourful and doesn't fill you up too much to take away from the main.   Can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"We have just had a terrible dining experience at Baton Rouge. They are doing a Lobster promotion, so one of the guests in our party and I both ordered a $31 lobster linguine. When the dishes came to our table, we could hardly see any lobster in The Plate. They looked more like a typical aglio e olio pasta. After a couple of bites, we couldn't help thinking how ridiculous that we would be charged $31 for a plate of aglio e olio. So we brought it to our server's attention, she told us that she needed to check with her manager. After 5 minutes, their manager came with a small bowl of mixed vegetables and lobster BITS and said this was how much they would put in a pasta dish, and he was giving us some \"extra\" in a condensing tone. He told us if we wanted more, we could have pay $6 more for a lobster tail.  The small bowl that he left behind was apparently heater with microwave and we thought if it only costs $6 for a lobster tail, then the tiny amount of lobster bits was even more ridiculous in our pasta dishes.  On top of that, it was so difficult to communicate with our server. My friend actually asked her how the past would be served, and she told her it would be in a rose sauce, and obviously it wasn't the case. And it took forever and several reminders to get refill for our kids' beverages.   I guess it explains why I could make a reservation anywhere else this Saturday but here."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Baton Rouge in ages prior to this visit so I was very much looking forward to it. It lived up to my memories.   I was a complete glutton and ordered the rib and chicken tender meal with coleslaw and cinnamon apples. The chicken tenders were plump and juicy with a light crispy (almost tempura) batter. The dijonnaise that they come with is absolutely addictive.   My ribs were cooked and sauced perfectly, but they were a bit lukewarm. I honestly didn't mind because I'd rather have delicious lukewarm juicy ribs than hot overly dried out ribs. I was with quite a big group so that probably explains the lack luster temp on the ribs.   I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Visiting from the US and can't even access the menu because for one it's in French, and 2 it requires a postal code which I have no idea of... it has been recommended to me but I guess I have to pass."}
{"text":"Was there a week ago after seeing South Pacific.    Ordered the Chicken fingers.  They offered two sides, i asked for french fries and spiced apples.  they brought Cole slaw instead.  The person bringing the food was not our waiter, and yet another brought our drinks. So I took a bite of the Cole Slaw.  My dinner companion said i should ask for the apples.  When the waiter finally came over I told him I had ordered the apples. He noticed I had taken some of the Cole Slaw and said, well you have started on the Cole Slaw.  Sort of to imply that even though I had not ordered it I was eating it, and if I still wanted the apples there might be an extra charge for an extra side.  Now the size of these is the little black plastic cup we have all seen.  It would have cost them next to nothing to offer me a tiny cup of apples.  It would also have gone a long way toward good PR.  This is what i might have expected at Toby's.  The food was good, so i give 3 starts. I know it was late, but this is what makes the difference between a good experience and a sour taste.    We are locals not tourists. So we will probably walk passed Baton Rouge the next time."}
{"text":"A dry rib steak A mushy order of yam fries A sad vegetable A spicy wine  This place is nice however they need to improve the quality of the preparation. Presentation of the plates is meh."}
{"text":"Horse shit. The tuna tacos were wraps, not tacos, devoid of all spice and jalepenos. Also who the hell puts a poppy seed dressing as a side for a taco????   My girlfriends aunt got fries with her meal while my girlfriend got a poutine, and the server actually he the gaul to say they don't have gravy WHILE MY GIRLFRIEND IS EATING A POUTINE WITH GRAVY.   INSANITY!   Luckily it was pretty cheap so I guess there's that, but I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"The two star description of \"Meh, I've experienced better\" describes Baton Rouge very well. I used to really enjoy coming here years ago - not sure if the food was better back then, or if it was when eating out was a novelty to me.   Baton Rouge certainly doesn't do anything for me now. The ribs are tasteless, and the sauce is uninspiring. They were cold when they got to my table (and when we walked in the place was empty so it wasn't busy at all). Seems like my plate was cooling on the counter until we finished my fish chowder soup. I chose the apples and the beans as sides, and they were decent.   The service was good - the waitress did come by a few ribs in. When I mentioned the heat issue, she had it reheated (I'm assuming on a grill) and resauced. I was asked if I wanted a refill for my drink.   The rest of my table seemed to enjoy what they ordered (ahi tuna salad and pulled pork mac and cheese). They certainly looked more appealing then my meh meal.   I might be coerced back to try something else (maybe a dish that trusted Yelpers have enjoyed) but I won't be going back anytime soon. I deem this as a tourist trap based on where it is (in the Eaton Centre)."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the staff was the best part. Everyone was so friendly and made me feel right at home. The gm dini I believe her name was. She was so nice and all the staff at the bar knew I wasn't from Toronto and they recommended so many other cool hang out spots. I will def be stopping by again next summer when I return to Toronto"}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriend's father's birthday. Apparently this place is known for their ribs but looking through the menu, the Chipotle Jack Chicken caught my eye. With bacon and corn salsa, I couldn't resist. I tried some of the ribs and it was quite tasty. I was however disappointed with the chicken *womp womp*. It was very dry and not really all that flavourful. I'm not going to let it deter me from coming here again but this time, I might stick to their specialty."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance of this place. It's got that old school charm of a steakhouse which is what it is. I ordered a cranberry juice and thought it was quite outrageous to charge 4.00 for a small glass and she also said we had to keep our old straws f our drinks or else she wouldn't give us another one. I should also mention it started as four of us at 345pm and then it was 9 by 530pm.  My friend ordered chicken and fries and it looked great. The batter on the chicken tenders was done in house and deep fried. I ordered a salad with top sirloin I ordered it medium but it came out rare but due to my antibiotics needing me to get fed ASAP I just ate it without complaint. I then asked The blonde waitress if I could have a to go container and she refused as she said it was wasted material and that it would ruin the environment for the sea turtles ?!? Wtf. I thought I was a paying customer paying over $30 for food and drinks. I never asked for anything no complaints yet she made a big deal about straws and containers. Give me a break. Very poor of a waitress to push her so called beliefs on a customer. This is why we have recycling."}
{"text":"Way over rated reviews lead me there.  Steak was tough; services was rougher..Rated is as NO waiter because it seemed like it. Had to ask for bread, got burned frozen rolls.  Close to CN Tower and that has to be their ONLY draw."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, after we ran around 4 restaurants on a Sat night we finally found a restaurant with no wait.  The food was good and the servers were all at tentative and friendly.  I got the burger and it was cooked to a perfect medium well, the skinny fries were crispy and not oily.  We also got a bottle of merot for $32.  Great place for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I stumbled upon (and I use the term loosely, because how does one stumble upon a huge restaurant) this place because the restaurant we were originally looking for, seemed to have disappeared. The place was busy, but after a surprisingly short wait we were seated and the service and food was excellent."}
{"text":"Generally I hate chains, but this one was OK , and well parts were indeed better than ok. The Famous ribs were just OK 'eh' the souse is to die for but the overall preparation was so-so. Beans and slaw I could do without   My Casear salad was fresh and tasty  Jumbo shrimp were delightful  Oddys speaking a Chain I didnt hate."}
{"text":"Crab Cake I can identify the seafood taste. That's probably the crab meat, I believe. The chipotle sauce adds flavour to the taste. The texture is a bit soft to me. The side, corn, that comes with the crab cake is a bit mushy. The chef mixed the Balsamic vinegar with syrup and used the mixture to decorate the dish.  New York Strip loin with hot apple cinnamon and sweet potato fries The steak is good. The middle is pink which is what I like. The texture is chewy. The negative part is the edge is slightly burned. The sweet potato fries taste so good, especially with the pink chipotle sauce. I love the apple cinnamon. It's like a dessert after meal."}
{"text":"$39 steak was amazing. Absolutely the best streak I've ever eaten. Fries were great with it.  The peppercorn sauce with the steak should be a beverage. The steak plus the peppercorn sauce was an absolute masterpiece."}
{"text":"My friend came back to Toronto from Hong Kong and was craving English food.   We started off with a bottle of wine and the seafood platter (fried calamari, grilled calamari, scallop and shrimp) which I didn't think was worth the price (seasonal item). We ordered a Top Sirloin 8oz, BBQ Pork Back Ribs, and a Chipotle Jack Chicken. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good either - it was seriously whatever. We got another bottle of Inniskillin Pinot Noir during our meal.  The server (forgot his name) didn't seem to happy with his job. Everything was rushed/cut off/didn't gaf. If I had a choice, I wouldn't have picked this place."}
{"text":"Terrible. When we sat down a waitress came up and asked what drinks we'd like. We said water. We got the water and waited 15 minutes for her to come back. Never did. We had to ask for a new waitress. She took our order and since she was nice enough to take it, we decided to order alcohol. When the food came it was a disaster. I ordered chicken breast with ribs and mashed potatoes. The presentation was like someone just placed it there. A 5 year old can put a plate better than what I got. Then the chicken wasnt fully cooked. And it seemed they just dumped the chicken into bbq sauce. The ribs were the same. But it was burnt. The best was the mashed potatoes, but it looks like it splatted on my plate after falling from the CN Tower. It was just a terrible experience. It was my first and now last time. The new waitress was very nice. Might be the only light in the darkest tunnel."}
{"text":"Rude staff. I can't believe it!! We were party of five - happy group. The staff informed us to wait for 25 min. After 45 min of waiting, we asked her when our table would be ready. We were fine with another 5-10 min. However, she didn't say sorry - her attitude was very rude. Her suprvisor was there hearing her rude response. He supported her by saying we can't enforce other clients to leave sooner?! (I was saying in my head: Really? why did you say its 25 min waiting). Then she offered us a booth for 4 (it would fit 5) which she have offered it at the beginning when we arrived. Anyway, I asked if we can change our booth (before we are served) in case a table for 5 becomes available. She said sorry you can't!! Then, I stopped smiling and hiding my feelings and say will we then leave. She said in a round tone: okay!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the ribs based on my wife's recommendation. Being a big fan of ribs I had ordered the 16oz serving, but regret it because it wasn't very good. As advertised, it was indeed fall off the bone and the BBQ sauce had nice flavour, but...  1. The rib meat was not tender or moist, it was on the dry side.  2. The ribs were not hot, they were room temperature. 3. The sauce was not dripping, it was caked on like bottled sauce. 4. I did not need a napkin. Good ribs done right requires napkins.  I enjoy baton rouge's rib eye but their ribs were a fail for me.   Service was decent, no complaints. But was not exceptional either.  This is for the Markham / Thornhill location"}
{"text":"I'm generally not a big fan of chain restaurants but I love Baton Rouge.  The food any location is consistantly excellent with great, friendly, prompt service.  I always enjoy my meals here.  And my husband was in heaven with his fillet mignon so he was happy too!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go after a day of shopping at Eaton´s. The staff have always made us feel welcome and the food has always been good. The Steak was tender and the Sandwiches delicious. Their Spinach Dip is to die for and one of the reasons we keep coming back. The only con I have is that it´s way overpriced. Chicken Tenders for 17$ are just way overpriced."}
{"text":"Went to the baton rouge on front after the auto show. The decor was typical baton rough. Servers were not bad, know the menu, made good suggestion and came over a couple times to check on things.  Had the new York steak (suggested by the staff) which was nice and tender. Fries  and cole slaw was good. The italian dressing has too much balsamic vinegar in it. Friend had the rib with vegetable. Ribs were ok, but the broccoli and cauliflower were way over cooked and doesn't taste fresh. The ginger lemon dressing was tasty with the house salad."}
{"text":"I love the ribs at Baton Rouge they are my fave.  The coleslaw  and fries is good as well.  The ribs sauce is amazing and the ribs itself fall off the bone easily.  I sound like an advertisement but that is how good it really is. The mood of the place is great and looks upscale.  Good place to bring a date.  The only thing I am not happy is that 2 of the many times I been they didn't have the prime rib - it was all sold out apparently and it was just 6:30 pm on  a sat night.   I would think they would get more to satisfy the dinner crowd.   The severs are helpful and honest. Asked them if the soup is good today and fresh and they will let you know what they think. haha. The steak is not bad too and the baked potatoes are decent.  Nachos is huge and can fill you up with you have a small party.  Calamari is nicely fried and well seasoned.  My fave app is the Louisiana Spinach Dip.  Looking forward to the next visit to Baton Rouge.  Writing this review is getting me hungry"}
{"text":"Last Saturday night, my husband and I found ourselves at home with nothing to eat and a half-hearted determination to make our way over to the 24hr Metro over in the St. Lawrence Market area.  As we left our building, we felt (very small) droplets of rain and because we kinda felt like losers going for groceries at 9pm on a Saturday night anyway, we decided to check out the relatively new Baton Rouge which opened up in front of (what I will always call:) The Dome.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess who ushered us straight to a booth at the back.  For a pretty big place, it was not very busy for a Saturday night.  We mused that it is likely a more popular place for lunch, tourists, conventioners and game-goers given the location.  However, it is a nice space.  Comfortable with a lot of room around the tables.  Decor is an attempt at traditional steakhouse cool.  Apart from the hostess and a woman who appeared to be the manager, we experienced the staff to be indifferent and inattentive.  The woman from whom we ordered appeared to not give a crap about us or the order.  It was as though we were inconveniencing her for wanting to place an order.  What's weird is the number of people who ended up coming to the table at one or another throughout the evening.  The guy who took our drink order (indifferent), the woman who brought over our drinks, the woman who took our food order, the guy who brought over our food and the manager who came by to ask if things were ok.  Inattentive may sound strange considering all these people, but none of them seemed to give a flying **** except for the manager.  My husband had the burger ($14-ish), which he says was ok.  And I had the seared tuna with black olive tapinade sandwich on a baguette ($20-ish).  It was very disappointing.  I had to add salt to a black olive tapinade!!!  The tuna was tasteless and the baguette soggy.  The manager had come by toward the very beginning of the meal (it really bugs me when people in restaurants come over as you are taking your first bite to ask how things are so far!), so I didn't have a chance to really taste the sandwich to let her know what I really thought of everything.    It's baffling to me that a place with a potential to serve up a nice meal with good service can be so off.  Maybe their entire budget was spent on the decor and there wasn't any left over for a decent staff and someone good to oversee the kitchen...  Better to walk a little further east and hit the Canyon Creek for a passably better steakhouse-like experience."}
{"text":"Chaine de pubs à Toronto, c'est l'endroit idéal pour manger entre amis ou même en famille. Spacieux et pourvu de lumière tamisées, vous aurez accès à de la restauration typique de bar pub tout en regardant les matchs sur les nombreuses télés.   // You'll find several Baton Rouge in TO, this is like those typical bar/pubs where you'll find families coming to enoy a lucnh together, coworkers enjoying a pint after work or even romantic couples. Food is what you can find in lots of pubs in the city. Good place to come if you wanna watch a game."}
{"text":"I gave this only a 2 because the service was terrible. The food though was exceptional.  We stopped in here because we were pooped from walking and wanted to grab a late lunch and a drink and sit for a bit.   This is a steakhouse/bar. It wasn't very busy at all and we were seated right across from the bar. Which would make you think the service would be fairy fast. Wrong. The girl who took our order, I believe her name was Kate or Katie, was friendly, and smiling. She took our drink order. 5 minutes after we ordered drinks she asked if we wanted to order. I ordered General Taos chicken salad and hubby ordered the Pub Style beer battered fish.   We were 3 feet from the bar and it took 15 minutes for her to get around to bringing the drinks to the table. Then she disappeared. After sitting there for 40(?!) minutes my husband finally caught her eye to ask what was the delay. 2 Minutes later she appeared with the food, apologising and blaming the kitchen for having an \"off\" day. Hubby ordered another drink and again the bartender poured it immediately and she disappeared yet again. He finally asked the bartender to bring the drink half way through the meal.  The meal itself was delicious! The General Taos chicken salad was done perfectly. It was described as :  Hand-battered chicken tenders, General Tao sauce served on mixed greens, red peppers, walnuts, sesame seeds & crispy noodles drizzled in ginger & lime dressing.  Totally lived up to it's description and I devoured it. My husbands Beer Battered Fish was described as:  Beer-battered fish served with spicy tartar sauce. It came with fries and coleslaw. The fish and fries again were perfectly cooked, light and crispy.  I tipped a standard 15 percent even though I wasn't happy with the service because I hoped that the tips were shared equally between the kitchen and servers. That's the ONLY reason she got any tip at all.  The quality of the meal more than made up for the lackluster service.  Don't know if I would ever visit this location again but I may try another location to give them a second chance.  They also offer a gluten-free menu and this restaurant is kid friendly. The bathrooms were clean"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The steak (ordered medium) was seasoned well and juicy. The calamari was lightly salted but not bland. Creole sauce that came with it was superb. The lobster linguine? Divine. Lobster poutine was great. Flavors blended really well together. Staff was polite, friendly, and quick. No regrets & I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night, the restaurant was pretty much empty so we were served and seated quick. We came for their 10oz rib special which is $20 instead of $22.  Pros: - Nice ambiance  - Servers were polite and professional  - Ribs were great (good portion)    Cons: - Some items are a little overpriced"}
{"text":"The old Bâton Rouge, one of the restaurants that's been around for a good amount of time in the Richmond Hill/Markham area. I remember when it first opened and we'd gone for a huge family occasion dinner - it was someone's birthday probably? At the time the place was more upscale - typical of a steakhouse - and it was dimmer lit like The Keg. Now - the 6:00pm dinner wave is almost all families and casual groups, with the more well-dressed individuals making an appearance for 8:00pm. The prices were out of my reach back in the day and steaks were too heavy a meal for many in the family, but in the last month or so I've frequented twice on different family occasions - our tastes have changed!  The first things I noticed were the kids - since when did this become a family restaurant? Babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, bring them all because they'll all be welcome at 6:00pm. I wasn't annoyed per se, mostly surprised and a tiny bit nervous about noise levels. Turns out what really brought the noise was just the restaurant layout - round group tables with booths all along the side, and dumbbell-shaped setups for larger groups. People yapped away loudly to one another and the music was playing all at the same time, and from 6:30pm until 9:00pm when I finally left the place was packed.  The menu was as expected - a focus on steaks with a smaller selection of pastas, poultry, and seafood for other appetites. A prix fixe menu is now available starting at $40, including a starter soup or salad, a choice of mains (with two sides) from catch of the day to surf and turf, and chef's choice dessert (mini slice of cheesecake - flavour predetermined for the day). A really good deal for the price, providing enough variety and volume for most patrons.  Shortly after being seated we got a round of water from the server - she spilt some on my menu and soaked the napkin she'd placed, but quickly moved on to another table to take an order without coming back to clean up. Disappointing - I can only think to say water is clear and maybe she thought it was a small splash, but that still makes her quite unobservant since the napkin was drenched. Subsequent to this we were server-less for quite some time. Nobody to check if we had questions with the menu, nobody introduced themselves to be taking care of us for the rest of the night, nothing. As the rest of my party of 13 showed up it took some time to get even water. One of the chairs was rickety and coming loose so we needed a replacement - the same water-spilling server had finally reappeared but the attitude she used to ask a fellow server for assistance with the chair was rude. I wouldn't want to be helping her at all - and shockingly (or rightfully...) the fellow server gave back equal amounts attitude. Not what I picture from a good restaurant service team.   I went with a medium rare top sirloin, 8 oz, with added blue cheese on top. My sides were steamed veggies and hot cinnamon apple slices. Quite promising upon arrival, but cutting in my steak was a bit overcooked - it was more medium to medium-well. I could send it back...but I'm not a fan of waiting for remakes. Aside the doneness the steak had decent flavour - my decision to add blue cheese was great. The sides were as expected - my apple slices were a bit cold and my steamed veggies a bit too raw for my liking. It was okay, I'd say, given I was with a large party of 13. On any other occasion I'd be disappointed.  In my visit in the distant past, I remembered a rich baked cheesecake selection available at Bâton Rouge. I wasn't disappointed the last two times I've visited - interesting classic flavours available, and a gluten-free peanut butter brownie cheesecake for those with diet restrictions. The cheesecakes are rich and creamy, and quite firm. None of that gelatin-induced mousse-like texture, these are baked cheesecakes that weigh their worth. There was caramel drizzle on the New York style mini-slice that came with my prix fixe meal, which wasn't too sweet or too plain. The mini slice size is good for a small dessert - nothing to share, not too much to handle, no feeling of guilty afterwards.   I also ordered a classic crème brûlée to share, it was a decent size and looked pretty good. Mine wasn't as brûlée as others that arrived at the table so I was disappointed, and rightfully so upon tasting as mine was quite cold. The poor torch job meant my caramelized sugar wasn't crunchy enough to break into small pieces under the attack of my fork - more effort required and large chunks stuck to my teeth unnecessarily. Fortunately I'm not a crème brûlée fan, meaning I won't be considering the item for my next visit - no points lost with me as a returning patron.    Cheesecake for dessert rounded out the meal for me positively and helped Bâton Rouge retain their star rating for now. But for the cheesecake - two stars flat based on poor price-quality ratio."}
{"text":"Before heading up the CN Tower to the 360 restaurant, we stopped here for drinks and a light appetizer. I read through some of the ratings on Yelp before we came inside, so I didn't expect too much and well surprise, surprise, it was all true.   The service we had was actually quite good. We enjoyed our server, she was very tentative to our needs and checking in with us. But the food was pretty bad. Ordered the spinach artichoke dip and stuffed mushrooms. The dip wasn't very tasty, you could tell it wasn't fresh. But the mushrooms were pretty much frozen and just reheated and they were kind of stale. It was pretty gross...they were even cold when they got to the table. The sangria wasn't bad, but the drinks were overpriced and were average. Honestly, I only gave the place 2 stars because I liked our server. Since it's so close to the stadium I can imagine it gets busy during game days, but I really would go somewhere else before I came here."}
{"text":"Melon Daquorui were enjoyed by all who had.  One of the huge Batons. Food is good but I found the ribs on the cold side and a little burnt. Mind you the sauce was requested on the side so that might be used to cover up the burn marks.  The draft beer a little warm. Jamie our waitress was very friendly and pleasant. All the staff seemed very well presented. Albeit  a second order of appetizer and salad came after we were digging in. No we didn't get that on the house."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I do enjoy the chicken and ribs combo here. The spinach dip appetizer is also very good. Service is average. I tried a few of their entree salads as well and they were good. I don't usually eat french fries but I do like them here. Had the steak once but prefer the Keg in this regard."}
{"text":"This place is average in my book. Not amazing and not horrible. I did enjoy the food and the service was good. The only great thing about it is the location. It is pretty  expensive prices wize too. But overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Droppin a deuce star rating on this place due to my recent visit here.  Baton Rouge is generally a step above places like Joeys, Moxes or Jack Astors, but over the years I would say it's now sitting well below all three.  I came here for Mothers Day, because my GF's mom wanted some good old fashioned ribs for dinner.  I like ribs too, honey garlic, bbq, buffalo, I ain't got no type.  Fast forward to ordering, our server was rushing us on our order since we sat down.  No idea why, the place was pretty empty.  Perhaps he wanted to get back to the bar to watch the playoff game on TV.  I got the large portion of ribs, my gf got the steak and her mother got the small portion ribs.  Shortly after I asked the waiter to adjust the sides for me as I changed my mind on the sides.  He looked unimpressed that he had to input another order to the computer and gave me a rather cold look.  Why you mad tho?  Almost 45 minutes later, our food came out.  The food was rather bland and my ribs were actually a bit cold.  They were over sauced to the point where I could barely see the meat, and my large portion was the exact same size as my GF Mom's small portion.  The dip in quality was pretty evident from my first few visits here years ago.  Service was pretty weak, our drinks were never refilled, no one asked how our food was, and we had to ask several times for the bill.  The bill was also wrong as we were double charged for a few items we ordered.  Good thing I checked, I like what I like, but I check before I swipe!  I'll be going to the Keg next time for occasions like this fo sho."}
{"text":"Came here because I wanted to get down on some Ribs!!! I had been to this location several years ago, and had avoided coming back because the steak was so underwhelming for the price I paid.  But, time heals all wounds... and cravings.  Came on a Saturday night with no reservation in place, so found that there was a 20-minute wait time for a table for two. No big deal.  Ordered the Cheddar Dip and the Poutine for starters and they were good. Poutine could've had a bit more flavour but the fries were pretty damn good. The dip was what it was, just cheese and chips, no problem.  As for the Ribs? Quite tasty! They had a bit of a bite to them and were not \"fall of the bone\" which I actually expect from great Ribs, so thank you for that. I got a baked potato in the side, could used a bit more sour cream and some butter.  As you can see, my only qualms were minor adjustments that could be objective to others, so certainly not a knock on the place.  Thanks to this experience, my perception has definitely changed and I'd definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Staff were very pleasant and attentive. I ordered Medium Well Filet Mignon butterflied with baked potatoe. Potatoe was OK Steak was quite dry though and for the price I was pretty dissapointed with meal. Will try something else when I am in Toronto on the 20th for a Raptors game."}
{"text":"Beautiful establishment.  Great amazing service and most of all such great food. From out of town and I'll be in the area for two months.  This first visit will DEFINITELY not my last. Yummy!!! Visit if you can for sure."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant after the ball game with a friend from the area. We started with wine and the selection was just perfect alone with the price, some restaurants have to many selections. We ended the evening with a few more bottles. The apps were good, the spinach dip was very tasty but the could afford to make it smaller and still enjoy it.  We all had ribs as we were told they were amazing, the portions are exactly whats needed and the meat melts in your mouth. It come with 2 selections and no matter what you desire from beans to fries or coleslaw you can't go wrong.  The service was excellent, they didn't rush us at anytime within our 3 hours of stay and it all felt comfortable. We would go back and we recommend it."}
{"text":"This place seems like your would get a great service, but complete opposite. We walk in and were barely greeted. Once we sat down our drinks were ordered. Noone came to check up on our drinks. We had to look around looking for our server. Other servers saw we needed service and no one would come.  We were roadtripping in Toronto, so we were not dressed fancy. We were wearing tank tops, shorts, and sandals. But that doesn't give them a reason to be looking out for us every time we got up as if we were going to take off. When we finally paid, our waitress would leave until we signed and tipped. I felt so uncomfortable about that. I almost didn't tip because of the horrible service, but I felt pressured as she would NOT leave.  That might be the culture of Canada, I'm not sure. It just seemed rude and a bit racist."}
{"text":"Prices are a little high, but the food was good and I left full. Very warm environment and the staff was friendly enough."}
{"text":"First time at Baton Rouge. It was just okay. Ordered steak and it was okay.. a little overcooked for my liking. Service was good. The spinach dip was good. There are a lot more better restaurants on the same strip.  Skip."}
{"text":"I like the rib. We had a bottle of Pinot Noir that is fantastic. It is really a lot of food. Irish coffee is great as well."}
{"text":"My client and I were starving and I said he should treat himself to a nice dinner. I've  never been disappointed with the food there. Ribs, chicken, coleslaw, the beans and the yummy fries. The servers are always great!"}
{"text":"Do not order the Lobster Risotto. They put corn in it and it is way too watery! Good service.  But, the food was sub par. Only order steak"}
{"text":"Just came back from the restaurant today and it was a pleasant experience. There are a lot to like about this place and some that I don't like, but first with the goods.  To me a good restaurant must serve good food, and this one is serves great food. I went with my gf and we ordered Louisiana BBQ Chicken with mash potatoes and BBQ pork ribs with fries and coleslaw. The portions were excellent and the ribs were delicious. We love ribs and this place serves them up right. The meat was well cooked and just melts off the bones. Very tasty! The portion for the BBQ pork with fries and coleslaw was huge (another plus). Although the Louisiana BBQ chicken was a little small since the cut of the chicken breast was dwarfed by the stacks of ribs.  I also enjoyed the service. The staffs were friendly and helpful. The food came within reasonable time (about 15 minutes after we ordered). We went during quiet hour so the restaurant was not really busy, but the waiter was really attentive about us being there. He literally came checking on us 4 times to make sure everything was good. In all, I was really pleased with the service.  The atmosphere was nice, comfortable and cozy. We got a corner booth and it was a really nice location to be in. Normally, I would hate to be in that position since most waiters in restaurant would forget about us, but since the waiter was checking up on us very frequently, it didn't make much difference where we sat in that respect. But we did get the corner booth which felt really cozy and private.  On the down side, the TVs in the restaurant was not in the best shape. For a place that is so close to Roger's Center, you'd expect them to have nicer TVs than the ones I saw. The TV located at the bar area definitely in need of replacing (there were visible black lines across the screen).   The room is also a little too dark, I under the location is trying to set an atmosphere, but it should be a bit brighter because I can barely see my food. When I got up to leave, I couldn't see the stuff I left in the booth because it was so dark.  Lastly, the waiter messed up my order. I asked them for sweet potatoes fries (which the waiter said they will make), but I got normal french fries instead. It tasted good, so I decided to keep my order.  Overall, it's a great experience and I would love to go back again."}
{"text":"I love Bâton Rouge!  The service is always top notch whenever we have dinner here.   The steaks are always cooked to perfection and you are always so satisfied after eating.     You can't go wrong with their steaks.   They fill you up and are great quality.   Thank you Baton Rouge for always going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"I had a steak dinner with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. They advertise their steaks being aged 45 days (or something like that) and high quality.   The prices across the menu seemed pretty good and slightly cheaper than I expected. That said, in the case of my steak, it was a downgrade from The Keg, and maybe only a couple bucks cheaper. It was still enjoyable however.  My dad's ribs looked good and he enjoyed them and they're often on special.  An okay experience, but I'm not sure whether it's enough to be too memorable either."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Came here with my parents and ended up doing a family style meal sharing a large house salad and the seafood platter. My dad also had the trio dessert. It was more than enough food for the three of us and was delicious!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! Yesterday we walked to this location, the reason we went there was  because we had good time  previously but this time it was totally the  opposite experience. The waitress seemed unhappy or didn't want to be there, we ordered our drinks and I explained that I was allergenic to eggplant please remove any eggplant from my order.  She brought me my vegetarian sandwich with eggplant as well as the other toppings such as a Portobello mushrooms etc . On the second attempt, she brought me a sandwich with only tomato, lettuce and red pepper.  I asked her there supposed to be other toppings ( veggies ), she said when I took it to the kitchen there was only eggplant on it.  She was accusing me of eating all the other toppings before I sent it back. I would of had a serious allergenic reaction in the restaurant if anything was touched by the eggplant. We asked for the check right away without out eating anything because our table still didn't receive any cutlery, at that point our table was feed up.  This experience left us disappointed and still hungry, we will not go back to this location if this is how staff is trained to serve  paying customers."}
{"text":"Like all food chains, there is nothing really special about this place. The steak isn't as good as the Keg, Neither are the fries or the other foods. The service there is fantastic, and the lobster menu looks fantastic.   Pros  Service was excellent. Didn't need to ask for refills, if there was a complaint, they would help us change the food immediately.  The lobster stuffed mushrooms were awesome.   Cons  Mashed potatoes wasn't good at all.  Fries weren't crispy. Mushrooms above was a very small portion. There were only four pieces, but places like Red Lobster or Keg have at least 5 if not 6.   Don't know if we would go back. The rest of my party didn't really like it."}
{"text":"Horrible. Pathetic. Just plain gross. This Baton Rouge needs a complete overhal of their Management and Staff all together. Better yet just shut it down and open something else completely. I have been here multiple times and EVERY SINGLE TIME the Service is ssooo bad and the food is so bland and I feel completely ripped off.   I am not one of those customers who comes once leaves a bad review. I have been here multiple times within 2 years and NOTHING has changed. Servers are rude telling you that \"its not their fault\" and they are either utterly mis-managed or simply just do not givva f***.  Food is always super salty and it takes FOREVER to get it due to them being under staffed or simply incompetent.  DO NOT EVER come here even if you ate dying of starvation. You are better off getting the $2 street meat outside and will be much more satisfied.  I hope you listen to all the reviews on this place and STAY AWAY because this place does not deserve your money."}
{"text":"Pretty typical middle of the road fare.  I ordered the steak & salad the steak portion was a reasonable size but was cold.  Salad mix used I presume came out of a bag because it was very dry and clearly not freshly washed, chopped and had plenty brown wilting pieces.  My dining partner ordered the club sandwich.  It looked good and the fries that were served with it were very tasty.  I would probably stick to sandwiches next time.  Location is Eaton Centre so very convenient.  I do like the layout of the restaurant the booths are comfortable and afford you some privacy.  If you don't want to venture outside of the mall or can't get a table at Joey's then Baton Rouge is a safe choice."}
{"text":"Delicious ribs. Good Caesar salad. Great chicken and mushroom risotto. Fries were great. Great variety of food on the menu - something for everyone.   Negative: Garlic mashed potatoes were not that good. Too thick and kind of hard to swallow; not creamy. Nothing close to The Keg's mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Had a craving for steak so we decided to go to baton rouge. Hostess was ok, could have been more welcoming. Our server was good. Came to check up on us promptly. We ordered the sirloin and lobster and the strip loin. Both were amazing. Really satisfied or cravings! I still wish that this location cloud be more friendly and welcoming. Overall, food was great, service was good, atmosphere could be better ."}
{"text":"First time there with a couple friends and the first thing that jumped out to me was how OLD the decor and asthetics of the place looked. Our waiter was very friendly, attentive and prompt so all good there. The food however, was a big negative. The steak along with the mash and veggies were bland and over prepared. Same went for my wife's seafood dish, bland and over prepared.  We still enjoyed ourselves and again our waiter was excellent. Sadly, because the food was a huge miss...I won't be coming back and will advise others to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Two dinners at Baton Rouge on Commerce Valley Drive were enough to satisfy my meat lust for a long time.  (I admit I am not a lover of all things steak, and seldom indulge in anything more than a good hamburger.)  But, its convenient location close by my hotel made it a logical place to investigate. Going in, I did not know it was a steakhouse.  I thought it was a place for Cajun cuisine, a la Jambalaya Creole.   First visit, the Baby Back Ribs and Garlic Mashed were bone sucking great!  Sticky fingers never tasted so good.   Second visit, had a Medium grilled Burger that really satisfied my urge for a compelling First Bite Experience (FBE).  It was perfectly done, well garnished with cheese and hot peppers.  A little Dijon in place of Ketchup is also a secret for a seductive slider.   When I find myself back in that part of Markham, I am sure to visit again."}
{"text":"I love baton rouge and if I'm ever craving a slightly  fancier form of dining that's not Asian cuisine in Markham, this is my go to place. Staff is always friendly and attentive and food has never failed. Portions are very good. One of my friends commented that he didn't know potatoes grew so big (baked potatoes)! I've been to another location before and was very disappointed. I ordered a salad and it was the size of a side salad. I ordered the same salad several times at this location and it's huge to the point where I've packed it home a couple of times (and the prices are the same! ). I will never go to a different location with the fear that I will not be getting the same service or food."}
{"text":"Went to Baton Rouge at the Eaton Center last night for dinner, and the reason I went was because I walk past it every day, twice a day heading to and from work. It looked so beautiful on the inside and so festive for Christmas with their decor. We had reservation for 6PM for two.  All I have to say is if we had a reservation, why would they stick us in the corner of the restaurant where it does not impress me at all on effort. It wasn't packed, I asked for a Window seat, they could have put us in view of the windows. Anyways, our server Nichole said all the right words in a great tone as if she was a robot,  I'm saying this because her facial expressions & body language and the non-existence of a smile meant she did not really care or had interest in us as guest. Okay, I know I sound mean and difficult, but I'm really not. I'm just being observant and I'm saying how it was.   We ordered Filet Mignon, medium-well with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad ($32)and Ribs with French fries and cinnamon apples($29). Filet Mignon is the best steak you can have... Right? I'm pretty sure of it... Lol. Anyways so my steak was well-done, dry and tough... Like... McDonalds breakfast steak bagel taste better..... I had to put a lot of salt and pepper on it... The say, when you don't season your food while you're cooking, u put a lot of salt when it's served, it will still be tasteless. And I guess the gave me 1.5 lbs of mashed potatoes, with peppercorn sauce (I call it alright-gravy) and it tasted pretty good. Had their Thursday night \"End Bin\" red wine. Does \"End Bin\" mean cheapest wine they have? Lol. ($6 each) The ribs we ordered, 1/4 of it was burnt, I like burnt meat, but I didn't ask for it burnt lol. It wasn't that great. It was served with shoestring fries (from McCain?) lol and some warm sliced apples with cinnamon, which tasted great. It wasn't my meal, I just had samples lol.  So great for Mashed potatoes with peppercorn sauce, and cinnamon apples. I don't want to say my full experience but you get my drift. I gave them a chance even though I glanced through some yelp reviews. I should of trusted the yelpers!"}
{"text":"Nice staff great place for couples and friends What a pity they don't offer French wine per glass"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday and was disappointed with the service and food.  Ordered a kiwi mojito and the server comes back saying they ran out of kiwis for the day. Then ordered an alternate drink and took over 30 minutes to make it.  Steak and lobster entree was salty and vegetables were undercooked.  Will give them an extra star for not charging a plating fee and cutting our birthday cake.  Will not come back to this location."}
{"text":"Our server was great. The food was just very average. The only standout was the shrimp cocktail, where one of the three shrimps was about half the size of the other two jumbo shrimps. Our server reflected my dissatisfaction to the manager. However the manage reluctantly and begrudgingly replaced one of the substandard shrimps.   What we found odd was when we arrived at 6:00pm, there were many employers tables that could have seated our small party of three. We were informed the wait was about 20 minutes. Within that period we received a text to return as our table was ready. Oddly, the table given after the 20 minute wait was one of the empty tables in the bar area. I wonder if there was a cancellation, or if they wanted to have patrons all seated as close as possible to one time slot? Extremely odd, but I didn't want to start my meal with a confrontation.   It's been a while I've been to Baton Rouge. It'll be another extremely long while before I contemplate returning."}
{"text":"Nothing particularly special here. Very family friendly restaurant with the basic kids menu. Entrees were ok. The lobster bisque had a feel of cheddar soup consistency and not many large chunks of lobster. The lobster ravioli was meh, though it did have nice chunks of lobster in the sauce. Service was pleasant."}
{"text":"There are three things I can always count on when I eat at Baton Rouge (which we do every year since it's basically connected to the hotel my colleagues and I stay at while in Toronto):  1. One of us (if not more) will have something spilled on us during the meal by one of the servers. So far, it's been beer, cocktails, and a basket of tortilla chips.   2. While the hostesses/bartenders are always friendly and awesome, the waitstaff will be awkward, make weird, uncomfortable comments to us while ordering and during the meal (and we're a pretty thick skinned, easy to please crowd), and either ignore things like water refills, or be overly attentive and try to take our plates away AS we are still eating off of them and come back every few minutes asking if we are done yet. This last trip, we had about 12 people with us and at the end of the meal when the bill came, we handed them a card. The server asked \"So, everythign on the card?\" \"Yes, please put the whole meal on the card.\" \"Are you sure? So, everything? All of the meals?\" I mean...nothing terrible but just kind of redundant and unnecessary.  3. At the end of the whole experience, we all walk away feeling kind of weirded out by the vibe, and those of us who don't eat ribs unsatisfied with our meals while those who did get the ribs can at least say that they are really good.  To be fair, the cesar salad is tasty and the rest of the salads are HUGE and decent. The salad with chicken fingers looks good. So are the mashed potatoes.  NEVER order the side of baked beans, they suck, kind of taste like medicine, and are lukewarm and chunky in a mysterious way.   Next year, I'll probably skip out on this experience and opt for one of the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I see a lot of reviews claiming bad service but my group was attended to very well by a portly, caucasian server whose name I can't recall.  Came here for a friend's bday dinner and we had a group of 11. The wait time was crayyyyyyyy even though birthday boy had made the reservation a week in advance. Anyways, we got one of the big tables to our liking and started off with some appetizers. We got a small seafood platter (came with fried calamari, grilled calamari, grilled shrimp, grilled scallops) that came with butter and a chipotle mayo of sorts for dipping. The platter itself had a lil too much oil near the bottom but nevertheless the seafood tasted pretty good. The fried calamari dipped into the chipotle mayo was the best imo. We also ordered nachos with cheddar dip which was surprisingly good (all because of the cheddar dip which actually tasted homemade). My girlfriend got one of the set 3 course meals while most of us got the cowboy ribeye with our choice of side. I got my steak with a side of sweet potato fries which were crispy and really well fried. Almost no complaints on any of the steaks except for the friend across from me who ordered his rare and got a raw sashimi on the inside. The remaining steaks were all cooked to perfection and tasted great. One of the guys ordered the ribs (which I had considered) but he claimed the ribs weren't good at all and rather tough, which is surprising seeing how many rib awards are plastered up at the front of the restaurant. He probably just got a bad batch off the grill  TL;DR the service was excellent (contrary to what ppl hve said), the food was quite good for the most part (dare I try the ribs next time? they do look tasty from the pictures other yelpers have posted) and while it IS obviously going to be on the pricy side because its a steakhouse, it is still EVER so slightly cheaper than other places like the KEG.  Would I return? Definitely."}
{"text":"Not bad. Didn't love it, didn't hate it. Nothing overly exciting but for some reason it's always crowded so I guess some people love it."}
{"text":"2.5 stars is right on, folks.  Get the ribs or lobster risotto. I enjoyed the sweet potato fries. Skip thte chicken sandwich--it's not light, it's pretty dense \"chicken\" and roll.  Open late + close to Rogers Center, CN Tower etc.   But I am curious to try Canyon Creek or Loose Moose instead or I'd just stick to ribs + fries here for everybody whether at lunch or dinner. (Though I hear at lunch you may be able to ask for an off-the-menu sub of baked apples instead of fries, as a side)."}
{"text":"I have always seen the sign for this restaurant but have never ventured inside.  Well, my boyfriend and I decided to change that- after all it was on our list of places to try!  First things first, great service! Our server was on the ball and whenever I needed another drink he was there with it before I could ask! Now time for the food!  We both ordered Caesar Salads to start. Now I LOVE Caesar salad but, this one was not good. The Caesar dressing was more of a Caesar vinaigrette then anything else. It wasn't that good. However, when the mains came I was excited. I had ordered the filet mignon with peppercorn sauce. It was good- perfect temp and good flavour. My boyfriend has ordered the Crab Cake Sirloin. The crab cake was not that good from what he told me and the steak was cooked to his desired temp. So great on them for that!   All in all, it was a good experience and we will be there again I'm sure!"}
{"text":"I first went here 10 years ago but had to stop because my kids had peanut allergies and they used to cook their fries in peanut oil. Now they  stopped ad's now we're back.  Glad to see they have kept a consistent product (their ribs) as tasty as ever (a tad drier but still falling off the bone).  We had a good server, friendly but not b overly, and attentive.  Great meal...always on my mind to return. Plus kids loved their chicken fingers (looked home made no processed) and pasta..."}
{"text":"Came here at 12:30 with a party of 9 it's now 1:40 only 3 people have been served. I had to leave before I got my meal because I'm at a convention. We made a reservation 2 weeks ago so they should have been aware of my party size.  They comped the meal but it is still disappointing for a busy downtown restaurant to have such terrible service.   My staff texted me later saying they git the order wrong so they are still waiting...  I'd think twice before eating at this location... but I really wouldn't know about ghe food quality since I'm at my course hungry...."}
{"text":"I had the lobster poutine for poutine week. I know this is a special dish I expected it to be specially good. It was the most inedible poutine I've ever had. The lobster bits were tiny and most definitely frozen. They had a disgusting watery taste to them. The gravy was barely warm and lumpy. Probably from a can. Because the fries were so thin, they got soggy from the crappy gravy and watery lobster. It was like I was eating potato spaghetti. It also really doesn't help when the waiter is trying to rush you out when there was barely anyone in the restaurant. Never coming back."}
{"text":"This baton rouge was okay, it was a chain store, much like the keg if you like this chain's cooking you will be okay with any of its brethren.  Overall this restaurant is not one of the best nor is it one of the worst. it doesn't really stand out, and for the most parts the restaurant is a bit pricey for what it offers. i believe the keg is overall better. i had the steak here which i ordered a medium rare, and it was okay. the seasoning was fine, but the beef quality was not that great. certainly not what i expected for a meal where the steak costs 40 dollars after tax and tip is included. if you want great steak i wouldnt' expect too much here, it is average for the most parts, you will probably find better steaks at non chain restaurants."}
{"text":"It was my first night in Toronto, and a friend who lives there suggested this restaurant, since it was walking distance to my hotel downtown. You would think with a name like Baton Rouge, it would be a New Orleans-style/Cajun or a French restaurant. Well, it's none of the above. The waitress actually told us their specialty is pork ribs. My coworker who was with us had those and I tried a rib. They were decent to above average.   My friend and I each had the top sirloin steak, which was around $23 (CAD), juicy and flavorful. It was cooked more medium than the requested medium rare but still good. With the steak I received a Caesar salad and baked potato. I was warned by the waitress that their Caesar dressing was more of a vinegarette, which I thought was odd, but it went well with the salad. The baked potato was tasty but kind of small. It's hard to find a restaurant that will give you a large baked potato with your steak, seems like. Our other diner was a child, so she ordered the pasta from the kids menu, which was a pretty big portion (she took 1/2 of it home) and it also came with ice cream.   Two of us had 2 Molson Canadian draft beers each with the meal and the total for the 3 adults and 4 kids came to around $120 (CAD), which wasn't too bad. Our server was nice and attentive. I'm not sure I'd specifically go back to this place when I visit Toronto again, but everything was decent so I wouldn't be opposed to returning."}
{"text":"Filet was delicious, ribs were great, ahi tuna appetizer was great but beer was warm.  The killer though, was the sizzling mushrooms. They were amazing! Seasoned and sautéed to perfection. I will definitely be back at this place. Just please, chill your glasses!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! My fiancé had the BR burger and he loved it and I had the club sandwich. For dessert we had the BR cookie and it was SO good! Great experience and will return in the future! :)"}
{"text":"I'm not ecstatic about the service but I'm pretty satisfied about it during my experience. What was interesting was my trip from the washroom back to the table, I walked past 5+ uniformed servers as if it's a never-ending Deja Vu of them here.   I did feel a bit of impatience with our assigned server but that was our fault for waiting on that last person to begin our order. Not much happiness to be shared here, it's very business business attitude with most staff except from an occasional one.  3.5 *Star*  As to Baton Rouge standard, this is a setting to schmooze over your Associates/Partners/Date/Friend or get your friend to pay for that meal they owe you but think you forgot about. I'm a generous guy, so I didn't dig deep into my buddy's pocket therefore we came to Baton Rouge rather than The Keg or other $30+ Steak-only Steakhouses.   BBQ Baby Back Ribs(10 oz/$20) where I chose the 2 side(Coleslaw, Cinnamon Apple) option. Considering this full service environment, the price is pretty reasonable compared to portion size like other BBQ spots. It was definitely as advertised with fall-off-the-bone and you can smell some smokiness. The Rack had approximately 7 Ribs or so and the Coleslaw and Cinnamon Apple was good accompaniment.   Being generous doesn't mean I don't eat as my portion was slightly under my norm portion size while maybe perfect for some average consumers. I dug in to my friend's Fall Special Menu Steak and it was seasoned(Salt & Pepper) and cooked medium rare, melt in your mouth. I'm no Steak expert, but that price offered wasn't too bad especially with your choice of Side and Appetizer Salad."}
{"text":"Good restaurant. The decor would suggest that this place is high end, but the cost would suggest otherwise. The pricing is decent, the food is decent and the service is good. I wouldn't need to go back, but it was good and I left with a full stomach!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and great service! The food was delicious and the waiter was extremely helpful and easy-going. I ordered the santa fe chicken with garlic mashed potatoes, while my friends ordered the atlantic salmon fillet and the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was yummy! The waiter would come by and make small-talk while asking us how are meal is and if there is anything else we wanted to order. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Nice service, the waiter was really cool and engaging. Got some beer and an amazing hamburger here and loved it. Will come back here again if I'm in Toronto,"}
{"text":"So we thought this would be a winner!  Martinis, Caesar salad, Louisiana Spinach Dip, Mississippi Delta calamari, a nice Cab Sav and the piece de resistance - Prime Ribs.  Well the prime rib was resistant - resistant to knives and teeth!  This was like shoe leather - not good at all.  The cut didn't even look like prime rib!  Everything else was good - at best an average rating for the rest, but big hint do not spend the $ on the 14 or 10 oz Prime Rib - worst we ever had."}
{"text":"The food is quite good and portions are decent.   The $19    10oz rib special is good but interestingly enough they did not give any discount if we wanted the 16oz size.  Service  is so-so.  First off the hostess put us in the busy part of the bar because all the free tables were not cleared.  In fact, tables all over the restaurant were not cleared throughout the dinner-dirty dishes, plates etc were disgustingly all over the restaurant.   The food is very good and temperature was right but the rest of the experience with the \"people\" took away from the experience.   No one was rude, in fact they were polite BUT they needed us to ask for things and did not initiate.  We had to ask for water, plates, bread, steak sauce.....refinement will make this a five."}
{"text":"Not Bad, not Great. Didn't leave the place thinking I can't wait to go back, just left thanking I found a decent spot on a Saturday night. My food felt like it was missing something and I'm still looking for it"}
{"text":"Our first time at this location and we were ruined by food poisoning! We ordered mashed potatoes with both of our entrees and our entire Halloween weekend was ruined as we spent it, instead, sick. Will never return."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I would have expected.  It's in a more touristy part of the city.  I was there after work on a Friday for a drink and app with my wife before attending a show at CBC (it's right across the street).  Having never been to a Baton Rouge, the experience was 'so so'.  In comparison to a Keg, or Canyon Creek - it doesn't touch it.  Worth a try anyways.  Not sure if I will rush back......."}
{"text":"Come here for work lunches regularly.  Service is quick and friendly.  Good flavor and quality is good and great.  Why both??  Bc on some recent visits,  my colleagues ordered the lobster risotto and lobster roll. Risotto salty, numbing to tongue Lobster roll-was a fair portion of lobster but really cold.  I had prime rib sandwich and that was Delish!   Onion rings were yummy but a small side was $8. Calamari was good too Spinach and arty dip-always good.  Steaks are tasty and cooked to your liking.   Service- if it's not right,  they'll do their best to correct.  I find that when they know you're on a work lunch, they are quite friendly bc they know you're spending a few bucks.   Price point is mediocre and equivalent to other steak houses.   Interior needs an update. Quite dark.   Overall good food and service.  Amongst other restaurants in the Eaton Center this one seems to be the most consistent."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I have cravings for ahi tuna. I think it's one of the best in town. Unlike most restaurants that give you a few slices of ahi tuna and charges $25-30, baton rouge gives you the the whole tuna steak. The proportion fulfills my cravings. The sauce for the tuna steak is also very delicious! I love to pick fries as a side because the tuna sauce and the fries just go so well together. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Such a shame, with a wonderful location and a restaurant that's delivers mediocre at its best.  What we wanted where some good ribs. What we where served was cold ribs along with not made to order sides: fries, beans w/ beef and apples sprinkled with not fresh cinnamon.  They did replace our orders with hot food, but again those sides where not made to order.  We where given desert for free. That didn't fair well either as it came fresh out of the microwave.  I don't plan on going back anytime soon.  Much better offerings in the area."}
{"text":"Frankly I am surprised! I was a regular patron of Baton Rouge in Montreal, and was always pleased by their Chicken Fingers. I had not tried any Toronto location until a few days ago.  Judy and I went on Thursday night, at about 8:30 to have a quick meal. It is difficult to park there because there is a hugely popular tea shop, but we persevered and found a spot.  The interior of the restaurant is very well done, with beautifully cofferred ceilings, and tremendously attractive artificial plants. The seating is comfortable and intimate (for a big space), and the service could be just a tiny bit better. There is a step that leads to the booths surrounding the restaurant that is can be a hazard, but it is 'signed' on all tables at the booth.  Their featured item for the day was a full rack of baby back ribs which I ordered. My much better half ordered one their specialty hamburgers. As sides we both ordered the beans and I added the baked cinnamon apple slices.  Judy pronounced the hamburger delicious. As to the rib they were truly \"falling off the bone\". I was able, using a knife and fork, and no effort whatsoever to eat all the juicy morsels and strip the bones clean. They were very good. I would have prepared a slightly more tangy sauce, or even a dry rub, and on that account they do not get their 5th star. The beans and apples were delicious.  Another curious note is that with their relatively stiff price range for casual dining, they offer neither bread nor salad. This is a departure from their direct competitors and prompted me to remove a further 1/2 star. But since Yelp does not unable 1/2 stars I am in the habit on rounding down.  They can tweak the food a bit, add bread and salad and really shine! We will be back."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a good steak? What i love about Baton Rouge is the variety of steaks they have and that you don't have to spend a small fortune on dinner to get a great steak! They have so many wonderful options to choose from and great place to stop in for lunch too. This was the 3rd location i tried of the popular chain and quickly became one of my fav places for steak, ribs etc. over the usual places like Keg etc.   Over the Christmas holidays i had some time to visit some old fav places of mine. I was on a mission for ribs, so naturally the only place to go is Baton Rouge. Plus with so much shopping & prepping for the holidays, i hadn't been out to a good restaurant for a while. I love the ambience of the restaurant and all the cozy booths they have in addition to the large tables for big groups. A great place for family night or a date night.  Here is what we indulged in:  Spinach dip appetizer - served warm with salsa, chips & sour cream. One of the best spinach dips i've tried. It's made with a blend of spinach, artichoke & cheese. Rich, creamy and tastes like homemade!  Ribs & fries - fall of the bone, tender, super delicious and basted with their very own bbq sauce. Shoestring cut seasoned fries & baked beans (with bacon!) So many options & variation of sides to choose from. Baton Rouge made me fall in love with ribs all over again.   Rib steak w/garlic mash & an order of caesar salad (which used to be included, but now only costs $4 to add to your order) - this was my hubby's meal. His steak was grilled to perfection, cooked perfectly to a medium rare just like he requested and was a great cut. He really enjoyed his dinner.  For dessert we each had a chocolate mousse - no description or words needed except for - amazing!  This was a great meal after a week of turkey, leftovers & take out. My only criticism about this location would be that the service isn't always as consistent as the food. Which sometimes makes for a not so great overall experience. Otherwise it's great food and a great night.   Another plus & bonus for me - they have a kids menu! Can't find too many steak houses that do!  I do have to add that they have some of the best if not THE best chicken tenders! Juicy tenders coated with a nice crunchy batter with homemade dijonnaise & bbq to dip into. Overall great menu with so many great options. And wonderful to see that there are some old favs and some newer items since the last time i was there, so i'm definitely looking forward to another visit soon to try some of them out!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here on a Thursday night and had reservations so we were seated pretty quickly. For the appetizer, we shared the spinach dip. I like how it also came with sour cream and salsa on the side for the tortilla chips. However, the spinach dip itself was lacking... not sure what, but it wasn't amazing. There also wasn't a lot of spinach. The consistency was very thin and I have had way better elsewhere, but it wasn't horrible.  For entrees... Goat Cheese Top Sirloin: I really thought this would be great, but it was quite disappointing. The goat cheese barely had any flavour- it was more like buttery stuff on my steak mixed with a shitload of walnuts on top. The steak itself was good though.  Ribs & Chicken: My dad loves ribs and really enjoyed (and quickly devoured!) his dish. He said it was really delicious and had lots of barbeque flavour to it.  Lobster risotto: My sister said the plate was covered with more green onions than rice, but the flavour was good and there was a lot of lobster.  I might potentially come back here to try other dishes; however, considering how the prices are somewhat similar to the Keg, I will probably return to the Keg because I like their steaks better and their ambiance."}
{"text":"We were in a hurry coming from the nearby convention centre and needed a quick lunch that would sustain us through an afternoon of conferencing. We asked when we walked in if we could get things fairly quickly and the staff were very pleasant about helping us out. We both ordered off the lunch menu, a steak and frites, plus a kale and goat cheese salad that was very nice and came with the soup of the day or potato soup loaded with cheddar, real bacon bits, and green onions. Tea or coffee was also included. Everything was very good (nothing mind-blowing from a culinary perspective, but quite good), and quick. Friendly service and a nice atmosphere for lunch, so this definitely worked for us."}
{"text":"I can't shake a Red Stick at Baton Rouge.  I used to eat here regularly, constantly resorting to the ribs, which remains as a signature dish.  Today's lunch was a return after a 6 year absence, and guess what I had THIS time?  Ribs.  For $19 you get a tender rack of baby backs, with two sides.  I chose the fries and beans.  As usual, the ribs were ultra tender.  I simply pulled the meat off the bones with my fork and kept my fingers clean.  Good thing, since this was a business lunch.  To be clear: these are not \"low and slow\" smoked ribs ala Memphis BBQ or Big Bone BBQ for a similar price.  Their sheer tenderness can only come from braising, which some rib purists would scoff at.  Instead I scarfed.  Every morsel.  Baton Rouge has a comfortable, classy, old school steakhouse vibe, with red vinyl booth seats, lots of rich stained wood and a great wait staff. You can get better ribs for the same money at real rib joints, but you are going to be eating off of brown wrapper paper tablecloths, while sitting on cheap chairs.  There is a small price premium for an elegant atmosphere, so think up a business excuse for a meal and order up the ribs..."}
{"text":"Excellent service...Excellent food...Excellent everything!  Their food portions are big and fulfilling and most importantly of all...Tasty!  The service...They don't forget what each person ordered (we had a fairly big table) and everything arrived in a timely manner.  I so want to go back!"}
{"text":"I usually don't expect much when it comes to restaurants in the mall but I actually like Baton Rouge in Eaton Centre.   Their steaks are not the greatest, it's never really cooked to my liking. Despite one time sending it back, found it to be too tough or even undercooked still. However, I remember their Ahi Tuna salad being pretty delicious! So I would definitely recommend that. Cheddar dip appetizer is good too. As for desserts, pass on any ice creams and maybe just try the cheesecake if you really want something to nibble on.   I haven't been here in a while, but last Friday I came back for their LaPoutineWeek promotion. $10 for poutine topped with lobster. Yum!! I think it's part of the regular menu as well. The portion is huge, definitely able to get a cheap filling meal even if you are splitting the poutine w/ a friend. Lol. I did for my pre appetizer, right before going off to a winterlicious dinner. Haha. Just recheck about portions if you order this. Idk if there will be a difference in size portion of promo vs. regular menu. Show them this picture or something as reference. Ha!   Note: expect a 20-30 min wait if you go during busy times and have no reservations. My friend and I skipped that by just heading over to the bar and eating there. We were short on time and after ordering, only had to wait like 15 min max for our food to arrive."}
{"text":"The food is always good here, but the service tonight was incredible. Daniel, is an amazing server. He was very attentive and he kept checking to see how we were doing. This location is very lucky to have such incredible staff!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! For a first time visit, I expected the prices to be high based on past reviews, but it was soo worth it!  I ordered the Smoked Margarita to start and it was delicious! It also came with a cute little shot glass of Hickory sticks pinned with a little clothes pin to the cup. Drink was a little sweeter than expected but still good.   For my entree I had the Ribs and Chicken combo, which came with 10 oz ribs and 2 chicken tenders with a side of sweet potato fries for $28. The ribs came right off the bone and the BBQ sauce was amazing! The chicken tenders on the other hand were below average. They came soggy and the chicken was bland, but I guess the Dijon sauce helped quite a bit. The sweet potato fries were perfectly crispy and the Chipotle mayo with it added the perfect finish to the entree.  For dessert I had one of the mini Caramel creme brules. I attempted to order the Trio but wasn't a fan of Chai Tea and they said they were out of chocolate, and I thought 3 caramel creme brules was a little over kill, so I just got the one for $3. Worth the price and the perfect ending to a meal at a reasonable price.  The staff was great. Attentive while not being too \"in your face\" asking how the food was.  The atmosphere was also pretty good. They had a bar off to the side for those who wanted to be a little rowdy and a huge seating area to the left with booths and circle tables for more relaxed or intimate experiences.   Overall, great night and would return...but on a special occasion. A $250 bill for 5 people isn't something I can afford often :p"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this place I end up being overly FULL by the end of it. Me and my sisters have been coming to this place for the past two years for our annual \"Sister Day\" as it is usually one of the nicest restaurants and is right in the Eaton Center. This location is kind of hidden if you are shopping at the mall but if you are walking along Yonge Street it can't be missed.   This year we decided to start with an appetizer of Spinach Dip and Calamari. The calamari was fried just enough and came with an aioli that my sisters both dipped everything possible in. The spinach dip was great however the artichoke can be too much and the cheese does get over powering after the while. The crunchy tortilla chips that came with it were just good enough for me to chow down on its own.   I ordered a burger with shoe string fries. Baton Rouge does not cheapen out with their shoe string fries as they came pilled next to my burger. My burger was juicy, tender and everything I would want out of a burger..however after having the appetizers I did get full very quickly and left some fries. Baton Rouge also does free refills which is a bonus for me at every restaurant.  The server was very friendly but was just there to do his job and didn't converse much but he did his job and politely checked up on us here and there.   I would return to this location for a celebration, it isn't always the place to go to if your hungry as you will be digging deep in your pocket once your bill arrived at your table."}
{"text":"As it was my first time here, I went straight for their signature ribs.  Ordered the BBQ Pork Ribs Tro (10 oz Ribs, 6 oz Chicken, 5 Tiger Shrimps) with a baked potato side for $35. The ribs were really \"fall off the bone\" and it had a smokiness taste to it. It was probably the only highlight for that night.  The chicken was smothered in the same sauce as the BBQ pork ribs, so I was indifferent to the taste. Nothing special.  As compared to the BBQ ribs + chicken combo ($25), the additional $10 goes to the 5 tiger shrimps. I imagined tiger shrimps to be bigger in size, but I was wrong. There was nothing special to it, and not for an extra $10.  Other than the food, it was a quiet night. Service was slow, but attentive.  I would come back for the ribs. But other than that, there are better options out there for a good meal."}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient staff at entrance and as our waiters. We had the sour puss bramble and the James' Son, the SPB was alright I wouldn't order again but the James' was delicious! We took a picture of the ingredients to make our own. Then we ordered the calamari which is our usual app we order and it was absolutely delicious! Then we ordered the Louisiana chicken salad and the burger and they were okay, wouldn't order them again. I would go back for the James' Son and Calamari!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times. Each visit has been a positive and pleasant experience.  The food was top notch, much better than I expected."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment this past Saturday evening of Labor Day weekend. Extremely disappointing. The wait staff were totally disinterested in providing any type of service to their customers.  Took ten minutes to have our drink orders taken.  Should have left then.  The staff spent more time on their cell phones in full view of diners, as well as socializing amongst themselves and fixing their hair than attending to their customers.   Food, once arrived, was average at best.  Never again."}
{"text":"Husband and myself went for his b'day lunch.  He ordered a glass of milk with his meal.  It was sour.  We should've left at that point, but we had already ordered.  Then came the spinach dip, which I'm sure they used the same sour milk to prepare.  It was a disgusting greasy mess.  Then the steak and chicken Caesar salads arrived.  The steak was like a cowboy burger, and the chicken was tasteless.  What a horrid dining experience.  And it was very over-the-top expensive.  I've had tastier grub at greasy spoons for a quarter of the price.  I plan on contacting the health board in Toronto about the sour milk, and poor quality food of this restaurant. Please don't dine here. I wouldn't want anyone to get sick."}
{"text":"Bâton Rouge is an upscale casual chain in the GTA known for their steaks & ribs. This location is actually relatively close so I've been here many times for family dinners. They have some of the best ribs I've had, very tender and they fall off the bone very easily. They're fresh & taste pretty great. The atmosphere is a bit dated with wooden decor but very clean overall. As another reviewer noted, lot of kids which is surprising as I never thought of Bâton Rouge as a family restaurant necessarily.  Overall it's a decent restaurant that's a step up from similar chains like Joey's Moxie's."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great place to order ribs, fries and chicken dishes. The prices are pretty high but the food is good. Located right at Eaton Center, on Yonge street. Great for quiet dinner, or birthday party. Unless you happen to have a rude waiter."}
{"text":"This is your typical Baton Rouge: yummy food, cocky waiter, $$$ bill. I believe the Baton Rouge ribs are the best and I like to try their ribs whenever I can. Since the chain closed their Toronto locations, I was happy to find this restaurant in Quebec. The decor is nice, the restaurant was not very busy and the ribs tasted as good as always. As I have experienced in Toronto before, the waiter seemed annoyed by something and I could not figure out if it was me or my food choices. The fake friendliness could not mask the rolling eyes and the whole confrontational attitude.  Prices are high, but the ribs are excellent. With appropriate service this place could get a solid 5-star rating."}
{"text":"We really liked this restaurant! The staff here is much friendlier and nicer than at the Baton Rouge at Eaton Centre. The food is always good and fresh, also the location is great. I just learned that they closed down this location. How disappointing."}
{"text":"Steak was great way better then the keg. Waiting at the bar area was fun but a little longer then was told. We will go back again."}
{"text":"The restaurant in itself is really nice and big! The food is good but overpriced for me. I had a seared ahi tuna salad for $21. It was good but it was not amazing. And the portion was not huge. The bathroom was not really clean, which usually says a lot about a restaurant. Our waitress was also a bit rude. Maybe she was in a bad mood or something..."}
{"text":"Your typical seafood and steakhouse restaurant.  Ambiance and environment is a bit more upscale than your usual western restaurants as it is highly renovated and decorated.  Food was good, nothing alarming or spectacular, but good overall.  Service was typical, however, I must admit that more attention should be focused on ensuring that the table all around has enough water.  I think this is a pet peeve of mines, but when waitresses and waiters do not come to visit the table often enough to ensure that customer satisfaction is there, as well as that there is enough water to go around, I believe that I can not rate a western restaurant that usually expects their clients to tip in the range of 20-25% above average in terms of service or even standard service.  In a modern age where people are starting to want more not only from the client's standpoint (in terms of service), but also from the server's standpoint (in terms of wages), I think it is only fair to assume that if you are going to pay a premium to have a dinner at a restaurant that wants or almost mandates you to tip, that good service is table stakes.  Now, there are some things that have to be kept in mind, the day we went as a group of 8-10 people, was also the day that a lot of the Toronto teams were playing and hence, it is to be expected that service might be a bit slower than normal.   Overall, not something I will say is a must go to in terms of food quality and service, but is a good place to just lay back and enjoy your food without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Pros:  Location Seating Decor Family friendly  Cons:  Quality of food Overworked staff/lack of staff Poor management   Summary: Evening time at The Baton Rouge on Yonge St. Looks fantastic from the inside out! We both have been wanting to go for a while as we both are steak lovers and have been to different steak places across North America. The wait time was good for a busy, Friday night (10 mins). Alex was our waiter and he was very sweet and polite. My friend and I were seated and it took a while for the waiter to take our food order. When we finally ordered they took 20 mins to bring 2 glasses of wine. We could have walked to the bar, bought a drink, sat back down and still waited an extra 20 mins for our appetizer. 50 mins later and we only have our appetizer. 20 mins later our entree came and it was cold. Our meat was cooked rare instead of medium rare. I wouldn't have said anything but my friend had mentioned that her steak was undercooked as well. We politely asked Alex for our steak to be grilled a little longer. We didn't want to cause any fuss; we only wanted to eat the $130 meal we were going to pay for as this was 1.5 hrs at this point. An older waitress with long, light coloured hair named Christina, asked what our issue was and we just explained that we wanted our steak cooked a little while longer. Christina was very aggressive and not sympathetic. We understand that it is more work to reheat a steak, however we weren't going to waste $100 in steak meals; as well we weren't going to eat a mouthful of blood unless we asked for it.   *side note The bathrooms were not tidy and dirty.   She took it away; she was fuming. We were very apathetic to Alex who had to run around a whole section with so many people. I don't know if they didn't have enough staff, employ jaded people or overwork their staff.   I do not blame anyone, I understand that things happen; but I will never go to the Baton Rouge again. I'm very disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the wife and 3 kids recently on a shopping trip downtown. I'd rate the overall experience as between Meh... and A-OK. We all had ribs as it seemed to be their specialty.  Food was passable.  Not bad, but not terribly awe-inspiring either.  Was what I expected. The service was fantastic, I don't know if this was because the place was not very busy, or because we lucked out, but our server was attentive, seemed truly happy to be there, and very personable.  This saved our experience!"}
{"text":"I use come here just for the ribs, but recently the quality of the ribs have gone downhill a little.  The prime rib has now exceeded the quality of the ribs.  Be sure to give that a try.  They give a generous serving of sides.  Service is superb!  You're not stuck with one waiter/waitress you can ask anyone for assistance."}
{"text":"We were a bit late in booking a table for mother's day. But Baton Rouge had a slot for 5pm. So we took it. The girl on the phone that took my reservation was very pleasant. And even called me the day before to follow up.  Our family chose the set prix menu, which included a main entree, salad or soup, and a dessert.   My choice was the Top Sirloin, Lobster Tail and loaded baked potato. I also chose soup and the soup of the day was Seafood Jambalaya. The soup was tasty and very flavorful! The top sirlion was also cooked to my liking of medium rare. Lobster tail was nice and plump and juicy. Loaded potato was huge, and was filled with all the fixing. The dessert at the end was a huge slice of cheesecake, which was delish!  Our server Keith was outstanding as well. Very attentive. And was on par for everything. :)"}
{"text":"Typical Baton Rouge location. Over priced, good quality food. Service was slow at this location like past experiences at this chain. Seating area was huge and barely 1/4 full."}
{"text":"I live across from baton rouge on yonge street and this location is a million times better, I can't believe they are suppose to be the same restaurant?  I ordered the steak and it was so good and cooked just the way I liked it, it was almost to good to be true. I think it might of just been the best steak I have ever had. It's really hard to find one these days.  The baked potato was the perfect size, I hate it when restaurants give you these tiny little potato's.. What am I suppose to do with it?  The ribs were excellent too, but I think my steak was better!  The food was reasonably priced for what we ordered. The woman beside our table had a completely raw steak, I like mine medium-well and she ended up sick in the washroom. Ambulance and fire had to come to the restaurant and they were trying to blame it on the food they ate, well the steak was extremely raw and she did have a few glasses of wine..   Overall, the experience was good and amusing."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with my family. I threw up the tilapia they served in the washroom. It was their \"special\" the waitress said. Serves me right for thinking they can do fish right. It was dry and bathed in their cajun spice. Not great lunch at all. The people here are all 20ish so the service is really subpar and way too (fake) friendly."}
{"text":"This is basically a Denny's with dimmer lights, better decor and possibly worse service.   I'm not generally a huge fan of suburban chain restaurants but there are some higher-end chain restaurants that are still pretty good, this is NOT one of them.   I was given a $50 gift certificate to this Baton Rouge location so I thought: why not? Well, I'll tell you why not. Even though the majority of our dinner was free (our total was $59), I still wish I had never ventured to this place.   The service was TERRIBLE! We received the service I would have expected at a greasy diner that was full of people. How this place claims to be a higher end chain, I don't get it. Our server knew nothing about the menu when asked questions about various dishes. Our plates were just thrown down on the table with no consideration. Our waitress never offered to fill up our 'bottomless' empty glasses. We wait for an exceedingly long time for our table to be cleared after we finished eating even though multiple servers walked by and noticed we were finished.   As for the food... I don't understand how this place gets away with charging what they do for the food. The garden starter salad was undoubtably out of a bag. The garlic mashed were flavourless and the tuna steak had been frozen. The ribs were okay, I'll give them that.   Regardless this experience in general was awful. I don't know how this place stays in business considering it's competitors (other high end chain restaurants) actually serve good food and are on point with service."}
{"text":"Whenever you hit the Eaton Centre (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/toronto-eaton-centre-toronto), you've got the choices of places in the many food courts or one of the other restaurants in the mall.  Duke of Richmond (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/duke-of-richmond-pub-toronto) is good for pub food and Mr. Greenjeans (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mr-greenjeans-restaurant-and-bar-toronto) and City Grille (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/city-grill-toronto) are decent enough.  That's when Baton Rouge came in.  I remember the first time I saw them here, which was the first time I heard of the franchise, so I figured I'd give them a go.  Let me say first off that I went in expecting nothing.  It's a restaurant in a mall for crying out loud.  The décor is dark wood and darkly lit; a labyrinth of booths and tables that snake their way back to the kitchen along the east side of the mall.  The tap list and wine list are decent enough, and give you a sense that this is a higher end place, but the illusion ends there.  It's a rib & burger & steak & fish place, pure and simple.  The ribs are as tasty as you're going to find outside of the American mid-west or a bona fide barbecue restaurant in the city, the burgers are as decent as any other franchise, and the steaks are grilled as you'd expect from any restaurant serving them.  It's a pleasant experience and a decent option if you don't want to leave the mall.  You can find more interesting places further afield outside of the Eaton Centre (is that obvious?), but there is a consequence for convenience."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch time for some appetizers. We got the chicken fingers which weren't crunchy and the dipping sauces was not good. My boyfriend LOVED the yam fries. The calamari and the potato soup let me down.. They both had a funky taste.   I've seen some really good reviews about there steak and ribs so I'll try that out next time! Overall don't get appetizers, stick with the entrees."}
{"text":"eh.. this place isn't bad but there's nothing bayou, cajun or louisiana about it.  it's your generic franchise restaurant, decent burgers, steak and beer.   three stars for false advertising"}
{"text":"Food was kinda cold when delivered and overall the place looks fancy but it's a glorified Applebees."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge is the definition of \"average\". The only exception is that prices are a bit high for the average food. 18$ for a chicken breast and one side.  Average service? Check. Average piece of slightly overcooked BBQ chicken breast? Check. Average portion sizes? Check. Average mashed potatoes? Check. Average amount of sauce on chicken? Check. Average menu item could have been prepared at home by anyone? Check. Average overall experience? Check."}
{"text":"Service needs improvement. their famous baby back ribs wasn't that great but was good in flavour only"}
{"text":"Baton Rouge is one of the chained restaurants that I like.  For one, they have a well-executed theme that they may enrich from but never sway away.  Second, I like the richness of its decoration and the heavy front door.  Upon entry, Baton Rouge has an old school steakhouse feel, but not to the point of stuffiness.  In terms of menu, they have dinner menu, lunch menu and children menu.  They even give out drawing paper mats and crayons to children.    Baton Rouge is known for its ribs.  The ribs are meaty and the meat is fall-off-the-bone tender.  They taste rich, smoky and have a hint of sweetness.  For lunch menu, the portion is good for $19.  I also tried their Atlantic Salmon for lunch ($22) once.  It tasted decent but nothing blow me away.  Last but not least, if you may, choose the cinnamon apples as a side.  It is quite a delicious dessert.  Services are professional.  Soda and hot tea were graciously refilled.    Overall, 4 stars for well portioned food and consistent quality."}
{"text":"Took a few friends out for dinner. Decided to go with the filet mignon instead of the recommended ribs. Still ended up trying the ribs as one of the ladies ordered a full rack :) Asked for medium rare and received rare, but other than that a fine meal with great service and good atmosphere. Also, didn't put as big a dent in the wallet as I'd expected, so it's got that going for it which is nice."}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst Baton Rouge I've been to.  We popped in for a pre theatre dinner last night, on our way to see Ross Pettys new annual pantomime, Sleeping Beauty. We were greeted by a hostess and we were seated near the bar, in abooth, whose leather benches were ripped beyond repair. In a feeble attempt to hide their age, a crude (and failed attemp) to tape the gap closed may have been successful when the rips appeared, however one does not like to dine on exposed foam (which was a grungy, dirty, unhygienic brown). Yikes I thought, as I sat down. I was going to ask for a different booth, however we were pressed for time and I thought I could position myself off to the side of the rip. Our waiter was fairly good, he was over shortly after we were seated, listed off the daily specials, took a drink order, and off he went. On to the food: I ordered the Louisiana Chicken with garlic mashed potatoes. Zero garlic taste to the potatoes, perhaps the blandest I've ever had dining out. The chicken was smothered in dried out vegetables (zucchini and red peppers) and the chicken itself was overcooked and dried out as well. It did have an ample amount of goat cheese however, that couldn't compensate for the rest of the dinner being a disappointment. My dining companion had the chicken fingers, with fries and coleslaw. He enjoyed the fingers, said the coleslaw was good, however the shoestring fries had nary a hint of seasoning. Don't know if this location serves their fries differently, but other locations add Lowry's seasoning to their fries, which sets them apart from other joints.....so he was a tad disappointed in the fries. Draft beer was $8/glass...fairly steep. Dinner, as described above, with 2 beers and a Diet Coke, taxes, came to just over $60, a fair amount had the food quality been good. Would I go back? If in the area and pressed, maybe. I wouldn't go out of my way to return though."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5 Service: 3/5  Location: 3/5   I've come here many times over the past couple years and I think it's one of the better chain type restaurants out there. My favourite dish is their BBQ Pork Back Ribs served with a side of crispy sweet potato fries! And every year they do a Ribs special where a 10 oz. rack is only around $18 - a really great deal! Since I'm a pasta fan I've tried most of their variations, but they are nothing really that special. I often go to this location, but I'm sure the quality is pretty consistent across the rest of the chain."}
{"text":"Salmon was completely undercooked, was basically raw apart from the outside. Very disappointed especially with the price. They took it back and overcooked it. Didn't end up eating dinner. Mashed potatoes were decent though. Service was alright but all in disappointed with how they handled the situation. First and last experience at Baton Rouge.  They decided to pay in the end. Happier with that."}
{"text":"Investigated the menu online and found some items that caught my interest.   Started off with the lobster spring rolls as appetizer for $12. Comes with a side arugula salad. Didn't like how the lobster was ground down to a paste and stuffed in the spring roll. Could hardly taste any lobster. The salad had this weird dressing which was not to my liking and the arugula leaves were a bit wilted and not very fresh.   Not a very good start to the meal. First strike.   Prime rib sandwich $18 - One look at the sandwich and I was not impressed. The prime rib is not prime rib in my books. More like fried beef slices to me which was plain in taste. The aju didn't make the sandwich taste any better. The dish comes with more fries than one can eat. The fries were sliced very thin and didn't have much crunch to them. I wouldn't be surprised if they were frozen fries.  Two strikes so far.  My guest had the lobster sandwich for $17 - Once again it came with a pile of fries which could feed two people. The lobster was cut to very small chunks and I would say there was a very small amount of lobster. For $17 I would expect a little better quality than this.   Three strikes and we were out.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong stuff on the menu but for the money you pay here you expect more. I'm sure if I tried the ribs which they are more famous for, I would have enjoyed my meal more. This time around though I can only justify a 2 star. Service was good at least."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. It used to be my safe place to meet and have dinner with friends and family.  I also took clients here on lunch meetings. Quality has deteriorated and noticed it on the last few visits.   Last straw for me was when the mucked up my ribs. Twice.  For a rib place to screw up on something they specialize on is unforgivable in my view.  Ribs were dry and inedible.  2 stars was for the manager that offered to bring me  another one and when I declined, just yanked the ribs off the bill."}
{"text":"I have been here for the first time last night with my girlfriend. Much ado about nothing. Just the regular boring american type of menu at a very high prince.  We ordered what I thought it would be a cheese platter but it was a nacho dip. Boring. And then one fillet mignon and one NY sirloin ...two glasses of good wine indeed, a cranky waitress  and the bill was 150 dollars. Really? Next day ( today) I ate at a Japanese restaurant on College and I was full with 5$!  So I didn't pay for luxury 'cause Baton Rouse is far from being luxurious, it's a God damn chain...what did I pay for? For trying this brand once in a lifetime. That's all.  Anyway...Baton Rouge, overpriced mediocrity!"}
{"text":"Sat. night, 6PM, 4 of us.  First ever visit, and it was very nice.  The servers were attentive, polite and unobtrusive.  Food was very good, cooked perfectly, and correct to our order.  My wife stated that her meal was \"outstanding\".  Nearly perfect, wished they had mints at front desk to pick up on the way out.    If ever in T.O. again, would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge is one of the better chicken/ribs restaurants around!  Came here not for this gluttony but for a salad instead!  Ordered the Lousiana Chicken salad!  Came out  huge and very tasty.  I have a co-worker who orders the chicken-ribs any time he comes to eat at BR.  Let's say he's a bit of a larger fellow but enjoys each visit like it's his last meal!  Consistency and taste is usually very excellent!"}
{"text":"Ribs are good and side choices are fine.  Good quantity and quality.  Chicken tenders are disappointing.  The batter isn't quite right.  Very bland like a tempura but more of a wheat taste than that.  Also a bit too heavy on battering.  I do like their coleslaw side.  Beans are usually a bit burnt tasting.  Mashed potatoes are fine.  Service can be hit and miss.  Usually pretty good but sometimes I feel like they've just seen too many tourists and are just trying to survive another day."}
{"text":"After my horrible review @ Baton Rouge in Kanata, I felt compelled to visit another Baton Rouge to see if my service would be any better...so I went a little closer to home.  Again, this time, we had a large group of people but this time, service was MUCH better and my steak was MUCH better.    I ordered a filet mignon this time and asked for medium rare and it came out true to its word.  The waiter was professional and courteous but service was a tad bit slow.  However, I do get that we had a table of 8 or something like that.    Overall, for Baton Rouge, this steak was pretty good and I am way more satisfied than the Kanata one!"}
{"text":"If this is the Rogers centre location, it sucks. Terrible food and even worse service. I was there yesterday. The apps are unedible. Waited about 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge I was enen there. Then I finally ordered a beer (patio). That took another 15 minutes. When the beer arrived, I asked for a menu. That took ten minutes. ... You get the drift.. stay away!"}
{"text":"Baton Rouge at the Eaton Centre is one of the few places in Toronto where I can say I've never had nothing less than a great meal.   The specialty is seared tuna that melts in your mouth, but the ribs are also uniformly excellent. A good bet to eat at when you're roaming the centre."}
{"text":"great food, lauzy service. lately I've notice that the steak house for some reason is always full every night. regardless which city/state/country I went to. which is good. that seems people are going out and enjoy a nice dinner again. Gumbo, you can skip it. too water down, I think Campbell version is better Baby back ribs, it is really baby, 10oz weigh but the size is very tiny, smaller than my pinky finger. but they cook it to perfection, so it is good. and the key lime pie, not bad either. a bit too sweet for me. the sweet potato fries, hm.. I think I stik with regular potato, because this one is mushy.."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our 1 year wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. I got the 16oz ribs with French fries and cinnamon apples. The ribs were mouth watering and fell right off the bone. The fries were perfectly cooked and crispy with a lift seasoning sprinkled, and as for the apples, although a peculiar choice, they were absolutely delicious and acted as our dessert. My wife had a steak and lobster combo covered in hollandaise sauce with mixed veg and garlic mashed potatoes. I wasn't too keen on the hollandaise sauce on the lobster, but the steak was cooked to perfection and the potatoes were scrumptious. Service was quick and friendly and the environment was quaint and romantic."}
{"text":"I love finding little restaurant gems, but that doesn't mean I am going to hate on the big chains.  I have a little love for all types of restaurants, especially if their food is good.  I mean, they must have gotten big some how.  Went here for a work gathering, and it was perfect considering we had to dine with an executive but on a East Side Mario / Swiss Chalet type of budget...  The setting was definitely a little fancier than other large chains in the same budget category.  They even helped create a fixed budget menu for us, which was great.  The service was exceptionally fast considering there were approximately 40 of us.  The entree choices we had were salmon, chicken, steak or ribs - definitely go with the ribs.  They were amazing and huge!  I can see that some people regretted not ordering the ribs.  Their fries portions were also gigantic, and can be shared between two people.  The service was good minus a little screw up with how the bill was to be handled.  All in all, I highly recommend this place, they did exceptionally well considering the amount of people they served."}
{"text":"A bunch of friends and I decided to go out for some steak. We tried The Keg across the street but it was full so we decided on going to Baton Rouge.  They had a special set course dinner so I got the mushroom and artichoke soup, surf and turf with steamed vegetables and chocolate pudding.  The soup was decent - there was a lot of mushroom and artichoke which was nice.  The lobster was done very well and tasted great with the garlic sauce.  The steak on the other hand was not done to my perfection. I asked for rare (I usually go for medium rare) and the steak came fully cooked. I placed my order first so they probably cooked my steak first which means that it continued cooking while they made the rest of the steak at my table. One of my friend commented how my steak was like an eraser (dry).  The dessert was a total disappointment. It was this chocolate pudding which looked and tasted like just melted chocolate. It came in this glass cup and there was way too much of it and it was way too sweet.  The service at this restaurant was good though but I won't be coming back because the food was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I went.  I ate. I hated.  The food was mediocre at best...not at all Louisiana style food as the name Baton Rouge suggests.  The service was not good either...waited forever when there were only a handful of guests to wait on...and my waitress had an attittude!  Being a native Texan who visited Louisiana at least 100 times I can tell you I was disheartened that the food was nothing more than bland American fare.  And for the quality of service and food this place is slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"Was there today....not good at all..comparing to the Baton Rogue  I am familiar with in Mississauga...service is horrible...the hostess after I ask for a booth by the window...too me to a booth by a brick wall...I looked at her and said window?...my water glass was dirty ask for it to be replaced only to be brought back the same glass the waiter said it was just a smudge and he wiped it off...really buddy?  It was the powdered soap from the dish washer...shame on you....oh the nastiness didn't end there...our appetizer plates were dirty too left over food....omg....yeah I took a picture...the girls walks around very pouty and grumpy looking...the male staff was more attentive...for a Baton Rogue especially in a prime tourist location....Yall need to step up ur A game."}
{"text":"I usually pop in here for an after work drink. The bar is nice for a casual drink but I haven't been here in ages for dinner or lunch. I did pop by during Christmas Eve to meet a friend. We figured Joeys would be packed and I was right when I noticed how quiet the restaurant was. We got some drinks and an app to eat - Spinach, Artichoke and Cheese Dip. It came with Salsa and Sour Cream. I'd have to say the dip was overly greasy...I know it's baked cheese, but I have never had a dip with so much oil especially at other restaurants who serve the same.   Overall, it was good, service was alright but I'll probably skip the food and go straight to the bar next time."}
{"text":"Ordered the mushroom risotto.  Best meal I have had in a long time. The service is great and they go above and beyond. Great clean location will be a regular stop here in the area. The cheese cake is made in house and it shows   All around a great experience"}
{"text":"Had ribs and br cookie here a couple of days ago. Both of them were delicious! Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favourite dish here is the Santa Fe Chicken. Delicious chicken breast with grilled veggies and goat cheese. I cannot speak for the rest of the menu, because I have never moved beyond the above; however, I will be trying the chicken fingers next time I'm there, due to Adam P.'s review. Furthermore, I appreciate the fact that I can always get a booth at this location, and that it is usually far away from other people. Also, the staff is attentive, without being around too much, making it a good place to have a nice private meal.   Like I have said before, I am not a big fan of big chain restaurants, but this will sometimes do."}
{"text":"Bland and unappetising food, far too many flies, no atmosphere and really poor level service."}
{"text":"I don't eat here often, but I've had enough good experiences here to give it a good review.  The food here is good. Nothing too unique. I have tried steaks, different kinds of chicken and the salmon. Enjoyed everything. The garlic mashed potatoes are great. I've never had room for dessert, but I would love to try them."}
{"text":"Oh no, another bad experience at this specific location. I came here one day before New Year's Eve and our waiter Matthew was a disaster. First of all he came up talking to me from behind (instead of facing me first as it would be polite) so I got scared and jumped. I told him that he scared me, I didn't know he was there talking to me... instead of an apology, he said: \"You have bad nerves!?\" OMG. I would never say like this to my customer when clearly it would have been my fault. I told him nicely that \"no, I don't have bad nerves, just he should have talked to me while facing me\". He just shrugged and did not apologize. After that my friend ordered couple of teas for her and kids, Matthew brought the cups with tea spoons inside, no coasters or plates underwear, he did not offer or bring sugar. One of the kids is allergic to lactose, so when we asked if they have lactose free milk or any other substitute, he was very uninterested, saying \"No\". His attitude was very vulgar and he was not friendly, therefore we decided not to order food here but go elsewhere. He came up rushing asking if we need a bill in the middle of our conversation, and even if I said not yet, he brought it in 2 minutes! When we left, he ignored us and didn't even say \"good bye, thank you for coming.\" I complained to the hostess but I am not sure if she addressed the issue with management."}
{"text":"I'm a long time fan of Baton Rouge and I prefer it over The Keg and Milestone's and I've been to this particular location many times.  However tonight's experience just wasn't their usual character..  We decided to have a team dinner and movie night so we made RSVP for 4. When we for their, our RSVP was missing.. But they are always able to accommodate a table of 4.  Ordered a beer to start and the first thing I noticed was their was a fruit fly in my beer and pointed that out to be waitress immediately..  We ordered a bottle of Gretzky red to start and they brought us the wrong bottle of wine! LOL!!  Ordered a Cheddar Cheese Dip, Lobster Poutine, and Lobster Stuff Mushroom to start.  All the apps were on par and I particularly enjoyed the cheese dip and lobster mushroom dish.  You could actually taste lobster juice in the distinct mushroom flavour which was memorable.  We all went with either the Tenderloin Fillet and Prime Rib and added a side of Lobster Tail to our main.    The lobster tail for $17 a piece was disappointing. The meat was obviously not fresh and you could tell the Lobster was dead before they froze it so it didn't taste springy at all. Not to mention, they forgot to plate the lobster tail on one of our orders..   My Prime Rib Au Jus was over salted but other them that was cooked to my liking.. (Hard to screw up the level of doneness when serving Au jus...)  My three colleagues had mash potatoes for their choice of side and it was horrible.. Flavourless and mushy.. They made up for it by giving us baked potatoe with the works and it wasn't bad.. But i prefer mine double baked.. So nothing special...  Peanut Butter Brownie Cheesecake was great but didn't really taste any cheesecake - more like just a peanut butter brownie instead..  Then we asked for the bill, they had an extra pint of beer listed.. They immediately took it off the bill, but to sum up our experience tonight, it was just horrible..   Missing RSVP Fly in the beer Delivered the wrong bottle of wine Forgot to plate the lobster Food was either flavourless or over salted Screwed up the bill..  SERIOUSLY?!?!?!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to come to Baton Rouge for the first time. My wife and I both decided on the fixed menu ( salad, main course, and desert). My filet mignon was cooked perfectly as I asked for. My wife also enjoyed her steak with lobster tail. She chose a baked potato as her side. She shared it with me and it was delicious with all the toppings. For desert they gave us a chocolate fudge cake but it would have been nice to have a selection to choose from. Overall, great atmosphere and great food. A bit pricey but okay for special occasions."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge is not what I thought it was going to be. I really expected more from the food to the service. The service was ok they have good drinks the food was not up to park. I went on a day that that probably wasn't the best. I went on a Blue Jay game day it was super crowded and pack we had to wait on a table for 30-45 mins. I don't mind waiting on something that is worth waiting on but I was just dissatisfied. I ordered the cheesey dip which was disappointing it had a weird sweet note to it although it was supposed to be spicy which didn't even exist. The ribs and garlic mash potatoes were disappointing the ribs didn't taste grilled if it wasn't for the BBQ sauce they wouldn't have been good at all. That sauce was the star the the dish. The garlic mash potatoes were bland and thick I didn't taste much garlic or butter. I would not visit this restaurant again and I don't recommend this place for anything other than drinks and appetizers only which aren't strong btw taste like juice only. We order the blue jay and the smash punch they tasted good but probably didn't have much alcohol in it. I simply can say I've been there and will not double back."}
{"text":"Arriving after an 8 hour drive from the south to find not a lot open on Good Friday we stepped into this chain restaurant in the hopes of some decent fare. When shown to our seat the server asked for our drinks, having not seen a beer list I asked what he had on tap to which he reeled off a list of beers then when asked what was in bottles he practically rolled his eyes and listed them. \"Which would you like?\" He asked, I wasn't sure. He had rattled the list off so fast I barely had time to hear the words. I didn't know what I wanted which seemed to irk him, rather than take the initiative to suggest a beer to me that is popular, he just looked impatient. We made our selection and then he brought them back. We ordered or food.   When asked for the two sides option I was met with \"it depends what sides you want?\" The menu clearly had them listed next to the item and it took patience and trying to empathise with him having had a long day, to not be sarcastic to him and point out that the only options were those on the menu. I smiled and ordered. A different server brought our food and muddled up to placement of the foods leaning over us to change them around (would have happily done it ourselves).   Suffice it to say, would not go back, would not recommend the fries (they were soggy and not because they were gravy laden) and I begrudgingly tipped, in the UK I'd have asked for the tip to be removed from the bill."}
{"text":"There is little one could complain about at Baton Rogue. Sure, the Canadian inferiority complex is in full view (Canadian chains with meaningless names like New York Fries, Boston Pizza and Baton Rouge are unnecessary and named after places with no connection and typically bad food - who has ever had a good pizza in... Boston?? or good fries or anything edible in New York??), but otherwise, this location of this chain was fine and I would be happy to return.  Firstly, the interior was certainly not as plush or elegant as The Keg and they do not have the steak assortment either so the comparisons are unjustified. Reading the reviews below mine we did not come across children or any kids that were running around thank goodness. It may be because we were here for lunch. If they have kids dining at night then I would avoid that.  With that said, the booth was comfortable, the girls at the door were friendly and sincere, the Asian-Canadian waitress was friendly, well put together and elegantly dressed in black. Her service was prompt, helpful and always with a friendly presence. I had the Steak Frites and the cut of meat for less than $20 was small but enough for one. The frites were nicely done and the au jus was exactly right, although fearing its calories I had little of it. I had asked for medium rare and they delivered exactly as requested. The manager came by to assure us that the food was coming soon, and it did, and the waitress came by for a quality check. The bill arrived when we asked for it.  They have the usual tacky TVs tuned to the same corporate channels, but I guess that is what people want or that is what restaurants think people want. I rather dine in a classier atmosphere without millionaire jocks butting heads. Oh well...  Their menu offers steaks, ribs, sandwiches and burgers and a fish or two.   Tasty food, superior diligent service and the price was right."}
{"text":"The Ribs at Baton Rouge are the best I have ever had. If you are in the area, check them out, but stick tot he ribs.  The restaurant is housed in the old Planet Hollywood digs and as such suffers from sort of an obscure almost hidden location in the 277 Front office building.   The decor inside is excellent and the place is enormous, due to this you never have to worry about reservations.   The staff seems to have a high turnover from what I have seen and the food outside of the Ribs is very mediocre. I have seen them screw up countless orders since their opening, likely due to staff issues. So service is really hit or miss."}
{"text":"I went to this location on Friday after work with my bestie for a girls' night dinner and my experience here was not as great as the location at North York Centre that I went to back in 2010. First of all, when we arrived, the hostess who brought us to our table gave us \"attitude\" when we tried to request seating somewhere else, as our table was near the window and it was a cold evening. She said all the other tables were full so we settled for our table but were shivering due to lack of heat on that side of the restaurant. The only good thing about this hostess was that she asked if we were scheduled to see a show downtown that same evening, which, of course, we were, so they made note of that.  On a happier note, the waiter who served our food was a pleasant personality who informed us of their daily specials (although he talked through the list so quickly that I could not remember any of it and there was nothing in writing provided) and the selection was as great as I remember from before. I ordered the Lobster Bisque Risotto and I enjoyed the taste and would definitely order it again in the future. Sadly, the creme brulee dessert we ordered in a shot glass tasted more like dollar store pudding rather than actual creme brulee so I wouldn't order that again.   Prices are on the high side, similar to The Keg Steakhouse, and it is a fancy restaurant. For the amount of money I paid, I was expecting better customer service and better quality dessert. However, the Lobster Risotto was worth the price that they were charging."}
{"text":"I've always loved the food here. I went to a Baton Rouge years ago (different location) and I've always remembered how good their apps and mains were so I decided to try this location and it was just as good as I remembered it!   We had the coconut shrimp and crab cakes as appetizers. DEFINITELY GET THE CRAB CAKES. Seriously, best crab cakes I've ever had. For mains, we got the BBQ pork back ribs with chicken tenders and the lobster sandwich. I recommend the pork back ribs; I found the chicken tenders and lobster sandwich to be just mediocre.   Most importantly, the service was great. There were a lot of people in the restaurant because it was Sunday night but our waiter was still very upbeat and prompt and managed to handle many tables without a problem. When we left, I accidentally left my sunglasses there and one of the waitresses ran out to give it back to me.     Overall, loved the place and I would definitely go back. Baton Rouge remains one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"My husband and I had supper there this evening.  The place was jammed with shoppers but we managed to get a table.  It had been a while since Gord had been to one and he was craving the Chicken Tenders.  And that's what we both ordered ... I had mine with garlic mashed potatoes and he had fries and baked apples.  They were good! Yum!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. Food was great but what made this a five star review was the great service we got from our server Yasmeen. She was attentive and very easy to talk to.  She made one tiny mistake (forgot the side order of crab cakes) and we didn't blame her for it or anything. She insisted on giving us dessert free of charge after the meal.   So we ordered one chocolate mousse and we also ordered a shot of espresso. We didnt expect her to comp us the coffee as well. Ten minutes later she showed up with TWO chocolate mousse and comp us the coffee as well.   So great food plus awesome server equals we are definitely going back. :D"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this chain only works due to its excellent locations. Always next to the major attractions, filled by the tourist folks who come and go. I've been to the Yonge St. location, and one time was good enough to never return.  Food quality... think Swiss Chalet (khm!) on steroids. Man they could at least change the oil for those fries, it looked like 5W40 after a 100K miles run. Price is a joke, but again, that's a tourist money-drainer, so it makes sense - at least for the chain owners.  Service is simply not expecting you to be back. I've been waiting for like forty minutes, got three (!) waiters changing one another without even attempting to apologize for the delay, until finally a manager-type guy brought me that meal. He was polite and professional, so I was feeling sorry to leave a tip to some other guy who grabbed the money and rushed away without even saying good bye.  Ne-ver-mo-re... One time was bad enough for me."}
{"text":"I wish we had thought through diner before descending on the Eaton Centre this frigid February day.   It had been so cold in the two and one half block walk from where we are staying to the E.C. that we dared not take to Yonge or Dundas in search of a place with more savoury fare after shopping.  Inept, bumbling service from all who approached and mediocre salads and pastas sent us quickly to the door and the cold mean streets of Toronto completely unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. But I've never really been a fan of Baton Rouge since my first visit a few years ago left a horrible taste in my mouth. Back then, I waited over 45 mins for a damn burger (table for two only). Never again I vowed...until last Saturday.   I ordered a veggie sandwich as I'm not a big meat eater. It was quite good with goat cheese, avocado and many of my favourite toppings. I also got sweet potato fries. Though the wait was also long, it was more understandable due to the large party size. It felt as though they were understaffed.   I would only come back here if nothing else is available."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! Food is excellent. Staff is beyond amazing and willing to go over the top to have the best experience you can . the garlic mash is like crack its so good I order a second helping just to take home haha. Lobster fest is my favorite time everything was cooked perfect and not over cooked  200% recommend"}
{"text":"I was surprised for a bar in the touristy part of downtown didn't have a lot of patrons during lunch hour. I mean the place was clean, the servers were very friendly and I had a pleasant time here sitting at the bar.  I took advantage of their $20 ribs special. And I was shocked that it was pretty good. I would recommend this to anyone.  And for dessert, go for the brownie. Nice, warm with fudge all over. Mine came with vanilla ice cream and it was heaven.  For a bar in downtown, the prices seemed pretty reasonable too. Plenty of beers on tap and plenty of tv's for the random Canadian sporting events."}
{"text":"Ok, let's deal with the obvious stuff first: food is good! Not outstandibg but good! My steak was properly cooked (you'll be surprised to know how many places can't cook the steak properly) and delicious! Now, the service could be better. If I order a Creemore, I would naturally assume that if I ask for another beer it would still be Creemore and not Heineken. (unless they ran out of Creemore, that is). Now another thing that happened surprised even me. Until this time I've only heard anecdotal stories about servers NOT recommending something  that is on the menu, but this time I witnessed it with my own eyes. After finally getting the item that was not recommended we discovered that it was great contrary to what our server was saying. All in all - not bad, just keep your servers in check, I'm perfectly ok with deciding what to order and I don't have any problem asking for their opinion, but I prefer not to if I choose so."}
{"text":"The food was good. Our ribs, steak and chicken were all well-cooked and tender.  The staff all looked miserable and our server was borderline rude."}
{"text":"It had been a while since we had been to Baton Rouge so off we went for ribs. They were cold and over cooked - but not in a 'falling off the bone' way.  And, seriously, what's with the outfits the female hostess and bartender were wearing? So tacky. Now I know why there were so few women and families in the restaurant..."}
{"text":"Their lobster poutine is really good soo yummy!!!!   Service was great staff was really friendly and was helpful and answered the questions we had well :)"}
{"text":"Decent but not special sports bar with Louisiana theme, plenty of Baton Rouge sauce. Food is ok and decent local beers. Best feature is very close proximity to Rogers Centre so fills up quickly when the Blue Jays are at home."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I've always wanted to go,  have coveted from afar, and finally, years later,  have managed to try - and was NOT disappointed.  My friend and I decided to go here because we'd both been talking about it for a while and we felt like splurging. We popped in and found out that there was about a half an hour wait (not surprising as there were people lining the booths in the waiting area) so we said we were going to come back and left our names on the list. The hostess clearly indicated on her list that we were out for a walk on our reservation and told us to come back in about 20 minutes even though the wait was 30. After walking around and shopping, we came back and within 2 minutes of arriving and letting the server know we were back, we were seated at a nice booth in the middle of the restaurant. Perfect timing.  Now anyone who's read any of my other reviews can probably tell that I'm a stickler for good service at any kind of establishment. Perhaps I expect too much but at a place where your average bill is likely to be in the $50-70 range for 2 people (or more), I expect good service. Our server wasn't bad, he just wasn't overly friendly. I also wasn't a fan of how low our table was - our server was towering over us and it just felt weird. Besides that, he made some good menu recommendations, such as my friend not getting the bbq chicken (he suggested that the other kind of chicken with veggies and cheese had more flavor) and that fries already came with our appetizer and that I might want to order different sides with my ribs unless I loved fries. Both good suggestions and both suggestions we took. I ordered the smaller size of ribs with the hot apples and coleslaw and my friend ordered the chicken with zucchini and feta cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. We started off with the chicken fingers appetizer.  Not gonna lie, these are probably the best chicken fingers I've ever had. Jack Astors chicken fingers come in a close second. The chicken was juicy, they were fresh made and the matchstick fries had some sort of addictive substance all over them that was to die for. We cleaned the app plate pretty quickly.  I will note that we had a barrage of different servers bringing us stuff but these are called expeditors in the restaurant biz. In busy restaurants, usually the expeditor is the person who transfers food from kitchen to table (or here, drinks from bar to table). They also take care of the last few garnishes, ensuring the plates are clean and no sauce has spilled (etc) and that the food going out of the kitchen is of optimal quality. Hopefully, any place you go to that has expeditors will have good presentation, food will be hot and fresh out of the kitchen. I don't really have an issue with expeditors except at places like Jack Astors where you never see your server again until its time to pony up the tip. Our server stopped by every now and then to make sure things were good, not too much but not too little.  The ribs I had were great, good portion size for the 10oz portion and those hot apples... omg... I don't know that I've ever had a more interesting and tasty side dish. They were a nice sweet note to the dish and they brought the bbq flavor out just right. I normally am not a coleslaw fan but I didn't know what else to get on the side that wasn't a starch... let me tell you, I'm now a coleslaw convert. It was crunchy, flavored just right and not oozing in sauce. Overall, the sides hit it out of the park.  I did try some of my friend's meal but I usually find chicken is nothing to write home about when it's a breast cutlet with stuff on or in it. Most places can't do chicken well and although it was ok, it was dry. The garlic mashed were fantastic though, I'd order a side of those just for the hell of it any day.  We did get dessert, my friend has a thing for cheesecake so while it was probably the plainest dessert they offered, we tried it. Nothing to write home about, but the chocolate sauce was super chocolatey and nice and thin, not goopy and thick.   The last thing I have to say is that although 2 people shared all of this food, we didn't feel like we were going to explode afterwards. It was a nice change to have appropriately portioned food, great tasting food and be able to have an appetizer and dessert and not feel grossly full. We were both really surprised and pleased with this part!  I will definitely be returning to Baton Rouge for some nice BBQ again in the future. It was a pleasant dining experience and it had a Keg-like atmosphere without the Keg-like prices."}
{"text":"Slow cooked ribs are the best around! Wish they didn't get rid of their apple side dish. The kids loved that one. Please bring it back if you're reading this :) Great service and food. Just a bit on the pricey side. So we come for special occasions."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Went with a group of 30+ we scheduled for 6:00pm but they had seats ready for us well before that so we wouldn't have to stand.  A little crowded, but that's ok, overall I was happy with the experience.  While most people go to hang out, I'm at restaurant to eat.  Appetizers came right away, and water and soda.  We got a large basket of nachos and even some calamari.  I was almost full just eating nachos and drinking soda.  I had the steak, and mashed potatoes.  Taste was good, but not great.  Service was excellent, waiters regularly filled our cups with water and served us soda.  Received food fast so we didn't go on starving.  Good enough to bring family or friends if they are hungry."}
{"text":"Great family resto with good food.   Baton rogue is just of those those no brainer restaurants that you go to when you have a big family that have very different food preferences.  For the meat lovers, their steak is very decent for the price you pay.  You are not breaking the piggy bank like other steakhouses just to enjoy a good piece of steak.  It's a really good deal when you add on a lobster tail.  You get the best of land and sea!  Their steak is always very flavourful and juicy.  the lobster tails were really fresh and cooked perfectly. If you fancy ribs, their ribs are to die for.    The service is always good and best of all, they take reservations!!!!  What's there to think about? Get there already."}
{"text":"I think the experience here can be kind of hit or miss but I really enjoyed my meal this time around. The rib special I ordered was tender and juicy and falls right off the bone. The sweet potato fries were nicely crisp and well seasoned. Nothing to complain about, everything done right!  I have only been here for work lunches so the place has always felt unfeeling to me. The wait staff seemed to make a point to be elusive, which worked fine for us as we had very important matter to discuss anyways. It serves its purpose of offering a quick satisfying meal with a sombre professional ambience. I would take the cute date elsewhere as there are plenty of options near the Dundas area.  WYWH"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice. The first time was in April 2015. This visit was my second, breaking up my shopping excursion at the box stores.   I was promptly seated, pretty much sitting in the same booth area as last time. Servers are prompt and polite.   The food never disappoints. I ordered the prime rib au jus with baked beans, veggies, and a side order of sautéed mushrooms. Everything was incredible!   I like my prime rib medium well. So yummy and tender. The au jus was perfect - flavourful, but not overly salted. The veggies are my favourites. Give me green beans and I'm a happy camper. And, in a sucker for sautéed mushrooms. I practically inhaled them!  For dessert, I wanted the red velvet cake with raspberry coulis. It's so good. Get it!  I got free refills of Diet Coke with a slice of lemon. Perfect!  Come here when you are hungry and need a break from outlet shopping.   (192)"}
{"text":"Service: 3 for the server Food: 4 Front door waitress: 1  Baton Rouge is usually my go to steak place. I've always enjoyed going to the STC location but I'm not quite sure about this one.  We were hungry and wanted steak so we decided to try this location. It was a busy Saturday evening and we were told it's about 1/2 hour wait. So we waited and waited and there were many ppl arriving with and without reservation. About 45 mins later, we started to notice those who came in later than us got their tables before us.   We went to talk to the girl and she told us well they usually give 2 hrs seating time for big parties so our wait would have to extend to an hour. I was pretty frustrated at that time especially since we had a child with us and she didn't even bother to come tell us about the extension.  After we complained, she decided to give us a table that was left empty for 20 mins. Our server forgot to give us bread but that was fine since we were so hungry we got my entrees pretty quickly.  Talk about good customer service! We're never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as the steak is very well prepared. They do make sure that you are absolutely stuffed from the appetizer and salad before you even get to the main course so beware! And then there is the potatoes! ;)  As for the atmosphere, it is very friendly and civilized. They will address any concerns that you might have right away even if they are busy.   It is a bit pricey but you get what you paid for. And as I said, you will be full."}
{"text":"If you enjoy mediocre at best food and being ripped off, then by all means eat here!   Let me start off by saying, I am not picky when it comes to food, in fact I've never written a bad review for a restaurant in my life.   Baton Rouge is very misleading. It looks like a high-end establishment (and the prices reflect that), however the food is downright awful.   I was thrilled to see coconut shrimp on the menu - one of my favourite foods. However, I was extremely disappointed when I received just 3 tiny coconut shrimp (which were very bland) next to a small pile of arugula - for $13!!!!   My friend ordered a Caesar salad and 2 glasses of wine and the bill was over $50!   I thought maybe the dessert would be better, I chose the apple crumble. I was wrong. Tasteless and dry.   After dinner, my friend and I agreed we should've just gone to chipotle, at least we know we can always rely on their burritos and guac ;)"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I was there for the rib feast and it was the worst ribs I have had it was dry and overly sweet and it just had no flavor at all. Don't even get me started on dessert the red velvet cake was disgusting and I could break a fork with that cake. I will never ever come here ever again what a waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and a skewer of shrimp. Tasted delicious but my stomach did not agree with it"}
{"text":"I am biased with this place because I find their chicken fingers to be the best chicken fingers I have tasted anywhere in Ontario. Every time my wife and I go to Baton Rouge (probably once a month) we always go straight for the chicken fingers. What makes them so delicious to me is that they are not breaded but rather battered. Jack Astor's has set the bar for chicken fingers, but in my opinion these ones are better (although Jack Astor's is also really good).  The portion size is huge especially if you order fries with it. They provide two dipping sauces on the plate, a honey dijon and a bbq. They do not have wing sauce or plum sauce, but the sauces they give you do a fine job.  I have found the service to be spotty at times and hit and miss in terms of the courtesy of the wait staff but then again, we don't ask for much since we know what we are eating.  The place is large so don't worry ever about waiting to get a table. In the end I any Baton Rouge will give me the same satisfaction with the food consistency, and I will trade off spotty service for getting a table right away anytime."}
{"text":"Big fan of BBQ back ribs, I had to try Baton rouge and found it really TOP level! You definitively need to take the 16 oz ribs (I took the 10, because the server told me it would be enough (...) and unfortunately I left still being hungry then...). The steaks (filet mignon) seemed delicious also (my friends said it was the best steak of the year!).  So, why just 4 stars? because I agree that it is a little bit overpricy (at least for the quantity then) and the staff is (just) nice from entry to when you are being seated (as already stated in previous reviews). The servers are giving you the minimum of cheers and good/ bad pices of advice required, for you not to leave in angry mood. Whether they make a small effort on this particular point and the baton rouge experience would be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I came to Baton Rouge for a client lunch.  I haven't been to a Baton Rouge restaurant chain for many years. I always remembered the quality was great so I was super excited to go. We got there early around 11:30 am so the restaurant was empty.  We got seated right away.  I did noticed the restaurant never filled up even after we left.  They have a lunch menu but we're told we're not allow to do any substitution period!  Even from vegetables and fries to a salad. I found that quite odd. Their daily mushroom and artichoke soup came with the lunch menu. It was not very good. Very peppery.   I ordered the steak and frites. The steak was dry and the meat quality was not that great. My clients had the calamari salad which came with a very small portion of calamari.  My colleague had the Cajun basa and she said it was dry as well. Service was adequate, he did his job with no smile and was not friendly at all. I was quite disappointed with my experience and would to say I now prefer the Keg."}
{"text":"Started with the Potato soup. Fairly typical although not well seasoned.  Santa Fe Chicken for my entree. Pretty good but nothing special. Chicken was well cooked. But topping not exciting."}
{"text":"overpriced crappy food with good service and ambiance. The only food that was satisfying was their sweet potato fries.  I got the three course meal ($35): 1. potatoe soup: turned out it was MASHED POTATOES in a bowl. Asked the server what was going on with it and she actually said \"thats how our potatoe soup is served, kinda like mashed potatoes.\" i switched it to a caesar salad and that was okay. 2. Steak frite: The medium \"new york striploin\" turned out to be a piece of puck, and it tasted like one too. The sweet potatoe fries were actually th best I've ever had 3. Red velvet cake: too rich and sweet. had cream cheese frosting, which made it worse.  My boyfriend got chicken and ribs ($24) 1. chicken: meh 2. ribs: meh. 3. garlic mash poatoes: tastes like my potato soup.  TIP: If you find your potatoes and fries bland and dry, ask for their peppercorn sauce, that might make your food at least palatable..it was at least how i finished my steak.  We also tried our friend's coleslaw. Be careful, lots of raw onions.  Utterly unsatisfying and burned a huge hole in our wallet after drinks, tax, and tips"}
{"text":"The food wasn't that great. The service was good, but the food was disappointing, very disappointing. When the bacon on my friends sandwich was undercooked, the bus boy was snippy and said \"yeah well that's how I eat my bacon,  so okayyy\"."}
{"text":"Another of my Toronto favorites.  Great ribs and chicken, nice salads and really good fries.   This last time we were there, we met the owner and had a really nice chat.  He even bought our round of drinks while we waited for our table.  The service has always been good and the only time we've ever had to wait is when we came in without a reservation."}
{"text":"The best steaks ever ! Service is awesome , I come here most Thursday nights and you can't go wrong with the filet mignon and lobster tail on the side ... Soups are always great and the desserts perfect with a double espresso ... The lobster menu is nice when it's around and the ribs are a must ... Say hi to Joe the owner he is an exceptionally talented owner always makes you feel great like your his best customer and is very sincere ... Michelle is an excellent bartender and makes the perfect martinis !!"}
{"text":"I generally like any restaurant that has patio dining.  This place was extra special because we had a nice view of CN Tower.  I had the Louisiana Chicken Salad with mixed greens, grilled chicken, oriental noodles, pineapple soy dressing and Thai peanut sauce.  The salad was huge, fresh and the dressing had good flavor.  Service was bareable.  All in all a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at the restaurant.  With our big party, it did seem a bit crammed but we were able to manage. The service was a tad slow.  I guess it's because of the large party size.  However the food was really good.  The ribs were so tasty & practically falling off the bone. The portions for the sides were quite large & filling. Overall, I enjoyed the experience & recommend you to check it out."}
{"text":"A friend and I walked into Baton Rouge as a last reserve after being unable to find a place to sit down and eat for what seemed like forever. We arrived around 2:00pm on a Saturday and it was quite busy, but there was no issue in being seated.   Our \"first\" server (Michael I believe) seemed kind of out of it and wasn't the friendliest. A perfunctory glance at the menu yielded limited vegetarian-friendly options (as could be expected, it's a steakhouse more or less), so I opted for the grilled vegetable sandwich with fries and a bottle of Stella. My friend chose the chicken tenders platter with garlic mashed potatoes and some sort of pomegranate apple cider cocktail from the seasonal drink menu. Michael disappeared, nearly forgetting to take our menus with him, and then reappeared a few minutes later to let my friend know that the garlic mashed potatoes include bacon and asked whether that's okay or not. It was great that he asked (bacon was not okay, she switched to coleslaw and hot cinnamon apples), but it seemed like it would make a lot more sense to let a diner know when they place their order instead of brusquely coming back a few minutes later and having to ask them again...just sayin'.   After placing our orders, we were served by a series of changing faces throughout our stay - a different person brought over our drinks, and can I mention that he literally threw down a cocktail napkin in front of me, slammed down a cup and peaced out? Then someone else brought out our meals, and my friend's plate had none other than a heaping pile of garlic mashed potatoes on it. Of course she had to explain to this new person about the mix-up, who returned to the magical place where food appears and promptly came back with the right plate. At one point some random man came over and asked how our meal was...he appeared to be the manager, but he could have been anybody! The portions were huge and service was fairly prompt, but the food was mediocre...my fries were terrible and my friend was rather unimpressed with her chicken tenders (why they are called \"tender\" is beyond me, they looked totally dry and unappetizing). I also found it kind of annoying how you have to ask for ketchup and they bring you a small dollop in a little cup...I like a lot of ketchup with my fries, and it would have been a hassle to continue asking someone to bring over some more. Is a bottle of ketchup too much to ask?   By the end of our meal, we were on our fourth or fifth server, who was lovely and polite and completely made up for the lack of service we received earlier. I hope she gets the tip, who knows how the system works at this crazy place. My bill came to $26 in total, tax and tip included - make of that what you will.   To end on a somewhat positive note, the interior of this restaurant is quite nice and the booths are comfortable and spacious, although I wouldn't return here for the food again. It might be a nice place to go for drinks and dessert, though, as I tried some of my friend's cocktail and I must say that it was excellent.  Lesson learned: never go out without finding a place to eat on Yelp first, or you'll just end up somewhere like Baton Rouge."}
{"text":"No doubt baton rouge is one of the good franchises out there, but i've tried maybe four different ones, this location is my favourite.  I have dined in few times, but picked up from there tens of times, food is always fresh, nicely packed and always tasteful. My favourite and usual order is the Louisiana chicken  and their chicken tenders.. All salads selection are wonderful Usually, no reservation is required, it's a big place until they it have reserved for a party or something Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Overpriced, food is mediocre at best, unfriendly staff, overall this place is pretty horrible.  It was my first time at Baton Rouge and there is no chance I will ever go back. They served our entrees before our apps. When we told them this we asked them to make new steaks when they served them again. Of course we got the exact same steaks. What a joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"In Toronto for the CanSIA show at the Convention Centre, I had the opportunity to dine here for both lunch and dinner. Why? It was next door and my clients wanted to eat there. Plus, they serve better food than the Intercontinental Hotel restaurant, and at much more affordable prices.  Baton Rouge can also accommodate food allergies. Mine is gluten, and I had two decent, but not excellent, meals. I can recommend both the Amarillo chicken, which I had for dinner, and the house burger, which I had for lunch, sans bun. However, if you have a hankering for authentic Texas/Louisiana cuisine, this is not the place to go. Their picante sauce, which our server advised was really spicy, had no kick. At least not for this Southern girl.  Added bonus for those with Celiac disease - they have a dedicated fryer for the french fries!  Service is warm, friendly, and efficient. Not a bad option if you are pressed for time and are in the area."}
{"text":"I never have high expectation for Franchise Restaurant. I found most of the time the food they serves are ok but not great. Nothing will make you go yay! I have to tell my friends to come, but at least it is much certain expectations.  Monday night the place is 80% empty. The services here is friendly and professional.. but the food... is meh, ok but not great!  My boyfriend wants to order a steak and they have that Savour York Region Prix Menu that includes a salad, a steak and dessert for $35. So I suggest why don't we order that.   Ceasar Salad I think I would never order Ceasar Salad out at all.. They should really check if the Romaine lettuce is fresh or not before serving. A lot of the leaves are yellowing and browning with spots. Can even see that in the dim lighting. Not Fresh at all!! -0.5 star  Filet Mignon The steak is ok, cooked medium rare the way we requested. Extra veggies requested to replaced the baked potato. Good fresh broccoli.  Dessert They don't have the Velvet Cake, So a chocolate nutty cake was offered as replacement. It taste ok.  I think Baton Rouge really needs to work on presentation of food. Just dumping the slice cake on the plate is not what I expect from a restaurant.  I order the Burger with hot apples. I find it is quite tasty. The patty is made with fresh ground beef and you do have the options of cooking it medium well or well done.  However, the lettuce in the burger has the same days old dry and brownish look...  Will I come back? Maybe... but I know I won't be ordering salads....."}
{"text":"The décor is very dingy and outdated. My boyfriend ordered the rib steak and said it was the worst steak he has ever had. It was extremely fatty and flavourless. I ordered the sirloin which was served to me cold with a side of frozen vegetables which were cold and terrible. Our waiter seemed like he did not want to be there the entire time and when we were having an after dinner drink he pushed us to pay the bill right away because he said he needed to leave, even though we saw him staying much longer. I filled out the review online after and it asked if I wanted to be contacted about our experience which I said I did and was never contacted. Horrible food, wait staff and customer service. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge on Front street is a 5-10 minute walk from the subway, not a great experience during the Canadian Winter. But inside the restaurant was really nice, the atmosphere felt cozy with the dim lights and comfortable booth seats.   The service was really good, we were greeted right away by a hostess and our server came asking for drinks not too long afterwards (It was a Tuesday evening, probably not a busy day anyway). We ordered food, ate dinner and dessert in less than an hour and a half = extremely fast service. Our server kept asking us how we were doing every 5 minutes, it was nice but it was interrupting our conversation.  I ordered the chicken tender platter with seasoned vegetables. Chicken tenders were battered and fried which had a good crunch to them and the chicken was still moist. It was good for chicken tenders. The vegetables were bland, not really \"seasoned\". The BBQ sauce that came with it was pretty good and I actually asked for more.  My boyfriend ordered the rib steak with mashed potatoes, and loved it. This was his 2nd time ordering steak from Baton Rouge, both times he enjoyed it very much.  For dessert we ordered the New York style cheesecake with caramel. It tasted okay, but it felt like it was frozen and they didn't thaw it out all the way.   The menu is pricey but the portions are rather large. Baton Rouge is more of a restaurant for special occasions rather than a \"go-to spot\" for me."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.. not the best experience. The service was pretty slow, however our waiter was kind. Ordering and receiving our dish took forever when it wasn't super busy. I ordered the club sandwich and the toasted bread was SO hard, I couldn't even eat the sandwich properly.. literally took a few bites and ended up just finishing the sweet potato fries (substituted regular fries for sweet potato fries)."}
{"text":"Server was Great! But the overall was unimpressive. The prime rib was dry (person who dropped it off asked us to check and see if it was cooked ok and when we mentioned it was a little past med rare was told that's the best you can get because it's prime rib ) Overall it was good but nothing I would want to come back to mostly because of the underwhelming food.  Not bad but not great."}
{"text":"I have to say Baton Rouge has been around for a while , and I have been there a few times . I just have to say that they are known for the spinach dip , a classic at baton rouge , but I have to say it was not as great as usual . Same goes for the baked potato , used to be amazing this time was very bland , the cheese was not even melted  and they were skimpy on the butter and sour cream . Over all  the service was fast , but then again we went on a rainy Thursday night . Would I go again ... probably as it is still a classic  place you can count on for  decent food ."}
{"text":"I ate here twice since it was next to the hilton I was staying at.  I had two fairly uneven experiences here.  My first visit was good.  The service was good and the ribs and lobster was pretty good(lobster was little tough but ribs were spot on).  My second visit was aweful.  They were fairly busying so it too forever for them to take my order.  I got the ahi tuna salad after reading some of the other positive reviews.  Big Mistake!   When it was served, the tuna was smelly really fishy which is a really bad sign of it not being fresh.  My first bite confirmed that it was unedible.  This dropped my rating to a 2 star.  I wouldn't go out of my to come back unless I really really have a craving for their ribs."}
{"text":"Four of us stopped at Baton Rouge while wandering Downtown Toronto. We were all very satisfied with our meals. The food was good and the prices were fairly reasonable.   The menu offered a great variety of choices: a full steak menu, salads, appetizers, BBQ ribs, chicken, sandwiches and seafood. They also have a full menu featuring their lobster dishes: lobster tail, lobster stuffed mushrooms, lobster Poutine fries. They will add a full lobster tail to any meal for $17. I tried a bite of my sister's lobster and it was very good! It was also a good size for $17!  I ordered the 8 oz. sirloin topped with goat cheese crumbles and crushed walnuts. It was delicious!  They cooked my steak perfectly. It came with a side of bacon mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. Both sides were very good.   The cocktails menu was phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed my frozen Raspberry Pucker drink. Our servers were both very helpful in making recommendations for cocktails. My favorite server was Jasmine. She could not have been sweeter!  We also spoke with the manager briefly because she needed to verify our IDs to order drinks (they were not familiar with the NYS licenses).  She was very friendly and personable! I will certainly return here next time we are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is part of a chain. Experience is pretty much the same across the 3 locations I tried. Food variety is broad, centered around ribs, steaks and grill. It's okay but not great, however what you see on the menu is what you get. Booths are comfortable. Service was ok. Wine list is minimal. Overall overpriced a little, but again, it's a safe choice."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant chain. Love the menu here and the serving portions are well worth the price tag. I fancy this place over the keg any day of the week.   I have visited this location approximately 10 times in the last year and every single time has been a pleasurable experience.   The only con I could give this place is the wait time when you call in to make resos. Last time took 20 mins to book a table. Besides that, no complaints here."}

{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening for a bday. There were 10 of us.  It was surprisingly busy, lots of large tables, lots of bday celebrations going on.   It was a neat mixed crowd, tables of families with children, tables of men doing boys night, tables of 20-30-40 something's, seniors.   Its located in a plaza full of restaurants. Its on a side of the building with limited parking near the Dior, but don't fret, there about 1000 spaces at the rear of the building. I, being a master at the art of parking and finding spaces, (laziness?) I managed to score a space across from the door. Already love that place. :)  I like how the outside looks, dark wood and brass.    There's seating at the door for those who come too early and have to wait for guests  I've been to this restaurant before, just to pick up take out at the bar, so I've never seen the seating place before.  Its nice, a mixture of tables and booths.  Tables were big and a bit squished. Not the most comfy when you are wedged in.    Decor, more dark and brass. Its nice, feels like a high end pub.   Wait staff, nice. Very efficient. Attentive despite all the customers. Its a well piled machine. Kudos.   Food, yum. Yum yum. I got the goat cheese steak with baked potatoes and veg. It was beautifully done. Steak was evenly cooked, soft, easy to cut.  Baked potato well done as well, evenly cooked, not overdone, or feeling like its been sitting in a heater for hours.  Others got ribs and chicken.  They loved it. I stole a few fries, thin and crispy. Yum!  Cost, wish it was less expensive but, the good is great. Quality ingredients. Worth the price!  Would come again."}
{"text":"Good cheese dip appetizer, kids meals were liked...my daughter ate all her ribs, tasty chicken sandwich, good beer and drinks and a friendly staff.  I would recommend it.  Ambience is dim and sedated; very relaxed with good music playing.  Kids meals included ice cream.  Good value!"}
{"text":"Another great steak restaurant.  New York medium rare with yellow and red peppers , carrot, broccoli and zuchinni. Mashed potatoes . Second dish was Filet Mignon medium rare, lobster tail, asparagus, zuxhinni, red and yellow peppers,  brocolli with Pilaf rice.   The New York was so flavorful and fatty.  Lots of marbeling just melts in your mouth like a kobe steak. Filet Mignon was suppose to be tender too but not as What I would expect it to be .   This was my second visit.  Only Con was my first visit,  ordered the prime rib and it was so chewy and hard to swallow basically not edible."}
