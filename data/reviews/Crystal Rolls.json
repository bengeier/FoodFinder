{"text":"I just ordered their House Pad Thai and Spring Rolls and have now become a fan. The food was really good and it came fairly quickly. Good price and great portion sizes."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot if you're in the area. Mysteriously, they always have plenty of free tables, despite putting together a pretty impressive array of (mostly-)Thai food, done well and served cheaply.  The lunch specials are fine, my coworkers and I have run the gamut over the years, but my pro-tip is to be a little adventurous and read their actual menu. They have a Cantonese Chow Mein (I know, not particularly Thai) full of fresh veg and big seafood for a buck more than the specials cost. They also have a crazy-giant hot and sour soup with udon noodles and chicken/beef in it that will rescue you from February in Toronto.  For dinner, I'd give this three stars - the atmosphere is pretty bland, the Michael Buble in heavy rotation can only be appreciated ironically for so long, and the presentation isn't something I'd try to impress a date with. Hit it for lunch and be happy, rather than hitting it for dinner and being underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Crystal Rolls was recommended by a close friend and after having my first experience there, I can see why it is huge fave of many thai food lovers in Toronto.  If I had to sum up Crystal Rolls in a few words, they would be the following:  Delicious thai food that is plentiful and cheap!  They have a large menu with many of your thai favourites, such as spring rolls (both meat, veggie and seafood combos), pad thai in various styles and flavours, pure veggie or pure meat dishes for all of your veggie/vegans or carnivores.  Also, they have a full service bar and know how to make a great stiff martini or a high class glass of wine.  When I ate there, I split fresh veggie rolls with a friend. As my main course, I ordered the asian chow mein with seafood. It was all mixed up with larger noodles, tons of fresh vegetables like broccoli, peppers and onions and was dressed with a yummy black bean sauce.  Overall, my appetizer, meal and a glass of wine came to just $20.   Now that is what I call amazing thai quality at a great low price!"}
{"text":"After avoiding this place for no good reason for a long time, my co-workers and I wandered in and discovered a real gem in the east Annex. We've sampled most of the items on their (very cheap!) lunch menu, and I don't think any of us have ever been less than very pleased with its output.  Lunch specials come with hot and sour soup, some form of salad (sometimes lettuce, sometimes mango, sometimes others), and a spring roll, in addition to the well-proportioned mains. Add to all that the fast, responsible and friendly service, and you've got a real winner in Asian fusion cuisine.  Some of our favourites are, of course, the entire lunch specials menu, but one frequently-overlooked but very tasty alternative is the \"Pho hot and sour soup,\" which is basically hot and sour soup with udon noodles. Great for a cold and dreary day."}
