{"text":"overall bad customer service. I have been to several locations and have come to the conclusions that the employees are very rude and inattentive. I thin it would be good for the owner to invest in better customer service.   The maple heights location is probably the worse. Very rude employees. The bathroom was gross and did not have soap (eeewwww).   The oakwood location served our family a spoiled piece of chicken.   I highly respect the concept of this business and that it is black owned. However, they must do better."}
{"text":"Food is good and still worth the new icreased prices. Service at this location has declined rapidly since they moved into the new building. It is so terrible we will not return to this location. The past two times we have called in our order, been told \"30 minutes\" and then arrived at the store only to then have to wait nearly an hour. Inefficient does not begin to describe the service.The disgusted looks on other customers faces is very off-putting."}
{"text":"I try with this place, I really do. It is on my way home from work so I often go there when it is late and nothing else is open. I tried again last night, somewhere around 10:30.   Let me start with the good, whomever takes the drive-thru orders and takes the payment is one of the best people I have ever dealt with in similar establishments. She was extremely pleasant, efficient and even told me to get home safe. Give that lady a raise.   Now for the bad, the food was barely lukewarm. I understand that it is late at night and  inventory is likely being put away for the night, but it isn't okay that I am spending $8.00 for cold wings and soggy cold fries. None of those items reheat well and honestly, I shouldn't have to reheat it. It should have come to me piping hot. The least they could have done is make fresh fries, but they never ever do that. It is like this every time I go, I assume because there is less traffic at night and therefore the food isn't turning as fast, but they had to know those wings and fries were not suitable to sell. Again, I get it, it's late but you guys need to find a way to do better. That is the last time I will try it, maybe I have to try Sharks up the street a bit for my late night nourishment."}
{"text":"Last year the chicken wings were sooooo small, you took one bite and it was gone!  The ribs are overcooked. They do not give you your money back if you are NOT satisfied with your food. AND no one will take a complaint! The prices are high compared to the amount of food you get. The ONLY thing GOOD in B & M is the CAKE!  And they don't make it!! You just have to go on the other side of town for good BBQ, SMDH."}
{"text":"Very good food. Finding a phone number online is next to impossible though."}
{"text":"I visited their food truck on 8/14 in Independence.  What a let down.  I ordered a pulled chicken sandwich.  The flavors, well you can make them at home and it would be just as good.  Don't get me wrong, it was edible, just no 'wow' factor.  Easily forgettable especially for the price.  The portion was ok, but don't expect to be able to eat this with your hands.  Should have came with a fork.  The staff was very friendly.  For the price, it really should have come with a side.  You live and you learn.  I'm sorry to say if I see this truck again, I will pass on it."}
{"text":"Ordered from skip the dishes to give them a try. Waste of money.  Wouldn't give this to my dogs."}
{"text":"Dear yelp reviewers: Today our voice was heard. I wrote a review about my experience and it wasnt the best frankly but the owners reached out to make it right.  There are not many propertiers that offer to make your meal and service to and beyond standards but this B and M on Lee did it.  I recieved a new fresh meal and an apology and it was awesome! My perch seasoned and fried to perfection , fries with the great sauce and slaw.  I would go again for service and food...and really isnt thats what it is all about?"}
{"text":"Quality in food has went down since I first started eating here. It's a hit or a miss! Sometimes it's the bomb and sometimes it's bad!! Customer service here is kinda bad! It seems like they have no interview process and hire just about anyone. One time I came in and the girl called out \"Ashley is here for pick up\" and and employe said \"that bitch Ashley is here! Smh Customer service is key. With out customers no money without money no buisness! Get it together Mr.Beckom! Sam silk fish and chicken is better"}
{"text":"If it was at all possible to leave no stars I absolutely would. It is the most frustrating thing when I call this B n M and deal with the employees. They are extremely rude and highly unprofessional. There is no understanding of customer service period.  I called this location several times in one evening and repeatedly hung up on when they answer the phone and ask a customer to hold. Further more no one ever returned to the phone after 5 minutes. This is not the first time this has happened (at the B n M in maples heights). I questioned whether or not to leave a review because frankly I have found that black owned establishments know the crowd that they choose to employ and I have never had an experience where unprofessional tactless employees have been adequately  dealt with. I hope the owners and management corrects this issue with their employees."}
{"text":"Chicken wings were cooked well and they were crunchy on the outside but they had absolutely no flavor at all. The collards were cooked well but also flavorless. Pulled pork sandwich was mushy and had a funky smell but no flavor and was sitting in a puddle making the bottom bun basically inedible. Fries were soggy too.  What a massive disappointment. Won't ever be back. :("}
{"text":"I really hate to give this place a bad rating because I want to see black businesses succeed. However, I have to say that a BBQ joint absolutely positively has to get the ribs right. BBQ 101. I have tried their ribs on three different occasions and I have been disappointed each time. Either the ribs had clearly been reheated after being refrigerated for some time or they were overcooked. They never tasted like they had been barbeque'd either. You know, the par-boiled variety.  One time I ordered rib tips and they were dry, tough and chewy.  It's too bad really.   I will say that their chicken wings are the bomb, if you're lucky to get them fresh. Their service has gotten better, but there have been times that I felt like the girl at the register thought she was doing me a favor by taking my order. Calling in orders was also always an adventure. You never knew whether the person taking your order was going to have an attitude. It has gotten better and I hope they don't go backwards.  If I get one more order of chicken that is not right, I will be done with this place. This stuff is not good for you anyways."}
{"text":"I stopped dineing here because they used to short me on my bread and chicken tenders and frys, i went to the other one in oakwood and they would give alot the 2 times i got it. I was there 7 times after that and each time they were out of chicken tenders. Also there philly is around 7$ and its on a hotdog bun. Too pricy"}
{"text":"Just horrible every time I go from when they first open or midnight Chicken wings always   cold with sauce plus cold fries, Too Much Bad attitude that Drive thru. They too lazy change price on menu board the right way instead of a 0piece of paper an tape now thats sorry cheap By far  the best store is Shaw they stay open longer its old but fresh majority time I travel from Kinsman to Shaw always"}
{"text":"UGH is the only nice thing that comes to mind when I drive by this place. I have never received such bad service anywhere. 1. Cashier was arguing with seemingly every customer in line and was no help whatsoever 2. Restaurant is dirty and not kept up 3. Workers are casually lounging around and messing around not actually doing anything   4. Food takes forever to prepare 5. By the time you get you get your food it's cold and dry 6. It's overpriced  I'm surprised this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Food was old & dry... I'll never eat there again. I can't believe the bigger they branched out, the worst they became"}
{"text":"you don't kno what your going to get when you order sometimes the food is great most other times food is bad.. my money is good all the time soo should the product you receive!!! get it together..."}
{"text":"Went to this location around 9:40pm and ordered a 10 piece with 3 large sides. I paid almost $30. When I got home, discovered that my \"10 piece\" was actually  pieces of chicken!! They actually took full pieces and chopped them up to make 10 pieces of random pieces. I will never eat nor refer another soul to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is subpar and takes way too long to get served. The employees are subpar also. Not recommended"}
{"text":"Customer service SUPERB! Notice a change in staff from when I use to come there a while back. Very efficient love the food and better effort. I was also told under new management when I forgot to get my beverage while  I was waiting I talked to the an employee  out in the lobby. Very good change. I've been coming regularly again, very satisfied"}
{"text":"I Wish there was a zero star option. I only came here because I saw the owner on food network Huge mistake. The staff is extremely unprofessional and is not very clean my husband and I shoes stuck to the floor as we walked. I don't think the chairs have ever been wiped down. Don't ever bother stopping here"}
{"text":"Surely I can't be the first person to acknowledge that there is a striking correlation between the name of this BBQ restaurant and the dooty that comes from your other end. I think it's actually a fairly fitting comparison because what I put in my mouth on my visit to B&M was not fit for human consumption.  Let me start off with describing my dining experience. We arrived at B&M around noon on a Friday. If you are unfamiliar with the area, it is a bit rough and most would call it ghetto. Like many restaurants in the area, the people taking your order are behind bulletproof glass and take your money and pass you your food through slots under the glass - like you are in a state correctional facility.   My colleague and I weren't the only ones in the restaurant but we were the only ones in line to order. However, it took a good 10 minutes before anyone came to notice our presence and we were greeted with a very unfriendly grunt and a \"tell muh whachu wan'!\" So I did. And they she took our money and walked away without a word.... not to return for nearly 40 minutes while we waited patiently behind bulletproof glass for our food. After this I began to wonder whether the glass was to protect the staff or whether it was to protect the customers.  However, I patiently waited for the arrival of my food which I was convinced would be absolutely heavenly given the ample time she had to prepare it. Now I have had tons and tons of BBQ from all over the country throughout my life. I've had good and bad, happy and sad.... but there is none worse than I had at B&M. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich (something a BBQ joint should be able to do right). The meat was tough like leather and practically swimming in a flavorless soup of \"BBQ sauce\" (I'm not sure it is fair to claim this was BBQ sauce). Besides this, it was cold and put off a funky smell that another reviewer on here had mentioned. Let me educate those unfamiliar with pulled pork or BBQ in general: pulled pork needs to be cooked over many hours so most places slow cook it throughout the day which means it should always be ready to go. Having to wait 40 minutes should have been a huge red flag to me. What were they doing in that 40 minutes? Was it even made from pig? It didn't taste like it.  Seriously, go here at your own risk. That includes risk to your life and to your health. If the food doesn't get you, the ghetto might!"}
{"text":"Marquita, London, and Nate need a raise they have great customer service and i only eat at this B&M due to their customer service skills and patience for us customers..... The food is always fresh and delicious im yelping now because i forgot yesterday .... The food was great i will keep coming across town for this location thanks guys keep up the excellent work."}
{"text":"I gave this place another try after i said i wasn't ever going back now im never going back for sure, on 3/27/18 i got some ribs and chicken wings some of the ribs were half raw & some were burnt and everything was cold."}
{"text":"I'd really like to give it 3.5 stars. The area of the restaurant is a little sketchy, but the restaurant was clean when I went in. It's set up like a sit down restaurant, but I'd suggest grabbing food to go. They don't have the ridiculous wait time like the Maple Heights location, and the staff here is friendlier. Portions are bigger, which is a good thing for the money but a bad thing for my waistline, especially since my gym just closed. :/"}
{"text":"If I knew how to give this place half a star I would! We were so excited to try this place and the huge crowd of people waiting made us think we had stumbled across the next best thing. Boy were we wrong! The cashier kept saying \"huh?\" after we ordered each meal like she was hard of hearing. We thought we were dining in until we received our order all boxed and bagged up as if to say, \"Hit the road!\" We had to ask for our drinks from the guy preparing foods and we still left without one. The food was not all that.  Not sure how everyone takes their food to go. The sauce was tasty. I think I'll buy some sauce and make my own ribs next time. I won't be returning to dine in or out again."}
{"text":"went to the miles/warrensville location   good polish boy, but barely any slaw, fries were average with no seasoning, sauce was a little mild and sweet not hot (i liked it), $8 for combo, asked if i wanted bottled pop instead for $0.79 more  fountain drink machine broke so gave me bottled pop anyways  restaurant seemed fairly clean, some old cook moping around in the back doing nothing, only 2 wetnaps left in the bin, restaurant was basically empty from 11:30-12:30  have to order at counter, cashier seemed half asleep and bored out of her mind, took way too long to get food, guy in front of me in line got wrong food, cashier disappeared, manager was looking for her and saying \"what are you doing!!!\"  cakes/desserts in cooler looked ok, not sure how long theyve been in there though, lots of condensation on the cooler glass  decor on the outside of the building is nice, two small tables oddly located next to front door, looks welcoming, confusing layout with \"dine in only\" and \"take out only\" sections. fountain drink machine is behind counter, so probably no free refills?  there's better options around for lunch, so hopefully they can improve ASAP, it's a tough location and it won't last with such poor service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have an open mind and am willing to try to eat in different places in hopes of finding an unexpected treasure.  I like neighborhood, independent gems.  I tried and failed here.  First of all, the building is literally falling apart.  Second, the prices are waayy high for what you get.  The service is slow.  The entire experience was sadly disappointing.  I can't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Had their BBQ at their food truck as part of Walnut Wednesdays.  It was mediocre at best.  The smell was so enticing since they have their grill hooked up to the back of their truck.  I got a pulled pork sandwich and side of macaroni and cheese.  It took about 30 minutes for me to get my food.  Luckily I went on my day off, but I can't imagine doing this on a tight lunch break from work.  When I opened my sandwich from its foil wrapper, it looked like regurgitated food.  It was smashed, soggy and impossible to eat as a sandwich.  I started in with a fork and the meat was lean , but was not seasoned at all and there was one small squirt of BBQ sauce on all of the meat.  The cole slaw served on top (which wasn't stated on the menu) was pretty good.  I would never order this meal if I was in business attire or if I had an important meeting later in the day.  The mac and cheese was separating into the oil and cream part of the cheese which was obviously less than appetizing or tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered catfish dinner but was given whiting and asked for no sauce on ribs but got sauce"}
{"text":"first timer:  i told them first time to visit cleveland. they were really nice to me. polish dog a+ sauce b+ fries b+ coleslaw b service a+ bathroom was dirty:  fail"}
{"text":"This place is so busy they can't keep up! Hahahhahaha. But they make it happen! Real BBQ real food!"}
{"text":"B&M has definitely falling off completely. It was my top bbq spot since I was 10 then it has been hit or miss now I'm done. Ordered a pull pork combo got home and the bread was molding."}
{"text":"My first visit wasn't good: shorted me a soda and a sandwich. Beyond that the meat had no flavor and too much fat.  I wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say but the quality of barbecue restaurants that we have in this city has declined. I remember years back when it was quality, now everything tastes bottled and watered down.  First of all, not a big fan of their sauce. I find it too tangy and vinegary for my tastes. The service is very slow and the workers can be incompetent and rude. Then again, a drive thru at a barbecue joint is a very stupid idea. It's not like burgers or tacos which can be prepared ahead of time or quickly. If you're going to use the drive thru, be wary, bring a book for you'll be there for the longest time and they'll still probably get it wrong. Calling ahead of time won't help either for you'll still have to wait.  If you have a taste for barbecue, I would not recommend this restaurant. I would highly recommend spending your own money and time to making it yourself. At least that way, you can play with flavors and get the meat exactly the way you want it."}
{"text":"This place should be shut down. There are to many things to write about but here are just a few: 1. Service is so slow. Takes forever for your food to be ready.  2. Your order is almost ALWAYS wrong!! Be sure to check it.  3. Their sauce is hideous. Makes the food uneatable.  4. Night manager in charge has no clue and no sense of leadership.   Don't bother going here. I've given them 3 chances and never will again. I watch 6 people in 30 minutes come back in because their orders were wrong. How they are I'm business is beyond me."}
{"text":"I ordered wings and fries from this location. I was excited because of the locals loving this place. Unfortunately I went to the wrong location. The wings lacked seasoning and crisp, and the sauce on the fries was thick and unsatisfying. The food was also cold which was surprising because of the long wait. I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"The food is not good they are stingy with the sauce and my fries weren't done... It's not hard to cook fries I knew there was a reason I stopped going after the first time and it hasn't changed. The wings are skimpy also. The picture posted is of the wing dinner it hasn't been touched that is what I got."}
{"text":"How do you say nice things about a restaurant when there aren't that many nice things to say... at the top of the nice list is the mac and cheese and the free wi-fi. If you're looking for flavorful, smoky, succulent, delicious barbecue... look somewhere else.  My wife and I had been looking for some really good barbecue and we came across B & M on Yelp.  This is a counter service restaurant. Whether you're eating in or carrying out, you order at the front counter and then wait for your order. They have an extensive menu of ribs, pork, fried chicken and more, so we asked Mercedes at the counter for help.  She said their pork shoulder was the best, mentioning the buy one pulled pork sandwich, get one for only a buck. Not a bad deal. I went with that, figuring I'd take the second sandwich home for lunch, adding a size of mac and cheese, cornbread and bottled water. Mercedes confirmed that I wanted cole slaw and barbecue sauce on my sandwiches, which I certainly did.  There was a steady flow of people in and out, many of which seemed like regulars. There was smoke in the air and it smelled good inside.  It took about five minutes for my sandwiches and sides to appear with copious amounts of napkins. No fork or drink though. I went in search of a fork and after a few minutes got one from someone on the kitchen staff. I'll let you know when the water shows up.  The sandwich was wrapped in wax paper and foil and was nice and hot. I opened the wrapping to find a generous portion of pork on two slices of white bread. There was a little bit of barbecue sauce and cole slaw too. The bread was already started to soak through and I could tell I was going to get one good bit in before the whole thing came apart.  The pork was okay; juice and tender. Nothing crewing or nasty, but also not smoky or tangy in any way. It was very plan. I could hardly taste the barbecue sauce. The same was true of the slaw, which had just a hint of creaminess and almost no crunch. As I expected, by the second bite the sandwich was in pieces and I ate the rest of it with a folk.  The mac and cheese was actually very good. Their large macaroni shells stood up to a creamy cheese sauce.  I'm trying to stay positive, but the cornbread is the worst I've ever had. Dry, mealy, cold and flavorless.  If I find myself at B & M again, I would definitely order the mac and cheese, it was seriously good, but I wouldn't order the pulled pork or the cornbread again.  And I' still waiting for that bottle of water. It just wasn't worth asking for it after the disappointing meal."}
