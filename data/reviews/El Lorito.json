{"text":"This place is sooo dirty and nasty ! I don't know how ppl can eat there ... The food might be good never at there but come on really you would food that you don't know we're it has been stored ...."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I love their tacos. I had been going to Yaquis over by Charlie's but this place won me over. It's a taco truck so if you're too high class then better go somewhere else. I've had the carne asada tacos and my friend raved about the birria so that will be next on my list. Tacos are larger than your usual Street tacos. 3tacos were more than enough for me.....  Will be coming back most definitely."}
{"text":"My husband and I are fans of this place...  for what it's meant to be: a food truck, family owned/operated, in South Phoenix, serving typical mexican dishes, but mostly known for their Birria, it is pretty good.    ALL of the clientele is local Mexican families ....and all your utensils are cheap plastic.. parking is a dirt lot... the plastic tables may have some flies abuzzing around.. cash only... Spanish only...  but their Birria is damn good and all their toppings (cilantro, onions, home made corn tortillas) are tasty and look fresh/clean.  The two guys that take your order are welcoming, quick, and get the job done.  The food comes out quick, hot, and tasty.... never had a complaint about the food being too much bones or too much fat or not enough this or that... and even better, I've never gotten sick from eating here!  That's gotta mean something, right?  oh yeah, had their huevos rancheros and their avocado was fresh and their beans were yummy... okay, I'm ready to eat this again...."}
{"text":"I'm try this place out the food looks amazing I me on since they're also going to see if it's going to be real good very authentic place I've got that carne asada and the El Pastore tacos their prices change since last year that I've been here they were little cheaper but now they have to keep up with everybody else it is right here on the corner of 7th Avenue and Broadway right in the parking lot which is awesome you have to come and check on my own and it gets busy around lunch time so make sure you get here a little early breakfast burritos I believe are just as good as anything else on the menu.  If you're looking for out of the ordinary place this would be it brush up on your Spanish a little bit so that way you'll know exactly what you're going to order look at the menu before you order they got a selection of drinks from Mexican sodas to American sodas chips you name it it's all right here by rakoba was the ultimate choice but they were just getting this together as soon as I got here this morning"}
{"text":"Food is great, owners are nice and give good service, funny that people bitch about how the place looks its a taco stand not a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite places to eat, I love the quesadillas! I always bring my family here when they come from out of town! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since 2000, we LOVE IT HERE. We always are welcomed with the Best huaraches Arizona has to offer. The food is out quickly and hot and fresh. That's what brings us back every month."}
