{"text":"Fantastic lunch! We've eaten at the adjacent Isa's Pizza several times, but haven't ever stepped through to try Aiello's until today. The complimentary Italian bread and pepper infused oil appetizer was a delicious delight. We shared the spaghetti and pork/veal meatball, and the antipasto salad, and enjoyed both very much. Our service was great, and we look forward to many returns at this quaint little NY-styled bistro."}
{"text":"We had four different pasta dishes. They were all excellent.  The Pesto gnocchi was especially outstanding as was the arrancini appetizer.  Great Italian meal."}
{"text":"OK, so being a NJ native I have eaten in my share of Italian delis. I really wanted to like this place, but it fell short on what we ordered. I read their online menu after purchasing a Groupon and already made up my mind to order the arrancini and eggplant rollatini -- 2 of my deli favorites.

The rice ball didn't have much flavor and was way too big -- the size of a large softball. Although it was stuffed with the usual tasty fare it just couldn't compete with the amount of rice. The marinara that topped it was quite good.

The rollatini was good, but served barely warm. A dish like this should be served hot and melty. It made me think it might have been laying around a while and nuked. Yikes, I hope not.

My husband ordered a veal parm sub. All of the elements were good -- the bread, cheese, sauce -- except for the veal itself. He said it was just one of those weird Arizona type cuts of meat -- if you know what I mean...

I'm going to give Aiellos Salumeria one more chance and order a deli sandwich and antipasta next time.

The restaurant itself is extremely clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Their anti-pasta salad is the best!  I order it all the time and their pizza is superb!  But today I had my baby sleeping in the car, and my husband called the usual order in.  They said they would bring the order out to my car so that I didn't have to wake my baby to come in!  A nice lady came out and even asked me if I wanted something to drink while I wait.  I've known this place was awesome, but this really just made my day!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to this restaurant since they opened at this location. The food is excellent and ambiance at night is good. We've never been disappointed with any dish. 
However, the last few times we have been very disappointed with the service. We like to dine and not have servings come out too quickly. That's not the issue. The problem is the staff was extremely inattentive. We waited a long time to be asked for our drink order, same with getting our drinks, same with the food order and delivery. To top that off, the dirty dishes just sat on our table a very long time. The kicker was they weren't that busy. The first time I just chalked it up to a bad night but it's happened 2 more times. 
Joe is a very hands on owner. Please be more east coast with service."}
{"text":"I want to like Aiello's, I really do. It's close to home, and lord knows, this area really needs some good neighborhood Cafe's. Sigh. I'm partially Italian, originally from upstate NY, and spent 30+ yrs in the SF Bay Area. The interior is pleasant enough, as are all the employees I've encountered, but it has more of a cafeteria feel than a restaurant. I'm used to Italian Delis being crammed with products, and am consistently puzzled by the bare looking messy deli cases. I also didn't even know they had a dessert type case until my 4th visit as its in the back and unseen unless you're on the way to the bathroom. 4 times now I've wanted to order the stuffed artichoke, but they were out, as they seem to be on a lot of items every time I've gone. I've had the chicken Caesar, it was ok. Last nite I stopped in quickly to grab something to take home. I winced at the price of the lasagna in the case ($12), but I was tired, so....Oh, they were out of artichokes, again. I was told they had run out the day before. I wondered why they had not made more. Anyway, back to the lasagna. I asked if it contained meat (I wanted meat) and was told yes. I refuse to eat veal from humatarian reasons, and was told there was no veal in it, although, it will prevent me from trying their meatballs. I was puzzled as to why, when I placed an order to go, I was not asked if I wanted the lasagna hot or cold. I had expected them to give me one of the pieces in the deli case, and I'd be on my way. Instead, I waited over 10 Min. And received it hot. This turned out to be the worst lasagna I've ever had. Stoffers is better. The gravy was not a gravy, it tasted more like they just shredded canned tomatoes and called it a day. There were no spices, and it had a raw, canned flavor. There was no cheese, except for the slab on the top. I did want to eat enough that I didn't have to fix something else, so I searched for the meat, which was very hard to find. I literally could not eat this. What a waste of $12. I've also had the chicken Marsala (rubber) and the pasta pomodoro (bland, tasteless). The pizza is ok,but again, the sauce is bland and canned tasting. It's great that they deliver, but with only one giant sized pizza option available, it's not really an option for just 1 or 2 people. I'm sorry, but I'll never get to taste the artichoke as I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went here on the spur of the moment on a Saturday night & got there about 8:15. We were greeted immediately & shown to a lovely booth. The waiters were very attentive, bringing water, bread & taking the drink order  as soon as we were seated. They have a full bar & a good selection of wines. I had veal marsala, which was delicious. My boyfriend had the red snapper special and loved it. Entrees come with a potato croquette & steamed vegetables, both which were good but the entr√©es were the stars. This isn't a big place, about 15 tables and is beautifully decorated.  We were surprised to find a place this nice in a strip shopping center.  This is not the kind of place you go to get a pizza and a beer. This is serious Italian food, a place to go for a nice Italian dinner. I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local 
We have been to Aiellos many times and have always been more than satisfied.  Our last lunch was very disappointing.  The salmon salad was sparse.  It consisted mostly of greens. The size of the salmon was very small, the dressing was too light, no olives, few artichokes and a small slice of roasted pepper.  The spaghetti and meatballs was bland- this is a dish the restaurant is noted for.  I hope this will not be the norm for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Our good friend took my husband and I to Aiello's two nights ago.  When we waked in, we were greeted right away by a hostess and seated at the bar until a table was free.  Dana was tending bar and was very accommodating.  While at the bar, we were approached by the owner Joe, who asked how we were doing and if we were okay.  We talked to him for a few minutes and had a great conversation.  Then Joe's wife Mahyra (spelling?) came over and talked to us.  Again, all very nice people.

When our table was ready we sat down and ordered drinks and appetizers.  The Calamari Fritti was soooooo good!!!  The breading was light and tasty.  I didn't drink much wine, but hubby and our friend raved about it.  We were served bread and olive oil with peppers to dip the bread in.  All of it was amazing!  We were happy campers at this point.

We ordered our dinners:  I ordered the Chicken Maria, husband ordered the Linguini Fradiavolo and our friend ordered Veal Marsala.  Mine came with a decent serving of chicken breast (covered in mushrooms and artichokes topped with lemon & white wine sauce), green beans and a potato croquette, it was very tasty.  I was very satisfied and will definitely order it again.  Husband's dinner was really good, he said.  The only thing he would have changed was the portion, which was small compared to what he received at other restaurants.  Our friend really liked his veal, which he has had there before.  All three of us cleaned our plates!  

On to dessert.  OMG the dessert!!  Husband and I shared the Tiramisu, which I wish was a little bigger.  It was so incredibly creamy and tasty.  I could have eaten 10 of them!  Our friend had the Chilled Zabaglione, which I've never heard of so he offered me a taste.  I was ready to order one of those next!  It was heavenly, to say the very least.  WHEN we go back there, I honestly will order everything I ordered this time and add the Chilled Zabaglione to my order.

Overall, it was a very satisfying experience.  The ambiance was great, the owners are engaging and very nice, our server Dana was great, and the food and dessert was amazing.  We will definitely be back!  We live in Fountain Hills but will think nothing of taking the drive to Aiello's for another great experience!"}
{"text":"Joe and Myrah  catered the Brickman wedding this past weekend. I'm the mother of the bride and I received so many compliments on the food.The appetizers; crab cakes, shrimp scampi and meatballs were just the start of deliciousness. 
 The Chilean sea bass and chicken Marsala were both excellent! I had to try it all! Umm the Parmesan garlic rolls topped it off. Enjoy a FANTASTIC meal at the restaurant or have them cater your event and you too will come back for more and write a review. Thank you for making the wedding a tasty memorable meal!!!!!"}
{"text":"I come to this review having no bias, since I never heard of Aiello's until it came to my 'hood near Moon Valley. The wife suggested we try it, so we did. I've never been to the central location and had no idea what to expect here. 

People tend to think that \"Italian deli\" is an easy thing to pull off. I believe it is not, because I've eaten at far more Italian delis that I DIDN'T like than I have liked. Aiello's falls neatly between these two extremes, agreeably tasty but... not quite what you would call a great \"deli\" experience.

I had the antipasto salad, the thing by which I judge all Italian delis. What I got at Aiello's was not a salad. It was a meat and cheese plate. With a few paltry greens, artichoke hearts and giardiniera. Oh, and a delicious piece of a ciabatta bread. Everything on this plate was fabulous (especially the fresh mozzarella drizzled with balsamic vinegar). But it wasn't a salad. I took a picture of it - check it out. The thing is, all they had to do was put about fifty cents more worth of what I'll call \"salad type material\" (you know, romaine, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers) on the plate with a dash more of the oil and balsamic dressing and BAM - I would have had a HELL of a salad. As it was, I had a delicious meat and cheese plate. Seriously, my wife got a sandwich and her side salad had more salad than my salad salad.

Also the atmosphere seems... rushed. It's like they had a checklist of \"things which one finds in an Italian deli,\" and they checked them off one by one but didn't put a lot of thought into it. Wire rack shelving with Italian imported dry goods? Check. Refrigerator case with meats and cheeses? Check. Refrigerator case with pre-made... stuff? Check. But the wire rack is sparsely populated, the meat and cheese fridge looks as if stuff was thrown in there randomly and never touched and the pre-made stuff had a tell-tale sag that made it seem that gravity had been doing its work for at least a few days now. Not really impressive.

Compare this with DeFalco's in Scottsdale or even Tony's right down the street at Dunlap. Real delis that have fairly complete selections of imported goods and freshly made stuff. Aiello's is more like a restaurant that has some deli-like window dressing.

Both of us enjoyed the flavors, however, so I'm willing to try it again sometime. Perhaps I'll ask for a side salad next time for my antipasto meat plate."}
{"text":"As good as it gets!  This place blew me away - right away!  As a former East Coast gal, I expected and received great service and friendly staff!  Our server, Brian, was amazing! He even speaks Italian, so if you are, you gotta go!  The owner and chef, Joe Aiello, stopped at every table and said a few words, so you get to know him quickly.

From the first moment I stepped in I was impressed that this little restaurant in a strip mall in North Phoenix was every bit as nicely decorated as many I have been in Scottsdale.  

I was there with my best friend and we both thought the food was outstanding!  The bread--OMG - the bread was unlike any I have had before in an Italian restaurant.  It was chewy and crunchy and flavorful and baked fresh with herbs on top.  Not an airy bread with crust but a dense, cakelike texture.  Delish!  Served with spicy hot peppers and olive oil it was the perfect little treat before the meal. 

The menu is extensive and it was difficult to choose but I went with the LinguineFradiavolo with seafood - mussels, shrimp, fresh clams, squid, etc., - so much food I had to take home some!  The pasta was fresh, and flavors were smooth and tomatoe based with herbs.  It was lovely.

My friend had the special - Sauteed Dover Sole served with potato croquette and fresh beans. It was flaky and perfectly cooked with just a hint of lemon.  

Dessert was a chocolate mousse cake with creamy mousse and moist, dense, chocolate cake, chocolate frosting.  It was to die for!  

Everything was perfectly spiced and freshly made!  I will be going back.  Luckily it is just across from Beautyworx where I get my nails done every other week...

If you live in Scottsdale and are used to good food, like at Trattoria Veneto, you gotta try this place.  Make sure you get reservations cause it fills up fast!  We went on a Thursday night and it was crowded.

And, oh, try the Sangiovese wine with the pasta.  It's dynamic!  Reminded me of my trip to Italy, so smooth and rich.  Brian will let you know which one."}
{"text":"Poor lunchtime service.  Normally great lunch special, 2 slices of pizza and soda.  The current cashier is extremely rude, seems to dislike her job, and definitely conveys disinterest in customer satisfaction.  I've had especially poor service from her on my last two visits. For example, I came at lunch time, and they were out of slices for the lunch special.  OK, that can happen.  But this same cashier was rude, unapologetic, and left me inclined to bring my business elsewhere.  Hopefully, she'll eventually leave or be fired... prior to her, I had consistently gooe service at this place."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch. Everything was excellent. Loved the fresh Italian bread with the pepper - infused olive oil. My antipasto salad was delicious.  I've never had one that was more authentic. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I spent many decades living in and around Los Angeles and there were no really good Italian restaurants there.

As a native New Yorker and former New York cop, I worked all 5 boroughs and visited many Italian restaurants throughout NYC and neighboring Westchester County.  Good as they were, Aiello's Salumeria could stand toe-to-toe with the best in and around New York.  I came across it a week ago and was awed by the terrific salad that comes with lunch.  No iceberg lettuce with a bit of onion and, if you are having a lucky day, a cherry tomato like you get in a salad that most restaurants throw in with your sandwich or  other luncheon choice,  The salad are a delightful mix of terrific greens and covered with the perfectly right amount of homemade dressing.  I would expect to pay $5.00 or $6.00 dollar for the sensational house salad alone. 

 I've since returned for other lunches consisting of their different salads, all topped with their homemade dressings and delicious fresh baked bread served with oil and vinegar with a spicy red pepper dipping sauce has me ever ready for the main course to come,  I've had lunches there and dinners as well.  Everything was scrumptious, especially the meatballs (made with special meats that make them particularly distinct and an absolute delight).  They even make their own Mozzarella cheese which is to die for.  I've been to places in New York where they make Mozzarella cheese for restaurants and also package it for distribution and retail in markets.  Never have I tasted such a cheese as pleasing to the palate with a smoother texture as that made at Aiello's.

 I find the quality and quantity of the dishes to be inexpensive for the awesome flavor and subtly significant portions.  The portions might not look that large, but it is enough to fill you and then some... it must be some kind of optical illusion!  

I've dined in people's homes as well as fine restaurants when traveling in Italy and this was reminiscent of those memories and experiences. Quality and freshness of the food, the ambiance (especially at dinnertime), the freshness and homemade essentials, along with the quantity to go with the quality makes Aiello's special place to be experience.

For a real true taste of Italy and the best of its gastronomical pleasures, it's Aiello's any day for me!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food. Restaurant is small & cozy. We ordered spaghetti & meatballs. Generous portions. Served with Italian bread, garlic knots & oil with peppers. Yum! Meatballs were huge, tender and delish. For dessert, we had a chocolate mousse cake and tiramisu. Both were incredible. Maitre d' was very friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"Being from Brooklyn, NY, I'm a tough sell on Italian food.  My family and I decided to try a few different dishes (take out) so we could make a really fair assessment and I was very happily surprised.  We ordered an antipasto salad that had the best prosciutto I've had since being in AZ. It was a little heavy on the greens, but all the meats and cheeses were fresh and tasty and the veggies like roasted red pepper and artichoke hearts were plentiful and delicious.  We also got an order of rice balls. They were good--we don't really like them with peas, which is a pretty standard way of serving them, but they were still tasty.  I don't eat escarole and beans, but my mother said it was spot on and absolutely delicious.  We got 6 garlic knots and they were ok, a little bigger and doughier than I usually like, but again, good flavor. We ordered a chicken parm hero which was really good; flavorful and not too saucy (if you like it \"wetter\" you should specify because it came really dry) and the chicken was obviously fresh.   The meatballs came per \"ball\" so we ordered 3....my husband is the meatball connoisseur and he was satisfied with them--not the best he's ever had, but very very good.  A large pizza finished up the order, and that's where I'm really hard nosed. It was o.k. It's impossible to get a good east coast/ny crust out here. I'm resigned to that.  It has good flavor, the sauce and cheese were very very good and the crust was probably the 3rd or 4th best I've had out here.  We'll definitely be ordering again to try out their dinner specials and the ultimate test:  how thin is the veal cutlet? :)"}
{"text":"Have done takeout dinners a few times and been pleased each time.  Flavorful food and OK portions. I wish they would make the front deli counter window more attractive with better signage and product.  It is the first thing you see when you walk in and it is visually not appealing and leaves a negative first impression!  Outdoor seating is great to have, but in hotter weather inside seating is limited.  Wish they would collect emails from customers and send out email specials to attract customers."}
{"text":"Love the lasagna, pizza is really good too. The bread that they serve before the meal is sinfully delicious, so try to limit it to one basket. The staff is experienced and it shows. Aiello's delivers what the others cannot - simply good quality food and service every time. They do not miss a step."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here.. Especially the sauce and pizza. The staff is friendly but a little slow. They have great lunch specials and have two sides to the restaurant.. There is a more casual space for families and a more of a fine dining experience on the other side .. I wish they would just open the whole thing up as it seems a little cramped. Anyways it was great overall."}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed with my entree 12 bucks for an entree(rigatoni bolognese)  that wasn't filling and had a bunch of grease sitting at the bottom with a sliver of bread to compliment. Not very impressed. I wasn't impressed with charr burger next door. But I'll give this place one more chance. Maybe a hero or a slice of pizza with a desert. But it will be a whole before I go to get that greasiness feel out of me."}
{"text":"Heard about the antipasto salad but did not try it.  Fabulous focaccia bread with a side of peppers and garlic oil.  YUM O.  Meatball sandwich beautifully presented but meatballs are bready tasting and lack a meaty flavor.  Marinara sauce is a little flat with chunks of tomato.   Ok not great.   Iced tea is delicious and service was 5 stars.

Would come back and try to antipasto salad or ziti.   Skip the meatballs.   Associated pizza restaurant next door."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in town!!! The Nanas pizza is my absolute fave and their canolli is the best I've ever had! They are so sweet in there even the owner is pleasant and just made my first time in even more impressive (my hubby has been picking it up for weeks)"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic east coast Italian food, best Italian restaurant in probably a hundred miles."}
{"text":"Remember, Yelp says 3 stars means A-OK.

   Billed as \"The New Little Sister\" of Aiello's on Central and Colter, this casual, come-as-you-are, dining and deli operation occupies the space formerly home to Pick-Up Stix; what I had thought of as a not too terrible chain, sort-of- Chinese place.
   Arriving by chance at 5 minutes before their opening at 11 A.M., I was extremely happy to see a lucite box of menus affixed to the exterior wall, which gave me the chance to see if I'd be at all interested before making the, sometimes awkward, implied committment of entering. I noticed that the couple and the single (waiting for a friend)  who were to follow me in, all used the considerately placed menu box as well. Point for Aiello's.
   The menu was broad and appealing enough for me to make a choice, and I waited just a minute after the door opened to walk in. The staff was doing minor last minute setup, giving me the necessary moment to take in the new surroundings without feeling rushed, and also gave me the chance to take in the deli cases of meats and cheeses. Overhead, the basic menu is repeated on a huge menu board, a bit crudely installed, in comparison to it's former incarnation, ala Pick-Up Stix. To the left are two wire racks that comprise the \"grocery\" section of boxed pastas, marinated artichokes, etc., and to the left  of that is a narrow cooler containing delicious sounding varieties of prepared raviolis, boxed ready for your home kitchen. At  $12  for a 15 ounce tray, I'd like to sample some of yours, please, before I'd cave to that pricepoint. Don't know if they're sauced, or if that's an add-on. I guess the price isn't too horrible if they're as good as they sound, and especially if you're going to order anything in-house, with those items at $8-15.
   I had the roast pork, rapini, & provolone hero for $9 w/ salad. The sandwich comes on a good, rather broad and tall, 6 inch Italian roll. (semolina) A half-dozen relatively thin sliced tenderloin medallions are arrayed along the length.That's topped with sauteed rapini, on top of which, is the melted provolone. If you're unfamiliar with rapini, it's a bright when sauteed, dark green veg I can only explain as a cross between broccoli and spinach, with the flavor of the preceeding, plus maybe, seaweed. Oh yeah, it has a pleasantly bitter finish as well. While I like the stuff, there was way too  much of it. A third of the way through, I deconstructed the sandwich by removing two-thirds of the  greens, and that suited me. At one point, I thought the meat could have been sliced a tad thicker and would have benefitted with just a kiss from the grill, and a sprinkle of good quality black pepper (plenty of red flake shakers around ) but overall, very satisfying.
   Ditto the salad. I was surprised that there was only one option  on dressing, (balsamic vinagrette) which would wear thin after repeat visits, but this time it worked beautifully with the wonderfully fresh, ripe, balanced, and proportioned ingredients. I initially thought the shaved parm was stingy, but I later realized that it was perfect, and came to appreciate the restraint. I don't remember when a simple salad last caused me to comment on it.
   Ambience-Neutral   Service-OK   Used tables/chairs looked imported all the way from the other restaurant, the seriously glum dude slicing meat wasn't into eye contact at all; at least not this Monday morning. That's ok, it was too early for a rousing rendition of \"O Solo Mio\" anyway. My counter girl had to refer back to the menu to find the corresponding register key for my sandwich after an incorrect entry. No biggie at all. When I asked how long they've been open she wasn't sure if it was two, or three weeks. No complaint; just observing the hired help doing their jobs.
   Here's a weird note on the dessert case near the side door. Most are $5, but there's a tiny, two-bite cannoli for $2. I'd planned on Isabelle's Rum Baba, but when I saw the Tiramisu on the top shelf, my appetite for their sweets took a sharp detour to the left. (like hearing a former lovers name at the critical moment) I could only hope that it was a display-only item, as the coffee powder on top was striated from the cake beneath, (like an Arizona riverbed in summer) the plate was messy (as though the cake had skidded to a stop) and an entire edge  appeared to be chewed away. (no kidding) This thing looked as though it was born on that first day and looked dry enough for me to postpone a purchase at least  temporarily.  Everything in the case was now, for me, suddenly suspect . FYI.
  All in all a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Stars may be added, as earned. Hope they stick around for awhile.
   Finally, if you don't know what \"Salumeria\" means, here's the def: \"pizzecheria negozio di salumi. \" Got that?
   Not speaking the language, my imaginary translation is \" the place you negotiate the salami.\" Makes sense in the deli context. Choose your own."}
{"text":"This is close to my mom's house and we have been a few times. Good food, atmosphere is nice, overall I am happy with this place. I would go back if I an in the area again and need good Italian"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, because we didn't get seated. Here's the deal... 

We live a half hour from Aiello's, so the day we planned to go, I called to make a reservation. They told me they didn't accept reservations for parties under four, but \"there would be no problem getting seated within 20 minutes.\" So we drove all the way out for dinner, getting there at 6:50, only to be told they were booked until 8:30!! Needless to say, we left. And we will never make the drive out there again."}
{"text":"Second visit. First lunch,tonight dinner. Wanting the fra diavolo oops sorry no clams or  calamari.Ordered meatballs and spaghetti-meatballs tasteless, pasta was not cooked in salted water,sauce no taste. Stuffed artichokes were excellent. The mushroom ravioli were excellent. Cavatelli in Sunday sauce tasteless. Bread here is awesome. Cannoli excellent there was constant chatter from the staff behind the bar. And last but not least lets talk about the dust the banquettes were enveloped in a thick layer. All in all not worth the expense."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband about 6months ago and thought it was a great local restaurant with great food. Sent my parents there tonight as they don't eat out much at all with Dad having cancer and they said food good, service was horrible. Very unfriendly staff, service and kitchen problems with staff and something way off. Two hours to get through dinner. Only thing said to them at very end was sorry took so long . Disappointed for them!"}
{"text":"I'm Italian.  I was born and raised Italian.  No one knows Italian food better than I do, and I want you to know Aiello's is the best Italian food I've ever had in a restaurant!  I say that because I have to reserve a little respect for my moma! 

 I've been to some of the best Italian restaurants in the Little Italy neighborhoods of San Francisco, New York City, San Diego and my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio their food was good, but when I first tried Joe's famous Meatballs and Sunday Gravy - it just blew me away!  Finally, I thought, real, Italian cooking, just like what I was raised on, it actually made me cry.

Joe has that touch, that I can't describe, but it makes every dish special.  I had him take me into his kitchen once to show me how he does it, and there is no secret, just all fresh ingredients, everything made from scratch.  And the flavors are so vibrant!

I always order the Cavatelli with Joe's Famous Meatballs and Sunday Gravy, not only because it's so good, but it also brings back memories of my childhood, growing up in an Italian family.  Ruth usually gets the Linguini Fradiavolo and she loves it. The appetizers also are authentic Italian, some of which, my dad and I made together when I was young, escarole and beans in olive oil, antipasto with real imported meats and cheeses, and the calamari has always been spot on and absolutely delicious!  By time desert rolls around, your stuffed, but the Tiramisu is just so creamy and amazing and the strawberries and Zabaglione are out of this world!

 When friends and relatives visit, I always take them to Aiello's and when my family comes to town, some of them born in Italy - they all say it's better than they ever had anywhere!  

And Joe and Myra are such wonderful people, they are like my family. They make every guest feel at home, many times just spending time visiting with them at their tables.   I love them.  You will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"I moved to Arizona from New York about two years ago.  I have been searching for a good Italian restaurant since.  Aiello's is just that.  The owners are from Brooklyn, so they know what I mean by \" Good Italian restaurant\".  I've eaten here several times and always, the service is impeccable and friendly.  The atmosphere is pleasant.  But the food!  The food is
 exactly what an Italian from New York is looking for.  Fresh, high quality, expertly prepared.  Do yourself a favor and order the eggplant rollatini.  Just perfect."}
{"text":"NO NO NO NO cheese PIZZA ..A disgrace .Ok here goes my review. I have been a regular here since they were open and i must say they are going downhill in a fast way. I have not been to there restaurant located next to the adjacent pizzeria but, i have to say they either need to close the pizza store or start paying better attention to how the pizza store does business. 
I loved and i do mean LOVED  there pizza when it came out when they first opened but, now i can honestly say im disgusted with not only the pizza but the entire stores atmosphere .
They never have anything fresh made anymore ( pizza) its old from sitting for hours and what they do have is usually raw never cooked enough.
i am writing this review just after going there for lunch and again much to my disappointment no cheese pizza at all and what they had was under cooked pizza looked liked it sat there all morning.
The people have also been rude beyond compare with little to no customer service what so ever,There soda is always flat from the fountain and the last few times i tried to go they were out of canned soda,,,I mean really.... Mr Aiello wake up your business and staff they are bringing you down.I am a New Yorker and your Pizza sir is not New York anymore 
Plus to add your website states open till 9 the pizza store is not on certain days fix your website.( also i walked in one night at 3 minutes to eight and rude lady stated were closed even though the sign was lit open and the door was open... So very dissappointed in your establishment
Wont be going back"}
{"text":"Amongst the best eggplant parmagiana's we've ever encountered, and certainly the best we've found in Arizona. That's kind of our go-to dish, so we kerp coming back for more. The calamari is also wonderful. We haven't tried much else ourselves, but we've observed many happy customers there. No one ever seems disappointed."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to go for our anniversary and I stumbled across Aiello's in my internet search.  Being from the east coast, it caught my eye.  I reviewed the menu and other Yelp reviews and it sounded right up our alley, so I made a reservation (probably not really needed on a Tuesday night).  

The place is small, probably less than 20 tables inside.  (They do have outside seating, but a little warm to sit outside in June.)  Service was great.  Not rushed, and not too slow either.  

We started with the calamari fritti.  We are big calamari fans, so we tend to order this whenever we get the chance.  It came with a fra diavolo sauce which definitely added some kick.  The calamari was nicely fried and the batter was perfect - not too heavy so he had a good flavor.  

For dinner, I had the spaghetti vongola (aka clams) with red sauce.  Clams were cooked perfectly.  I'll admit - I was a bit nervous about clams in the desert, but these were delicious.  (I took my leftovers home and I'm actually eating them for lunch now as I type this.)  My husband ordered the linguine fra diavolo.  He loved it.  He said the spice level wasn't overwhelming so he was able to taste everything without feeling like his mouth was on fire.  And the clams, mussels, shrimp and calamari were all cooked perfectly too.  

We ordered dessert to go - chocolate mousse torta for me and NY cheesecake for him - and enjoyed them at home later last night.  Again, delicious.  

Before we left, my husband grabbed a takeout menu because we definitely want to try Isa's pizza (which is located right next door - through a connecting door), maybe even as soon as this weekend.  And we'll also be looking to try out Char in the near future too.

Aiello's is tiny, yet upscale.  And prices are about what you'd expect to pay for good Italian food from back east.  Oh, and maybe you'll get lucky and get your meal pretty much for free.  They ask you for a number between 1 and 90 and if your number comes up, you win.  Alas, we chose 14 since it was our 14th anniversary, and we didn't win.  We should have just gone with my husband's lucky number...because that is what came out.  Oh well...better luck next time - and yes, there will be a next time."}
{"text":"I went here with my friends for prom expecting great service and great food. The service was great, but my lasagna came out and it was colder than my iced water. I told them and they were very apologetic. Yet they still made me pay full price for my meal that I didn't even eat. They didn't even give me a replacement lasagna so that I could actually eat and not leave hungry. Overall would not go there again and wouldn't suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Cute little mom and pop place. Friendly service. When my grams and I first arrived the owners parents were sitting and chatting about the Verrazano Bridge in NY. Adorable older Italian couple with NY accents. The server brought out water along with bread and oil with Fresno peppers it in. Spicy but not too spicy. We ordered the lunch special of meatballs and pasta. Our pasta came with a nice little house salad and balsamic. I ordered a coffee and it fresh ground and pressed. The ambiance is quaint with crooner music playing. Delish. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Thank you Yelp! This restaurant lived up to the incredible reviews and went beyond. Our food was incredible, service top-notch and the owner/chef even spent time with us. Our server, Hector was the best server we've had at a restaurant in years - he is a true professional. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I was a little surprised to read the reviews here. There was not anything inherently wrong with the food, but it wasn't great or even that good. Pretty much your average az Italian food. 

Can't imagine I'll be back."}
{"text":"Bottled soda. Sausage links in the lasagna. Not exactly true New York style Italian food. So disappointed. Pizza is better option right next door."}
{"text":"First time here--for lunch.  After ordering, we got some fresh breads and an olive oil/roasted pepper mixture which was delicious with the bread.  Had some spiciness to it but nothing that would keep you from eating it.  Very lovely and very complimentary!  Quick with the waters too.  The lunches are quite reasonably priced.  $8 for their spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs have the reputation (according to the menu) of being NYC's best.  A nice salad of mixed greens came with it with two cherry tomatoes.  Balsamic was just right.  My dining companion ordered a chicken and eggplant sandwich with a spicy marinara sauce which came with a salad on the side.  

My spaghetti and meatball (yes, ONE mountainous  meatball) presented very well. I tasted the pasta and it was AL DENTE--not overcooked and the red sauce was very good--not sweet.  I hate sweet sauces.  Save the sweetness for desserts not for pasta sauce.  The impressive meatball was made of veal and pork and while it was not a bad meatball texture and taste wise, it was not the explosion of flavor that I expect from a really good meatball. So NYC's best it cannot be.   I ate all the pasta and 3/4 of the meatball--it was that large.  The chicken & eggplant sandwich was pretty decent and they made the sauce spicy just as we asked.  
Dana, our delightful server, made sure the service moved nicely, that we had our waters filled, and answered all our questions about the menu.  I have not run into such an amiable and competent server all rolled into one in a long time.  Thank you Dana.  You made our first lunch at Aiello's quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went for AZ restaurant week last night. Average Italian food."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends last Christmas, and I was the first one there so I was the first one to get confused... ;-) The restaurant side has or had an entrance through their pizza shop side.... once I figured THAT out, I was able to get seating to wait for my friends and ordered a drink... Once we were all in attendance, my friend from NY(who also happens to be from the same borough as Mr Aiello) made a couple of suggestions... our appetizer was the Eggplant Rolatini... yum! 
our mains... The Spagetti & Meatballs, Gnocchi Pesto .... and because she knew him, he sent out a lovely dessert of the cannoli!! yumm! Guess I'm gonna have to bring my family there too! 
Very good!"}
{"text":"we were staying nearby on a stay cation and saw the reviews on yelp. We like to try local hidden gems and this one did not disappoint. The best meatballs in phoenix. Excellent service. Of course I had to have a canolli for desert. We live kind of far from it but it would be worth the drive. I would also like to try the pizza place next door owned by them."}
{"text":"Go here every time I'm in Phoenix. Food is wonderful. Always had a great experience but last night was not the same. The owner was not there and as they say when the cat is away the mouse will play very poor service. Also their phone was not working all day and the staff just shrugged their shoulders instead of reporting it."}
{"text":"Food was unique. Three different sauces all tasted different. Tea was old and waitress said yes, we use last nights first thing in the morning. Honestly not a repeat! 

Cannoli was good part of trip."}
{"text":"I have tried all of the restaurants in the building and they are all good but this review is for Aiello's. I just had the eggplant parm. It was good and what brought it together was the base red sauce. Made with plum tomatoes and not acidic or sweet and not spicy like some. It was just right. 
I'm disabled and it's hard to get out to restaurants so, the best thing for me is that they deliver! ( all 3 place deliver) Thanks for the convenience Aiello's"}
{"text":"One of the best places for a lunch meeting or just a quick bite. Salumeria  is the best sub I have ever had.big thumbs up."}
{"text":"I had the spaghetti & meatballs w/ extra basil... OMG. It was amazing. Love this place. Great service and excellent outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Phoenix's hidden Italian gem! I love this restaurant and the attached pizzeria. It's fresh, authentic and delicious Italian food. The service is always great, our server was Nancy and she was so sweet and made our experience amazing!  

It's a family run business so you know you and yours will be taken care of very well. Definitely recommend it to anyone coming into town or already here!"}
{"text":"What are the meatballs made of?  My husband and I decided it is mostly bread.  We were disappointed in the food and very disappointed in the price."}
{"text":"Been eating here, since they opened!  Italian food, is an addiction to me, so I've enjoyed, everything I've been served.  Joe, the owner, is a great guy, and I love it, when he's present.  I shoot a few events, up at the Pointe Hilton Resort, and whenever anyone asks me where they can eat, I send them to Aiello's.  I've never had anything but good reviews, when I ask about their visit."}
{"text":"I'm afraid I was a bit underwhelmed by Aiello's.  I really wanted to like this place which is right in my neighborhood, but alas it was just okay.  At least we had a Groupon so it wasn't too bad price wise, if we hadn't I would classify them as being a tad expensive for what you get.
I had the wild mushroom rigatoni and it was fine, nothing special nor memorable.  My buddy had chicken parm which was beyond overdone, but the sauce was decent.  The deli case has all the meat seemingly just thrown in there very unorganized and difficult to see whats what and how much it costs."}
{"text":"I'm east coast Italian and the day we found Aiello's was one of the happiest days I've had in Arizona!! The food here is incredible! From appetizers to desserts and everything in between, delicioso!!! 
I love that they serve cavatelli...my favorite pasta! The Piccata and Marsala are both excellent! You really can't make a bad choice here!!"}
{"text":"I was craving spaghetti and meatballs and after reading the good reviews on this place, I decided to give it a shot. I called and placed an order for pick up and once I got back home with my food, I became disappointed. The serving size of pasta was adequate and included 2 meatballs, but I was given 2 pieces of bread that were completely burnt black and hard as bricks. Dipping bread into the pasta sauce is one of my favorite parts, and this bread wasn't even edible. I decided to dig into the pasta and meatballs, and I couldn't have been unhappier. It had no flavor and was completely lack luster. The meat balls were very tender...but that was all they had going. When I say they had no flavor, I truly mean it. Just the spaghetti and meatballs cost over $15. I could have gone to Olive Garden for cheaper and it would have been tastier."}
{"text":"Just before Christmas, came here with my parents and my guy's parents.  Was just looking for a nice Italian place in between our homes. We had a wonderful meal...definitely aptly named because it was one of the best Italian meals since leaving the east coast.  Met the chef, the staff was very attentive but not overbearing. It was a great night out for all of us. We will be sure to come back."}
{"text":"This is on the top of my Italian resturant list. The owner is an authentic Brooklyn boy, whose still got a lot of New york in him. ( if you don't know what that means, it means you don't get out much. Or you never saw the Sopranos! Hey are you lookin at me?) It means that the best Italian food in the world is in New York, aside from a handful of places in Italy. Asaaa forget about it. Drop what your doing and go get your A-- over Aiello for a 5 star meal."}
{"text":"The pizza is great! The stromboli is not! Was on my lunch break and stated I need food to go. Didn't know that everything is so handmade it takes half an hour to make anything! By the time I got my food I had no more of my lunch break available. Didn't even get the chance to eat...they just kept telling me I should have known better and to call in my orders because they are busy. There will not be a next time! Too busy for people trying to eat on a lunch break! Apparently just call in all orders!"}
{"text":"Wow this place far surpassed my initial thoughts on the place. From the outside it just looks like a pizza to go place. But no, their menu is very elaborate even including crab cakes! They have a variety of legit pastas too. I got the special and it comes with a salad and cannoli and warm bread. All was delicious.  The Caesar salad dressing was so creamy and just great. They do put a lot on the salad so I'd ask for light if you don't want the salad doused. But the dressing was perfect! The bread came warm and very soft. Also very good. The pasta sauce was great but the pasta itself was mediocre. The pasta was not cooked al dente which was surprising to me since everything else was great. Cooking pasta al dente does not seem too hard. 9mins in boiling water sounds very straight forward to me... Anyways it was still tasty and I would still come back because everything from the service of the friendly workers to the taste was great. The food came out all at once and was very fast. I just wish they would put more effort into making that pasta al dente! I would give this place a hands down 5 stars besides that."}
{"text":"I'm an East Coast Snob who worked in NYC, lived in Brooklyn and dined in Little Italy at only places that John Gotti frequented, including Peter Lugers in Williamsburg Brooklyn.  I had lost faith in Arizona Italian over the past 2 years since I relocated here. Everything tasted like Chef Boyardee Beefaroni. Aka puke food. I almost gave up on Italian until I saw decent reviews on OpenTable regarding Aiello's. So my wife and I gave Aiello's a shot and were pleasantly pleased. The service gets an A+, the ambiance is perfect NY Guido-like  with nice table linen , red patent leather circular seating and Frank Sinatra singing in the background. This gets my A rating for replicating SPQR Restaurant in Little Italy NYC.  The food was served warm and fresh, pasta al dente, salad fresh and crispy. The so called Aiello's famous award winning meat balls had a bit too much bread filler for my palate. Red sauce perfect. Therefore the food gets a B grade compared to NYC quality. Overall, I am intrigued and satisfied enough to become a repeat customer. They have a lot of interesting dishes on the menu.
I want to reassure future customers that Aiello's is an all right place to dine and you won't be disappointed. Some of the reviews I have seen by Yelpers seem ridiculous. Go find out your self with an open mind and be civil to the waiters."}
{"text":"Great service, even better food. Solid wine list...must try.

We've been here for lunch a few times and now just had an amazing dinner.  Make reservations..."}
{"text":"I love the Caprese Hero and my hubby loves their Italian Lobster Tail :)  
Everything is super fresh and the staff really appreciate all the customers and if you go twice you're practically family."}
{"text":"I got the Veal Hero and the Calamari. The Veal Hero was all bread, I mean so much bread i had to take half off and make an open face sandwich. The Calamari was okay but had a great sauce."}
{"text":"I like bread and the bread here was ok not perfect not bad but ok, the main food is good though I personally liked it. It was good Italian and I am Italian."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon that was expiring today - my first visit. Got three items for takeout at lunch, and brought them home and into the refrigerator for dinner tonight.
WOW! All three items were exceptional. The Salumeria sandwich was our favorite, packed full of artichoke hearts, fresh mozz, roasted peppers, and a variety of meats. A little on the spicy side, which we liked. The grilled chicken with fontina and roasted veggies was no slough, either. Next time, we're asking for some of Aiello's spicy roasted peppers to kick it up a notch. The lunch special was grilled chicken with fettucini - another winner. All three entrees were served with a tasty side salad, and one that was not an afterthought. Fresh, multi-colored spring mix with a couple of grape tomatoes, red onions, and shredded cheese dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette. Truly a notch above.
Oh, they also included some of the Aiello's house foccacia - again, YUMMY.
What a great experience. We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in myself for wasting $30 on this place. I ordered the Linguini Fradiavolo & a side of calamari to go. 
First, no utensils, napkins, or dipping in the bag.
Secondly, the pasta was awful. It was so bland & didn't smell appetizing at all. I picked out the two shrimp & that was it.
Lastly, the calamari was hella greasy & wasn't seasoned with anything other than probably a pinch of salt."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in the valley. Best meatballs in town not to mention the parpardelle pasta with a light cream sauce, shallots, and wild mushrooms. Love this place and Joe the owner is amazing."}
{"text":"Two bites into dinner and I know without a doubt I'll never be returning to this place. The pancetta was disgusting. The smell alone made me gag and yet I still took a bite. Yuck! 

Was hoping the spaghetti and meatballs would be better. But nope. The meatballs were 90 percent mushy bread. So bad I literally spit the food into my napkin. Sauce tastes like canned tomatoes, lacking even a hint of basic seasonings like basil, oregano, or salt! 

Yelpers, you led me astray. I want my $30 back. If you're looking for a dinner spot please take note and seek Italian food elsewhere. 

P. S. The bread was good. We each had one piece for dinner."}
{"text":"I love their meatballs.  I often get 2-3 for lunch.  Chicken Parm is very good.  Homemade cookies are excellent.  Very casual place and prices are very reasonable.  $5 for half a hero and side salad."}
{"text":"Very delicious Roast Pork, Rapini & Provolone Sandwich served with flavorful side Salad.  Ordered the Lobster Claw dessert which was prefilled on this visit.   I prefer when they Fill it to order .   Pastry cream base was to eggy and texture was not as pleasant as in the past."}
{"text":"This deli has a nice collection of classic italian foods. 

I tried the veal parmigiana and it was excellent. The meat was cooked perfectly and the ultra-thin breading magically disintegrated in my mouth. These were layered with tasty mozzarella cheese and marinara. It was a very satisfying meal.

I also got to taste the veal meatballs. These also had excellent flavor and were much lighter than typical beef meatballs. The meatballs had a nice herbs and spices. In the middle, they were very juicy and flavorful.

Order and pay at the counter in this deli as you walk in the door. If you are eating in, the cashier will deliver your food to your table when it is ready. The meal prices are in the $10-15 range and the portion sizes are huge, which allows for extra leftover meals. I would go to Aiello's again when in the mood for Italian food and in the area."}
{"text":"We happened to stumble upon this fantastic Italian place last night while doing a staycation nearby at the Pointe Hilton resort. The food was absolutely delicious, the service was first rate, and the chef/owner was out and about in the dining room to greet guests with his warm personality.  This is easily one of the best Italian places in Arizona, and has very fair prices as well considering the quality and quantity of food that you receive. The dining area is small, but a large patio makes up for any space issues. 

We came with our two young boys (4 & 1), and were warmly greeted, with the chef even saying a special hello to our youngest. We will certainly be back in the future as it's very apparent that the family-owned restaurant cares about their customers and wants to put out a high quality product."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten here, go right now! Amazing food and service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I really like this place. There's a good vibe about it. It's clean and airy, with friendly people...oh, and the food is really good too!

I tried the Chicken Parmesan sandwich. It was big and delicious and came with a scrumptious salad on the side too. I tasted the Salumeria sandwich too, and it was also very tasty. That one had a nice spicy bite to it; very good!

I wish I lived closer to this Aiello's. If you live in the northern part of Phoenix though, this place is certainly worth checking out. I'm looking forward to returning anyway."}
{"text":"This was my boyfriends and mine first time here and honestly it is our favorite little find in a long time. It's is a smaller place but does not lack in quality or charm. Aside from the food being really good, the staff was friendly and funny. My favorite part is probably the portion size. It is the perfect portion of food where you can actually have dessert in the end. You won't be disappointed with this Italian restaurant, give it a try"}
{"text":"One of the valley's best Italian spots. The Owners come to you table and greet you and make you feel just like family. All of the pasta dishes are amazing but my favorite of all is the Chicken parm. The sauce has the right consistency and bold flavor. I miss Aiellos being on Central though but check em out!"}
{"text":"The service was AMAZING!  The food was pretty darn good. I was very excited to see \"Sunday Gravy\" on the menu.  The flavor of it was not what I was looking for, but still quite good.  The bread was great.  I loved the chef coming out and interacting. I will be back."}
{"text":"We tried the $4.95 lunch special , it was half sandwich with salad .

The Salumeria sandwich was assorted Italian lunch meats that were unusually mild for Italian meat and cheese that had little flavor . This sandwich seemed to  lack seasoning or dressing . The salad on the side was good .

I had the grilled chicken sandwich I did enjoy the taste of the char on the vegetables and chicken but  the chicken was dry , bread wasn't toasted and also this sandwich lacked seasoning and dressing . You might ask why didn't I just get up and ask for some vinegar and oil and my answer is after taking two bites I thought it wasn't worth getting up for a tiny end of sandwich ( this was a half sandwich ) . This sandwich even with grilled vegetables seemed very dry .They do say they are East Coast Style but  no hot Cherry Peppers in store can't be an East Coast sandwich without hot cherry peppers . 

If you get a sandwich ask for your oil and vinegar on the side so you can add it if you feel your sandwich needs flavor .

I saw Rice balls  (arancini) and Stuffed Artichokes that looked really good in the case  and would have purchased to try at home if I was going straight home but I wasn't maybe I would have given more stars if that is what I tried . Two stars isn't saying don't go here .

 I think this small comfortable casual place has potential so give them a try maybe they are still working things out ."}
{"text":"In from Washington looked on Yelp for a good Italian restaurant and Aiello's popped up. 
First thought a good Italian restaurant behind a fast food joint in a strip mall, you've gotta be keep kidding me. 
Absolutely, tremendous. Friendly service. The owner and chef sitting out front saying hello, and the food? Outrageously good. That meatball, it was  the best I have had, ever. The bread, homemade nothing like I have had before and I don't like breads. And the hot peppers that came with it was marvelous. 
It is a must."}
{"text":"Absolute best service absolute best owners and absolute best Italian food I've ever had in my 27 years of life. It's the most perfect date spot I would go once a week for the rest of my life if I could and I probably will. There cheesecake is to die for and all their pastas have never disappointed. I'm allergic to tomatoes so I order mine with pesto sauce or a lemon wine sauce instead and they're always very accommodating. They make awesome drinks at the bar I had the best dry martini with extra olives there. I would say my only complaint is that sometimes when they run out of good bread the bread basket they bring you is clearly leftover dough that they had from their pizzas that they just be can bring to you and it's not very good. But the oil with hot peppers in it that they bring you to dip your bread is to die for, I always drizzle a little of it over my pasta or any entr√©e I order because I can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"I worked for Joe and Myrah for a few months earlier this year at another of their restaurants, but in that time I never got to truly try Aiello's. Tonight, I decided it was time. I postmated their Chicken Park dinner to me and I was excited to try it. I have to say, I wasn't disappointed. My FAVORITE dish is Chicken Parm and I'm pretty picky about it. Theirs was breaded nicely, the sauce was delicious, the spaghetti was plentiful, and the garlic knots (as I remember them) were perfect. I absolutely enjoyed the dinner all to myself and I'm looking forward to maybe making it into the restaurant sometime. Def give it a try if you're looking for authentic italian."}
{"text":"We live close to Aiello's in midtown, so it was a bit of a trek to check out Aiello's Salumeria.

Totally worth it.  Delicious and fresh food was somehow overshadowed by outstanding service.

Every silly question of mine was answered, I even bought a can of authentic San Marzano tomatoes!

The \"house\" sandwich and meatball sub was amazing.  The house salad was OK, you really can't ruin salad can you? 

Most amazing was the Arancini or rice balls. delicious and full of great texture, it could have been a meal on its own.

This place is pretty amazing.  Being across the street from a McDonalds, it's pretty badass that you can get an amazing meal for about the same price of a extra value meal."}
{"text":"I have been an Aiello's fan since they were located on Central Ave. With them closer to home, I can enjoy them more often. I am here often for lunch and pick  up dinner occasionally. So obviously I like/love this place.

The food is awesome. Everything is prepared fresh. I have never had anything I didn't like. Besides lunches and dinners,  I have picked up food for family birthdays and a high school graduation get-together.

Part of the charm of this place is that it is a small local business, family owned and operated. It has character. 

This is the top choice of my mother's when we pick her up to take her grocery shopping, to the doc, etc.  She can no longer drive to due a stroke. I am here once a week, every week. We almost always get the 2 slices of pizza lunch special, different toppings, a great value. 

EVERY SINGLE TIME we visit, we are greeted by friendly employees who are quick to take our order. The atmosphere is so pleasant that we  eat-in, and hang around for a while to visit afterwards. Frequently one of the employees or the owner will chat with us for a minute. It is always a pleasure to lunch there.

The pizza is truly amazing, you can't go wrong with anything. I LOVE the Nana's pie, and sometimes they have a great special slice available w/ 3 sauces, alfredo, red and pesto.  Some of our family favorites beside the AWESOME pizza: stuffed artichoke hearts, calamari, veal marsala, house salumeria hero, chicken parmesan, eggplant parmesan."}
{"text":"We were on a staycation around the corner and the Resort restaurants were really staid,  so we went to this little family run place instead. Great food and service, everything seems to be homemade including the delicious bread. Had the ceasar salad which had great creamy dressing without being overdressed. Then for me eggplant rolitini which was yummy and chix parm for my husband which he liked. The atmosphere was cozy and attractive. The server was very attentive. Didn't think it was expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place after seeing it on TV. I ordered the Grilled chicken &Fontina Hero and an Iced Tea. I asked for a \"to-go\" cup for the iced tea but was told that they were \"out of the to-go cups\". Ok; no big deal. The sandwich came and it was so-so in terms of appearance, but figured it might taste better than it looked. The problem was, it did not have any roasted peppers as stated on the menu AND it had portabello mushroom on it which is not listed on the menu. I went up to ask about the peppers and was told that they were \"out of roasted peppers\". Hmm.  The sandwich was pretty blah and I would not order it again. 

The heavy, gruff guy on the pizza side of the business adds a bit of authenticity to the Italian experience, but I will think twice about going back not knowing if they will be \"out of\" the items I might want to order. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Are You Serious.... Get Out of Here! 

I'm so sorry to see that Aeillo's on Central closed their doors (some time back).  I never saw Aeillo's restaurant empty.  Every visit to Aeillo's was bustling, full of happy diners. With that being said I decided to head to Aiello's Salumeria Italian Deli on Thunderbird.

From the moment my lunch companions and I walked in the door, I felt right at home as the owner warmly welcomed us in.  When the staff referred to \"pasta\" as \"macaroni\" and \"sauce\" as \"gravy\" I knew I was in for a great lunch expeirence.  The staff and service at Aeillo's Salemeria Italian Deli was attentive and friendly, and the food was amazing.

The homemade focaccia bread was so good, I am certain I ate way too much of it so I wasn't able to finish my meal. The stuffed artichoke hearts, and spaghetti/meatballs were to die for! I didn't think it was possible to make a better meatball then my grandmother but I was wrong (forgive me grandma).

I definitely recommend this place and it has now become  one of my favorite spots.  In addition, to great food.  Aeillo's Salumeria Italian Deli, offers great lunch specials (2 cheese slices and a fountain drink for 5 bucks) ARE YOU SERIOUS!! GET OUT OF HERE!  If your ever in the area you have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love this place......never had a bad meal there.  If the risotto balls are available as an appetizer, get them!"}
{"text":"Honestly fair. Just fair. Came here with family and they were equally not impressed. The so-called famous meatballs I heard of we're nothing compared to other Italian restaurants. Food is bland and lacks simple salt and pepper."}
{"text":"I often get a chicken Caesar salad to go. The dressing is just how I like it. Creamy and garlicky. Grilled chicken is always done right.
For pasta, I like to get pappardelle with chicken and vodka sauce. It's not on the menu so I get fettuccine but sub the noodles, hold the red peppers.
The spaghetti carbonara was indulgent and rich, but not too heavy. 

Even the bread with hot oil is worth the calories. 

For dessert, the cannolis are my favorite.

Good service every time, reasonable wait for to go orders.

Right next door to Isa's pizza. 

I guess the only reason for 4/5 is the location. It's alright. No complaints. Just not that extra something special."}
{"text":"Yummy! This pizza is amazing...... You can't beat the lunch special. I would recommend trying the all white pizza with mozzarella and ricotta. Delicious!!!! The owner and staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Such amazing Italian food!! We love the dinner for four specials! The Thursday and Friday specials are the best! Their desserts are delicious! Love the new location, loved the old location.. Can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"Reading the sad news about Aiello's closing their Central Ave. location reminded me to share the good news about this place. So... Aiello fans, take heed: You have an alternative and it is GOOD!!

I had the. best. stuffed artichoke I've had in a looooong time here (see photo) and, for that, I am a devoted fan! The artichoke was giant and must've weighed at least 2 pounds stuffed! I also enjoyed the eggplant rollatini - the eggplant was soft and sweet and LOADED with ricotta filling. The sauce had the perfect acidity. Seriously, for as big of a fan as I am of the food and as convenient as it is -- it's dangerously close to home! 

The adjacent pizza place has a white pizza that's on my list! Looks PERFECT but can't fully vouch for it... yet! ;)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a fabulous mom and pop Italian restaurant for a intimate date night and came across Aiello's.  What a fabulous find. If you want true Italian food prepared to perfection,  this is the place!   You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food. The service is slow but the food is good. Their wine suggestions are not the best in the business.  The pizza next door is top notch."}
{"text":"First time in. Exactly what I hoped for a little Italian place on the corner. Great pizza. Stromboli was good. Meatball was really good. Regret not coming sooner. Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Not great.  Had seafood linguine which was really fishy and basically inedible.  My friends penne was good so we ended up splitting that.  They took the linguine off the bill and the salad was good, but that linguine never should have left the kitchen.  Doubtful to return."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of Aiello's. the food is the best Italian food you can find in a restaurant. The staff are very professional and friendly. The ambiance is quaint and appealing. I love the Eggplant rollatini,"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! I guess I wasn't sure what I was expecting but I was surprised to walk into to tablecloths on the table and a slightly upscale anti-toddler -- and though OH CRAP I thought Yelp said this place was kid friendly. I did a quick scan and spied the high chairs so all was well. We were the only ones in there (thankfully because the child was talking loudly). They gave a lovely bread basket with a spicy roasted red pepper and olive oil teaser. I loved their bread. Crusty hard but soft in the middle. I had the Chicken Maria which was delightfully tangy, perfectly thin, and fresh. The hubs really enjoyed the potato croquette. The green beans were on point! He had the Papardelle Bolognese. It did not disappoint. Bolognese, for me, is the unit of measurement that i use to judge an italian restaurant's worthiness. While not the best bolognese (my vote is tied between Bianco and my mom's) it was seriously delightful and REAL DEAL bolognese. The child, being the adventurous eater that she is, had butter noodles. She ate more than 1 bite which meant she enjoyed it. They do this really fun thing at the end of your meal -- you pick a number 1-90 and if they pull your number, your meal is free. How cool is that?? Will definitely be back -- neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are wonderful and very fairly priced.  You can eat inside or takeout for an additional .75. People keep reviewing the pizza but Aiellos Salumeria aren't the ones who make pizza- its Isas right next door. The deli makes sandwiches and Italian dishes like spaghetti and meatballs. It is all delicious. The owner is extremely personable and polite, always greeting customers. I suggest giving some of the treats in the bakery a try. I have never had anything disappointing. Best neighborhood spot, we are so lucky to have this gem!"}
{"text":"I have to say impressed from the get go with the hostess and server Mihail. The owner Joe was personable and greeted us twice. The meatball sauce ravioli and lasagna was amazing! Great local moon valley find!"}
{"text":"If you drive by this spot and like Italian food make time to stop in. Great atmosphere and food. 

The calamari was light and flakey. The capplinni with Sunday gravy is hearty and rich. The carbonara was full of chunks of porky and was rich in flavor. The veal Marsala and the fantastic potato cricket with a beans was great. Tiramisu was outstanding."}
{"text":"Amazing food... I had a veal parmigiana that brought me back to my youth in New York. The service was phenomenal... Ask for Dana she was great. Not too obtrusive, kept our cups full and made great wine recommendations. And Joe is such a great cook and host - made the visit fun for our whole family."}
{"text":"Just what Moon Valley needed! The Aiello's doing what they do best! Italian pasta, heros, desserts and Isa's Pizza right next door! FORGETTABOUDIT! The new salad bar is great,  lots of choices and a great price. Tell them Gino sent ya."}
{"text":"This restaurant and it's affiliates next-door have a great selection of tasty and fresh Italian food. Their service is prompt and they are courteous and thoughtful for the needs of their customers. We have eaten at all locations multiple times and also ordered takeout, always with delicious results!!"}
{"text":"Great food-tasted like home made Italian without all the work!!! The owner really adds to the ambiance. He came over and asked if I was full and if I wanted more-just like I would imagine someone in Brooklyn doing! He checked in on us several times! Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"UPDATE!  Although my review still stands, I decided to call them regarding my disappointment. The owner Joe called me right away and was very, very nice. He explained to me that their style of Italian is not as spicy  as the type  of Italian I like.   he did offer a full refund however I booked and paid through Yelp so he was unable to do that.  NOTE TO SELF... DONT BOOK OR PAY THRU YELP!  He he owns three restaurants and he offered give certificates free meals whatever he could do to make me happy.   it's nice to know that there are Business owners that have integrity. So I raised my rating to 3 stars because of Joe's integrity.  
 After reading all the reviews and 4 a half stars I was really looking forward to our dinner. I am sad to say that for the most part it was very disappointing. Other than the Cesar salad dressing there was absolutely no garlic taste with either Sunday gravy dinner or a chicken Parmesan. We spent over $50 Plus the five dollar delivery charge and a five dollar tip. The \"famous meatballs\" were basically tasteless and kind of spongy as though they had been frozen prior to heating them up for my dinner. The chicken Parmesan had one small chicken breast and a side of spaghetti for $16.   I'm not sure why our dinners were so different compared to the wonderful ratings written by other people. If this was an off night, I would sure like to hear from the owner."}
{"text":"We ordered from here tonight and were disappointed. I got the tortellini alla panna. The prosciutto was chewy and the cream sauce had no flavor. My husband got the chicken Parm, which tasted like plain tomato sauce was poured on it. The tiramisu was ok, but the Italian Ricotta cheesecake had no flavor. We will not be returning or recommending this place."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!!!! What an amazing find.  The pizza is crisp but flavorful.  Original New York style.  So very yummy!"}
{"text":"This is the deli version of Aiello's. You order at the counter and they bring your food to you when it is done (although I wonder if you will have to wait for it during busy days). They have very limited sittings but we were there during lunch time and most people were ordering their food for take-out so it must not get full often. 

I had their veal meatball spaghetti and it was very delicious. The meatball was very juicy and flavorful. The two large meatballs were accompanied by a generous portion of spaghetti and a piece of garlic bread. My boyfriend ordered their veal parmesan, which was served as two large pieces AND more spaghetti. The portions are definitely more than enough for a meal. The price is a little on the pricey end for a simple dish but we had a Groupon so managed to save about 33%. 

Their dishes were good but not a place we would purposely drive to Phoenix for. It would be a good place to go to if we are around the area again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner tonight. The food was really good. I am gluten free and called ahead to confirm an option as I found nothing on the menu.  They offer gluten free penne pasta! It was cooked perfectly.  Service was great too.  The chef even came out to check on patrons.  Definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"can I give no stars?

bread terrible, no butter, no olive oil.

salad drowned in basalmic vinegar.  should have asked for it on the side or gotten the minestrone.

service so-so at best.  main course took forever to show up.

side of spaghetti tasted like it came from a buffet where it sat for hours before being served."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! I had the fettuccini and a Caesar salad and I enjoyed it very much! If you're from the east coast and miss the food! You can get a fix here!"}
{"text":"Had the spinach ravioli special. The ravioli was delicious and the Alfredo sauce was very creamy. Loved the fresh bread with the pepper olive oil. Server was great and funny."}
{"text":"If your looking for Italian that falls short on service and you have lots of money to spend on horribly small and flavorless portions, then this is the place for you. For all you spring training fans looking to branch out and try different food locations while your here, I urge you to skip this local flavor, as it under delivers and will leave your pocket book wishing you had went Mexican food or burgers.  Drive past this place, you'll be glad you did !! I give it a quarter star, for having cold water!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here for lunch and we ordered spaghetti lasagna..taste really good than any other place we've been and the place is very pleasant..perfect Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"This is NOT East Coast Italian food. I repeat... this is NOT EAST COAST ITALIAN FOOD! It was one of the worst Italian meals I have ever had. Three stars for the Mozzarella Carozza and Calamari (which brings this place up to a 2 star average) but that is the best I can do. The waitress was friendly enough and did a decent job. However, she did forget my mussels appetizer which I didn't point out because I didn't want the rest of my group to have to wait. 

The baked Clams Oreganata had way too much Marsala wine in them. It overpowered the taste. The pasta dishes were over cooked and not al dente. The Lasagna was average but it tasted like it has been cooked and frozen for a long time. The Carbonara and the Spaghetti with \"Joe's Famous Meatballs\" were both sitting in a puddle of water in their bowls. Drain the pasta properly please. I want to taste sauce, not recycled reheating pasta water. The meatballs were pale and looked under-cooked. Not sure how or when these could EVER be ranked the best in NYC. They were mushy and instantly fell apart. I have had better frozen meatballs and that's saying a lot coming from an East Coast Italian New York girl (sorry nonna). 

And where do I even begin with the cannolis? They were the size of a child's thumb, $6 a pop ($3 would have been reasonable), and lacking citrus or pistachio. They had a gummy consistency; tasted like they used flour as a filler. Espresso was served without sugar or lemon peel like on the East Coast.

The dining room doesn't look half as nice in their staged website photos and is coated with dust. It's on the back of the booths. It's on the lights above the tables. You can see it moving on the chandelier in the middle of the room. Make sure it is not falling onto your pasta in place of the Parmesan!

To top things off, we had made our reservation on OpenTable. We showed up on time and checked in. The next morning I received an email from OpenTable saying the restaurant had cancelled my reservation. I didn't even get my 100 points for this terrible meal. 

We won't be back. And please, if you have any decency, any concept of what good East Coast Italian food is, don't bother eating here."}
{"text":"The bread was okay. I would be surprised if they baked it. The minestrone soup was watery and bland. The calamari had zero flavor. I also thought the staff was more than a little annoying. We were all convinced the hostess was on a large dose of Xanax."}
{"text":"I love anything the Aiello's do in the culinary world (awesome folks in every other way too).  Love the restaurant on Central but a tad bit far and expensive for frequent consumption so this smaller different twist on classic Italian is just right for me.  I usually get the eggplant parm cause it is the best in the Valley, but wandered off the traditional path and had the featured sandwich, Aiello's House Salumeria.  All the ingredients complimented each other so nicely that the result is a masterpiece of a sang-which!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza! The owners are super nice and attentive. I highly recommend the pizza, salads and the tiramasu."}
{"text":"Great locally owned restaurant. Food is delicious and the bread is amazing. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best authentic Italian restaurant in Phoenix! Everything is truly delicioso! From the focaccia bread, to the roasted peppers (super Yum) to every entree - a culinary delight - especially on my birthday! Tiramisu was the ultimate Birthday treat and worth saving room for- trust me! Chef Joe Aiello and his wife Myrah treat you like \"la famiglia\" and make you feel as if you are dining with your newly acquired extended Italian family! Bravo Aiello's - your establishment is 5 Stars!! We will be back for many years to come!"}
{"text":"So, I live in the Tempe area but my friend said that this place was supposed to be good. So I hopped in my car for a good 32min drive to get there.

The inside was very romantic, especially when the sun went down. Candlelit. Classical music. Beautiful.

The wine was delicious. The bread and olive oil, which is spicey because they do put red peppers in, to start was wonderful. The food was super tasty and, because I'm a tiramisu person, that was also very delicious.

One of the cool things is both the owner and chef took the time to come out and say hi and make sure all the food was to our liking. They were both very friendly and seemed to be well liked by everyone there.

Then when our bill came (and I don't know if they do this every night), our waitress had us choose a number from 1-99 and if that number came out, our dinner, minus the cost of my glass of wine, was free. We didnt get the number but even so, our dinner was reasonably priced.

Definitely a great date night spot if your looking for a chill place just to relax and have great food with great conversation."}
{"text":"Good New York Italian with amazing sauce. I had the chicken parm and it was great. The owner also comes around to every table and introduces himself. He's also the head chef. It adds a nice personal touch. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, real authentic NY style. Best pizza we've had since we moved from Brooklyn six months ago. Joe Aiello's was truly genuine- coming out of the kitchen to meet and greet his guests, making sure you everything is going well just like a New Yorker!! Best Italian restaurant in Arizona!!"}
{"text":"I have loved Aiello's since day one! The food AMAZING!! Everything from the pizza to the pasta, salads, and sandwiches are delicious. My favorite is the spinach alfredo pizza or linguine with grilled eggplant and mozzarella. This place is definitely a must try if you are in the Moon Valley area."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood for Italian after a log day so we ordered it and had it delivered.  My wife got the tortellini alla panna and I got the chicken parmigiana.  We were both extremely disappointed in the lack of flavor and temperature of the food.  I got a notification of when the food was picked up and 8 min later it was at my door.  The food didn't have enough time too cool down to just above room temperature in that amount of time. My chicken was tender but it just tasted like fried chicken with tomato sauce dumped on it and covered with cheese.  There was no Italian seasoning to the chicken or the sauce.  The spaghetti wasn't warm and the menu showed it comes with potatoes croquettes and seasonal vegetables...apparently all potatoes and vegetables are out of season because they didn't make it to the house.  My wife's meal was very plain too.  Hers was cold and vapid. We also got standard bread that most Italian restaurant serve and that was cold and very yeasty. 

We got a couple of dessert to go with the over priced meal, Italian Cheese Cake and Tiramisu both were disgusting. The cheese cake didn't have any flavor except for a metallic flavor and the tiramisu tasted like it was a couple of days old.

Spare your taste buds and go to Olive Garden there food is much better than this place.  Honestly just got to the grocery store and buy a frozen Italian dinner it would have better flavor."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVED Aiello's.  I'm in the food business so appreciate  family owned and operated restaurants who care about not only food quality but their customers.    We were greeted warmly and met the owners while enjoying the most delicious meal.   I highly recommend the Fusilli with Seared Salmon.  A light cream sauce makes this a perfect choice for summer dining.  Aiello's also offers take-out.  What a wonderful find in the Moon Valley neighborhood."}
{"text":"This rating is strictly for the pizza. (Haven't had anything else). Love the pizza! I'm from the east coast and the regular cheese pizza here is pretty close to the good ole Italian pizza I'm used to from NY.  $20 for a pie. Wished they still had their liquor license. Nothing like a beer and a great slice of pizza. : )"}
{"text":"Ordered take out..food was ready when I arrived. Ordered Antipast, Eggplant Rolatini and the Spag & Meatballs....The portions where good size..the meatballs were large , creamy and good...could of used a little more seasoning but all in all very good ..The spaghetti was cooked perfectly...sauce was fresh and flavorful...I am looking forward to actually dining in ...great atmosphere small and and inftimate....In a town where I have struggled to find good Italian this is a great place"}
{"text":"Amazing place for the whole family. The owner himself, Joe, greeted us and even took our orders! He was very nice. The food was delectable, and they were very caring when it came to dietary or allergic restrictions. I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice family meals. Also the bread rolls are SO GOOD! Might I add we got a piece of Italian cheesecake on the house!"}
{"text":"Ate here after hearing Rick D'Amico (previously from Fox10) rave about this place several times. Maybe I just don't have an appreciation for East Coast Italian, but was just not feeling it. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't great...I guess I'm just used to the West Coast (San Francisco) Italian flair like my Grandfather used to make. My 3 biggest complaint: The restaurant temperature was on the warm side, the spaghetti was still watery and the salad was about one day away from being expired. However, the pork and veal meatballs were good and almost made up for the other complaints. The pizza was just ok and nothing to write home about. There was one other family dining at the other end of the restaurant and was so quiet, you could hear the hum from the refrigerator in the back. Really wanted to fall in love with this place as I love mom and pop joints, but this just isn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Friendly service, with Joe wandering among tables.  Nice wine options for a small restaurant.  Was able to create something that was not on the menu, which was nice.  Would certainly go again.  Was a nice evening."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go here again. Walking through the door the place is dirty at first sight. Someone needs to dust and mop. Everything had months old finger prints on it and the mirror behind the bar was filthy. I was wondering if what I could see was this dirty and run down, what did the things I couldn't see look like? 10 tables inside and about 10 tables on their patio. We stayed because we were meeting colleges.  Very few wines by the glass. There were 6 of us and 4 entrees came out together, 1 5 mins later, and one not at all. When the server apologized for the cook not making the entree our friend asked if he could just have come asparagus or any quick veggie while he waited. 10 mins pass and no veggie. By then we are done and he is pissed and it's getting awkward for everyone. After a long day working we were all starving and felt so bad about the situation. We joked that 3 different entrees all looked identical even though they were all different meats and veggies. Server didn't do too much to apologize or offer dessert. I believe she wanted us out of there.  He owner that came by when we were seated was of course MIA when things went wrong. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Aiello's was a terrific and reasonably priced experience.  The ambience was fun and pleasant.  It's reminds me of a small Italian restaurant in Brooklyn.  The service was prompt and attentive but they did not hover.  The veal picatta was delicious.  It was tender, pleasantly spiced, and a generous portion size.  The side of cheesy mashed potatoes that where deep fried was amazing.  The chicken Maria was a delight for the senses.  The owner Joseph is very friendly and warm. Aiello's is a terrific restaurant for a date or to bring your whole family."}
{"text":"What a gem! Superb food, excellent service and reasonable prices in quaint, friendly setting.  Such a welcome change of pace from the large chain restaurants! 
Our group loved the lobster ravioli, chicken & eggplant Parmesan and veal piccata entrees along with complimentary bread and roasted pepper spread.  Oh, if you have room, the tiramisu and profiteroles are delightful, too!
Check out this locally owned, impressive restaurant. You're sure to add it to your favorites list."}
{"text":"A casual relaxed dine in or take out, Salumeria Italian Deli. Street 7 & T-Bird.

Stopped in for the first time today. I have been craving real Italian for a couple months now. Aiellos is a small place and I am seeing plenty of excellent Italian culinary tradition.

The menu is quite extensive. All I am going to try today is the special. A stellar large roast beef, hero sandwich, featuring a golden toasted baguette and served with a fresh side salad of mixed greens placed on top of the meat, that includes tomatoes, red onions, and shaved Parmesan. $6. This sandwich was damn good. The beef was pink and lean. The bread was fresh and crusty. The pasta salad had noteworthy Italian cuts of meat. Everything was choice.

I also just realized this place will deliver. Now that's an Italian restaurant. 

Next door Joe and Myrah Aiello serve their pizza at Isa's Pizza. If your lucky, you get to chat with one or both of the husband and wife team and Joe will have slices of white pizza ready to go. Two slices and a coke $5.

{"text":"Great family run Italian restaurant. 
The calamari and lasagna were excellent.  
Their red sauce is as good or better then places like this in New York.  

The chicken parmigiana was good but the pasta portion was too small 

The service was nice. It's a small cozy place. I will return with my friends."}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews . I only write if it was really bad or REALLY good! And that's the case here! BRAD our server was GREAT! Nice and friendly which I like .  The food was EXCELLENT! I had the meatball sub and it came with a fresh spring salad. I can honestly say, I never had meatballs so good! I always try them if they are on a menu , it's one of my favorites even if I'm not having them , I will still order a single one. Plus I have been to little Italy in New York, I thought they were the best till now!  Anyway, my boyfriend had the chicken Caesar salad and said it was delicious. We will definitely be back and try more things. Pizza looked great will be ordering it soon and they deliver so that will be nice  can't wait to come back soon. EVERYONE should take a try! If I like it, you will too! I eat out a lot and very FEW times can I actually say I love it!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian spot, very much enjoyed the ambiance and the selection of fresh food. I opted for vegetarian pasta selections and the pinot was spot on. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area if they are looking for a well priced, large portioned, authentic and homemade spot in Moon Valley."}
{"text":"awful, they do not wear gloves when preparing foods
they put aluminum foil on the sandwiches when you cut the sandwich
the aluminum foil gets in the sandwich

THEY DO NOT WEAR GLOVES, GROSS AND UNHEALTHY."}
{"text":"As an East Coast 1st generation Italian, I was very excited to see a more casual version of Aiello's open very close to me, and on my way home from work no less.  I can tell this place will be trouble for my waistline.

Salumeria means a store that sells cold cuts, meats, etc.  Aiello's does that and more.  I've only had a sampling of their food so far and just based on the Sfogliatelle in the dessert case, I'm in love.

Caprese Paninni - absolutely delightful focaccia bread, fresh mozzarella, basil that smelled and tasted like it had just been picked and juicy tomatoes.  Divine.

Anitpasto Salad - real Italian meats and cheeses, not those weird little sliced bundles of rolled up American meats and cheeses like you find at other places.  This salad was peppered with whole slices of imported Italian meats and a beautiful blend of greens and artichoke hearts.

Arancini - OK, I love these!  My Mom used to make them occasionally so I was thrilled to find them on their menu.  It's delicious!  A huge stuffed ball of rice in tomato sauce.  Way too big for me to finish so I am enjoying it for breakfast as I type this.

Now, to the item that will most get me in trouble!
Sfogliatelle - In Italian this word means \"many leaves\" and that is what this pastry looks like. Some call it Lobster Tails..I call it by it's traditional name.  You have an option of two different fillings.  One is similar to cannolli filling...YUM.....the other is a sweet ricotta with citron...DOUBLE  YUM....  At almost 500 calories a pop, I'll really have to restrain myself or hit bootcamp twice a day!  Honestly haven't had Sfogliatelle this good since I left the East Coast.

Aiello's Salumeria, I will be back and am very much looking forward to it.  There's nothin' better than a little midweek Italian foodgasm!"}
{"text":"Just order take out to go. I ordered two meatballs and a small Caesar salad. I live two minutes away and when I got home my meatballs and sauce were cold and seemed not even cooked all the way through. First time and not a good impression"}
{"text":"Love this place,  I have never had a bad meal or bad service.  And the owner always comes around to make sure you are happy. If you like Calamari,  their appetizer platter is practically a meal, I get it with a salad. Try everything."}
{"text":"We visit Aiello's at least twice a month.  I am a creature of habit so I typically get the same thing every time....the Tortelloni.  Perfection!  My husband always tries something different.   We always do take out as this place isn't really set up to be a restaurant....it's a deli that serves some main courses.  This means we can get sandwiches for lunch and hearty meals for dinner.  The portions are huge and Joe's famous meatballs are no exception.  Recently my husband got the spaghetti and meatballs and said the meatballs tasted strange so he had me taste them but I thought they were great...and I'm the picky eater.  

The Aiello's are warm and inviting people and now know us by name.  They know I like extra alfredo sauce on my Tortelloni so I don't even have to ask anymore.  If you have a poor experience with Aiello's please let them know because they are very attentive to customer's comments and are anxious to make everything right for you.  If you think they should stock more desserts tell them.  If you are frustrated because they are always out of a certain item tell them.  They are not new to the Valley but the Salumeria, Isa's Pizza and Charr are new-ish to this part of town.  They run Groupons and Double Take Deals all the time and that may be one of the reasons they run out of some of the more popular items periodically.  You never know how many people will be redeeming those coupons in a week.  I think they are still getting comfortable with the demographics."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service on the other hand was not. Had a reservation for 8pm. Once we arrived there were 6 open tables. All employees were wondering around doing other things, and were too \"busy\" to check on the 10 people standing at the front door waiting to be sat. Finally after about 10 mins of being ignored they started seating people. Server was also very slow to get to the table and take order. Everyone seemed to be too busy talking to help the customers."}
{"text":"Went to Aiello on a Saturday night, which was busy, but they got us a table quickly. Menu options were good, but specials were very good. Antipasto of eggplant rolatini, which can be difficult to prepare, was very good. I should mention bread with an exceptional spiced olive oil was very flavorful. Loved the red pepperoncini. One of the specials that stood out, veal saltimbocca had a very good combination of flavors and texture. A regular entre, chicken parmigiana, was well prepared and came with a side of pasta that was slightly overcooked. OK, to me, the star of the show was dessert. Zabaglione, where can you find this? Worth the trip alone! Our server Claudia, was excellent, very attentive without being overbearing. A true asset to the restaurant. Good food, excellent service, well worth the trip from Scottsdale. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great little deli. Love the eggplant rollitini. Meetballs are not meaty enough for my taste.   Too much breading.  I don't use any in mine or meatloaf either!  They even sell huge cans of Italian tomatoes and olive oil."}
{"text":"Makes me feel bad to give a low review but the service is so unfriendly and the owner screams obscenities to apparent vendors from the dining room for all to hear ( this has happened in my presence more than 5 times, every other word f bomb, M F bomb C S bomb, G D non stop not the lighter stuff) with the exception of the pizza cook ( who apparently smokes, so you will easily identify who wrote this)who is a great cook and even better customer service oriented person.  Until today I ate at the Pizza side known as Isa's 4-6 times per week and have eaten in their restaurant side on four occasions.  Again the food is good, better than average, highly priced, ridiculously bad service making it not worth it.
I thought  I would continue with the pizza until today.  
Today was absurd.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place great day night, first time and will definitely be back.  The food was insanely delicious and the chef even came out and checked in us and the temperature of the food, the waitress was knowledgeable and very friendly, I can't say enough good things the music was calming and the decor was excellent.  We will definitely be back and recommended!!"}
{"text":"Arrived 7:30 on a weeknight. 3 tables seated. No one on the patio. The hostess asked if we had a reservation. OK. No, we didn't. She said it would be about 3 minutes - the remainder of the dining room was wide open. I guess they needed the time to set the table - I didn't pay attention.

No matter. Very friendly people. We've been here a couple times and I started with Aeillo's about a dozen years ago when he opened across from Uptown Plaza in a much bigger space. 

Owner/Chef Aeillo is a very jovial guy. He was there and came by the table to schmooze. 

The bread served with red peppers in olive oil is very tasty.

We had chicken parm which was cooked/breaded well. The cheese over top was flavorful and plentiful. We also had the lasagna which was very tasty. No room for dessert.

Portion sizes are very generous - take home box worthy. And the pricing is very reasonable especially given portion sizing. Service was friendly and not rushed. I guess there is a balance between wishing for beverage refills every couple of minutes and being left alone to enjoy a meal and dinner companion conversation. I thought our server did a fine job.

It comes down to expectations - I think an \"old world\" fine dining experience is what Aeillo's is aiming for. Old world, to me, means one aspect of the experience is for servers to be in the background. If you need something, catch a server's eye vs. servers nearly constantly at the table interrupting the flow established by the guests at a table.

About 1/2 way through our meal the other tables had emptied out. It was around 8. We started to worry that maybe they closed at 8? A quick online search and we saw they are open until 9. No one else came in after us. 

The ambience is quaint and tasteful. I don't know if the neighborhood location lives up to the demographic the decor and the menu of Aeillo's is aiming for. For a relaxing get-away to a cozy dining room serving very authentic New York Italian, Aeillo's is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Delicious! Food was incredible, service was excellent, owner came out to greet everyone, would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had not tried this place in years, or since the change from their deli format to restaurant. It's come full circle since then and we were blown away by the experience. The menu had great variety and is easy for vegetarians. The food was high quality and well prepared (we had the seared salmon and the eggplant rolatini). The ambiance was comfortable and the staff was very welcoming. There are many more things I'd like to try here and can't wait to go back. Wonderful old school Italian in the heart of Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and obviously made from scratch but I have to say what makes this a five star place is the fact that I called before hand and asked about things my daughter could have with her food allergies and he was beyond helpful. AND then when we went in his wife (I am assuming the owners) had already talked with him and helped me again navigate the menu!!! This is service and this is why I would recommend them to anyone looking for good Italian food/pizza."}
{"text":"I'm becoming somewhat of a regular at Aiello's because I simply can't get enough of the tortelloni: delicious, homemade pasta, delicate cheese filling, fresh peas, a bit of pancetta and a cream sauce to die for.  I recently introduced friends to the restaurant and got to try three other dishes.  All were well prepared, flavorful, and unique.  I have to admit, the carbonara may have rivaled my go-to dish.  Give this hole in the wall a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"4 Canoli's and 1 small (3 bites) Tiramisu-ToGo was $35. Raised in New York, grew up in Bensonhurst, I can say I'm extremely familiar with Italian Cuisine especially with Pastries.  Was craving some good Italian Pastries, drove by and figured I would give it a go, before I went in I checked out their website-ok-looks legit. I walked in, was given a friendly greeting= 1 star. I told the boy behind the counter I would like to order some pastries to go...he said oh pizza? What kind? Moving on..the menu was easy to read, nice setting, clean= 1 star, young lady at the counter was very informative, polite, smiles and all together great customer service=2 stars. Placed my order of 3 Canoli's and 2 Tiramisu's, to go/take out, balance total $34.98! ! ! Yikes! Ok, waited a few minutes, a man came out with a neatly tied up shopping bag with each pastry indivually boxed. Nice.=1star..total of 5 stars. Went home with my Mom and 7 year old all very excited.....which brings me back to the beginning of my review... they gave me the wrong amount of pastries. Fail! -2stars.  Listening to the customer is key. Given it should not be a big deal but without exageration the Tiramisu was literally 3 bites , it was a 2 inch square piece, for $6? I just spent $35, that's a lot for just 5 pieces of pastries. I'm going back to my old spot on Grand Ave. For that I can get pastries to last me 2 weeks.  Was so excited but now dissapointed. Didn't try the plated food, so maybe and I hope it's better. But unfortunately I'm not going back. Over 15 years in the food industry and if one area is lacking on the menu than its hard to hold the rest together...any menu should have items that can accompany any other item...just my opinion."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant. Everything I have tried has been to die for. They make a great sangria. We do low-carb and the eggplant appetizer with antipasto platter really hits the spot. This place is a real treat and super service."}
{"text":"Excellent place to go to. Our waitress Laura was great in taking care of me and my friend. The food overall is pretty good and not expensive. We loved our overall experience and we hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"If you are a lover of excellent East Coast Italian New York Food like Grand Ma used to make in her kitchen for the family; Then, this is your place! When I go it feels like a visit home. Everyone from Joe to Claudia make me and anyone I am with feel like part of their family. Over the years I have tried just about everything on the menu and every Pizza from their place next door. It has always been amazing. Everyone I have ever brought in for a meal has become a regular. That is how good it is. That is the level of quality there. And I am pretty picky about product and service in everything so If I am saying it is good then you know it has to be. Want to impress somebody take them here. But want to amaze yourself try them out. And I am so sure you will love this place here is my number to call me and thank me for sending you 602-373-9738 Craig."}
{"text":"The chef/owner is an Italian from NYC, he is awesome! Joe Aiello
He cooked me up a special pasta because of some dietary restrictions - rigatoni with mushrooms and sausage, lots of garlic, fresh basil and olive oil! Yummy! Thanks Joe!"}
{"text":"Meatball parm was like ground beef in a ball shape that tasted like meat paste. No stars this go round if I could. Stomach says -1 star."}
{"text":"Fantastic little Italian restaurant nestled in the corner of 7th st and thunderbird. I've been coming here for YEARS and the chicken parm gets better and better every time! And I always order the zabaglione with strawberries(to die for)! Joe and Myrah the owners always walk the dining room and chit chat with every table making sure everyone feels welcomed. If you haven't checked it out definitely do!"}
{"text":"I was extremely bummed when Market Bistro closed. Where would I get a great sandwich less than 5 minutes away? But then Aiello's opened here, and on the whole, from a tremendous fan of Market Bistro - from the month it opened -  I think it's probably an improvement.

Great people, great food, not just sandwiches (which are absolutely hands down first class. House Salumeria. Jesus H Christ.) but also great pasta and all sorts of other treats, and now pizza! 

And I don't need a goddamn fork for the salad I've got forks at home :D

I was there once and there was a very good looking eastern European lady outside having a coffee and smoking a cigarette. Reminds me of being in great places. But five  minutes from home. 

As a rule I don't go to \"burger restaurants\" besides Delux, since it's the original, nor do I go to anywhere with a name \"X: a YZ\" but after I learned that the people behind Aiello's also run Charr, which now occupies the space once home to venerable Market Bistro, I will have a try. That's two very significant personal prejudices overcome, just by the great cooking and good people at Aiello's."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed everything from Arancini appetizer, spaghetti with Vongole to Cannoli and French press coffee. The service was great! I'm of Sicilian descent and this was delicious, comforting cibo."}
{"text":"I am convinced that I have never had authentic Italian food until now! OMG I cant say enough about this place. I ordered Chicken Parmigiana and it was delicious, the noodles and sauce in the spaghetti were super fresh. The Chef (and I believe he is also the owner?) came by our table more than once to check on us but we were fine because our server was more than attentive and recommended great wine for me.  I will never go back to any other Italian restaurant as long as I live...well as long as I can help it at least lol. The pizza shop (Isa Pizza) on the other side was already our go to for amazing pizza, this place truly deserves all the great reviews. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place started off so promising.  Nice seats out in the patio, the server was friendly and listed their specials for the evening.  At that point, mostly everything went downhill.  Our drinks were never refilled and when they were (after requesting it for the 5th time - no joke), he'd bring our drinks and leave the empty cups on our table - by the end of the night we had about 12 empty cups on our table (party of 6).  Our entree's took ALMOST 2 hours to come out and this was after we already finished our appetizers - which by the way, we started a dirty dish pile at the end of our table since our server never picked them up.  The food was good, but by the time they arrived, most of us lost our appetite - and considering it was near 9:30 pm when they came out.  We had 2 tired kids who were done after sitting for 2 hours already and now had to wait for us to eat."}
{"text":"What a bummer... I thought I had found my nice little neighborhood Italian joint.... not even close. I order the pasta w/ clams... server informs me they're out of clams... we were the first customers of the day, go get clams before you open? So, I say I'll take the seafood pasta with calamari and shrimp.... yup... out of Calamari....Daughter orders Chicken Cutlets... ouch. Frozen, burnt , cardboard cutlets... I get the Gnocchi's in pesto... edible but not home made and drenched in pesto.  Wife ordered meatballs and pasta.  She liked the meatball, the sauce had that metallic not homemade taste.  Server was attentive but failed to ask us if we would like dessert, maybe they were out?? just brought us bill. Oh well..."}
