{"text":"The bartender was rude and acted too busy on a slow early Eve and was oblivious. With her back to us, she said I'm listening to you. When I asked about the raw oysters she said u can ordered 6,9 or 12.. Then she was incorrect...only 6 or 12. No offer of any kind.. When they came she said here u can look at the menu and see what is on the plate... She forgot never gave us napkins, silverware, plates and water.. Service was poor.  We taught her how to make a cocktail.. She could have looked it up and asked if that's  what we wanted. The recommended dessert was.. I ice cream on a toasted hot dog bun... Really? It was a pretty summer night and the service was so poor.. Not what I wanted at all! Go across the street.."}
{"text":"Paul was by far the best server I have ever had at this fantastic establishment I will definitely be back this time I'm going to bring my wife of 20 years for our anniversary"}
{"text":"I came here to order Clam Chowder. Usually I order it from Tide's Oyster Bar, but decided to give another place a try. BIG MISTAKE!! It was more like a bacon soup. If that's what I wanted to eat, no problem. Seriously, I don't care what anyone says. Bacon on clam chowder is just plain wrong. And it made is super greasy. Worst clam chowder ever!!!"}
{"text":"We went here craving a Crab Louie salad but were truly disappointed.  There was literally a spoon full of crab in the salad and the rest were carrots, celery, cucumber, and a tiny slice of avocado.  It was attractive to the eye but a rip off as far as price is concerned.  We also had a cup of chowder with very few clams.  We will not be ordering these two items.  I will stick to the fried shrimp that I normally order.  Just wanted something a little more healthy."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as was the ambiance. Wanted to give five stars but had to dock one for the server delivering our entrees while we were still enjoying our appetizers. We had specifically requested that they give us some time yet we found ourselves rushing to enjoy our meal while it was still warm.   I will go back again."}
{"text":"We ate here last night sitting at the bar,the food was excellent, absolutely loved it but the bartender was horrible, she was more concerned with preparing to close up than do her job, this was at 8 o'clock and they close at eleven. I own several restaurants and bars, she absolutely made everyone uncomfortable and completely ruined everyone's dinning experience, absolutely rude. One bad employee can ruin the rest of your good ones.  and keep good customers from coming back. I personally would solve this problem."}
{"text":"We love this place! Always love to see Jen working super fun & friendly, great service!"}
{"text":"Came here to try it out. Food and service was amazing.  Mac and cheese was a rare delicacy at a fish house.  Also Tasha and Matt, (I think are managers.) They were very attentive to the dining experience and made sure we were enjoying every aspect of Kings Fish House.  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Came from Hawaii to visit a friend working here. Wait staff and kitchen took care of us and made sure our food was made perfectly. We'll be returning here on out next trip to try new stuff on the menu.  5/5 for service and food quality"}
{"text":"I was the birthday girl in Jeff P's review.  I am  local and have been here many times with friends.  We always had great service and good food until then. What a disappointment, even the chicken fingers on the kids menu was so over cooked and dry you needed to dip them. Everything in his review was true.  The steamed claims even came without a spoon.  Our waiter seemed not to care about our concerns until I asked for the manager.   Seems they have made some changes to their menus and how items are served,  according to the manager.  No serving spoons but oyster forks are now on the table.  Hard to dish out claims with fork.  By the way the tongs for the salad were kitchen with nice rubber on the handles, easy to grip."}
{"text":"My kids treated me to dinner the week before Mother's Day and this place is superb. everything here is good from the food to the ambiance to the staff. Between the 6 of us we had steak and lobster, a cold platter with an array of shellfish, the fish tacos, the BBQ shrimp and their nut crusted white fish dish. Our server Ben topped it off. He gave us perfect descriptions of a few dishes, didn't ignore us or leave us drink less and had the most perfect demeanor that you'd want in a server. They've definitely gained return customers"}
{"text":"Jose was a great server! Food was awesome too. Tricia was also friendly, hospitable and welcoming as a hostess. We will return. Thank you."}
{"text":"I'm very pleased with the excellent improvements of our favorite neighborhood seafood joint! We have dined here six times since my last review and have had excellent food and service. I cannot be happier about this because we have been loyal Fish House customers since the opening and we will continue to dine here and bring friends and family. The food is consistently fresh, delicious, and high quality and the service is always very good!"}
{"text":"One of the best sea food restaurants in town. Had the Macadamia Nut Halibut and New England Clam Chowder. Seabass and their sour dough bread is also to die for. Our server, Stephanie, is the best, couldn't get any better. Very pleased. Our fifth time here. Will be coming back for sure. You won't be disappointed. Lewie & Rachel"}
{"text":"We just had a delicious meal at King's Fish House.  The King's Combo Platter and Wedge salad was yummy.  The Blue Cheese dressing was best I've had in a long time.  But, the best part of the meal was the impressive service we received from Jose!  He went above and beyond to make sure we had a good experience.  We will return!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! After living in the Pacific Northwest I feel like I know good seafood when I taste it. I almost never leave reviews, but this place deserves every star. Not only was the food amazing, but the service from our waitress, Anissa, took our experience to the next level. Plus the ambiance is really great to meet up with friends or for a date. I highly recommend this spot to anyone living in or visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Nothing memorable for sure. The service was slow too due to a large party seated next to us that required a lot of attention."}
{"text":"Food was average, our server was a nice & pleasant girl, BUT her service was VERY Slow OMG so slow!!! Only 3 party's in place, didn't check back with us, took for ever to bring second wine I asked for. Restaurants NEED to train their employees  especially if you're in the business & you expect service"}
{"text":"I'm sure it was probably just a bad day or a bad cook day and the service could have been much better there was literally about 5 tables I counted 13 servers   I still had asked for a refill and the food's extremely Bland for the money I was paying   you would think  it would be tasteful but no food just blend it tasted like nothing even the sushi - Seafood   And what's the deal with one slice of bread ... u would think u get enough butter for put on the bread .....  To think I waited so long to go there what a disappointment. .."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed our visit and will be back as soon as we can!!!!  My husband and I love coming to Kings because of the menu variety and fantastic service.......I would recommend the clam chowder, the sushi....most every roll is good, the spicy seafood soup, the BBQ shrimp app, and of course their drinks are fantastic especially if made by Tasha (server/bartender).  Tasha was extremely hospitable and friendly and she definitely knows her menu whether it may be food or drinks.  My husband and I prefer the Cadillac Margaritas because they are awesome!!!  Tasha made our experience memorable and fun.  It's nice when you have a server/bartender that has such a charismatic personality with knowledge of their menu....makes a better dining experience and easy to look forward to.     My husband and I will be back very soon I hope and hope to have Tasha take care of our dining experience once again."}
{"text":"First of all our server Karen was awesome. We are finicky orderers but Karen was patient and remained friendly throughout. My Ono was not as good as it had been at the orange Cali Kings, but it was okay. Artichoke seemed smaller than most. But service was excellent."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Our server Jose made sure that we were well taken care of & answered any questions we had."}
{"text":"Patient...Thank you!  I'm wanting to make the Important person Happy..  Her Father is Fisherman in Korea.  We Got Halibut and Fish  and  chips....Cost More, but I ...We .......Loved It!    Thanks for the Bread"}
{"text":"I have been here many, many times over the years and tonight's experience was the absolute best I have ever had - all thanks to BENJAMIN!  Fantastic server.  The service is always good, but this time it was memorable.  From the start, he made solid eye contact and took plenty of time with me.  Sometimes when you dine alone, it seems like servers are trying to get you in and out or they just simply don't check up often, however, that was not the case here!  I never felt rushed and forgotten about.  Also, he helped me pick out a tasty glass of wine based off of a very general description, made sure my food came out modified as requested, and even up-sold me on a delicious dessert.  The rest of the staff members were also very friendly and attentive.  Oh and as for the Southwestern Salad (with addition of blackened shrimp and tails off), to die for.  I will definitely be back and asking to sit in Benjamin's section again!!"}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant to dine in, it's a must with family and friends. Amazing atmosphere, great food and customer service. Would definitely recommend and always looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Kingfish House has always been our favorite place to dine. The food and service is always superb!! Thanks Jose for a great evening."}
{"text":"Kings Fish House is great, however, with servers like Tasha at the Henderson location makes it incredible. We can't wait to come in for GREAT food and EXCELLENT service."}
{"text":"Love this place, been coming for years and the service and food are always great! The oysters, calamari, rainbow trout are just a few of my favorites."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat at King's Fish house often. As it's just the two of us, we usually sit in the bar. Our most recent visit, we decided to sit in the outdoor, restaurant area. It was such a pleasant night, we couldn't be contained!  Their outdoor booths are odd to look at and slightly awkward to sit in. While they're cushy and comfortable, someone who's around 5'4\" (me) or shorter, might struggle with the dangling feet issue. It may sound strange, I like my feet planted on something - the ground, a bar, just for example - when I'm eating. Otherwise, I feel like a big kid, sitting at the grown ups table.  After coming to terms with the lack of foot rest for shorties, I realized they had their ceiling heaters on. It felt nice. Added to the feeling of fall.  Our waiter was sweet. She seemed to not handle multiple tables too well. However, my husband and I don't require doting - hence, why we sit in the bar. The waitress gave us an oyster suggestion, we took it. We weren't impressed with the size. Not the waitresses fault.  Husband ordered the rock fish with mac'n geese and garlic mashed potatoes. He loved the mac as it was gone in two seconds. I ordered the In-season Swordfish. It was a giant portion!  I asked for the remainder of my dish to be boxed up. Our waitress took my plate. We received our check; leftovers nowhere to be found. I enquired with one of the managers. Apparently my leftovers were mistakenly thrown away. The manager was mortified and ordered a completely new dish be cooked for me to take home! Two swordfish for the price of one!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner date with my lovely wife at this location. Our server, Ben, was awesome and should be recognized for his great service. Our food was spot on and our drinks were never empty. The manager, Erwin, stopped by to check on us just to be sure we were being taken care off. Great hospitality by both, Ben and Erwin, definitely a first class operation here!"}
{"text":"Who knew that a restaurant in Henderson Nevada could satisfy every single craving for Seafood of mine in one fail swoop!!  Starting with their Oyster Bar featuring every kind (at least a dozen) of oysters you could possibly want (the Kumamoto is my personal choice)...My absolute Favorite Dungeness Garlic Crab (which you'll find yourself dreaming about, trust me)...Fresh Lobsters (even complete with a clambake mind you) PLUS Some of the very best Sushi in town (and I consider myself a sushi aficionado) with a side of Yellowtail Carpaccio (what? get out of town!! lol).  Hands down the most extensive cuisine and menu  you'll ever find in Nevada! I'm so very glad I found it!! Makes me feel right at home!! I believe you won't be disappointed, props to Kings Fish House!!"}
{"text":"We love fish and it's hard to find a good fish place.  I always try the cioppino first at a fish place because it takes skill to make a good one.  My wife had the haddock.  My wife's plate was OK, but the haddock was overcooked.  I started out with the clam chowder and that was very good.  However, the cioppino with crab and shrimp was not very good.  The crab was so overcooked that it shrank and the meat tasted like rubber.  The shrimp still had the shells and was not fully cleaned properly and that was also severely overcooked.  That said, the clams and mussels were very good and the broth was flavorful.  The manager saw the problems and refunded our money for the cioppino, but I'm not sure we'll be back.  It's too bad, because they used good ingredients.  Unfortunately they had a cook (I can't call him a chef), that doesn't know how to cook fish.  We had really wanted to like this place a lot better...."}
{"text":"Oysters were wonderful! Service was amazing, Jose was endlessly helpful. He spoiled us with spectacular service. We sent an entree back because of a misunderstanding and Chef Mike came and hand delivered the refire which was cooked to perfection! Very classy gesture! Such care and attention from FOH and BOH! Thank you for making our evening out so enjoyable!"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner tonight to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. Paul absolutely made our experience. We will be back just for him."}
{"text":"It's just okay. Service was good but the food wasn't anything special. Definitely an expensive place to go dine out in the burbs. Don't expect anything to be stimulating taste buds. Wish The District had some better dining out options."}
{"text":"I love KINGS! I have visited quite a few of them now. They have great complimentary hot toasted sourdough bread and butter ! And the clam chowder, my whole family loves it! The N'awlins barbecue shrimp is definitely one of the best dishes, comes in appetizer or as and entree which is cool. Always polite, efficient service."}
{"text":"Every time they change their menu, I always fall in love with a new dish.  The salmon carpaccio melts like butter in your mouth.. accompany it with a little ponzu sauce and you have yourself a little slice of heaven. I could probably run through about 3 of these alone so I definitely wouldn't recommend for sharing"}
{"text":"Wow! What a change!  The last time I ate at Kings was over two years ago. We'd been loyal and frequent customers since they'd opened, nearly 10 years prior. And over that time, the quality dwindled -- portions were smaller, servers turned over almost monthly, food overcooked or undercooked. Truly dreadful.  HOWEVER, we went back having heard they'd updated the decor. They did much more than that. Salads are back to decent portions, sides that are runny (like spinach) are served in separate bowls so they don't make the rest of your meal soggy, the fish was wonderful, and the server was friendly and efficient (and said she'd been there almost two years).  I'm so glad to have this one back in my regular restaurant rotation!"}
{"text":"I have dreaded trying this restaurant because it had some really bad reviews. One day I was in the area and decided to explore this restaurant. Let's just say, I really love the interior design of this place and I like the options you have for seating. You can sit at the drink bar, the sushi bar, the restaurant, or the patio.   The service isn't the best at this place, but the food is absolutely amazing. If you like seafood, this restaurant offers a wide variety of dishes that are made to you liking. To starts things off, I had one of each type of oyster. I never knew how many types of oysters you can eat until I came to this place and each and every one of them were extremely fresh and tasty. Next, I had an order of steam clams. I was blown away by how much was given in an order and how flavorful the broth was. I also had an order of blackened catfish with mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. Everything on this dish melts in your mouth with extremely delicious flavor, I highly recommend it.  The side salad was the only thing that I didn't like about this place. It was over $6 for a side of salad and it had a strange taste to it (I wouldn't recommend eating anything other than their fresh seafood).   I can't wait to come back to this place, I still have yet to try their sushi items."}
{"text":"Great dinner and the best server!  Jose was outstanding.  Really on top of things and made us feel like we were his only customers.   Great job Jose."}
{"text":"My in-laws live in Henderson and love King's. Recently they celebrated their anniversary and my husband and I surprised them and drove up from SCV for the evening and to take them to dinner.  They had made reservations at King's and when I called them from the St. Rose Offramp, they added us to the reservation. They are old, lol,so they eat dinner early which was fine. We got to dinner at 5 pm. It was a Wednesday and the restaurant was pretty empty. The restaurant is in a great shopping center with lots of parking. It is really beautifully arranged. The outdoor seating area is lovely and the inside is even better. Our waiter was attentive, drinks were kept full, the food was good. We got bread and calamari and the BBQ' d shrimp as appetizers. Everything was fresh and tasty, the best was the sweet, spicy sauce that was with the shrimp. I dipped the bread, the calamari and the shrimp in it. We couldn't get enough. For entrees-The salads were huge, my sushi was delicious, the swordfish was a little bland, but the shrimp appetizer made up for that. Because it can be ordered as an entree as well, the next time we are in Henderson, we will be back. After you eat, the little shopping center is a fun and interesting stroll. Check it out."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place many times & never decided to try it out. Don't know why. The service was very good. We sat outside, which was nice with the weather cooling down. The California Roll was excellent. The strawberry shortcake, may favorite dessert, was OK. It came with hard crunchy biscuits. I would've preferred it with something softer, like pound cake. The butter cake was so good & I'll be back for that. My one gripe was that their appetizers were priced like a full-sized meal and there wasn't a huge variety."}
{"text":"The server was great!! Awesome even. Now the bar at happy hour was something else interesting. Even though you have a  table you must pay and eat over at the bar.. service was rushed. The server saved the day, following me to my table with my order which I paid for over at the bar. Thanx!!! Food was excellent!! Fresh and seasoned perfectly. That's some good eatin' lol. The server at the table,the food made me forget about the nonchalant service at bar.. I still left them a hefty tip. Even though I was forgotten and passed over. Again I will go there again. Hopefully different staff will be there in the bar."}
{"text":"Ben was the best waiter I've ever had in my life. He's funny and nice. He also didn't buckle under pressure due to how busy it was when we first came in! Food was also great. No complsints"}
{"text":"Well maybe its just me, since I'm from the Midwest. Where food reigns KING. But if anyone thinks this is King? Has to never have been to a real Fish House. In fact the best Fish houses I have been to are in the Pacific Northwest, and the Atlantic Northeast. Midwest maybe a number 2 or 3 on the list. So when I went here, even on a busy day, it looked pretty quiet on Mothers Day. Nothing compared to Lucille's next door, where you had to wait 1 hour to get in. Here was right away. And I think I know why. The food was one of the worse I had for a sea food. In fact even I saw the pics here on Yelp posted of what I mean. Good example. Look at the Fish Fillets Pics. They all have fake grill marks on them. Just like what McDonalds does and puts on their Chicken Sandwich. These are basically painted on with Indentations from a press machine even to look real. But you can't fool a real food critic. Service was kinda slow. We were missing one place setting for 5, and we waited about a 1/2 hour before the waitress could be told. Because after she served us, we never saw here again until dessert time was needed. I ordered the YellowFin. Wife ordered the Fish and Chips. Kids, Burger and Fries. Mine tasted a little blan. And watery. Had also a heavy fish taste. Usually this means it is older fish. Not to mention the fake cross patch grill pattern on the fish. Actually McDonalds Fillet-O-Fish tastes much better. My wife almost tossed the plate out. Even the Cole Slaw was a watered down version of cabbage something. I don't know what it was. We both almost tossed the plates out then. Even the price was way too high for the quality food. And I would pay a fortune for good food here in Vegas. The kids enjoyed the burgers and fries. About the only good tasting thing was the fries and the garlic potatoes. Now. We aren't that picky either. But the food here is not too great in a sense. Maybe a 3 out of 10 kinda deal. My wife even said, maybe I should show the chef how to make a good fish. Say a huge Catfish stuffed with Cilantro and Spices of the Orient that would make any customer come back again and again. So our laugh was maybe they don't have a real chef here. Maybe high school kids cooking in the back, like they do at Mc'D's. And all prepared foods you just Microwave, or deep fry here and there. One will never know. Now the Decor is a little better to mention. And we enjoyed the ambiance. But if anyone said this place had good food, Knows nothing about food, let alone seafood! Never trust a person who reviews a place that has no experience in food. We know food. We even have a successful Youtube Channel on it and recipes. And we have one very very close relative who is a Chef to a real King. A dedicated Chef to a Monarc King Overseas. And he taught us well about food. And how to prepare and research it. He still does daily! And yet we aren't picky! Go Figure! But this place is no King for Fish or Seafood. More like a Peasant in the Seafood arena. I think it has potential though. Can be really big. If just one day, the owner would wake up and read the real reviews. And stop looking at a empty restaurant, and wonder why? Let me tell you. If your next store restaurant has a waiting list 1-2 hours long, and you have empty seats on a holiday. Something needs fixing! Wake up! And fix the food, not just remodel the place!----------Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went in the other night with my boyfriend and had Paul as our server. Service was AWESOME! He was very knowledgable and able to help me find something on the menu even though I have allergies. Food was great and it was a nice atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing evening out. We didn't have to worry about our drinks getting refilled and the food tasted great."}
{"text":"Super great place. Delicious food, great drinks, great atmosphere and a wonderful view of the districts. Great for people watching! Will definitely go here again and bring our friends. Our waitress Karen was super helpful and sweet too"}
{"text":"Consistent and comfortable. A go-to for me for several years. Dine outside if possible. Natalie is to be commended. AlwAys great service with her."}
{"text":"We decided to try Kings Fish because we saw some open tables. When we ask for a table for 4, we were told there was going to be 20-25 mins wait, bec all tables were taken. The hostess told us to wait at the bar. Right after we ordered our drinks, they called us and told us our table was ready. Such a good business tactic. We ordered 12 oysters and got 11, we told our server about it and she gave us the missing one. The oyster tasted fresh and good. We also ordered lobster, wahoo, salmon carpaccio and some rolls, all the food was delicious and our server was nice to us."}
{"text":"Not impressed, food was sub par and for the price... not worth it. Halibut was not seasoned well and not flakey."}
{"text":"Friend and I had a lovely lunch here on Saturday. Beautiful Patio! Our server Tyler was super attentive, when I mentioned to my friend that I wasn't drinking today, she asked me if I liked Ginger beer? I said I do and she described a non alcoholic drink with ginger beer, lime and cucumber. It was super! I also took her recommendation of the Seabass with an Asian sauce over bok choy and mushrooms. My friend got what he always gets, the salmon and wound up wishing he had the Seabass too after trying it! Great service!"}
{"text":"I'm afraid I'll bore you, because I can't specifically rave about one item, but I know that my tastebuds do a happy dance each time I dine here. The staff is courteous, the place is clean and there are a lot of menu items.  What I really love about them: Outdoor seating and open layout (especially after they've updated).  What is so-so for me: Their salads (but then again, when was the last time you raved about a salad?).  I always have a good hearty meal and the service is always key. The last time I went, my order was slightly incorrect when the runner brought it out. My waiter took one look at it, shook his head in a lighthearted way, and fixed it immediately before I could say anything - that was key for me and why I continue to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in again on my way through town and it did not disappoint!!!!! Started with the poke appetizer and it's hands down the next Poke sauce ive ever had. They put it over sushi rice for us instead of wontons. Macadamia nut crusted halibut and homemade mac and cheese always hits the spot, my husband ordered filet and tail with asparagus and loved it all. Our server was attentive but not overwhelming and the manager swung by to check in. Didn't save room for dessert but maybe on our way home!"}
{"text":"Great food and exceptional service! The signature crispy rice tuna sushi was the best and probably the least expensive thing we ordered although everything else was great. Karyne was attentive and very nice to add to the great food. Definitely going back before we leave."}
{"text":"I have been to Kings 3 different times since moving to the area 1 month ago. Karyne has been my waitress twice and the other time I sat at the bar. First off, their sourdough bread is delicious. Second, Karyne has gone over the top for my family and I with all of our needs and she does it all with a smile on her face. I would highly recommend this restaurant. If you like whiskey, their Old Fashioned is superb. If you like a little bit of BBQ with a spice, I would recommend the sautéed nawlins BBQ shrimp. If you go in and Karyne is working, I would try to sit in her section again! Thank you King's for delicious food and drinks, oh yeah and the great service!"}
{"text":"Just came home from enjoying a wonderful meal at Kings with good friends. Our waitress Scarlet was terrific - attentive, funny, made great suggestions, and overall enhanced our evening. Food was delicious, fresh, well seasoned and cooked as requested. Since they renovated - and we suspect more than just the decor (which we feel was a great improvement!) - we have come here to dine more in the last six months than in the past six years.  Tonight was another great experience, sitting outside to enjoy the weather and people watch, and Kings has risen to one of our top ten restaurants to dine at."}
{"text":"Alex our bartender, also our server at our booth in the bar was fantastic, probably the best that King's has ever had.  Immediately got us our drinks, bread, took our order & thanked Dad for his service on Veterans Day 11.11.17.    King's doesn't give any kind of Veterans discount, which was disappointing, but Alex made up for it w/ exceptional service.  Thank you!    Great personality & right on top of everything such as the A1, extra ginger & side of avocado.  I ordered the Sake Sashimi, Yellowfin Tuna Tataki Sushi.  Mom's Fish n Chips w/ Fries were great & dad's Top Sirloin was cooked perfectly, as well as the grilled asparagus.  The Spinach was a bit salty.     We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So we were in the area with visiting friends and decided we wanted fish for dinner. Being new to Vegas myself I only knew of Bonefish Grill which is a chain restaurant and also has branches in Chicago (where I moved from).  Decided to go on Yelp and found Kings Fish House was only minutes away so ok we're in.  Walked in and restaurant was clean and simple but warmly inviting. Found out they recently remodeled.  Wow this place has it all sushi, fresh oysters and lots of fish options. My hubby and I ordered 1/2 dozen raw oysters called \"Naked Cowboys\" we've had them before in Chicago and really loved this meaty tasty Atlantic coast variety they did not disappoint!  Our Friends ordered the clam chowder which was tasty And loaded with clams. Then fish tacos and crab cakes. Tacos were loaded with fish and crab cakes were delish. My hubby ordered the seafood Cobb salad it was huge and he enjoyed it and left him full. For me I was quite surprised to find Sand Dabs on the menu as they are quite hard to find. My mom had them in California years ago and she still raves about them so HAD TO HAVE THEM.  They were lightly breaded pan fried with a touch of lemon. Well now I understand why my mom still talks about them. They are a very mild fish with a delicate flavor. All of us left very pleased and full. Mom and Dad are coming to visit in a few weeks so we're definitely going to take them there and surprise mom with Sand Dabs. This place is s little far as I live near Summerlin but definitely worth the trip. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. Seafood is fresh. Had their clam scampi and fried Jumbo scallops."}
{"text":"Waited a bit extra for an outside table. Well worth it, tables just outside were great for us with the baby, high booths are not practical for kids.  Still get some people viewing and close enough to the a/c to be comfortable.   Kids burgers, good and plenty, kids salmon was great, Large Sushi Platter was great for sharing and delish, scallops from Long Island were sweet and prepared just right.  Overall the food was a 4.5.  oh and the banana pudding and the Creme brulee finished everything off perfectly.   Super friendly staff that really went out their way for us.  Gaffnir was awesome and nailed it.   We are high maintenance and he managed right through it with a breeze.  No blender and espressos machine was broke.  No worries about the blender but let's fix the espresso machine.  Great experience,  we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Kings for first time yesterday, We sat in the patio and the atmosphere was awesome,,,food was great, the soft shell crab was incredible. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This local seafood place is better than any seafood restaurant we have been to on the strip (especially the seafood one at aria). The shrimp cocktail was the best we have had. The oysters were perfect. I can see why the halibut is the most popular item. If you order anything- that would be my suggestion. My father in law from Indiana \"only likes catfish and fried shrimp\". Even he loves the halibut. The mac n cheese is so yummy too!"}
{"text":"One of my go to spots in Henderson. I've eaten here over 6-7 times and it's always consistently good. I love their kumamoto oysters and clam chowder to start. I usually get the crab legs with mashed potatoes and I try my best to save room for dessert because if you have a sweet tooth I'm telling you, they have the BEST desserts!!! The butter cake is to die for, literally die... it's so good, I don't even like cake but I love this butter cake. At least I think that's what it's called... it might have a different name but if you say butter cake I'm sure they'll know what you're asking for. They also have the fluffiest most delicious cheesecake. Honestly I think it's so random that their dessert are so good. But I really recommend it! I'm drooling as I write this review."}
{"text":"Ambience here is fun and inviting. We sat outside and had quite a lot of fun talking and sharing food. I guess if we had sat inside, it would have been hard to hear each other. The food was great, we ordered all meat dishes, and we really liked it overall."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time based on the Yelp reviews. Loved our apps-NE chowder and a crunchy crab roll. And the speciality beers we picked out were pretty amazing-however, dinner was a little off for me. I ordered the shrimp and scallop combo with grilled asparagus. The scallops were one-note, but the shrimp tasted horrible; it had a nasty, dirty seafood taste. I made mention of this to our waitress and she brought it up to the kitchen. Took me two more beers to get that taste out of my mouth, and it ruined my appetite for the night. The service was great and we really enjoyed the ambiance; just will try something different next time."}
{"text":"This used to be a wonderful place to eat. Since their remodel, the place looks cheap and the food has gone downhill. Some of the salads are still good, but in general, it's not as good!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Kings to have an amazing dinner. If you ever have a fish craving this is the place to go. I never in all the times visited had a bad experience. I love the different assortment of fish you can get. It is always fresh.   Today I had the salmon. It was cook to perfection. Andrew was my server today. He was very kind and gave really good suggestions. He always kept checking back on me. Not once was my drink ever empty. He was very fast and gave excellent service. He was always smiling and moving around.  The manager named Jose, stopped by my table to see how everything was. He also was very professional and friendly. He also as well always had a smile on his face. I had a couple of questions that he had all the answers to. I really liked how he was out on the floor at all times and was going around to the tables to see how everything was going. I also liked how when he was going around checking on the the guest he would also help the servers out.  Will definitely return and ask for Andrew."}
{"text":"Such great oysters in the half shell and service, a little pricy, but worth it. We also loved the sea bass and oysters Rockefeller."}
{"text":"Oh my, where do I start?  Seafood.  Fish.  Great bartenders who know what a real drink is.  Wait staff who know their product. Oysters and clams as good as any raw bar you've ever seen.  Great ambiance and reasonable prices.  They went under renovation a month ago and we almost went through withdrawals.  When you have to have a cold seafood platter, you just have to have it, and this is the only place.  Bottom line: great seafood in a great atmosphere with a great staff.  Go!"}
{"text":"About a month ago my husband and I changed our diets to pescitarian and have been on the search for new places to call staples. This has been added to that new list. Parking can be tough because the surrounding area is always busy,  but it is worth it. The place has a great atmosphere and lots of seating. The decor is not overwhelming like some restaurants.  Service has been great the two times we have been here so far.  I have ordered the Crusted sea bass both times. The meal came with two sides and I have to say I am obsessed with their summer grains! Their buttered corn is pretty good too. People we have been with have tried their fish and chips, blackened wild salmon and their shrimp, everyone really enjoyed them all. Desserts have been pretty delicious as well and have included the creme brulee, bread pudding and chocolate cake. No complaints here! So many things to try on the menu. We have some friends coming in to town this week, I am sure we will be bringing them here for dinner."}
{"text":"The place looks cool, our server was good. The cocktails were great. We had the 3-4 person order of seafood platter for $75. It was the most pathetic looking platter.  It was garnished with seaweed and tiny, unpeeled cocktail shrimp for an illusion of substance but everything was subpar. Tiniest, driest mussels I've ever seen, missing clams, unbelievably tiny lobster tail (size of a large shrimp). When addressed, our server was embarrassed and the manager did comp our drinks which was nice. I'm certain we are not the only people who've brought their subpar food to their attention. I think the restaurant needs to spend less on the decor and the facade and pay more attention to the quality of food. I'm never going back there."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Kings. It's a casual dining environment and the food is always great tasting with fresh options and good flavor. I find it odd that there are so many \"farmed\" options as it seems this is a very unhealthy way to eat fish; however, there are several fresh options as well. The sand dabs are not on the menu but a great option- crispy Parmesan crusting on light fish. The portions have dwindled but it's still good.    The single thing that varies drastically is the service. As with any place, service can make or break an experience dining out.    The service at the bar has been quite poor on a few occasions- I honestly felt as if I was bothering someone by being there.   Ben is a phenomenal server- request his area!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a few days and our friend that lives here said this place is really good. Now when this friend tells me that a restaurant is really good, she better make sure it is really good as she knows I work in the food industry. Well well well! My friend was right. Service was outstanding and the food. Man the food was ridiculously awesome. I love the macadamia nut crusted halibut. Man super moist and flaky. Just melts in your mouth. Everything, i mean everything was outstanding.  Keep up the good work king's fish house. You have got another repeat customer for life."}
{"text":"I really hope the district manager sees my review and the others who mentioned about the wait time for their food. RIDICULOUS wait time to get our food! Over an hour! Really?! You pay $30 a plate and you have your customers wait over an hour to get their food. I realize that it was a Saturday and there were a lot of people but it was not that packed! Peoples wait time to get seated was not even 15 minutes!   Once we did receive our food it was lukewarm and cold! The manager that was on duty last night (4-21-18) could careless and was so nonchalant. If it wasn't for me that made an issue about it we probably wouldn't have comped our food. Still not sure how much he did comp since we only saw that total price.   The only good thing about the experience was Ramsey our server. He was excellent! Was able to bring out my 3 year old boys food before ours as he knows little kids can't always sit still. Thank you Ramsey for going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a late dinner last evening. The place is beautiful! My honest opinion is that you overpay for underwhelming food and portion size. The seafood chowder was tasty at $6/cup. The Lg sushi platter for $31, consisted of 2 rolls and about 5 pieces of sushi of mediocre quality. Our server (Deborah) also didn't bring us silverware/napkins until the sushi platter arrived and I asked for it. We had already eaten soup without napkins, and buttered our bread with chopsticks. I see no real reason to return."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to come for seafood. Today we sat in the bar and had the best server ever! Jose took great care of us, was very pleasant and made sure we had everything we needed. Thank you Jose for making our dining experience fantastic. We will return"}
{"text":"awesome food and great service.  very prompt and  professional.  the waiter was from Dana Point and knew the menu with great recommendation plus knew the wine menu.    very clean and loved the trout!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review before. But our service yesterday was so great, I had too. I wish I could remember our servers name. She was so attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. We ordered the warm artichoke appetizer (so good) my fiance got the crab cakes (which he loves) we had a few white sangrias. Which they make too order, delicious. Server also brought out theeeeee most delicious dessert for my daughters 2nd birthday! Omg! So so good.   Will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"The fish and chips were the worst I have ever had. There was so much batter on them that it was hard to find the fish. Unfortunately, I wish I had not found the fish inside, because it was mush.  My companion's fish dish had hair in it. Never again."}
{"text":"This was the first time that I have been there. Went there with my family. The decor was beautiful and the restaurant was very clean. The service was fantastic and I don't remember the name of our waiter but he was very nice, polite, and did a great job of pointing out the specials and other great menu items. Needless to say the food was outstanding and absolutely delicious. I will definitely go back to this place again. I highly recommend it. A plus on everything about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Chef was rationing Shrimp & Crab today! Ordered the \"Louie Shrimp & Crab Salad,\" mostly red onion, carrots, cucumber & lettuce, very, very few pieces of shrimp & crab. Really a let down because I did order (2x) before and it was loaded with the \"good stuff\", avocado,lump crabmeat, jumbo shrimp-pieces . Not sure what was going on today but it was not worth $20.00!"}
{"text":"Waiter Jose was Amazing! Very attentive, food was excellent. Atmosphere was very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Pleasant server, nice patio dining. Overlooked scallops (presented with burned side down) over cooked dry shrimp. Salmon was decent. Not great for the price."}
{"text":"Great grilled fish. Creative coctails. Loved halibut and scallops. Awesome outdoor seating. Will go again for sure. Fried fish didnt look tempting...so we did not order.."}
{"text":"Delicious! Where else can you still get trout almandine done to perfection? The staff was friendly and helpful, especially Paul. If you have to wait for the food awhile, it's well worth it.  Now I don't eat oysters, but several people were gobbling them up so I'm assuming they are also very good here. We'll be back soon! Thanks."}
{"text":"King's Fish House is easily my favorite lunch and dinner spot in Henderson! It's the perfect date spot! Sit on the patio and ask for Jose....service is amazing, food is fantastic and our server was very knowledgeable and he went above and beyond!!!"}
{"text":"The new renovations are beautiful! The fish is fresh, the service is great (Alex at the bar!!) and it's a comfortable place to grab food and drinks. Outside seating and a separate dining room for family dining. The only negative was there was a baby in the bar, when the dining room had many open tables."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the district, Green Valley Ranch, the outside is really pretty with lots of flowers and a patio. I took my mom and 3 of her friends here for her birthday. I had crusted salmon & spinach as a side which was delicious and the perfect amount of food for lunch. The entire inside has been remodeled and it looks beautiful, comfortable, clean and upscale. The people I was with had south west chicken salads & sushi. I think it was priced good, with some of these ladies drinking wine! The best part was we had a really good server, Vivavanh, who was smiling the whole time and happy to see us, which makes all the difference. She gave us time to talk and was around when needed, but not hovering over us too much. The food is always good!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite seafood stop! Their BBQ shrimp is out of this world! I recommend it to anyone who wishes to bite into a piece of heaven.  The service is exceptional, our server Jose made my husband's birthday one to remember.   We are definitely making this one of our regular stops"}
{"text":"Ok good, but defently does not justify the price! The service is Good! And the atmosphere is very nice. I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"We have been going to King's for years and years. The food is always great, reasonable prices and the ambiance is beautiful and inviting. The service is usually pretty good but this last dining experience I just HAD to Yelp. We had Debra as our server. She is beyond on the ball, it's mind blowing. She pays attention to detail and one can tell she really enjoys  taking care of her customers. She greeted with a warm smile, made sure drinks were always full and made sure our food was to our liking. But it didn't stop there. We had our two children with us, so she took our young boys (8yrs old and 3 yrs old) to where the lobsters were. She took one out, made it do little tricks and shared some knowledge about lobsters that were very interesting and informative! Her customer service is above and beyond!!! Hoping to get Debra as our server from here on out, such a fabulous server and woman!!! The manager, Erwin, cane around as well, introducing himself and making sure our dining experience was to our liking. He noticed our food was taking a bit too long to our liking, so he made sure we received it promptly! Such an involved manager who takes care of his customers. King's is phenomenal!!! We have been dining from years, and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"We sat in the bar area on a Thursday evening. The restaurant was about 40% full. There were 5 of us.   The place was was very impressive in size. The menu was huge and seemed to have everything. It had too many options in my opinion- but that's just me. It took the whole table awhile to figure out what we wanted.   We started with cocktails - they were ok. Their \"Cadillac margarita\" was sweet and lacking tequila flavor. The spicy blood mary was very good. They seemed to put an emphasis on sugar forward in drinks that used sugar. No one raved about their drinks that night except for me with the creole Bloody Mary.   The food- the sides dwarfed the fish in the entrees  The crab cakes were bland and mediocre.  The scallops were good- not overlooked but nothing impressive. Just grilled scallops  I ordered the halibut- server recommended blackened so I went with that. It arrived grilled. I at first thought it was just weakly blackened.  The fish was dry and just plain bad. When I asked the server if this was the blackened she said no, and offered to exchange it.  It came back 15 minutes later when everyone was done. This piece of fish was moist and well prepared.  No apology, no acknowledgement of the mistake. Nothing. Very poor customer service on their part. I own a restaurant and I'm very forgiving to mistakes. The lack of an apology was lame. You pay a premium in a restaurant like this for the experience, which they did not provide.  Overall a very expensive restaurant for the experience.  Felt more like an Applebee's than a high end fish house."}
{"text":"Thank you Natalie for the great service tonight She was amazing and very personable. Congratulations on your 5 year anniversary  She is a keeper!!!!!"}
{"text":"I made an Open Table reservation for 7:15 PM and we were shown to our table right on time by a friendly Hostess. The establishment is spotlessly clean and it is obvious that the wait staff has been professionally trained. There is a varied menu with only the most popular and fresh seafood items along with a few meat dishes.  We ordered the mussels with avocado which I have to strongly recommend to anyone visiting King's Fish House. The multiple depths of flavor are extraordinary and it had to be the best mussel dish I have ever experienced. We also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass which was absolute perfection.  Service was 5 stars. I enjoyed my dinner so much that I already have a lunch reservation for the end of this week.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"When you go..  Ask for server Kelsi!!  Great service and knowledge.  It's in the middle of the district on Westside of Green Valley Parkway."}
{"text":"I wanted to like the place but the food was mediocre. It was mad busy on Saturday evening. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful.   The food. I got the spicy seafood soup and that was not well seasoned. It said spicy but it wasn't spicy at all. I also got seared albacore salad. It was blah. I had to ask for more dressing.   My friends loved their food though. So who knows..."}
{"text":"We came in 30 minutes before closing and Debra was so accommodating and amazing. Thank you for the great food and great atmosphere. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I gave this place a 5 star rating last time I was there. The seafood and service was great. This time the seafood was also great but the waitress, although very pleasant, needs to be trained. In the middle of my meal she asked if my wife wanted a box? And shortly thereafter she dropped off the check?"}
{"text":"Awesome food and a great atmosphere. Our server Casey was absolutely amazing.  Highly recommend the baked mussels. Just enough spice and the selection on the menu was really nice ."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in the food and service.  The Mexican nut crusted sea bass was dry and warm.  It tasted as if it had been reheated.  The brussel sprouts were not fresh, they had no flavor and were crusty.  The waitresses were not friendly.  A big disappointment for a $100 meal.  The best part was the bread and wine."}
{"text":"We went again today after a graduation, and got almost the same exact meal. We didn't specify for the fish to be well done, and I just wasn't happy. HOWEVER, our server Danielle, and the rest of the staff was so stellar that we will still go back. Just top notch, and since both of us have worked in the service industry previously, we recognize wonderful when we see it. Thanks Danielle and the rest of the staff!"}
{"text":"The menu alone...wow! So many great choices that you can't go wrong.  If you plan on going Friday or Saturday night, it does get busy so I would recommend a reservation so you don't wait a great while.  I had the N'awlins BBQ shrimp and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food at King fish house is very fresh.  The chefs know how to cook. The service is attentive, specially if your server is Paul. He goes the extra mile to take care of you.   Thank you everybody, I really enjoy eating here. :)"}
{"text":"Jose was a great and accomidating server!!! Totally made our night. We will come back!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Very consistent, the food is great every time we go! Great price for the fresh seafood you get.  I highly recommend, I do not cook and come here at least once a week! I have never had bad service! Try the hazelnut crusted Halibut it's Devine;)"}
{"text":"Don't know how this place is rated so high. I got a clam linguine and the taste is like nothing! I have to put salt and pepper......linguine tastes try and no favor at all. Service is okay. My coworker ordered grill yellowtail and he said it is good. So I guess they just are just not good at making linguine maybe..  Not going to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing yummy seafood! The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because they are so over priced. I can buy the same king crab and cook it at home for less than half their cost. And...Tilapia and catfish are $20 for a small piece of fish. You would have to be crazy to pay that much for bottom of the barrel fish. I enjoyed my experience and my food was delicious, but I will not be back anytime soon to pay $120 for 1lb of king crab, a sushi roll and a small piece of Ono."}
{"text":"We went to dinner even after a warning from friends who ate there yesterday. They wished us good luck being served within an hour- they were right. After waiting for our food, the sides were cold and the fish was dry and over cooked. After complaining, we got a lack luster apology from the manager. I blame management- he was clueless as to what was going on in the restaurant and unavailable. You'd think the time stamp on the orders would catch his attention."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit over priced for what you get. The food is ok but not great. I've eaten here a few times and had about the same experience every time. The location is good but if you're looking for seafood or sushi don't expect top quality."}
{"text":"We came here for my wife's birthday with our best friends. Everyone ordered something different and we all loved it. We started with the oysters, which were lovely. The staff was very nice and attentive. The various fish seemed very fresh and the sides were tasty too. I'm writing this review long after our visit, but it's a night we still remember fondly."}
{"text":"Dined here on Friday nite.  We were greeted at the door by a lovely young lady who promptly seated us.  In no time at all our server was by to suggest a fabulous cocktail selection and tell us about the menu.  We choose the wild king salmon on the plank. It was fantastic a little spicy and just a hint of smoke. YUMMY!  We are looking forward to coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great ambience, and some really amazing food. Tasha was our server and she was literally one of the most welcoming and friendly servers I've ever met. I highly recommend eating here if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend. It wad the two of us but we ordered a bunch of food!   We started with calamari and albacore roll. The calamari was great, and their sauce was fantastic to dip it in. Half the calamari was tentacles inspired and the other half was the circular meat. I thought it was a great mixture. The sushi roll could've been great but the fish was too cold. It felt like they just took the albacore out the fridge and served it to us. I'm jot a fan of cold cold sushi as it makes it not feel fresh.  I then ordered half a dozen oysters. It was a sampler so it included 6 different variety of oysters. One of the 6 oysters was amazing, the other 5 were okay.  My main entrée was a yellow fin tuna with carrots and zucchini on the side. The sides were absolutely horrendous. The yellow fin tuna was okay... It got cold really fast. I think they cooked the yellow fin tuna at the same time as my friends meal ( the wahoo). The wahoo takes much longer to cook, so my hypothesis is that my yellow fin got cold as they cooked the wahoo."}
{"text":"Food tasted like it was just caught out of the ocean!  Super fresh and delicious!  Our server Natalie was fabulous and had a pleasant attitude and was very professional.  She was very helpful regarding menu choices with her recommendations.  Definitely ask for her to be your server!!!  Request for Natalie!! Knows her menu extremely well!"}
{"text":"Best crab legs and sides I had by far. And lobster was so tender and juicy. Me and my boyfriend will be coming back. I love their bread and butter as well.  Customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gawd.   Phenomenal lobster and steak. Excellent whiskey selection. I couldn't have been happier.   The steak was cooked to perfection and the lobster was very fresh. Got the grilled zucchini which was also good. Service was fast but not too fast. We had a chance to enjoy ourselves. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Came back to see the new design of the place, and I was Amazed, not only did the place get a face lift did the food get that much better? I've been before and the food was perfect, but it seems to be that much more delicious. What ever is going on there they are doing it right. Can't wait to bring my next TINDER date there;)"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and got food poisoning. I had the clam chowder and a steak dinner. Within a day of eating here i had to go to the doctor and they tested me positive for food poisoning. Horrible!"}
{"text":"Loved every little thing. The server, Ben, was a standout. Fantastic \"Perfect Manhattan.\" The yellowtail carpaccio and sea bass were outstanding. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally found a restaurant with great seafood that I can trust in the Las Vegas area. Not only is the food great but the atmosphere is awesome and so is the staff! Our waitress Lacey was very knowledgable, attentive and extremely kind, we will definitely be visiting again! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves seafood!"}
{"text":"Delicious, perfectly crafted dishes in a fun, comfortable environment. This place gets heavy traffic and its easy to see why. The starter bread is a golden, crispy masterpiece. The lemonade is perfectly sweet and flavorful. I don't enjoy seafood but the pasta dishes are rich with flavor. It's easy to tell every dish is lovingly prepared.  Service was astounding, from the moment Mom and I walked in to the moment we left. I colored in the kid's menu, and Mom took one home for a souvenir because it was just too adorable to leave behind. The kid's menu proves a lot of care went into the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in the district! I'm a local district resident for over the year and shamefully I dine out basically every day , so we definitely know this menu and service.  The sea food is to die for!  I have had everything from happy hour to the lobster tails and every time 5 stars! You'll never go wrong with their mules, half shells are awesome, fish specials, yummy fish taco, clam chowder , side dishes, and the service ; you can't go wrong!  *Also, the staff is Service Dog friendly. Always so so so kind when I need to bring my service dog with me."}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us came here after our conference. The servers was very polite, but the food took a very long time to come out.  I got the crunchy roll, walnut salad, and miso soup, which was all very good. The price was pretty well priced and we had a good time overall."}
{"text":"I'm really trying to not give out as many 5-star reviews, but jeez some of these places are making it hard!  First, the interior is well designed and has a very nice outdoor patio area to eat on too when the weather is less windy and more warm. Very clean. Love the open kitchen, it always makes me feel better about the food quality when you can see into a kitchen (though the other part of my brain tells me that is bunk). The live lobster tanks guarantee you are getting FRESH lobster (I physically saw them pull my meal out of it).   Service: outstanding. Not only was our server very attentive and super friendly, this was the first restaurant I have EVER been at where servers with nearby tables also stopped to check in on you, help clear your table, offer you more drinks, etc. It was a real team effort there with service which definitely didn't go unnoticed to us as guests.   Drinks were decent. Glad to see they had Pimm's soda, which is hard to find in Vegas, but we tried two cocktails and both were good, and strong!   Food was great. Hard to mess up fresh lobster though right? The tilapia was also great tasting, lightly crusted, and very moist (weird word but hey, there are few other words to describe that). The prices were a little on the high side, but considering the location and the fact that you're eating FRESH seafood in the desert, I can't really be too annoyed about it... I'll definitely be back to try the vast raw bar options and more drinks!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service. Went for birthday dinner on Sat 4/28 (they didn't even acknowledge the occasion, like most places we dine at do). They sat us at the lounge for our party of 6. Oysters were ok. Kids ordered fried shrimp, all of the shrimp looked dark and burnt. Wife ordered the Manila clam linguini, it was bland. I ordered top sirloin, it was cooked to my liking, but the portion was too small for the price! We ordered appetizers and a sushi roll. Our dinner came way later, I would say 30-45 minutes after we were done with our appetizers. She didn't fill our water/drinks right away, we had to ask. Nevertheless, we did leave a 17% tip. I was excited to bring my family here as I've dined here once before. This time around it seemed the service and food was not as great as I remembered my first experience. Don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Server knowledge poor.  We asked questions and received incorrect answers leading to ordering items we would not have ordered. Also the spinach with garlic was horrible.  Crab cakes would not eat again.  The best item we were served was mashed potatoes.  We added more butter from bread loaf and pepper and they were pretty decent.  For almost a 100 dinner highly disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. I haven't had anything bad here. Love that the menu changes to seasonal items. Just recently had the macadamia crusted halibut and it was perfect. Had an Asian crab leg special with jasmine rice once, which was also really tasty. Crab cakes are yummy. The oyster selection is fantastic and so fresh."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here since the remodel. My past experiences seemed a bit, um, vanilla for me. This time, I'm a fan. Big fan.  They have a great selection of seafood dishes, meat dishes and sushi. Honestly, there's something here for everyone. The prices are not cheap, but they're not as bad a the prices you'll see on the strip. Plus, for you parents out there, they still have that awesome kid's menu that'll shut them up until the food comes. Trust me, I walked in with five boys (not all mine). This is part of the reason I am giving them such a high rating. Aside from their tasty food and great drink selection, they will take great care of your kids. The entire staff was so accommodating and super cool to our table of one frazzled mom and five kids. Seriously. I would have lost my mind without their staff being so cool. They made sure our drinks were filled and that everyone was taken care of. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Glorious! The Agave Sting made with Ranchero Alegre tequila has got me hooked the oysters here are....there are no words really buut daamn! The staff is kick-ass. Especially like the decor. Will vome back for more more more. They have sushi which I look forward to trying. Happy hour is too legit to quit."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Cravings got me like king crab legs please! The lobster was cooked to perfection,  the service was on point, and the outside eating was beautiful.   The salmon was a bit over cooked but add some of their homemade hot sauce, yaoooooo!  Nom nom nom.  The clam chowder was eh nothing exciting.  The crab cakes were flavorful but a bit too fishy for me.    I would definitely comeback do the lobster and the crab!  Need to try the steak next time.    The theme decor was super cute with the wood and sea theme with a hint of modern.  Overall I enjoyed my self and will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been to the location in Carlsbad several times, and during his last visit in Vegas, he suggested that we come here for dinner because he knows how much I love seafood even though he's not a big fan himself.  Tucked away in the District at Green Valley Ranch, King's Fish House offers dishes for seafood lovers and non-seafood lovers alike. We walked into the restaurant and I was immediately blown away by the interior design. The ceiling, the light fixtures, the tile... Gorgeous! Yes, I pay attention to these kind of details. Overall, the atmosphere was wonderful and perfect for a dinner date.   N'awlin's BBQ Shrimp- Okay, you MUST order this if you're a fan of shrimp! Absolutely delicious! The shrimp is sautéed in a spicy almost broth-like sauce and served with toasted sour dough bread for dipping. The perfect appetizer to share!   Lemon-Nut Crusted Wild Mexican White Sea Bass- Now say that 10 times fast! The cut of fish was perfect. Not too big, not too small, and breaded just right! It was served with lemon butter sauce and a choice of two sides. My boyfriend and I both agreed that the mashed potatoes were some of the best we've had at any restaurant! Garlicky and really full of flavor!   Herbed Chicken Breast- My boyfriend enjoyed his meal! The portion was huge because the chicken breast took up almost all of the room on the dish! I tried the chicken with the au jus. It was moist and flavorful! He ordered the sweet buttered corn as one of his sides and O M G... BEST corn I've ever had! It was super fresh and extremely sweet! I love the fact that the corn was shaved off of the cob and not individual kernels like most restaurants.  I truly enjoyed my first experience at King's Fish House and I am looking forward to dining here again in the future. Thank you to our amazing server Lacy for taking care of us! She was really attentive and sweet!"}
{"text":"Update to my original post: came back with friends Friday night to the Oyster bar side of the restaurant and had a fabulous experience. Our waiter Paul was attentive and on it. Enjoyed several apps and drinks and really loved our three hours catching up.  Our server paid just the right amount attention to us. Wasn't bothersome but always kept an eye on our beverages to make sure they didn't run dry. The atmosphere was lively and busy. I'm glad it was a wonderful experience again. Of course I will come back because I love this place.  Previously: I keep coming back for happy hour and hoping the poor service is just a fluke but clearly it is not.  I like going to the oyster bar side of this restaurant, especially since they had their remodel.  It's one of my favorite places after work because there's always seats available and I really do enjoy their food. I got a center table in between the bar and the booths. After multiple servers walked by me within five minutes and didn't acknowledge me, I finally went to the bar and asked for menu and questioned whether I was in the \"no service zone area\" and if I needed to move. Of course he apologized and sent the server over to help me order.   My friends arrived and it took a while for the server to acknowledge there were additional people at the table, even though the place was fairly empty. Then the drinks took forever. And the re-orders for drinks took forever. I was so embarrassed that I recommended this place.  It is also a disgrace when servers come out and bring food and go from table to table because clearly they are poorly trained.  Nobody wants their food paraded around the restaurant and visiting several tables before it makes it to yours.  My glass of wine set up at the bar and was picked up and put down by two different servers. When the third person, who was not my waitress, picked it up I made eye contact and ask them to bring it over because my server was nowhere in sight and I had waited quite a while for the drink refill.  Our water was not refilled and dirty plates piled up were repeatedly ignored and not removed from the table. And again, the bar was not busy. As much as I like this place, they clearly still have a ongoing management, staffing and training issues to deal with.  Our waitress was pleasant enough but clearly overwhelmed. Unfortunately this is not an isolated incident at this restaurant. You will only get good service for happy hour if you sit at the bar in front of the bartender."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at King's.  It was great!  The food was delicious, the service was wonderful.  We had a couple of appetizers prior to our main course, Edamame and grilled artichoke.  Yum!  Follow that up with a couple of oysters (my son turned 30 today and had never had them before). He loved them.  Crab cakes, fish tacos, and shrimp pasta for the main dishes.  All wonderful, tasty and nicely presented.  All in all, I will definitely be back again.  A fabulous afternoon at The District!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere & cleanliness - 4 stars Service -  2 stars - waitress, Cara,  didn't know what \"steamers\" were or the difference between mussels and clams (and she works in a FISH HOUSE)! So I asked for clams but  got blue mussels. I don't return food. She was polite and service was prompt. Food - 1 star - Mussels were dry and meatless, sauce had a slight burnt taste to it. Great sour dough bread. Prices 2 - over priced for the portion."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for seafood so off to Kings I went.  I had the lobster roll with the candied walnut salad they were both tasty , fresh and delicious. My buddy Jon had the Clam chowder which he said was delicious. The sour dough bread was fantastic as always.  I was disappointed that the lobster bisque was not available at this location.  We also shared the barbecued artichoke appetizer with aioli sauce. which was delicious.  The one side that stole the show was the side of mash potatoes that came with the lobster roll. The mashed potatoes were extremely tasty, buttery, and creamy but also had some chunks of potatoes that together made for some of the best mashed potatoes I have ever tasted.  Ben our server was prompt, attentive, and courteous."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight for some crab legs and oysters only to find out that Paul is not longer working at Kings. This was a huge let down and disappointment as he's pretty much the only reason we go to Kings. The food is always decent but the hospitality and service from Paul is what kept us coming back. Spoke with the manager Sean about what a let down it was that Paul was not a part of Kings anymore. He understood our frustration and was more then accommodating. Sean definitely saved our experience but I still feel that it may be awhile before we try Kings again. It's not just about the food when dining out, it's about the experience and Paul always made our dinner at Kings a fantastic experience.   Shame Kings Shame!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since opening day and loved it. However recently my last couple of visits it seems to be going downhill, quickly. Service has got to improve. That's been the biggest issue on our last visits. I thought maybe it was just one person, but I know we are not getting the same server every time.  This past weekend we were seated and greeted by our server. He quickly took our drink order, and for some reason, the drinks came out one by one. We were served bread while we waited on our food. It too showed up in shifts. Twice we asked for more bread and refill on drinks/water. Never got bread, no refills, not even once. I One member of our party did not eat the salmon tacos because they smelled and tasted fishy. When we mentioned it to the server, they shrugged their shoulders and said oh, I'll try and mention it. Wow. Hopefully next week when we return, we'll get another server."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Fantastic service. The clam chowder is a must. We will definitely come back. Benjamin was an awesome server."}
{"text":"Best Clam Chowder EVER!!!  We tried this place for the first time, getting the Lobster rolls and a beer. They were really good. We ended up coming back 3 more times during our week stay. The clam chowder was the best i've ever had, and we live in Santa Cruz, Ca near the ocean, so that is really saying something. I liked the ambience here, ocean themed. The hostess, Shannon, was friendly and helpful. The service was really good.   They are kid friendly, which was great for the grandkids. The prices were fair, and they have a full bar. You can sit inside or out. We were really please with this place. Make reservations if you're going at dinner time. The Ceasar salad was a bit spicy, but my husband had the Santa Fe salad and he ordered it again because he liked it so much.   They serve fresh, hot sourdough bread which is delicious. I like that you can order the main dish and two sides so you can get just what you want. The Creme brulee was ample and yummy. I will be going here every time I come to visit Henderson.  Thanks King's Fish House!!!"}
{"text":"The revive was great, atmosphere was awesome, service was good. Loved the blue cheese wedge salad! Had the filet it was way undercooked! Sent it back and it came back looking almost the same. I ate the edges lol!"}
{"text":"Food and service is always on point here.  On our last visit we sat at the bar and had drinks and appetitizers.  It was a nice relaxing dinner and we had good conversation with the bartender.  We will sit at the bar again next time we go."}
{"text":"Party of 6 here for dinner a couple of weeks ago. Had an early dinner on a weeknight, so it wasn't that crowded. The staff was very accommodating, asking which of several locations would be preferable for seating, inside/outside/bar area, etc. Very nice, and we settled on a spot inside but right next to the outside - perfect temperature mix! We had crab cakes, soft shell crab piccata and southern style, and grilled rockfish, along with some grilled asparagus. The soft shell crab entrees were just right. Very pleasant dinner."}
{"text":"The fish was way over cooked and the side dishes were cold. We were served crem brûlée for desert and it was a disgrace. There was so much unburnt granulated sugar left on top it felt like we were eating sugar cubes. I was hoping to provide my wife with a wonderful dinner for her birthday but I think we could have gotten better seafood at long John silvers."}
{"text":"If I were to rate King's on today's lunch it would be 3 stars, but I've eaten here before and it's been good.  Today I decided to treat myself to a Crab Louie.  It was a beautiful salad w a generous amount of crab, but after a few bites I felt something was off w the crab - not spoiled, but tinny.  I asked and found out it was canned.  I guess I should have asked before I ordered, but just assumed a nice place like this would have fresh crab.  It's probably not noticeable in the crab cakes, but it was unpleasant in a salad, somewhat like canned tuna.  The waitress offered to get me something else, but by then I had eaten a lot of the rest of the salad (not the crab) so I declined.  I was surprised and impressed when they comped the salad ($23), bc I hadn't made a big deal about it.  So yes, definitely eat here, but I would avoid the pricey canned crab Louie."}
{"text":"Came in on Mother's Day for dinner. Upon meeting the hostess we were asked three times by three different people if we had reservations. When we said no we were treated as a inconvenience, but seated right away. I was a little irritated to be treated like that, but our dinning experience made up for it. The servers were great. Everyone that passed by had a smile on their face, took empty plates, asked if we were doing ok.  The food was amazing, the drinks were excellent. And for a fish house in Nevada, the prices are very decent and reasonable. My kids also loved the nice sturdy kids cups. They also both ate all their food, which is amazing for them."}
{"text":"This is where I like to go tho get my sushi on! Plus the steak and lobster is to die for! Service is exceptional!  I've been here over 10 times over the years,  but I love the results of the remodel. It's so airy now!"}
{"text":"This was one of the greatest dining experiences we've had since moving to the Vegas area. The food here was second to none and our waitress and our new friend Danielle was the best ever. I was so moved by the fact of them acknowledging me as a war veteran and it made me and my wife really feel warm and comfortable. I recommend this establishment to anyone and veterans especially. Thank you for the wonderful service. If you are able to visit King's Fish House just ask for Danielle and be ready for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night with family. Had to wait a good 20 minutes for a table but got a drink at the bar to pass my time. I had the Perfect Manhattan which was, indeed, perfect. Once we were seated, I ordered the Bardstown Buck cocktail which was also delicious. For my dinner, I had the tuna melt with grilled zucchini. Everything was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. The bread they give before the meal is delicious, too. Prices are a bit high but it's seafood so to be expected (and it's definitely worth it). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience at Kingfish on Thursday.  Had dinner with a large group. The food was average and the seafood obviously frozen. The worst part of the experience was taking a bite of sautéed spinach and having a piece of sharp bent metal wire going into my gums. After pulling the wire out it was presented to the waiter who was very apologetic about the incident.  The disappointing part was the lack of customer service from the restaurant manager who did not even come to the table to apologize for the dangerous incident. It was brushed off and forgotten.  Should have been handled differently.   Business management was nice to reach out and fix the situation.  Thumbs up for stepping up and making things right."}
{"text":"A friend of ours treated us for dinner last night!   YUM!  YUM!  YUM! We started with a couple \"starters\"... - A dozen of oysters - mixed sampler: I don't do oysters so I didn't try these but the guys really enjoyed them.  There was one called the Naked Cowboy and I was very interested in that one but not enough to try it.  Apparently, that one was the most \"mineral-y\" of all of them.   - Trojan sushi roll - it had fresh tuna on the outside - it was fresh and melted in your mouth - Baked scallop roll - The scallops were cooked but still very tender - the sauce/topping was a bit much for me... cuz I don't like a lot of sauce... but still VERY good... another melt in your mouth  For entrees... My friend had the filet. I had the Sea Bass. Hubby had the soft shell crab.  All of us cleaned our plates!    My Sea Bass was perfection.  Grilled lightly... moist yet meaty and tender.  My sides were the Summer Grains and Grilled Zucchini.  Again... both were Fantastic.  I'm picky about my veggies and they got these Just Right!  I like my veggies cooked BUT NOT soggy... I like some crunch to them still and these were On Point.  Summer Grains is like a rice pilaf... nice and light.  For dessert... We shared the Butter cake and the Bread pudding. The Butter cake should have a poem or its own song written about it... it was THAT good. Buttery but not too butter... rich, decadent, amazing.  A couple bites is all you really need but that doesn't stop us from licking the plate.  (Didn't really \"lick\" the plate... but thought about it.)  Service is Great!  Everyone is friendly and attends to us in the right amount of time.  Just when our water glasses were getting low... a nice server would magically appear to re-fill.  And when we said we wanted another glass of wine later with our dinner... they remembered and brought it out at the same time (without having to be reminded).  The remodel of the inside of this restaurant really opened it up.  It's brighter and more inviting now.  The patio is still GREAT too.  (and they have misters for summer to try to keep it a tad cooler)  The bar seems bigger and more open as well.  I think next time we may sit in there and chill.  I forgot to ask about Happy Hour specials... but I'm guessing they have some so I'll have to check it out.  Yes, we will be back!  :)"}
{"text":"Casey is a great server!!!! He had the bartender make a drink that I invented, food was good as always"}
{"text":"The waitress was nice, however the food was not. We ordered the fried catfish, and it was so soggy. The fries were cold. For being a 'seafood' restaurant, you would think they were at least serve fresh fish, but nope. You could tell it had been frozen for a while before they microwaved it back to life. If you want good seafood, literally go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I travel between LA and Las Vegas and a fan of King's fish house in Calabasas. 'Been in that location several times, and in the OC area as well. My first time at the District was a quick lunch with girlfriends last year and we all had Caesars salad and it was nothing  special...a lot of lettuce in a big bowl but I have better dining experiences of this chain in the Calabasas location few years ago. I've tried the seafood Cobb salad (very good), soup, seafood platter, and different kinds of oysters in the past. Average food and pricey!!! you are paying for location!!! I invited a friend to join me for dinner tonight at the District. I ordered the swordfish taco, total disappointment! You find this entree under Favorites! Lol. Each component in that taco was unseasoned...not kidding! I would expect the fish grilled with some smoky flavors off the grill to give some distinctive flavor, the shredded cabbage slaw could use a hint of salt...none of that! Mayo in the slaw  was generic. The only impressive attention to details is the grilled half slice of lime. Lol... Grilled lime instead of the fish! Wow!!! The line cook in charge of the swordfish must be asleep. If this is a place called fish house, at least make the fish the star of this dish. I expected a lot from the District location but aside from the lousy, ordinary food, our waiter was unforgettable in a negative way!!! He was rude, rush, insincere, entitled, never asked if we wanted dessert, coffee or more beer, he came up to our table to hand us our check. Guess what, I'm a generous, big tipper but this is the first time...ever.. I gave only 10% and drew a sad face on the merchant's receipt. I have a house full of guests every month, does King's fish house  come to mind? NO not at this location, thank you!"}
{"text":"Waited for our food for over 1 hour service was lousy.  We ordered appetizers but nonetheless our food took over an hour. Totally unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Big fresh oysters, delicious seafood, and great service.  This is one of the best seafood places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We had the Cajun Bbq Shrimp and the sesame seared albacore, however our server (Ben) recommended I swap out the albacore with the Ahi and get it rare. What a great suggestion, the Ahi was delicious! The wife got the Cajun bbq shrimp. Which was amazing. The sauce was sweet and tangy, but when mixed with my garlic mashed potatoes it was almost decadent.  I'll come here again next time I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"KINGS will always be my favorite seafood restaurant! I really look forward to going there whenever we can. Their new handcrafted cocktail menu is great, my favorite drinks being the lemon drop martini and the Pimm's cup! One of my Favorite appetizers is the grilled artichoke- marinated and topped with  a light basil vinaigrette and served with a side of pesto mayo dipping sauce which is delicious. I also love the new dipping sauce on the calamari, it's a Mae ploy sauce with a hint of cilantro and orange juice. Calamari rings and tentacles are large and tender! There's so many good things on the menu there. And it's seasonal so it's always changing which keeps it fun and interesting. Right now they are having wild salmon season and one of the favorites is the cedar plank salmon roasted on a wood plank and topped with a sweet and spicy dry rub. A must try! Service is great and the managers are always friendly :)"}
{"text":"Overall an okay place. First the good: roasted beet salad (but the beets were not roasted) , fresh oysters, good cocktail selection and the desserts were good (albit overpriced at $10 a piece). The bad: Had the wild caught wahoo and it was tough and dry. I was hungry but couldn't finish it. For the sides I had fresh corn which was great but its hard to screw up corn, and mac and cheese. The mac was not only chewy and tasteless, but it was served cold. Not a bad place but I don't see myself coming back anytime soon Thumbs sideways on this one."}
{"text":"I went there once and ate at the bar. Service was good. I ordered tilapia grilled. The fish was chewy and i could tell it was previously frozen. Which by itself is okay, but this cut was old. I didn't finish it as I was actually worried about food poisoning. Overall the restaurant was not crowded. In fact I've walked by a few times since at various times and never see it to crowded. Bad sign, IMO, as then maybe food gets dated as it's not pushed.  I haven't been back since my first time there. Surprised it gets 4 stars, but then I noticed alot of 5 stars- really. Maybe employees? Just saying. Also less than a total of 100 reviews which again points to little customer traffic, I think. Sad as it's a great location."}
{"text":"Amie was so helpful in selecting the best oysters and sushi available at kings. Wouldn't select without her, she really knows her menu. Thank you Amie!"}
{"text":"I haven't been in for several months.  As always they did not disappoint.  We started with the nawlins shrimp and kumomoto oysters.  MMMMM we both had the hazelnut crusted pacific salmon and it was so fresh and tasty its hard to believe we are this far from the ocean.  I have been going to Kings Fish House for at least 10 years and will keep coming back for this awesome food.  The service wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"King's is a horrific chain fish restaurant masquerading as high quality. The prices are astronomical and to anyone with even a bit of sense, the ingredients are bottom of the barrel. Management is incompetent and a nice remodel recently has not saved their food."}
{"text":"Scarlet was the absolute best she guided me through the menu and all the food was amazing so I would always come back and definitely recommend this for anyone looking for great seafood!"}
{"text":"Well we went to use our \"we are sorry \"gift card and it had not been authorized. It was worth zero like the service we received which prompted giving us the gift card. Fortunately our server Pam at the Orange California store had her manager get involved and he authorize the gift card.  We will be eating again at Henderson Kings and I will be sure that the manager knows about our lousy previous service and I don't want to see the same thing happen again."}
{"text":"These guys consistently do such a great job.. it's hard not to take them for granted. And their happy hour is one of the best kept secrets.. why? The fish tacos.. the spicy tuna roll.. $5 each.. seriously nuts !! And their service staff is always 'the best'.. so glad just live a few minutes away. Just a very well run restaurant.. through all the years we've been visiting."}
{"text":"First off, I heard a lot of good things about this place. I was not impressed one bit. I went here recently with the family and had to wait 35 minutes to be seated. They do offer a texting service which will prompt you when your table is available which was quite convenient. Once they texted me to return the hostess said we couldn't take the stroller with us and that she would keep it. I thought that was strange and left it with her. When we arrived to the table I told the guy that seated us that we can remove a chair and there will be plenty of space for the stroller. He then continued to say no that it's a fire hazard and that management won't allow it. So I decided to state that no restaurant has ever told me that I can't bring the stroller and if that is a hazard then we might as well take the rest of the chairs away from the table. Well a minute later the hostess brought me the stroller. Aside from these people's incompetence, I was ready to eat. To start, I ordered the spicy gumbo chowder and some oysters which both were really flavorful! Other than that, everything else was just mediocre and bland. It's sad when the sweet corn is better than the Mac & cheese. The waitress that served us was the reason why this place didn't get lower than 3 stars. She was very friendly and attentive. I probably will not be returning here. The End."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and wow was I impressed.  Seafood this good and we are not even near the ocean - awesome.  I had treated a fellow Elite to lunch at Yonaka's and he returned the favor by taking my out to lunch at  King's.  We truly had one of the best lunches I have had in years.  We ordered so much Seafood I was worried they might run out.  It is fun to eat out with someone who truly enjoys food!  We started out with a dozen of their oyters which were all delicious.  We had Thorndyke Bay - Hood Cancel, Washington, Hama Hama - Hood Canal, Washington, Kumamoto - Laguna Bay, Mexico,  James River - Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, Naked Cowboy - Long Island Sound, New York and Island Creek - Duxbury, Massachusetts.  They went down so good that we ordered another dozen.  We also had a 1/2 pound of Wild Texas Brown Shrimp which were chilled and very tasty.  To add to the appetizer round we also had a 1/2 pound of Farmed Price Edward Island Blue Mussels.  Although not a huge fan of mussels I actually enjoyed these.      For the main course i had the Indian Ocean Ahi which was cooked perfectly - Chef Style.  It same crusted with Sesame seeds and was accompanied with mac and cheese and spinach.  I had a very tasty dipping sauce which added to the flavor but did not overpower the great taste of the Ahi.  The mac and cheese and spinach were both really good and were a prefect partner for the delicious Ahi.        King's has a very inviting decor which reminds me of an East Coast Seafood restaurant.  Since it was cooler and cloudy outside we sat outside in their covered patio section which was really nice.  Once the heat goes away would love to sit there again and enjoy a great meal and take it the atmosphere.  The service was outstanding as our Waitress was fun and ensured we were well taken care of.  It was a great lunch at a fantastic place.  I was truly Living the Dream at King's Fish House!!!  I need to take my wife and daughter here soon as they will love King's as much as I do."}
{"text":"King's roasted beet salad is excellent! Roasted beets over a creamy goat cheese spread with arugula, pecans, dried cranberries and a tasty red wine grapefruit vinaigrette. I'm a salad person so I've tried all of their salads and they're all good! A lot of great items on the menu, including filet mignon and roasted chicken!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy Kings, good food, but as a family of 6 kids, this place is very kid friendly.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"It took them more than thirty minutes to simply bring us a drink, which they were nice enough not to charge us for.  The magarita tasted like it was straight lime juice and tequila.  My steak and lobster was good but overpriced.  My \"mashed\" potatoes had massive chunks of un-mashed potato in it that wasn't even cooked.  The crab cakes tasted like they were made with tuna fish out of a can.  I certainly understand being busy, but if I'm paying $20+/entree it better come out amazing when I have to wait almost an hour to eat my meal!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT THE OYSTERS!!!!! I had a business lunch here today and ordered two oysters. I only ate one because it tasted a little funny and had broken shell pieces in it, which almost chipped my tooth. I now have food poising, missed my flight back home to Seattle and have spent the last three hours rotating from laying in the fetal position (to ease the stomach cramps) to expelling fluids from both ends of my body into the toilet. I will probably spend the next three hours doing more of the same. Thanks, King's!   Hats off to Silvia at the Green Valley Ranch Spa for taking care of me for the last three hours!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy going often to King's Fish House because I the food is excellent but also the service is beyond any expectations you may have mostly due to Kelsey! We go back to eat there to have her help us because we enjoy her service. Kelsey always remembers us and most recently we went to King's for our Anniversary dinner and she remembered our Anniversary from our conversation we had the last time we ate there. Thank you King's Fish House for have Kelsey as an employee who is an asset to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am rating King's Fish House a 2 star and not a 1 star is because the food. I have been to this restaurant a few times before tonight and had never had a bad experience. I think the layout is awesome and the ambience is nice. How ever tonight when I went there with a couple friends for my girlfriends birthday, I was caught off guard on how poor the service was. Our server Lacy, was not only inattentive but also very forgetful and careless.       *** FOR MANAGEMENT ONLY***  --------------------------------------------- We were 1 of 3 whole tables in the ENTIRE restaurant. Other employees would walk by us not paying any attention to our empty plates and empty drinks.  Working in the industry, I can understand the circumstances to having service that is that to your best ability. But when you are all standing around trying to complete your side work quickly so you can leave early is inexcusable. Its not only hurting you by YOU losing MONEY. Its hurting the business as a whole. All in all, it was a very very poor dinning experience saved by the chefs... Please management, take a closer look at your staff."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible and horrible.. i live in the district and when i first came here a year and a half ago there was a fly in my mashed potatoes so i couldnt even eat my food. I understand they have open doors and sometimes stuff like this happens. I decided to come back yesterday for a second chance with my girlfriend. Started off the the clam chowder and it tasted like canned clam chowder. Next got the crab meat cocktail and it was not fresh at all, the crab was actually mushy. My gf got the halibut and i got the tuna and both had no flavor at all, no salt and pepper or anything. He mashed potatoes were instant mash potatoes and my mac and cheese was terrible. The only good part of the meal was the brussels. It's such a shame that every restaurant in the District is horrible."}
{"text":"2 stars for the waitress she was amazing Food not so much.. something tasted off with the soft shell crab.. crab leg as were tough and cold and the filet was raw and flavorless Brussel sprouts were just gross corn was dry and anything but sweet  For $188 on dinner for 2 ... i expected more Total buyers remorse  Pretty sure we won't be back"}
{"text":"Whenever we visit our family in Henderson, we always drive buy Kings so we decided to give it a try!  It was amahzing!!!  Here are the must-have's:  sautéed N'awlins BBQ  shrimp, spicy but delicious! Lemon nut crusted Seabass topped with lemon butter sauce, lobster bisque soup, and anything during wild salmon season which is right around the corner! we even splurged and had their amazing salted caramel ice cream sandwich. I wish they would carry it year around it is such a big hit! They have real key lime pie too. They make most of their desserts in house!"}
{"text":"Came in yesterday afternoon and sat at the bar. Andy opted for a heff on draft and I had a glass (or 3) of their house Rose. We tried a 1/2 dozen oysters and they were amazing! The shaved horseradish was a great addition to the oysters. I wish we would have tried more but that will just make us come back for more!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. Been here a few times and the service and food was good. This time around I can't really say the same thing. First our service was AWFUL I mean awful. Our server Lacy probably had a total of 3-4 tables, she had one large party that left about the time that we ordered our drinks. She forgot our apps, she didn't even take all of our drink orders, she took two of the four people's and stormed off.  She was probably at our table a total of 3 times. Again, now she probably had 1-2 tables. All the servers were standing around, I was talking about how bad the service was right in front of a male server, I watched him laugh and continue folding napkins. My boyfriend and I work in a restaurant as well, and this service was so sad, it was embarrassing.. Not to mention it was my birthday and my friends went and told her and she said she would bring out a dessert, so my friend picked one out. She never brought it. It was 8:40 and the restaurant closed at 9. And she was just concerned about getting out of there. It was awful. On an up side the food was good."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and Jose was exceptional!  I ordered the Clam Linguine and it was absolutely delicious. We also ordered the Seafood Cobb and Calamari. All delicious!!   We ordered the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert and I would definitely recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend just have had the best seafood and service in so long! Thank you Karyne!"}
{"text":"I am amazed by how fresh and delicious the food is here! The Macadamia Halibut is to die for! Sit with Cara! Great service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Recently took a short trip out to Henderson to visit friends and was happy to see that they have a King's Fish House at the district! They have a great variety of appetizers including buffalo wings served with delicious blue cheese dressing, celery and carrot sticks. Surprisingly great wings for a seafood restaurant! In fact all of their salad dressings are really good and homemade. They have a roasted beet salad that I really like, it has a goat cheese spread with roasted beets, arugula, nuts and berries in it, with a nice vinaigrette also. Service is great and I love coming here. Their remodel is gorgeous!looks quite different and upgraded from all of the other King's I've been to."}
{"text":"My husband and I have finally found a restaurant with amazing food and service! King's Fish House has the best seafood in town at the right price. For the amount of food and drinks we ordered, we expected the bill to be way over $200. It was a nice surprise to see that it was well under that...which included the 20% tip for our awesome server, Debra. Debra is truly remarkable. She was training a new server and managed to still provide us with the BEST service. We will be back (often) with hopes that Debra will be our server again and again! We can't wait to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The only thing that saved this review from a 1 star was the male manager with glasses.. I didn't get his name but I made sure to ask who our server was. If you're looking for amazing food that has outstanding management who is very attentive and friendly - this is the place. If you're big on customer service and time management with your food.. maybe this is the place so long as you request anyone but the blonde, Victoria. She wasn't personable, didn't see her crack a smile once, she seemed to forget a lot of things too not only with our table but I overheard the people behind us - a different server verbally told them \"she forgot what you said so she sent me out.\" We got our appetizers AFTER our meal and that even took a solid 45 minutes to get. We asked for bread.. that was an additional 20. I was honestly afraid to ask for a refill cause I didn't know if I'd get it on time before I was finished like I should have. When the manager (I'm assuming) made his rounds from table to table - I asked him a few questions about the service and he was very apologetic and attentive! He took care of us the rest of the night.. we wouldn't even put our to go order in with her. We noticed a heavier set guy with dark hair - he was on the ball with his tables. Request him or anyone else. Maybe she was new or tired or who knows - but regardless, from someone whose worked in service her whole life, she would've been better calling out and if the excuse was she's new - don't get on the floor until you're confident and comfortable in your service skills!! Sadly, it was only a Wednesday night and she wasn't that busy at all. We'll be back a million more times as we love the food.. we'll just go out of our way to request anyone else."}
{"text":"I would have to say that i was highly disappointed with this place.  My  meal has goods and bads, unfortunately the bad was really bad.  First off I ordered the spicy seafood soup which was excellent.  For my main course I ordered the Sesame Crusted Wild Pacific Albacore with King's Ponzu sauce.  The waiter suggested I order the fish medium rare, which I did.  When the dish came, it looked like it was over cooked and the fish just looked...dead.  no life to it whatsoever!  There was absolutely zero sauce and it.  In fact, it's was extremely bland!  The mac and cheese and sautéed spinach were decent.  It's disappointing that a place that specializes in fish...doesn't know how to cook it.  Highly disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am sorry to say but we had the worst crab cakes ever, first of all the color was wrong and after we tasted they had a funny after taste, so we said something and they made a new order and this time the color was right and the taste was good but it was to late we immediately got sick and had to leave. It's a shame because we live a mile away and we won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Solid 4. Great service and really delicious food! We had the Cioppino, Parmesan crusted swordfish, tuna roll and miso soup....all was really flavorful and fresh tasting for most likely being frozen items. Our Server (damn I forgot her name :/) was super on top of it while also giving us space to chill out and enjoy the ambiance. Good music played in the background; the free appetizer bread was fresh a yummy. Drinks were brought out in a timely manner and I believe their menu had a great selection! We will 100% return here in the near future I am quite certain! Great experience all in all; especially for a chain restaurant. Yay!!!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful!!! Food was excellent & flavorful!  Daniel was fast & efficient!  And made excellent food selections!   Downfall:  GET RID OF YOUR WHITE LINEN NAPKINS!!!!!! lint on everything!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I come here regularly.  Their bbq shrimp plate is amazing, that's normally what I get. However my last visit i tried something different. The swordfish blackened with lemon butter sauce on the side it was amazing !"}
{"text":"Kings Fish House was awesome! The food was really good. They have fantastic Oysters and California rolls. If you like cocktails I recommend the lemon drop with Titos vodka,it's delicious. Scarlett our waitress was amazing, she was really nice and gave us the best service. I am definitely coming back. :)"}
{"text":"It was my moms birthday. Kings Fish House did an excellent job. We have the captains platter. Karyn was our waitress and she was awesome !! We  had a wonderful time. Thank you so much"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome.   Make sure you get some raw oysters and hit it with their habanero lime mix. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner!! Food is always wonderful!! But tonight Scarlett our server was beyond amazing!!! For a family of 6 she took such good care of us!! Our drinks never went empty and my kids adored her!! She brought a lobster over to our table and knew every question we had about him!! And boy did we have a ton!! So impressed! #bestServerEver #Scarlett"}
{"text":"I had been to King's several times when I first moved here and lived close to the District but I never reviewed it. I came for another visit and left asking why I don't come here more often. My wife only likes certain seafood items but they also have non fish options.  One of the best items IMO are the sautéed clams. Pan sautéed in butter, white wine, garlic, shallots and fresh herbs, served with a toasted piece of bread, they are some of the best clams I have had in the area. I have enjoyed many fish dinners and the surf and turf on an occasion. Everything here is quality and the packed dining/bar areas speak to that. The oysters look amazing and that is something I must try on my next visit."}
{"text":"First timer! We were looking for a seafood restaurant for dinner and found the reviews here on yelp. Loved the selections of fish and sushi. Had the California roll as starter and each of us ordered something different; Lemon Nut Seabass, Grilled Ono, and the Nawlins BBQ Shrimp. Seating outside was great with the mist on a warm Las Vegas evening. All in all, excellent dinner and tremendous service from our wait person, Natalie! We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"A nice restaurant with a very nice design and feel. Obviously seafood is their thing, and there's not much else on the menu so if you don't want seafood or anyone you're with doesn't want it, you better keep looking.  Lots of fish selections as well as crab, mussels and shrimp. Maybe a little pricey, but being out in the desert I'm sure it's a little more expensive to get that fish in than what I'm used to. I had the crab cakes, which weren't bad, but I wasn't very hungry and that showed in how little I ate. The Mac and Cheese is a good side.  Their beer selection is below \"meh\" so not the place for that."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything from the drink called the Agave Sting to my the end of my meal, key lime pie.  Jose was polite and attentive.  The restaurant also had a nice vibe to it. I recommend highly and will return."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant and the service is the best! Jose did a great job.  We always want him to be our server.  He knows the menu well and gives great recommendations!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place great food loved the fresh oysters server Ramsey was awsome we love this place.perfect summer food."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and Paul took great care of us. Highly recommended! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"When you get the fish cravings, this is the place to come to! They have an excellent assortment of fresh fish. Crab just happens to be my favorite!  The Alaskan King Crab was absolutely amazing. Paired with lemon and butter, the flavors were bouncing around in my mouth - they were having a party!  The Mac and Cheese was thick and left little to be Desired and the Garlic Mashed Potatoes hit the spot for this type of meal.  The Sirloin Steak Tacos were interesting. They tasted like your typical fish taco (sauce, cheese, and cabbage), but with steak instead of fish. The steak seemed a little fatty, but other than that, the flavors were on par.  Our server was amazing even though she seemed new. Very helpful and courteous; always checking up on us and even helped us make our menu choices.  I highly recommend King's Fish House and this location is awesome!"}
{"text":"I ended up here because I tasted one of my Co workers leftover shrimp pasta dish one day at work. When we first got there it seemed ok. We was sat down quickly because we had reservations. The server Cara did not talk much to us. Just the basics, what do you want to drink, do you want an appetizer, etc. When we did receive our food it was delicious and hot. The reason I gave the rating 2 stars is because of Cara her customer skills was very off. It was my first time at the restaurant and like I was not really pleased with her as a server. She talked more to the elderly couple that was done eating than she did my mom and I. If I  ever want food from here again it will be to go."}
{"text":"I had the mahi-mahi it was really good. Great fish place for the price. Great service.Clam chowder is good too."}
{"text":"The food came out quickly and the waiter was fairly attentive. We did have to ask for silverware on two separate occasions, when really the table should be made up before we even sat down. The main courses were good but my mac & cheese was cold and honestly I can make it better myself. I just feel the experience could have been better."}
{"text":"We had amazing food and amazing service. The artichoke is amazing. We had the red crab and chicken. The clam chowder is very good. The creme brule was wonderful and not too sweet. Will definitely recommend this to friends and family."}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary.  The new outside settings and the new look inside is awesome!  The food and service was excellent.  Thanks for free dessert.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had a bowl of Seafood Gumbo and the Creole Pasta Alfredo. The gumbo was rich, full flavored and spiced heavily. Tasty and fulfilling. The Alfredo dish was good, tasted really good but not as aggressively seasoned as the gumbo. It was filled with shrimp, chicken and Andouille sausage. For dessert has a slice of key lime pie. Nice and tart & also tasty, and none of that false added lime green color in sight.   The staff was polite and eager to explain dishes in detail and took empty plates away quickly. Food came out quick and accurately, no complaints here. Prices are moderate, and a nailed coupon made it even more worth the trip.  Being in Vegas a while, I've seen a lot of really good eateries come and go. All I can say is that I hope this one stays in town for a long, long time.  Good work guys, I'll be busy referring customers there!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a fish kinda guy and went there with a friend of mine who actually loved the place.  The staff was very professional and the surrounding were warm and friendly.  How ever, I did love the clam chowder soup Yum :)  If you are totally into sea food, then I would go and take a date or frineds with you!"}
{"text":"I rated this place 3* before the remodel and my opinion hasn't changed much. This place needs to fix their service issues for me to consider a higher rating.  King's still has a good selection of seafood dishes, but it's not nearly as good as in years past. Worse yet they continue to slim their offerings... it seems every so often they drop another sandwich, another soup, another fish entrée - making it feel like death by a thousand cuts. (One of their latest cuts is the honey mustard dressing for salads, which was by far their best - really makes me wonder how much they are saving by choosing to offer one fewer salad dressing.)  The decreased variety is further hampered by consistency issues with food preparation - we've had badly overcooked fish and/or sides on a few occasions. Still, King's is one of my preferred spots for raw oysters with a nice rotation, usually of at least six varieties. Also a fan of the raw clams. Their clam chowder is no slouch either, although a bit heavy on the bacon.  Remodel makes restaurant feel more open and spacious, although I'm not a fan of the patio doors being open all the time. The big negative is that service needs a lot of work and not sure that management really cares. In general, I've found service to be slow and waiters inattentive.  One particularly bad instance - a member of my party toasted his hands on a wet towel provided by the server. The towel was at first cool to the touch but wound up being scalding hot inside. When we made note of it to our server, she told us the towel was prepared by pouring hot water from the coffee machine through the towel, then a tiny bit of cold water on top to cool it down. That's why it was cool to the touch at first, but scalding hot in the middle. We notified management because we thought it was a pretty risky way to prepare a towel for the customer, especially when our server didn't warn us it was going to be so hot on the inside. The manager didn't want to acknowledge anything might be wrong and kept repeating that it's how they always do it and it's how they are trained to do it by corporate. Well, I'm not really sure when people burn their hands that they're going to care that it's how it's always done or whether it's \"corporate policy\" or not.  Anyway, I might stick to the raw food for now and hopefully they'll work some of the service issues out, and I'll look forward to updating if they do."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with my husband at Kings Fish House - First timers here!! Food was delish but the service is the reason why will be coming back. A huge Thank you to Tasha for making our anniversary one to remember. The service was unforgettable and her sweet caring nature made us feel so welcomed. Thanks again Tasha - We will be in to see you again soon."}
{"text":"Affordable quality fish, seafood and steak offerings.  Busy most evenings. Friendly and efficient staff.  Parking can be a challenge, go early.  Reservations recommended.  Nothing fancy, just good food."}
{"text":"First date. Best place. Great service. The clam chaowdah was wicked pissah. Going back again and again. ------- The first date guy turned out to be an asshole. FYI."}
{"text":"My first time here was for a business meeting. Great atmosphere & the food was awesome.  Our waitress Karen was very nice to explain the menu & great service with a smile.  I will definitely be back!,"}
{"text":"My favorite all time go to spot. I always have the best service and the oysters are amazing. I wish I could eat here every day lol."}
{"text":"You will need a fat wallet to eat here but well worth it. Kings Fish house is awesome."}
{"text":"The interior/exterior was exceptional. Food was great, but on the pricey side. The wait for our entree's was over half-an-hour. Our server Casey must have been new because we'd only see him every 15-20 minutes, on a slow Monday night, mind you. He never asked us if we wanted drinks, nor did he explain specials or the menu to us. Overall, for our first visit, we were quite underwhelmed with our entire experience."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday Brunch with the ladies. Beautiful environment we enjoyed the patio seating. Y friends enjoyed their meals. I ordered the shrimp and scallop combo. Almost $30 and they were tough and over cooked. Very disappointed in the rubbery food."}
{"text":"Update to our March post.  The management paid attention to our review regarding the Sanddabs and we returned to the restaurant at their request only to find they have corrected the problem and our Sanddabs were cooked PERFECTLY with plenty of sauce etc.  Thank you, management, for taking care of your customers.  We'l be back again and again."}
{"text":"Anniversary Dinner at our \"go to\" special occasion place for lobster.  Never disappointed.  Great bread, great food, reasonable price, and in the neighborhood.    Service was exceptional, thanks Ben.  Manager, Erwin, very attentive and caring. Will be back next month with the Birthday Boy!!"}
{"text":"My spicy margarita was TERRIBLE, but the food and service was good. My halibut was full of flavor!"}
{"text":"First time at this place, my dad wanted to go here. Waitress was very nice, place was just cute and the food was very good. I got sushi, my husband had the catfish and my dad had the jumbo shrimp. Bread was also delicious and warm. Will be going back!!"}
{"text":"Just had a great experience here. The staff was gracious and attentive. My Mom was in the mood for surf and turf and after a Yelp search of the area we decided to give this place a try. Glad we did. I had grilled scallops which were good. I highly recommend the garlic mash! My Mom plate looked amazing and she loved it. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Two pound lobster and 1 1/2 lbs king crab baby that's what I call lunch - yeah baby!!!  Oh yeah sorry forgot the best part key lime pie"}
{"text":"Great food really impressed by the service and the place was packed. The service shined they really where impressive considering how manny people where dining. My family and I waited for nothing. The food was amazingly fresh. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Good food at a restaurant is only part of what makes a good eating experience. The ambience and service are just as important, if not more important than the food sometimes. You can go to eat at a place and have mediocre food, but if the service was outstanding then you won't mind that the food was decent, but not memorable. The same can NOT be said if the food was great, but service was terrible. Your mood and ambience will be affected and all that will stand out in your mind is how bad your server was. With that being said last night I took my little one out to dinner at King's fish house over at the District at Green Valley ranch. King's prides themselves in serving up the freshest seafood in town and that was expected. But I have to take a moment out to write a review about our server, Andrew Grande. He was very attentive and anticipated our every needs before we even had to ask. Our drinks were always filled and he was always checking in on us to make sure we had the best dinner experience. He had extensive knowledge of the menu and made recommendations according to our tastes and preferences. It is very rare that I write a review, but the service that we received from Andrew was excellent and exceptional that I felt it was worth taking the time out to write this review. Thank you again for the excellent dinner service!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight with my girl and had an amazing experience. Beautiful restaurant,  great service and l food. Had the calamari with this tangy dipping sauce, very good. My girl really liked the \"Pimm's cup\" gin based cocktail which was very refreshing and garnished with a cucumber. I love the fresh live lobster and the garlic mashed. The manager Irwin even came over to say hello and ask if we were enjoying everything. Will be back !"}
{"text":"The halibut was awesome tonight...Ask for Jose's section...he will take excellent care of you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled upon this place walking around GVR for date night. It caught our attention with the beautiful patio dining and the decor inside. We decided to eat here for our first time.   We were seated quickly. The time we went it wasn't that busy, but as the night went on it picked up fast. Our server was quick, got our waters, went over the menu. We ordered the Kings Platter & the Crab Cakes. Our food cake out fast. Before our alcohol drinks! The food was delicious. Perfect portions. Reminded us of our trip down to Louisiana.   I removed a star because the bar was extremely slow at getting drinks out. It felt like each time we ordered another round it took 10-15min to get it. Our drinks were simple. I got a blue moon, and my wife got some fruity cocktail. The server also did not mention there were two drinks sizes for my beer so the first round she brought me a small glass compared to what I was seeing around me, which were tall glasses. That's what I thought I was getting. It wasn't until the 2nd round that my wife asked for the different sizes that she told me the beers come in two different sizes. I would've ordered the tallest had she asked.   Anyways, overall it was good. The food was spot on. However, the bartender was slow. Either that or our server was slow. I would go back, but maybe sit at the bar to eye my drinks or to get them faster."}
{"text":"Good food, great service from Jose. Sides were amazing, grilled zucchini and sautéed spinach. Seafood was fresh and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I use to work here when it first opened.  Good place to eat. I remember cooking all the items and having to taste food before it going out was the best part. Had to come here and have my kids and their significant other try the food. Everyone loved it and the butter cake was delicious! ! Good times great company and Bomb food!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been completely renovated. The atmosphere, food and service are top notch. The Peruvian scallops were excellent and the sushi was incredible. Worth the trip from Summerlin."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here while wondering the District. For a Sunday, early evening, it was packed. But for a party of 2, the waiting was minimal. We sat close to the patio, but not actually out there as it was a bit chilly.  Our server was very friendly & professional, and promptly took our drink orders. I had the Grilled Mahi Mahi w/sauteéd spinach and asparagus. It was excellent...and even for the extra charge, there was plenty if asparagus. My wife had the Jumbo Shrimp Ballerine, she said it was tasty, the pasta cooked perfectly & there was plenty of shrimp. Over all, a great dinner experience."}
{"text":"WOW! It's a great atmosphere and the service is AWESOME! We sat out in the porch and all of our food was YUMMY!"}
{"text":"This is the best seafood restaurant.  I love the many choices of fish.  The quality and quantity is great!  They have a variety of appetizers.  The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this is a new listing since they remodeled, but are still in the same location. The inside look of the restaurant has changed, but the menu and food are the same.  King's Fish House has been a favorite of ours since moving to town. This is one of those spots where I can count on consistently good food. Everything on the menu is good. They offer sushi, fish dishes, and some Cajun inspired dishes. When I suggest this spot to others I do warn them that this spot is as the name implies, mainly seafood. It isn't a good spot if someone in your party doesn't like seafood.  I never had a problem with the design or décor before the remodel, but the remodel is nice. The inside does seem more modern with the updates. They went with the open concept which made me worry about noise level, but it wasn't a problem. The patio still offers plenty of outdoor seating for nice days.   My favorite entrees here are the Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut and the N'awlins BBQ Shrimp. Both have great flavor and are generously portioned. The menu also changes a bit each day to feature seasonal foods and fresh fish options. My favorite appetizers here are the Edamame and Shrimp Taquitos.   There are only two suggestions I'd make for improvement here. As long as I've been coming here the menu hasn't been great at indicating which entrees come with sides. Many of the fish items come with sides, but it isn't noted on the menu in many cases. On our most recent visit the service could have used a little improvement. Our waitress stopped at our table three times before even taking our drink orders. Three times before even ordering drinks? She would say something and then run away before we could stop her. She also served bread and appetizers to my seat instead of the middle of the table. This included the appetizer ordered by our friends. Maybe I looked super hungry? It made everyone laugh, but it was a bit awkward. Service went smoothly with our entrée orders, but we started a bit shaky.  Overall, my many visits here have been five star worthy. As I mentioned, the food has never disappointed. This is a place I feel comfortable recommending to others since I know the food is consistently great."}
{"text":"Our server, Scarlett, was awesome!  She was friendly and patient (my boyfriend and I took forever to figure out what to order lol).  She also provided excellent suggestions which we loved!  We loved the food and the service was excellent, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Kings!  When we moved here we were looking for a great seafood place within walking distance to us. We love the happy hour they have and the drinks always come out perfect. We went this past Monday and had a great bartender (I totally forgot her name) and she was Awesome!  We are currently doing the whole low carb diet and she made the perfect adjustments for us and was super patient with all of our ingredient questions.  Most restaurants roll their eyes when we ask these.  We will definitely be back again on a Monday especially to see her (I feel so bad I still cannot remember her name)  Thank you for making our visit that much better!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, ambiance and service!!! Debra is an excellent waitress, super quick service, knows the food and very friendly!!  All the sides are delicious and fresh. The glazed carrots are delicious, asparagus was cooked perfectly with grill marks and the Mac and cheese was so tasty. I ordered the Mac and cheese side for my four year old and he loved it. It's pleasing to the pallet for both adults and kids.  I would like to come back when it's warmer outside and sit on the gorgeous patio.  The kids menu is a really well made activity book that helped keep my son busy. They bring warm bread right after you order, which is always nice when eating with children.   The chocolate cake is exquisite and topped with warm  gourmet chocolate sauce."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious!  Great atmosphere and our server Natalie was awesome!  I would definitely come back again here for my seafood fix."}
{"text":"We sat in the Bar side of the restaurant. At 12:45p the waiter was drunk!!  Has a beard and cursed a lot.  Very rude. Forgot our order and came back to retake it.  So pissed off. He was working as a bartender and waiter."}
{"text":"Omgoodness, how I love their Sand Dabs! We celebrated a birthday here tonight and every entree,  every appetizer,  and every drink was perfect! Annie, our amazing server, was a model of great service and accommodation.  She made a great evening even greater!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the bar to wait for our table. We ordered two house well martinis. When we received the bill, it was for $20.00. We were surprised and ask the bartender why it was so high for well vodka. She said it was the new Ambassador vodka and it was their well vodka. I think it would have been nice of her to explain that to us before we got our drinks. It was a casual restaurant and I don't believe they should charge that much and we never heard of Ambassador vodka. She said they charge $14.00 for Grey Goose, unbelievable for a restaurant of that caliber. I ordered BBQ Shrimp and had to order something else because it was too spicy, which could have been noted on the menu. My husband had the thinnest piece of trout we have ever been served and it was with a tasteless ball of plain rice.   The waiter and his service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place continues to deliver quality food....They have completely remodeled the place which makes it look like a real fish house now which you would normally expect to find in a city near water, not Vegas in the middle of the desert.  It has a great ambiance now and the menu looks like it has been redone and is more user friendly.  ]  The service is very good and even on cold days they have heaters so you can sit outside and still be comfortable.   We have not been here for a bit so it was nice to come back and see the new décor, the new menu with not only a lot of choices but it gives you detailed information about the seafood and where it comes from.  The food is amazing and like I said in the beginning it never disappoints.  This is a place I definitely feel comfortable recommending.  They also have Sushi and a FULL BAR, I am not sure about Happy Hour but I am sure they have something.    This is a place you should definitely check out."}
{"text":"I was here last Weekend with my husband and our friends. The atmosphere was very nice as was the weather that day. But we had the worst most rude and grumpy sassy server. I even got his name! Ben! He was arrogant, snarky and completely blew my mind with his horrible over all overbdemeanor toward me and my girlfriends. He seemed to go out of his way to talk down to us, yet surprisingly candid and pleasant to my husband and the other men. It was utterly offensive and quite awkward. We were speaking amongst ourselves and happened to be talking shortly about politics. He called us idiots under his breath amongst many other blatant statements about our \"uneducated\"  and \"moronic\" views. We felt so bad for his pure disdain and angry overall vibe. I'd say I will never ever go here again no matter what and I hope whatever happened to this man as a child he will find the help he so desperately needs."}
{"text":"Kong's Fish House come through with the Clam Chowda!!!!  Best I have every had. Seattle ain't got the juice, Boston ain't got the juice, or Baltimore.  You have earned the Crown for this one.  Everything else in the picture was good but that Clam Chowda tho!  Go ahead and slide in my DMs with that recipe."}
{"text":"As a local who has lived here for over 20 years and who has been to Kings numerous times, last night.was a total bummer. All service related...So bad we just got up after our drinks and walked out. Patrick, if you don't like what your doing....find something else."}
{"text":"Took my mom for a belated birthday lunch today.  We haven't been here in a while and we were super excited to go back.  Unfortunately the food was disgusting.  We ordered fish and chips and there wasn't any fish, just overly fried batter.  The service was extremely slow and we will not be back.  Way too expensive for crap food!"}
{"text":"Took my mom out for her Birthday last night. The perfect Manhattan was great, but the food and service were lacking. We started with the Calamari which was made up of very small ring pieces so that you were eating mostly the breading. Next we had the Louis salad with shrimp and crab. The serving size was large, perfect for sharing, but it came without any way to serve it! Waiter dropped the bowl at the table and walked away. Thought he was going to get some large serving spoons to toss and serve the salad. When we asked him, he said that they do not have anything like that. He did come back with a pair of tongs. If you are not going to provide anything, they just toss it table-side?!?   Next up was our entrees, I ordered the Macadamia Crusted Halibut. The Halibut was overcooked and the mac crust was almost non-existent. Menu should have read \"hint of Macadamia Nut Crust\". The birthday girl ordered the Littleneck clams which was the worst dish of the night. The broth looked and tasted like dishwater. The waiter sent over the general manager who offered to take the clams and the halibut off the bill which was the right thing to do, but I am always surprised when someone is given the opportunity to turn-around any customer service experience, and they just let the opportunity go by. Most dissatisfied customers just leave and do not come back. So simple just to bring something else over and say this is more representative of what we do here at Kings Fish House... and give the diners a chance to like the restaurant.   My mom did not even want to try the desserts so we ended up singing happy bday next door at Lucilles Smokehouse BBQ next door. The Peach Cobbler was amazing!  Overall, I do not get the 4.5 stars that this place has. Service and food quality needs to improve to match the $$$ pricing."}
{"text":"They are only getting 1 star for how the decor is and there was 1 person (busser) who make this review 1 star.  Let's start with the food...oh no not good. For being a fish house, you would be expecting some fresh seafood.  We ordered the crabcakes, they were over cooked (picture of them) and the crab was not good, definitely tasted store bought, not fresh crab.  Also ordered the claw chowder. I would say Progresso soup brand is 100% better than this! It was so watery and no flavor to it whatsoever.  Main dish was the halibut macadamia nut crusted, again not a fresh piece of fish. Definitely covered in the macadamia nut crust to mask the fact that it's not a fresh piece of fish.  I had ordered a Riesling glass of wine in the beginning of our service. It was so bitter. I told the server and he took the Riesling and said are you sure you ordered a Riesling? I said I'm better sure I know what I ordered and what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. He took the glass and didn't offer me anything and brought me back \"another\" glass of the same wine and just left.   Last, which my husband tells me why did you even order dessert if we already didn't like any of the food...good point I know but it was a mistake too late and I ordered the apple cobbler. I had noticed that there was no note next to the item on the menu mentioning the extra time to make it nor did the server say that this item make take a few minutes to make. Apple cobbler came out 3 minutes later and it was cold, not how a cobbler is supposed to be made at all. Needless to say we didn't eat that either.  Server didn't even notice that we barely touched anything and no manager came to our table for a table touch.   I will definitely not be returning here again!"}
{"text":"Every time I am driving on the 215 and I see the district area, I always wondered what was inside! Checked out the resurants and saw a Seafood place!   I was in the area and I was starving.. Seafood was the only thing on my mind!  Upon entry I saw outside seating and outside heating, it was chilly but I could feel how warm the heaters were so we sat outdoors!  I ordered the \"World Class\" Tuna melt! Comes with Albacore tuna confit, grilled NY rye bread, tomato, remoulade, and melted Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese!  Okay so our food took about 20 minutes to prepare, and I started to question where it was at.  However.   After receiving my food and taking a bite out of the melt. All was forgiven.   You can TASTE the quality. Exploding with flavor. I cannot even begin to describe how happy I felt! I haven't had a quality sandwhich of this level in a while!  It also came with fries and a giant pickle! Couldn't tell what kind of pickle it was though, they didn't clarify!  So so soooooo many options. Of course I will return to try others!  The swordfish tacos are next!"}
{"text":"I love seafood! This King's Fish house is in a great location at the district, there's plenty of shopping and it's right next to the casino! My girlfriend loves the lemon nut crusted Seabass, (when they have it), and I usually get the New Orleans barbecue shrimp! Tasty and spicy. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good seafood."}
{"text":"Wow, just moved to Henderson and found our favorite seafood place.  Enjoyed delicious appetizers.  Even my son said \"the food was great\". Our waitress Karyne was awesome."}
{"text":"I wish I had taken pictures because the presentation was great. We had Crispy Calamari for an appetizer, the sauces were great, the calamari was good. Not rubbery at all but a little too well done. i like it lightly fried. I had Scallop and Shrimp grilled with garlic mashed potatoes and spinach. At first i didnt think it would be enough but it was perfect portion. Tasted amazing with the butter sauce. Spinach was whole spinach sauteed and was great. mashed potatoes excellent. My husband had BBQ shrimp, I think it was a cajun sauce but he hasnt stopped talking about it. it was just spicy enough so not to mask the delicious flavors. He gave it 10 stars. ok. he is very hard to please so im thinking it was good. lol , his side was crispy brussel sprouts which were amazing. my son had the Lobster roll which he said was amazing. He has had many lobster rolls over the years and this one was his favorite. I had key lime pie for dessert which was just a little too tart for me but great with the home made whipped cream. My husband and son had Butter cake with the ice cream and whip cream which both tasted like heaven. mom had apple cobbler which she wishes she had leftovers from because she wanted more. lol I had a lemon drop as a drink and it was great. my husband had a beer king crab honey blonde, 22 oz. amazing! mom had Buehler white zin wine. all great. Service was fantastic. We had Amie as our server and made sure we were ok but not hovering. It gets busy. i know why. Its great."}
{"text":"We started with the Oyster Sampler, a dozen. Unbelievably delicious! The oysters were from the East coast, West coast, Canada and Mexico. They were fresh and darn good!! The Calimari app was great, too. Try both sauces cause they were both super yummy! The Ahi Poke? Holee Molee!  Delicious!  The Margheritas rocked as well!! Great food, great service!! We will be going back here!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service just a little over priced and portions are small. The margarita was also too sour and not of the best quality liquor. Given 4 stars as all the meals for our table of 6 were delicious."}
{"text":"It was a nice place ate outside. Fish was dry for me but I'm an island boy. Overall good place to relax when it's not crowded"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. I can always count on friendly service and food I love whether I'm eating healthy or indulging in multiple loaves of their delicious sourdough bread. They customize my meal however I want it and they really care if I'm enjoying it. I once had a manager come over because he noticed I wasn't eating something and it was like a team intervention- they sent out the chef to help me find something I'd enjoy and the server was SO pleasant and honestly was happy that I was able to get a meal I enjoyed."}
{"text":"A while back I had the pleasure of dinning at the Santa Monica Watergrill with old friends that all worked at JPL in Pasadena. I have had the pleasure of eating at other Kings Fish houses and have always enjoyed them all. recently I moved to Henderson and was really happy to find what I would call the best  Kings Fish House of all. My friend ordered the Chapino and I had the South African Lobster Tails. All I can say is what a great meal !! Everything was perfect. We sat out on the outside and that made it even more enjoyable, I will be back for sure and soon. All my old buddies from Jpl will be here in October and we will deffinitely dine here."}
{"text":"I ordered the King Crab and it was amazing! The crab was fresh and done perfectly.  The spinach was good, sautéed w garlic and the Mac and cheese was good but the crab, delicious. And great service too."}
{"text":"Wow!!! What a amazing place to eat! Never been a seafood person but my friends wanted to go! We had the most amazing server her name was Haleigh! Helped us thought the whole experience glasses were always filled and she always had a smile on her face hands down best serves I've ever had will recommend to every one   Thank you kings for a amazing experience"}
{"text":"Came here after being horrendously disatisfied at the bbq place right next door- Turns out this was a way better choice anyways. While it is slightly pricey, it is well worth it- Waitress was amazingly friendly and attentive, knowledgeable about he menus and very friendly to our daughter. I was very happy with the oyster sampler- found my new favorite! Fish and chips were amazing, as well as everything else we got.  I will say- for great seafood, and amazing service- this is a must go."}
{"text":"Good and solid, a very good alternative to all the restaurants in the District.  Prices are OK, had the mussels and they were VERY good, the crispy calamari was good but not crispy :( ...."}
{"text":"There are a lot of things that I like about this restaurant. The first thing that I like the most is the ambiance and accommodations. We sat on a booth in their outdoor patio and enjoyed the nice weather. The service was great and the food came promptly.   Another thing that I like about this restaurant is the variety of food. I like that it offers a variety of seafood including sushi. I ordered their sushi platter and it had 1 roll (8 pieces) and 6 pieces of nigiri. I also ordered their fish tacos and these were super good. Their portion of fish was really hearty!  As an appetizer I had their artichoke and calamari. Both these dishes were good. Next time I visit though, I don't think I will be repeating the calamari. Even though it was tasty, it really didn't have anything special.   I think it is important to note that the place does get busy. I would suggest doing a reservation which can be done online. When I was there there was a party of at least 15 and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves. Point is, that it looks like a great spot for big parties."}
{"text":"Good but not great: fish and chips, sirloin steak,  steak tacos.  Service was pretty slow.  Kids meals pricing $7 does not include additional $2 for drinks so this is almost 2x vs other restaurants for small kids."}
{"text":"Had a good meal at Kings on a Sunday evening, but not a great one.  It had been a few years since I'd been to Kings, one of my favorite (and most frequented) places when I lived in the Valley.  The renovation looks great, it's a little more open throughout the restaurant, but they kept the large circular booths while I liked.  The menu renovation I wasn't so happy with as a couple of my favorites were gone.  But, a lot of the usual suspects remained.  We were seated and immediately approached by our server.  She was pretty good throughout the evening, we had a couple of empty glasses waiting for refills, but nothing major.  And, she was prompt with the check and payment.  So, on the whole I'd say we received good service.  To start, we went with the ahi poke and the Mexican shrimp cocktail.  The poke was served with sauce, avocado, and crispy wonton chips.  I loved it, it was a strong version of this classic dish.  I could have eaten this for my meal and been sated.  The shrimp cocktail was good, but not great.  The shrimp were cooked well and chilled, but the sauce lacked any kind of punch.  I would call it a step up from ketchup rather than good cocktail sauce.    The table also split a dozen oysters which were very good.  Kings's menu changes daily, so the available oysters also change daily.  We received a card which noted which oysters were in our dozen.  They were all very clean, chilled, and large.  Good quality.    For my entree, I went with the appetizer portion of the famous N'awlins BBQ shrimp.  This is one of the dishes that (thankfully) survived the transformation at Kings.  The appetizer portion has 7 shrimp, bread for dipping, and no rice for $12.75.  I couldn't put my finger on it, but it didn't quite taste the same as it used to.  It definitely didn't have the spice I remember, I know that.  It was still good, and the sauce is still great for dipping.  But, I would call this more of a tomato sauce than a BBQ sauce.  I'd get it again, but I don't think it's the exact same recipe.  Kings may have changed, but it's still a strong spot and one of the better options in the District.  I would return on future trips back to the Valley."}
{"text":"The quality and portion size was not worth the price.  $40.00 for two medium crab legs.  The wait staff  was very friendly.  Our server, Scarlett,  was very friendly and knowledgeable. She made the visit a great experience."}
{"text":"Been here many times over the years. Tonight not only was the quality not up to par, service was not on point at all. The worst part about bad service is if the food is off point as well. No apologize or relief from management. I ordered the King Crab you would think the last place that would server rubbery crab legs would be a seafood restaurant. Not only were they over cook but they were cold as well. Vegetables were awful at best had rosemary potatoes which were ok, but asparagus over cooked as well. Most place's keep your beverage glass full & there was no offer of desert just a check dropped on the table. Guys there is too much competition in the area for bad service. This place has seen better days."}
{"text":"Wow, it's been a short while since my family and have been here. We were happy and looking forward to eating here at first.Unfortunately, our experience was off to a terrible start. Which began with a rude and amature hostess. We had to wait to be seated. Then the host denied our request so we couldn't be seated out side. It seems that requires a reservation per the host. Mean while , you would naturally expect this type of nonesense when the place is full. Instead , the place was 30% seated maximum . Many empty tables and chairs. Actually tied of empty tables. So why the drama ? What happen to accommodating the customer ? Really? The place is nowhere busy and you offer to seat us at the bar instead, with an 11 year child ?? Mind you this about 6pm on a Monday !!!! Good manager would fire a host that treats people poorly.  A dinning experience starts with a great accomidating,customer service oriented and respectful host.  Service beyond that was marginal as my first glass sat empty until the check arrived. No refill what so ever.  At this point the point not even a meal by Wolf gang Pick home self can fix a ruined evening. Never again ."}
{"text":"Passable fish/seafood restaurant but the two meals I've eaten there were truly JUST mediocre. There MUST be a better fish restaurant in the local area!"}
{"text":"Food and service was on point. Our server did not miss a beat. Came in for lunch and celebrating with a party of 7. Drank the white wine of the house and it was good. Had the tuna, broussel sprouts and asparagus. Veggies cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal but found it rather pricey, more $$$ not $$ as per YELP.  And here I am a guy from DC complaining about the prices!  I've never paid over $30 for a dozen raw oysters (until now) but I will say they were fresh and wonderful - fair value here. We had the mixed oysters (two from each of six regions) and it was fun comparing their flavor and texture. I had the fresh greens salad which was colorful and nicely presented but small and came with only a tiny sliver of avocado.  The waitress suggested the grilled halibut which was good but on the dry side.  My friend had the cioppino which he liked but commented that the chef had too heavy a hand on the pepper for his taste.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  Overall I did not feel the quality or quantity of the fare hit the mark well enough to justify the price of the meal."}
{"text":"Staff was great and management is wonderful especially for Mother's Day. I didnt give 5 star because my wife's lobster had a tag wire that she almost chocked. My Sea Bass was gummy. But Manager was very friendly. Well I do work in a restaurant also so, no BS was applied especially if it is a health code violation. All in all the bread was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great scallops, delicious sea bass, pasta was done right, sauces were nothing to write home about and the oysters were delish. The winner of the night was easily the swordfish. Perfectly prepared.   I believe it was Deborah, or Debra? I am not sure.  She was absolutely a delight. She made the evening absolutely 100% enjoyable. She was training new staff yet treated us like royalty. She deserves the keys to the place.    I am a bourbon, straight whiskey guy and the bar needs some work on their old fashion. It was a featured drink I think and I have had better at dive bars (only reason for the 4 stars). Problem was solved when I ordered the bulleit frontier on the rocks.  Wife loved it, will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"I have been dining at this location on a fairly regular basis over the last nine years ... Thrilled to walk in tonight and to find they have remodeled and revamped the menu.  As always the oysters and fish were fresh but tonight the atmosphere was fresh as well.  Servers were very attentive and knowledgeable.    Tonight we had Naked Cowboy Oysters that were absolutely awesome!  The large Shushi platter that consisted of a variety of fish and roll - every piece fresh and tasty!  Oh yes even though the weather was not conducive this evening  I can't wait too try the new outdoor seating it looked very cozy and comfy..  If you haven't been in for awhile give it a try ... You will like it!"}
{"text":"I love the new patio and will for sure be back based on the patio alone.   The service is still not great for the prices they charge.   If the service improved,  this would be a 5 star place.   Food is good."}
{"text":"Great meal with my daughter for her birthday(8yr). Staff was excellent and responsive.  They brought out a live lobster for my daughter to look at. They even brought her a free dessert.  Food was fried perfection.  Thank you again for the great evening!!"}
{"text":"Swordfish was great. Was super busy. Load, was hard to hear the waitress.Wait staff did their best to serve everyone in a timely manner. Will return just not during peak hours."}
{"text":"It you like the fish, this is the place.  But if you are with seafood lovers and you prefer Vegetarian, Vegan or want a non-seafood dish, don't go.  Burgers are just burgers.  A Southwest Salad with dry...I mean \"Blackened\" Chicken is just a salad with dry chicken.  My wife's trout was good, but what good is it if everyone else is enjoying their fish and we non-fish eaters have to have a burger or chicken, or worse, you're looking for Vegetarian and they don't have any menu items specifically created as Vegetarian?  Listen up King's.....ADD TRUE VEGETARIAN ITEMS TO YOUR MENU, TOUT THEM TO THE WORLD AND WATCH YOU REVENUE POP SOME."}
{"text":"I am so sorry to our server as I forgot your name and the manager too. He pitched in until the waitress could get there.  It was busy and they still did a top notch job. the service was great and each person that came past the table asked if we needed anything.  Thank you for making a nice Birthday dinner for my husband.  UPDATE  I found my notes the manager was Daniel and the terrific waitress is Scarlett. Thank you and we will return soon."}
{"text":"Jen is an awesome bartender.  She is always very friendly and always remembers my drink."}
{"text":"Delicious or Easters delicious clam chowder soup and the most delicious fish plates cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"I was looking for good fried seafood and this was not it. The doors to outside were open so we walked in through the bar. Our first time here, by the way. Stood at a booth waiting for someone to notice us. I then saw what looked to be the actual starting point . Two girls there. The hostess looked right at me, eye contact, and went on chit chatting. There were some high management people there and we were seated right behind them. They were NOT impressive! The hostess had plenty of time to go into the private office multiple times kissing butt. Always came out laughing and smiling. I never saw her even smile at any customers. Amazing. I ordered the King's Platter. Fish, scallops, and shrimp. What I got was a joke. I know seafood. Grew up on the shores on the East coast. I understood that seafood out here would not be all that great. It was worse than that. The scallops were tiny and only got 3. They were undercooked. Only 3 shrimp, although they were butterfly, slightly undercooked as well. Fish was fine. Hard to screw up ONE small piece of Long John Silver whitefish ! Will post pictures to see the size. The pictures  make it look bigger than it is. Now, had I paid $10.00, might have been acceptable if everything was cooked properly. The cost for that BASKET, NOT platter, was $ 19.75 plus tax. This place is a joke. The people that like this place must love to get ripped off and not understand what quality seafood is. Seriously. I could have gotten similar at a fast food joint for 6 bucks and it probably would have tasted better.   If you know seafood, you do not want this. No need to trust me. Give it a shot. Our waiter was good. Only decent thing about this dump"}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I have been in restaurants and food/beverage service for over 20 years and all over the country. So I won't get super critical just a couple of points more for the management there. 1. Mac and Cheese....as a side. There are TWO (main) ingredients. Why did you send me a $35 plate with a bowl of cooked macaroni that was then placed under a broiler which resulted in drying it out? THAT IS CRAZY! Where is Gordon Ramsey when you need him? And he freaks out on the 30 year old asking how to make a Grilled Cheese Sandwich! The mashed potatoes that I had replace the mac...aroni...was delish! 2. Smaller than expected Scallops, especially for the price. But whatever. It's vegas? I know they came in frozen so no big deal really. BUT, they were overcooked. A little. But enough. While the color on the outside was very very nice....too much heat/time... so close. But enough to go from Wow to Ehhh. $35 Ehhhh?  Hmmmm. 3. While the number one greeting that I hate Hate HATE with all my passion and all my heart is when the server asks \"How are WE tonight?\" \"Do WE want to start with some drinks from the bar?\"   To which I want to say \"WE would love to...YOU are not invited!\" Get's under my skin I could go on for hours about how rude that is (to me.)  THAT SAID.... THE SERVICE WAS AMAZING. FRIENDLY. SINCERE. HELPFUL. 5 stars for the servers!! 4. Atmosphere: can't speak about inside but totally love Love LOVE the patio!  Great place to bring a date or go with somebody you love or business when it is important!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome!  Renovation looks very cool.  We eat there frequently.  Great for kids too."}
{"text":"Such a shame that its only 2 stars because the food is actually very delicious... when you're order is correct.  Just finished lunch there and the menus weren't finished printing, the food took 45 minutes to get to the table, and the waitress had excuses of multiple parties showing up at once and the Health inspector arriving.  I received the Louie salad I ordered and it was missing the egg and avocado.  I  ordered it with ranch dressing and it was brought with blue cheese. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Went out to eat here on a Saturday night. It took forever for the waitress to take our orders and even longer for the food to come out. then to make matters worse they forgot to bring out the clams we ordered. The fish sticks were soggy and gross. We sent the fish sticks back to the kitchen. Not coming back. They didn't even bother comping the fish sticks we sent back!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try Kings....for years and never got around to it until now.  Kings Fish house is in The District next to Lucilles and Color Me Mine.  I believe it's the only other OG restaurant besides Lucilles.   To stand the test of time, you have to be good.     Fried calamari with 2 dipping sauces.  Loved it!   The calamari were crisp on the outside.  Tender on the inside.   They were served with a spicy sweet Thai style sauce and an fry sauce style aioli.  Both very good   California roll.  Standard roll.  Good.   Macadamia nut crusted halibut with orange sauce.  Fish was light and tasty but a bit too much sauce just personal taste.  Mac and cheese was good.   mashed potatoes so smooth and buttery.    Spaghetti with tomato sauce.  Standard"}
{"text":"We frequent this Fish House a few times a year. Our first trip since the remodel and we love it!! Sat outside and the misters are nice.  Scarlett was a rockstar!!!!!! Food was, as always spectacular and service was great!   This is our favorite fish/seafood place in LV!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! My daughter took me here on a weekday for an early Mother's Day dinner. Our servers name was Nicole, she was fairly new there but a \"no BS\" girl which I liked. I just can't stand when a server says \"everything is good\". I want to know the TRUTH! Especially if I'm going to YELP you after.   Oysters were delicious, clam chowder was a little thick for my taste but absolutely better than being watery. We shared the sea bass.. delicious! Had the crispy Brussels sprouts and butter corn for our sides. Brussels were crispy and corn was excellent! Not dripping with butter... when it's dripping with butter I can't eat it... it's gross to me. Plus for added extra amazingness... it was fresh cut corn from the cob!! I know that DOES NOT happen at all restaurants. When I saw this I knew this place was the real deal!"}
{"text":"macademia nut Halibut should have had sweet sauce on top , calif roll was good, corn was real corn, the grilled zucchini was exceptional, waiter wAs very good."}
{"text":"I had been craving some sand dabs for ages & I heard that only King's has them, so we drove out to Henderson for our first visit.    First, about booze in this entertainment capital of the world:  It frustrates me (bordering sometimes on anger) that every restaurant & bar in town (incl. casinos) only offer urine-like beer specials:  Coors, Bud Light, Miller; & consider domestic NOT to be Blue Moon or Sierra Nevada, so we pay more for them.  And the wine?  Why, oh why, does every establishment (incl. casinos) have rot-gut wine as their house for $5 & up, even on happy hour?  I mean, they're buying it by the gazillion cases, so can't they offer up a Kendall-Jackson at least?  I can drive nearby to Trader Joe's & buy any number of terrific bottles of wine for $5-8, so why give those guys $5 & up for a glass?  About music in this entertainment capital of the world:  Ever go into a restaurant & liked the music so much you said to a server \"Wow, man, what's that great vibe you got playing?\"  It is either of these choices:  Pandora, too quiet, too noisy, too unfitting for that particular place, & definitely canned.  Why can't   a n y b o d y  choose live music & keep our musicians from leaving town to stay alive?  We went into a terrific mom & pop Greek restaurant for our 1st time the other day & they had on beautiful Greek music.  What a concept.  In a Greek restaurant no less.  So... we arrived at 5:00 & not many people were there yet.  The happy hour drink menu was $5.00 for an ordinary wine & import beers, so I ordered the Chardonnay.  The main drink menu was over-priced (espec. on most beers at $7.00).  We had an efficient server, though she didn't ask if we wanted water.  I of course chose the sand dabs ($22.00) & my partner had the crab cake platter ($21.00).    I found the selection of sides for a fish restaurant to be unusual & otherwise common:  carrots, zucchini, baked potato, mashed potato, spinach, mac & cheese.  WHAAT?  No rice?  I chose baked potato & spinach but had to send the spinach back when it was over-salted, & instead chose the coleslaw (very bland).  The sand dabs are a delicate fish, like sole, so being heavily battered took away the taste & then caused me to wonder how fresh they were.  My partner said his crab cakes were good & they came with coleslaw & french fried (duh).  It was surprising that I had to ask for lemons at a fish establishment.  A return visit?  Not for the food, not for the drinks, not for the choices.  So, just for the ambiance & friendly server?  I don't think so."}
{"text":"Last night went to Kings Fish House for dinner. Sat on the patio and had Karyne as our server.  She went over the whole menu with us and I got the macadamia crusted halibut she recommended. It was amazing. My friends shared the fresh grilled halibut and they loved it!   We had the key lime pie for dessert.  Our server was always smiling and super friendly. We will definitely be back! Thank you Karyne for your great recommendations and excellent service.."}
{"text":"Meh. This place has been getting increasingly worse over the years. The service is always OK, but the food quality is really lacking. This is especially problematic given their pricing. On my most recent trip I ordered scallops and they were fishy tasting and just lackluster. I didnt even end up finishing them, which is pretty abnormal for me. Next time I want seafood in Henderson, I wont be headed here."}
{"text":"Jen was great in the bar. I came in looking for fresh Oysters.  She recommended a fantastic dozen. They where awesome!  Great service, great fun! Jen in the bar is super cool!"}
{"text":"I don't have one bad word for Kings. The food is delicious, the Service is fabulous, and the atmosphere is wonderful. We always sit on the outdoor covered patio that is heated in the winter and cooled by fans in the summer. A very enjoyable and tasty place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night, ordered the fish & chips kids menu item, half dozen sampler oysters, sea bass, red rockfish, 2 beers, and 2 creme brûlées. Total bill came to $105. The kids dish was a small piece of fish with a lot of batter, but it was hand battered and tasted good. The fries weren't great. Raw oyster sampler was fun because you can taste the difference between locations (Canada's was gross- possibly turning, but the rest were delicious). The oysters are probably the only thing I'd get again. Both the sea bass and rockfish were overdone and dry/chewy with not much seasoning. Sides were good, the spinach, glazed carrots, and mashed potatoes were tasty, but the mac & cheese seemed soggy and flavorless. Dessert was creme brûlée which tasted good but was unevenly heated. Beautifully creamy and warm in the outside but the middle was still chilled and stiff. I will say that the server was extremely nice and the other servers also were friendly. Overall this was a disappointing experience. We had been here a year ago and remembered it being much better. The restaurant was not even half full while we were there so I really don't understand why our dishes were so neglected."}
{"text":"King's Fish House was a great dining experience!  My friends and I dined in the patio area which were equipped with cute, comfortable booths that were perfect for lunch. I was actually impressed with the service since the food came out surprisingly quick and the waitress was attentive.   I tried the New England Clam Chowder and it was really delicious! It was very savory without being too salty and had the right amount of thickness to it. I'm actually craving it again now that I'm talking about it!   I also ordered the Beer Battered Fish and Chips (3 pieces of fish for $17.50, 2 pieces for $15.50). The Pacific Cod was quite fresh and crispy. The batter consistency was great! I liked the fact that they gave big pieces of fish too - much larger than I expected or had seen in other pictures. My only complaint was that it didn't seem like the oil from frying the fish was blotted enough so there was oil just sitting in the dish that made some of the fish and fries soggy ):   The only cons for me were the oiliness of the Fish and Chips and the fact that the meal was on the more expensive end but other than that, I can't wait to come back here and try the other seafood dishes!"}
{"text":"With Valentine's Day falling on a weekend night, my wife and I really wanted no part of the Strip, or maybe it was just me because I wanted to have some extra cash in my wallet. We still wanted the closest, available seafood deciding on King's Fish House. I ended up not having any extra cash in my wallet and we left satisfied with the oysters, but execution on our entrees had room for improvement.  Our reservation was at 7 PM and we were seated immediately when we arrived jumping in front of two or three walk up couples. Our server did not come to the table until ten minutes after we were sat, but one of his colleagues in the next section over was aware enough to take our drink order. My wife had a cosmo and I had a Deschutes black butte porter. The full menu was available along with a special 3 course menu with about four or five different options for apps, entrees, and dessert. On normal days, the menu usually changes day to day depending on availability of product.  The strength of King's is their varied selection from the raw bar which includes east and west coast oysters, shellfish, and cold platters. Getting raw seafood in Henderson, NV is going to cost you, but there isn't a place that is going to give you this much selection. The sushi or cooked items won't keep me coming back, but the raw bar will.  Along with some warm sourdough bread, we started with 18 oysters, 6 kumamoto ($17.60), 6 fanny bay ($14.60), and 6 wellfleet ($16.10). The oysters were served with cocktail sauce, a mignonette, and shredded horseradish which I was not fond of at all because as opposed to a horseradish sauce, it increased the chew factor when taking down the oyster. Although smaller, I preferred the two west coast oysters with their sweeter finish.  For entrees, overcooked was the theme. My wife had the grilled yellowtail ($18.75) with spinach and mac & cheese The filet was on the tough side and flesh didn't flake away. I had the three course meal ($50.95) which included a California roll, prime top sirloin and South African lobster tail, and key lime pie for dessert. Most of the flavor was cooked out of my proteins. Both were edible but cooked over just enough to lose the juiciness of the steak and the sweetness of the lobster tail. The pooling of juice on top of my steak and the dryness after I cut it suggest that it was taken straight from the grill and not given any resting time. For dessert, we split the chocolate cake and the key lime pie. The cake was rich and moist, but the pie was no longer set and mushy when it arrived at the table.  The fumbling of the entrees, especially mine which was one of the most expensive ones on the menu, shouldn't get a pass but I'll give them one because this was an outlier from previous experiences. I'll also give the service a pass because of the night and time we were there."}
{"text":"On a day date, on a sunny afternoon, we got to sit and enjoy King's Fish House. Since this was our first time, we decided to do some small bites and share.   My husband and I tried their sushi as well as their crab cakes and baked PEI mussels  which were YUMMMMM. I definitely recommend their yellowtail carpaccio and spicy tuna roll that's made with crispy rice!   I enjoyed a glass of wine as he dabbled in a beer to keep the drinks simple.   The server was very patient and polite and the ambiance was casual and cool. The patio gets busy on a nice day outside but the inner tables worked just as well.  Next time we come we want to try more from the raw bar as well as split an entire - there sea bass and bok Choi! The feel is a mix of a west coast fish house + some Asian flair."}
{"text":"I had the baked mussels and the lobster crunchy roll along with the kings albacore roll. They were amazing, I just really wish they had bud Light on tap."}
{"text":"Went here for my friends birthday. The restaurant side is as noisy as hell, but the bar side is nice and quiet with big booths. Service was good. We had a spicy tuna sushi appetizer that was delicious. the steamed clams were iffy at best and my wife's fish and my friends fish were both great. my lobster was all right. I would probably go back again."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here Friday night. We sat on the patio and it was just right, not noisy. Our sever was very nice and attentive, an excellent waitress for being new to the resturant (I wish I could remeber her name). Our food was fresh and delicious, macadamia nutt crusted halibut and dungeness crab with a warm apple cobbler for dessert. We thoroughly enjoyed our date night here."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local restaurants. Had a couple seafood salads tonight. They were huge. Our waiter Jose was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Fantastic seafood: they offer regional specials, wild fish and Cajun seasoned dishes. The patio looks like a cute outdoor area from New Orleans and the interior design is very classic, beautiful and comfy!   The only drawback is the service: in general the service quality cannot keep up with the food quality. Ben however is very charismatic and attentive - one of my favorite servers in town!  Update: David is also great- he is very accommodating and nice!"}
{"text":"Went here with a co-worker.  The food was delicious.  They have sushi on the menu also. I had the Nawlins shrimp and the baked salmon role.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"BUSY, busy...stop here for some fresh seafood...salmon cooked in a paper bag, vegetables and all, absolutely delicious. SUSHI here a must try-- Order the baked salmon and baked scallops roll...along with the shrimp tempura roll acompanied with SAKE Nigori....pleasant atmosphere...outdoor seating- it's in the District... I'll bring my seafood lovers here for sure !!"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom for a quick snack in the bar. The bartender, Alex, was fantastic. He took great care of us. Food was delicious. The manager, Erwin, stopped by and was very welcoming. All around great atmosphere and fantastic food and drinks."}
{"text":"The location in the District is convenient. The ambience of the restaurant is laid out perfectly. Good distance away from other guests so your conversations are private. Even without reservations, we are seated immediately. Our waiter, Jose, pleasantly greets us, takes our drink order and returns. Since it is our first dining experience there, he quickly and efficiently explains how to maneuver the menu, makes excellent suggestions and recommendations. He returns with delicious warm sour dough bread. We had 3 great entrees- steak, tacos and Louie Salad. We shared the warm lemon cake with homemade vanilla bean ice cream and fresh fruit. Best dessert I ever had. I know I will come back again for that alone and the impeccable, attentive service of Jose."}
{"text":"Waitstaff was extremely nice. Food was not great. Had the crab cocktail, crab didn't taste fresh. Husband had the beet salad and added salmon, cost $30. Clam chowder was decent. I love pudding so I ordered the banana pudding, it was not pudding. It was some sort of cool whip dessert with soggy nilla wafers. Only thing I liked was the raspberry lemonade with mint, wasn't too sweet, just perfect. I feel this place is overpriced and the food wasn't great so we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING. Let me just spell that out to get my point across: A M A Z I N G. I have to be in the mood for sea food, however the moment I walked in I knew this place was going to be delicious. The hostess let us know that they just remodeled (it was news to me since I had never been there before), and it looked absolutely fantastic. Everything was clean, the decor was beautiful, and the staff was very nice. I ordered the hazelnut crusted salmon with asparagus and mac and cheese. The salmon was fresh and cooked to perfection, the asparagus was delightful, and the mac and cheese hit the spot. They also had all of my favorite deserts on their desert menu such as bread pudding with rum sauce, creme brulle (excuse my misspelling), and cheesecake. I would be pleased to come here again soon!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here and every time I had a good time. Food is always good, the steaks are yummy, the lobster is also real good. The butter cake is amazing. I would compare it to mastro's famous butter cake. Almost as good just a smaller size. Drinks are good too and they have a few cool alcohol free cocktails to choose from which is a plus.  Service is so and so - it really depends who is serving you - I had real great experiences and real so-so to rude which is why 4*. However, this would never keep me from coming back :))"}
{"text":"Kings Fish House provided an enjoyable evening for me and my wife. This place is situated in the center of The District.  Nice location for a Sunday dinner.    The place was remodeled in the recent past and they did a great job.   Nice dining area, great patio and a cozy bar.  Depending on your mood, will determine where you sit.   We chose the main dining room.   The front of house has their act together.  The hostess seated us quickly and efficiently.  The server arrived promptly and took our drink order.  After drinks she took our order and delivered some great bread.    Our meals arrived hot and it looked great on the plate. The rockfish was prepared perfectly as was the catfish.  The sautéed spinach was tasty.    The quality of the food was top notch, the quantity of food was perfect.   The pricing was a bit high but you are in The District so you can expect to pay a premium for the location and it was not high enough to keep me away.    When we are looking for a nice, casual evening out, this place will be high on out list. Kings Fish House hits all the right notes."}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC and I wanted to experience some  sushi rolls. Couldn't decide but without being asked the sushi chef ( wearing a shirt that said \"raw talent\" (cute! ) made all my sushi plates for me and everything was delicious and things I would typically not order. Loved that everything was not overloaded with rice. Friend had beer salad she loved. It was quiet for a Sunday afternoon wish they had more specials including drinks ( yes there's a nice bar) but the sushi chef made our visit special."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars. The food is generally pretty good. The last time we were here one of the people in our party had an issue with their food. The waitress came by and asked how everything was, he hesitantly mentioned the issue with his food. The waitress apologized, but didn't offer to do anything. He was only a few bites in, so it's not like he's already eating the meal. The fact that she asked what how everything was, then apologized, but did nothing pretty much ruined my meal. For what they charge I would expect a little bit higher quality."}
{"text":"***update 2/21/17*** Food:  -The Spa - mocktail. So refreshing and limey! I can't wait to drink this again!! -Kumamoto oysters - 1 dozen. Heavenly! -New England clam chowder with delectable sourdough bread. Delish! -crunchy calamari - great as well. Ask for lemon and cocktail sauce, otherwise it's not on the plate.   *** Food: lunchtime cod fish tacos and King combo on the \"favorites\" menus and 1/2 dozen Kumamoto oysters. Everything was delish! Oysters tasted fresh from the sea and served with mignonette. Fish tacos came with guacamole and chips. Fresh baked sourdough bread for table.   Service: friendly and enjoyable service by Lisa. Very kid friendly! Provided my niece with a super cute plastic sippy cup to take home and coloring menu with crayola crayons and temporary tattoos!   Location: conveniently located in the district next to the kids splash pad."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as was decor and cleanliness.  However the service was poor.  I have worked in many restaurants and this kind of attitude starts from the top down... it's a shame because this could be a truly excellent restaurant.  The waitress was MIA the entire dinner.  No drinks filled... no side of ranch we ordered.  Other staff delivered the food... she never checked back until the food was gone and then proceeded to suggest desert.  The manager should be out seeing empty drinks and overseeing the seating so that one waitress isn't taking all the tables.  It benefits her with tips but hurts the customer.  Went to the bar at one point to get drinks and while there was only myself and one other patron it took five minutes to get contact.  The other customer ordered a drink then was told to sit back at the table by the waiter... then the waiter proceeded up to the bar two feet away to carry his drink.  The bar was mostly empty.  He wasn't rude to the customer but the reason was clear.  Just another example of tips before service by the staff.  Seems to me the inmates are running the asylum."}
{"text":"I have seen this place in the Green Valley area now for over a decade and thought dammit I have to try it if it's still here. Walked in on a slow day, ponied up at the bar and had the shrimp taquitos, oysters, artichoke, and the bbq shrimp. Not bad, not good, exactly what you'd expect. The bartender definitely did not want to be there and looked like she had a rough night before, but hey we've all been there so I can't dock them for that. And this may not make any sense but the atmosphere, uniforms and overall feel seems to be identical like the Lucille's next door just with sea food and better patio seating. This place has been reviewed sooo many times so all I have to say it's that it is a decent seafood spot in the district with good patio seating."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for a birthday get-together and had a wonderful time! Our server Nicole was very knowledgeable about wine and oysters and was such a doll. We had the oyster sampler paired with a Sauvignon blanc that Nicole recommended and it was to die for! Dinner was superb and to top it off, the butter cake was amazing. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Every time I come to town I stop by, the food and cocktails are delicious! The service is always spectacular, the staff is warm, welcoming, kind, and knowledgeable. There's a nice warm vibe, I'll just say, it's an overall nice experience."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and most of all the food. Our server was fast and courteous. The food delicious. The menu has a wide variety other just fish. The children's menu is a typical but the food was great. My picky daughter loved the food as much as we did which is not all that common. Most restaurants have good adult food and the kids meal lacks. Not here! The Sushi for me was very good. My wife loved the fish and chips so much I had to try it. Crispy outside and delicious inside.  It was a great family outing all around. We will be back again."}
{"text":"It was my first time there but I had always wanted to check this restaurant out.. finally on this Sunday, we got to try it.   First, I appreciate the atmosphere of the place, we sat outside and it was a perfect.   I had a Bloody Mary and my boyfriend had a few beers, and we ordered fish and chips and lobster roll... food was delicious. I'm so pleased because it exceeded my expectations. The food was incredibly fresh, which the waitress explained is standard, but I was happy and impressed.   Definitely recommend the food and it also had pretty great service and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"I got swordfish with ratatouille and it's was so oily, I'm very disappointed this time. I've been there before and had good good swordfish dish, well not this time. They have patio seating which is really nice, good for a date meeting"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere - you can dine on the patio if you'd like.  They bring you the yummiest bread when you sit down.  The service was professional - warm and attentive without being intrusive.  I ordered the blackened tilapia, which was seasoned just right, but had an overly spicy mango salsa that I had to push to the side.  The macaroni and cheese side dish was one of the best I've ever had.  The only thing my dinner companion and I didn't like was the spinach.  It just had a bad taste - was it lemon?  Couldn't identify the weird taste, but we both left it untouched.  My dinner companion ordered the trout, which he liked, but thought the almonds should have been sliced thinner.  I would have loved to have tried one of their very tempting desserts, but I was too full, so don't overdo that yummy bread!  Go right at sunset - no, you can't see it, but it's when the ambiance of the restaurant is really nice.  This is the kind of place that makes me love living in Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place.   We've been coming here for years.   We do special occasions and just regular dinners here.     The food is always good.   I've actually never in the 15 or so times I've been here had a bad experience.   The oysters are always fresh.   The fish is always cooked perfectly.  You would think the sushi isn't great but it's pretty darn good here as well.  I LOVE their version of crispy rice with spicy tuna.  I also love getting the captain's platter.   The raw scallops are amazing!  They're free sourdough bread is pretty awesome too.   I only wish I could eat it now that I'm gluten free.   Lol!  The service is usually pretty good.   I've obviously had some issues but for the most part I'm always pleased.   The food usually comes out quickly and accurately.   Definitely a great place to get some nice seafood."}
{"text":"Sunday, 3/6/16 & Monday 3/7/16; 7:15pm-ish; 2 people for dinner  Ambiance: 4.5-5 stars Food: 4.5-5 stars Service: 5 stars both days!  Ambiance: it's been 8 years since I've been back to King's Fish House, so I was extremely surprised to see the changes made in the decor! It's so much more chic and stylish that I didn't even recognize it! With new signage, the open floor plan, and see through windows to the bar; it's a lot more inviting now. Even though I happened to come during a little cold spell, the patio look inviting if you were to be here during the summer months when it is warm. All in all, a very comfortable place to be for a nice meal.  Food: back in the day, I used to come for one dish and one dish only! Their N'awlin's bbq shrimp!  Well, the plate has changed, as has a different flavor, but it's still a very delicious dish! So after our first excursion, we decided to branch out to other dishes, which included their blue crab cake entree. You get three decent sized crab cakes with a side of fries and the yummiest remoulade you could imagine!  Service: So, I was a 2 times a week regular for years at King's Fish House, and I've always gotten great service there. I have to say though, that Victor took great care of us. He is very respectful, kind and attentive! All the things you look for in a server! With southern charm, he made our visits quite wonderful! I look forward to coming back and asking specifically for him as our waiter again! It's things like this, that bring you back to a place. When they remember your name, they treat you like family, and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time and the food was excellent. My server Karen was amazing, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. When I go back I will ask for her section. Chrystal"}
{"text":"My mom and I were wandering around the District trying to figure out where to grab lunch, and I'm glad we stopped in. It was right before the big heat wave, so we were able to enjoy the outdoor seating. It has a very apparent theme, which is anything to do with fishing.  Something that I found quirky is that they also serve sushi. I guess that shouldn't surprise me seeing as they serve fish, but I found it refreshingly unusual. My mom had the fish and chips (a classic) and I had a Ono (Wahoo) sandwich. Everything was delicious. My mom finished off with a key lime pie. I'm not a fan, but she really enjoyed it. So if that's your thing, you are definitely going to like it. Attentive and friendly staff, a definite recommend."}
{"text":"So I've started Clean Eating and today of all days I felt like fish!   I called the KFH in Henderson and spoke with Carly and ordered the blackened Mahi-Mahi.. unfortunately they did not have Mahi-Mahi so I went with the Ono.   The fish dish came with 2 sides - so I ordered the grilled Asparagus and spinach.  When I got there to pick up my order.. it was about 4:30. The District parking was full as usual, but I snagged a spot right near VS and walked in.   When you order take out - note: you have to go the the bar and pick up.   After waiting about a minute someone came out I paid and left.   I got home after about a 5minute drive (I live close by) and was dying to eat!   The best part about it all was the spinach! Sautéed with garlic and was divine! I wish there was more!  The Asparagus was nicely grilled with seasoning.  **************** But I was truly disappointed with the fish. It was dry!  It looked good.... maybe it's better dining in the restaurant.  Also presentation was blah too...when I opened up my take out container I expected more coming from a restaurant ... this place is not a hole in the wall Mom and Pop shop.  There was NO pico de gallo either... Lastly, I wish I had checked my bill a little closer, the menu on their website clearly states my item CAME WITH 2 sides.... my bill said $22.50 and they even charged me extra $1.95 for asparagus, I thought that was with the fish???? (Puzzled) ... change the description and pricing on your receipts then.   Anyhoooo my bill came to a total of $26.47 total and I thought I was being nice so I tipped and the final price was $30. (See menu below)  So that's why the 2 stars.   *********************  The setting is cozy -  happy hour sounds like fun."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing! Top quality seafood at it's best! It's a little expensive but totally worth it! Especially for couples looking for a good date night the restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. Very clean and nicely decorated.  For the Oysters If you want the biggest bang for your buck I suggest going with the Carlsbad Blonde and Henderson Bay. The two biggest on the menu. So fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Coming out to Vegas I was looking forward to visiting the one and only King's in the state of Nevada. Their remodel is awesome! Looks nicer than all the other ones.  They are doing lobster Festival right now and their lobster bisque is awesome! Sweet and creamy with big chunks of lobster. Can't go wrong with pretty much anything you order on the menu. My lady loves the new hand crafted cocktail menu!"}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at Kings Fish House and it was wonderful. The lobster roll sandwich was delicious, and all of our food was hot. Our server Danielle was very attentive to our young son,  and asked if we wanted his food our first. She obviously knows that keeping a child happy at the table is key to a good dining experience. We will be back and thank you!"}
{"text":"Lunch date yesterday with staff. We arrived around 1:45 I informed them we were on our lunch break and to please be aware of waiting time. I ordered fish and chips. It was delicious. You can tell that this was fresh and not some frozen crap taken from a bag with freezer burned corners. Thank goodness. Our waiter immediately acknowledge that we were on our lunch. Great sign of team communication!  Fries were a bit dead but she replaced them even after I decided I didn't want any. Way to go! Out door seating is a must! Overall good lunch.  All the girls agreed that they enjoyed their food. No to go trays for us!  5 stars I will return"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, let's start with the positives. I really like the new remodel, it's very open and really looks like a fish house. Love the wood floors and the updated outside patio area with the new booths.   As for the service it was really really slow. There was only one other couple inside when we arrived. We were seated quickly at our choice of table. We ordered drinks while looking over the menu. I went with the swordfish fish tacos and a cup of clam chowder. The bread arrived with waters, but no wine. We continued to wait and I finally asked where the wine was. She said the bartender was busy with \"to go\" orders but she would check on it. I noticed it was sitting at the bar waiting for her.   Our soups arrived and were delicious. Kings has always had really good chowder.  It's thick and creamy and just how chowder should be. Our waitress returned and said that they didn't have any swordfish today and asked if I wanted salmon tacos. Salmon tacos?? Um....no. I switched to the Ono sandwich. After a long wait the entrees arrived, keep in mind there are now only 3 tables occupied.   The sandwich was okay but is was nothing memorable. Not sure how a fish restaurant is out of swordfish and the servers don't know it. Service was disappointing considering only 3 tables were occupied. As much as I like the new interior, the food and service didn't match up."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood, and have eaten here several times.  I feel compelled to write a review after my last meal.  Their special was a macadamia nut crusted halibut.  It was fantastic!  Beautiful piece of fish, cooked to perfection (not overcooked - hate overcooked fish).  The macadamia nut crust and whatever sauce was on it were incredible.  Would highly recommend this dish.  Would be five stars - but it was a little pricey.  I do like eating at King's Fish House, but I don't think the two of us have ever eaten there and gotten out for under $100 (and we don't drink)."}
{"text":"The staff was extra nice and knowledgeable but the food wasn't that good at all. I was excited after reading the reviews and even looking at the menu, but when the food came, I was disappointed. Steak was a bad cut of meat and underprepared. The lobster was \"ok\" and spinach very bland. The Moscow Mule was great however! I wouldn't come back having the choice."}
