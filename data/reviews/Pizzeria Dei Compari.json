{"text":"Très bonne pizza !! Ça faisait longtemps qu'on ne m'avait pas surpris comme ça !! Tout était très bon!!  Le service a été très bon aussi et rapide. Le seul hic c'est la personne qui attendait à côté de nous pour débarrasser alors qu'on finissait nos verres."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!! Maybe the best in the city. It is thin crust, made in a wood oven, with plenty of toppings. We had the Marguerita pizza and 4 cheese pizza. The Marguerita was so good. The pizza maker (who was very impressive by the way) put the basil underneath the cheese so that it wouldn't burn. The basil tasted so so good like that!! The four cheese pizza was essentially 1 piece with mozzarella, 1 piece with gorgonzola, 1 with emmenthal and one with goat cheese. It was delicious! The gorgonzola was a little too liquidy. It kind of just spilled, but I'm sure if we would have waited for it to cool, it would have been fine. It was all so delicious! We will definitely be back! Also, the menu prices include tax. The Marguerita pizza was $11 with tax and the 4 cheese was $15 I think."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service was lacking that night, but i don't know if it's always the case. The price are amazingly good if you compare it to other pizzerias."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and manocotti! But of a line but not long of a wait. Great neighbourhood."}
{"text":"There is a great ambiance , the service is good and the selection of Pizza and wine is great.   However mention to them that you don't want too much cheese because mine had so much that it felt chewy, also the center of the crust was still undercooked. That doesn't make the pizza bad, it's just not exactly excellente per say. Oh and the cheese is shredded mozzarella,  delicious, but not traditional"}
{"text":"Great pizza! And they even have whole wheat options for the more fussy eaters like myself, which is rare."}
{"text":"Saggy pizza. Not tasty at all. Felt horrible all day. Not recommended. I might as well have eaten bagel and cream cheese."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their piping hot cheese pizza!    Its such a treat to get a fresh quality pizza.    Service was fast and friendly.  Very happy with the place, I hope to go back soon.  I wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"They have great Italian pizzas.   The pricing is also fair.  The lady assuming manager or owner was responding in French when we were asking stuff in English which was a bit strange for my friends.  Maybe we took it in a wrong way :)"}
{"text":"Best Pizza and Service ! Don't settle for those Pizza Resto this one is the Best!! Pizza taste amazing many choices that you couldn't even imagine staff is super nice"}
{"text":"Came here during the later part of the lunch hour and this place was packed. There was a line of hungry people wanting pizza. I went here based on some recommendations.  Since it was really busy and it seemed like there was only three servers for the restaurant, the service was a bit slow. I got the broccoli pizza, which was huge and full of toppings (olives,mushrooms) plus they were generous with the cheese. The only thing was that a lot of the broccoli pieces included were the stalks which is not as nice as the florets. Other then that, the price versus quality was really good especially for a place on St-Denis."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza restaurants in town. Excellent and efficient, friendly service, wide choice of  Italian dishes. Crusts are just right. Always packed. Ideal place before or after a show. Service is amazingly quick so people need not worry about missing a movie or a show nearby. Highly recommended. No disappointments in service or quality of food."}
{"text":"excellent price to quality ratio. pizza is handmade and coal/wood oven fired. one size = medium/large. they load on the fresh/quality toppings. fast service from no nonsense middle aged quebecoise ladies. pies average 10$ and prices include tax. pizza places like this are few and far between in montreal - it is not overly fancy/expensive and not pizzahut-like. just a good place to get a decent pie on the way home after a busy day with the change left in my car's ashtray. i call in my order before pickup - they're terse: name and number are unnecessary."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé la pizza. Parfaite aux jours pluvieux. Situe Très bien, le restaurant de La Meilleure Offre Pizza du Quartier Latin, je le jure. Un lieu de revenir, sans doute."}
{"text":"Im sorry this review is from July 2016. Ive been lazy. There was an hour wait to get a table at this pizzeria. I figured if theres a line it must be good. Im glad we waited. Their pizza was amazing. The cheese was just right, the sauce was well balanced. I ordered the hawaiian pizza and im sorry I have to say this being a new Yorker but it was pretty up there in great pizza. The crust was tasty as well. I would go back to Montreal just to have their pizza again"}
{"text":"Nice and inexpensive pizza. We ordered the goat cheese one and was gone in no time! Yum!"}
{"text":"Meilleur pizza au four a bois de montreal ! Ils on vraiment plusieurs sortes et le service etait excellent!   En plus, le resto est en plein coeur du quartier latin alors cest un spot parfait pour manger avant un show !!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant de pizza. La qualité et le choix sont phénoménaux. Cependant, le service et l'espace fourni pour chaque personne sont insuffisants."}
{"text":"Un bon endroit pour déguster une bonne pizza cuite au four, rapidement.  La pizza à elle seule, en vaut le détour. Je le suggère particulièrement aux gens qui ont une sortie de prévue, sur la rue St-Denis, et qui veulent manger quelque chose de \"bon mais rapide\". (Avant le cinéma ou le théâtre, par exemple!)   Un petit truc: Ils peuvent servir des moitiés de pizza. Alors, ça réduis votre coût de facture! Et puis, elles sont tellement grosses qu'une moitié est bien suffisante.   Le service à la clientèle est OK, mais rien de plus. On dirais vraiment que les serveuses et cuisiniers sont là depuis des années. Le décor est OK, mais on ne va pas à cet endroit pour l'ambiance. On y va pour la bonne pizza à croûte cuite au four, typiquement italienne! Miam! :-)"}
{"text":"Alright, so I had ordered pizzas for delivery from this place back in January, and it was amazing. Thin crust, lots of toppings, very reasonable price (I think it was around 12$ for the 4 cheese pizza?). Clearly the best pizza I've had in Montreal. And the order arrived quite fast too.   Fast forward to today: we were in the area and decided to try the sit-in experience. I had a good memory of the 4 cheese, so I took it again, noticing a slight price increase to 16$. No big deal, it was well worth it. Sadly, they were not as generous with the toppings this time. The description on the menu says \"gorgonzola, goat cheese, emmental and mozzarella\", yet my pizza barely had 2 pieces of gorgonzola, and there was overall less mozzarella than in my memory. Oh well. Still a great pizza, with a thin, perfectly cooked crust, and quick service.   I'd probably actually give this place 3.5 stars, but I was surprised and delighted that all prices on the menu actually included taxes.  This would still be one of my go-to pizza places."}
{"text":"Une bonne pizza cuite au four à bois pour célébrer le début de \"l'année\" avec les collègues de travail. La portion est parfaite (beaucoup trop grosse pour mon régime, mais la gourmande que je suis a tout mangé anyway).   J'ai pris une pizza tomate/fromage de chèvre/basilic et c'était délicieux même si j'aurais préféré du basilic frais.  Attendez-vous à attendre sur l'heure du midi, l'endroit est plutôt achalandé. Prévoyez peut-être un 15 minutes de plus à votre heure de dîner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places! I always go for the shrimp pizza but there are so many different pizzas to try out. The portions are big  and the desserts are to die for. I strongly recommend the chocolate tartuffo, which was the highlight of my night. Service has always been great and fast despite the large crowds."}
{"text":"Great sit down pizza place on the Latin Quarter. Plenty of seating inside as well as in the outdoor patio. We ordered a Margherita pizza and a calzone. Both were very good and the servings were large. Staff was attentive but the place was packed so it took some time to get our order. Definitely a good pace to visit if looking for a nicer place for pizza rather than one of the many cheap, quick serve pizza locations near the campus."}
{"text":"Very good and reasonably priced pizza! Came here based on a recommendation from the front desk at our nearby hotel and did not leave disappointed. Service is good as well. The Caesar salad is fine. The large is more than enough for two if you're also sharing a pizza. Do the demi. English and French speaking. Lots of locals."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best pizza places in Montreal,I have been ordering takeout (much cheaper than dine in) here for years and we even have a pizza thursday at work dedicated to this place!  I would recommend the montrealaise pizza but you can't go wrong with a classic cheese!   I will keep coming back here, their crust is amazing and thin, their cheese is scrumptious and they offer spicy oil that completes the meal!"}
{"text":"Très bonnes pizzas! Bonne et goûteuse, pâte moelleuse et croustillante. Bon service, rapide.  Mieux vaut réserver car c'est la file à l'extérieur. Sauf pour les pizzas a emporter.. Seulement 20mn d'attente!!   Pâtes excellente et servie en quantité. La lasagne est bonne mais portion un peu petite pour les bons appétits...  Very nice pizzas! Good and tasty, fast service. Must reserved because there's a line in front of the restaurant. Except for the \"to go\" order , only 20mn!  Pasta ate also very good!  Must taste in Quartier Latin!"}
{"text":"I was craving pizza and decided to walk 25 mins from my hotel to this place because of the good reviews even though there were a lot of closer options. I'm SO HAPPY I did! I ordered a margarita pizza to-go and the entire experience was wonderful.  The staff was so kind and you can tell they genuinely care about you having a good experience. While I was waiting for my pizza (which only took 10 mins) they brought me a glass of water without me having to ask. That gesture really stuck out to me because most of the other places I've been in Montreal you have to hound the wait staff for water and for refills when you're eating out and they don't seem to be very attentive.  When I got back to my hotel and took the first bite I literally said \"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\" out loud. This is hands down the best pizza I've had since I went to Italy about a year ago!! The tomato sauce, the cheese, the crust, the basil.... Everything was perfect. My only regret is not finding this place sooner on my trip!"}
{"text":"Vraiment sympa et avec de bonnes pizzas au feu de bois... Faites une croix sur l'accueil jovial, sauf exception... Et préparez-vous a attendre un peu..."}
{"text":"Very good reasonably priced wood oven baked pizza. I tried all their pizzas. Vegetarian, pizza Saint Denis, pizza Siciliana, and the marguarita.  I also tried their lasagna and it is very good. I tried their soup and was ok. But the pizza is one of he best. The dough is sooo fresh and tasty.  I also tried the pizza with salmon and capers. But my favorite is Saint Denis. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"4 stars only because the boyfriend and I didn't get pizza - we both got pasta dishes.  They were really good, we ate our whole meal.  Restaurant is basically French speaking, which is fine.  Our waitress was helpful but could have come by with more water.  Restaurant wasn't too busy for a Sunday afternoon around lunch time.  It was very cute and quaint inside.  The table next to us all got pizzas and they were pretty good size for flat bread."}
{"text":"Un vrai délice!!! Pizza de qualité et typiquement italienne. Les prix sont vraiment abordables. Le service nickel, rien à reprocher!!! Je conseille vivement cette pizzeria pour ceux qui veulent manger une vrai pizza italienne. Les desserts sont aussi très bon :)"}
{"text":"Simple ingredients, super fast service, not too pricy & great flavors. All in all loved the pizzas here. They serve thin crust pizzas. My husband also tried their pastas with rosse sauce and it turned out to be delish. We came back for more the day after :)."}
{"text":"Ate here 1 and 1/2 times. The first time I really enjoyed the pizza but the service was slow. Being a pizza lover and living so close by I returned. The 2nd time was awful, we were rudely seated, then left to wait for literally 10 minutes. When we made eye contact with the waitress to place our order, she ignored us. We tried a second time, but the waitress said it was another waitress's table. After close to 15 minutes of waiting, we got up and left!"}
{"text":"Tres bonne place pour de la pizza au four à bois ! Elles sont gigantesques et pour le prix, tu en as en masse !!  Tu vas d'ailleurs très probablement pouvoir te ramener un doggy bag ! YOLO   Il n'y a pas que des pizzas, donc si tu préfères un plat de pâtes, laisse-toi aller !!! :)"}
{"text":"Very good Italian food on St Denis.     This area tends to be very touristy, but Dei Compari delivers good food at good prices.  We saw everyone eating pizza so we ordered a chicken pizza and a penne arrabbiata.    Both were good.  The grilled pizza was thin and crisp with a good fresh set of toppings.   The pasta dish was nice and spicy.    Delicious.  One odd thing....as we were waiting for our food, we asked for a basket of bread...the waitress, took a basket that was on a table next to us (it looked that I had not been touched by guests that had just gotten up and left) and placed the \"used basket\" on our table...we were starving, so we ate the bread....  LOL..."}
{"text":"Meilleure pizza en ville! Un goût de four à bois, la croûte mince comme j'aime la sauce tomate exquise...wow! Un must italien"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here and ordered some pizza. Service was great as was the food. Highly recommend. Nice area, quiet, and with a lovely patio."}
{"text":"Le seul restaurant italien que je recommande à tous mes amis, on adore y aller, soit en hiver ou en été, surtout l'été pour profiter de la terrasse à l'extérieure, les pizzas sont succulentes, rien à dire, j'ai pas mal essayé une dizaine de choix, toujours satisfaite, de Un par la qualité et de deux par l'ambiance ainsi que le bon service. Si vous cherchez un petit restaurant qui est pas cher et qui vous permet de savourer les meilleurs pizzas de la ville, ce restaurant reste votre meilleur choix !"}
{"text":"My favourite pizza in the city! They have an amazing selection of pizza which they make in a wood fire stove. The pizza is thin crust and full of flavour (tip: order take out and save a few dollars. Also... call in your order in advance so you don't have to wait but even if you don't, they make those pizza pies pretty damn quick!)"}
{"text":"In a recent trip to Montreal, my boyfriend and I were walking up the street one night and saw that this place was the most crowded outside. We came here the next night for dinner and did not leave disappointed. We waited to be seated for about 15 minutes but it wasn't too bad for a Saturday night. There's a ton of different pizzas on the menu, and you can create your own. They come in one size and definitely need to be eaten with a fork and knife. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellente pizza nous nous sommes régalé ! Acceuil chaleureux , pizza bien cuite et croustillante comme on l'adore , les prix sont abordables , pour finir les desserts étaient très bons , je recommande cet endroit , quant à moi je reviendrai avec plaisir !"}
{"text":"I think I have finally found my favourite Italian restaurant in Montreal. Yay! I ordered veggie tomato sauce pasta, gratin style, which was the best decision. Cannot begin to describe how flavourful and delicious it was. Their staff is super friendly and very helpful with the food and wine suggestions. We went on a busy night so the food took longer to come. Their tiramisu was the bomb! Flavourful, right temperature and great texture - just perfect! Highly recommend this place for some authentic Italian food. I honestly felt like I was in Italy because of the way it's set-up, the entire vibe and their staff. I will be going back to try more dishes and pizza as well."}
{"text":"Visited this place on sat evening and had a line queuing outside. Waited for about 30 min before we were seated. Really wanted to try their pasta but ended up having their Marine pizza - the one with clams, shrimps, and onions. The pizza overall is OK, but I really like their cola drink they got which is made with maple syrup - u can really taste the syrup in the cola. Maybe too sweet for some, but I think it's brill!!!! WE NEED MORE MAPLE SYRUP IN THIS WORLD!!!!"}
{"text":"Pour moi, une bonne pizza c'est : une pâte fine et croustillante + une sauce tomate faite maison et bien aromatisée + des fromages qui ont du goût + une cuisson au feu de bois (évidemment). Et bien j'ai le plaisir de vous annoncer que les pizzas de Dei Compari correspondent à tous ces critères !  J'ai pour ma part goûté la 4 fromages, avec du gorgonzola, du gruyère, du chèvre frais et de la mozzarella... et c'est la meilleure pizza que j'ai pu tester à Montréal jusqu'à présent ! La carte propose des dizaines de pizzas (végétarienne, végan et sans gluten à la demande), vous n'avez donc qu'à faire votre choix !  Concernant les prix, c'est dans la moyenne. Les pizzas sont entre $12 et $16 dollars (taxes incluses). L'endroit est assez classique (bien situé tout de même), et la terrasse est sympa en été. C'est également possible de prendre à emporter."}
{"text":"I passed by the pizzeria several times and always there is a line.  This time it was rainy so the terrace was closed. We waited about 15 mins on a weekday evening. The restaurant was packed the whole evening.  We had two pizzas. They were both tasty but mine had anchovies which was too salty and unbearable for me. We will definitely come back for other options on the menu.  The prices on the menu were tax included."}
{"text":"Je suis une fan finie de ce restaurant. J'aime presque tous les items du menu. La pizza cuite au four est parfaite. La croûte n'est ni trop épaisse, ni trop mince et toujours cuite à point. Il existe plus d'une trentaine de choix, végé, avec viande ou poisson (thon, sardine) et celles plus santé. Les pâtes sont succulentes, diffents choix pour tous les goûts j'adore les rigatoni bolognaise gratinés. Ils mettent tellement de fromage mozzarella dessus ça en devient indécent :D j'ai toujours reçu un service courtois et rapide. Certaines des serveuses peuvent sembler plus froides mais après qu'elles vous aient déposé votre assiette gargantuesque vous vous moquez bien de sa froideur!!! Ils ont une terrasse donnant sur St Denis agréable en éte. Il s'agit d'un petit restaurant rapidement bondé alors souvent je prends pour emporter. Et ai je mentionné leurs prix ridicules entre 12 et 16$ (regardez la taille de ma pizza!!!)"}
{"text":"Saw a line outside and decided to go with the flow and wait in line. Luckily my friend and I were seated within ten minutes. It was a beautiful night to sit outside.   My friend had the Margherita pizza, and I had the Saint Denis pizza. The dough was so soft with prefect amount of sauce. My friend said it was probably one of the best thin crust pizza he's ever had, or maybe he was just extremely hungry.   Definitely a nice spot to visit when you're in the area."}
{"text":"I use a very small mobility scooter. I wanted to support the restaurant because it's one of few places in the area with an accessible entrance . However after I entered they refused to serve me because of the scooter even though they were not busy at all . Only three tables were in use. They made no attempt to accommodate me and no apology ."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Great service! If you are looking for a quick bite, I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Bonne calzone et prix intéressant"}
{"text":"26 janvier 2013 Un bon souper avec un ancien collègue de travail. Direction Dei Compari ! Un petit endroit très sympatique, très petit, mais très bon. Le rapport qualité/prix est impressionnant. Ça rappelle le Café Presto sur Stanley mais en version pizzeria. Arrivez tôt pour vous assoir rapidement et manger. La file d'attente s'allonge rapidement à partir de 18h, surtout la fin de semaine. En bout de ligne vous en sortez bien rempli et bien heureux !  January 26th 2013 A nice meal with a former colleague of mine. Make way for Dei Compari ! A cosy place ....... a small and cosy place, but really good. The quality/price ratio is quite interresting. It reminds me of Café Presto on Stanley but for pizza. Come early if you want to get a seat otherwise the lineup gets long, starting at 6 pm, especially on weekends. In the end you'll get out of there full and happy !"}
{"text":"Walked into this pizzeria while looking for a place to have a quick bite to eat shortly after arriving in Montreal. This place did the trick!  We got seated and our order taken right away.  We ordered the garlic bread and then a Pizza to share. Our order came right away and they were both very good. They have a wood burning oven and the pizza is prepared from scratch right before your eyes.  Affordable and good, what else can you ask for?! I'll definitely come back next time I'm in the mood for pizza.  3 stars only since this is a casual place where you go for a quick bite. Nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Heard the pizzas are baked in a stone oven, just like how it's supposed to be done, so we decided to give it a try.  We were seated at the terasse, on a warm summer night. Very busy street and good atmosphere.    We had the 'Dei Compari' and the 'Marinara' pizzas.   The 'Dei Compari' was a bit burnt on the edge, but it was still delicious. The tomato sauce was very good, the amount of cheese was just right. The combination of flavors was excellent. The only thing that was somewhat of a let down was the italian sausage. It wasn't very tasty, it might as well have been mushrooms. Maybe spicy sausages would be better.  The 'Marinara' (with shrimps and clam) was better than I had anticipated. I love seafood, but I don't get too excited when it comes to Montreal seafood. To my surprise, the shrimps didn't taste like seaweed (as they do in some restaurants). The pizza had a perfect hint of seafood taste, totally not overwhelming.   Good flavors in general, coming from good combinations of ingredients.  It comes down to about 18$ per pizza with everything included. The portion was relatively huge, so I hope you're hungry when you show up."}
{"text":"Exellente pizza , pas trop salé, copieuse, huile picante bien dosé, bon service, deco propre, plusieurs tables, rapide."}
{"text":"Love the 4 cheese   They have great pizza although I have never eaten there, just get take out.  Price is fair, good tomato sauce and nice thin crust oven pizza.  I have tried their All dressed, the Margarita, and the number 26 which has eggplant and anchovies.  The only thing non pizza I would also recommend is the Eggplant parmigiana.  Well worth the price and really among the better and convenient pizza joints."}
