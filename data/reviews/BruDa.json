{"text":"First tried Bruda using a Groupon.  The testing menu was restricted to a couple of items from the full menu.  We both had a starter that was breaded meatballs that were  deep-fried.  Interesting.  But surprising bland.  Our mains were much tastier.  I had the sausages.  Similar to the meatballs but with more spices.  My daughter had the homemade gnocchi.  Flavourful but a softer texture than she would have liked.  We had an excellent bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere very pleasant.  We were impressed enough to return with friends for another meal a few weeks later.  This time, since we weren't using a Groupon, we could choose off the full menu.  And what an interesting menu it is.  And well priced.  The organic grain salad was perfectly prepared.  The only quibble was that it needed more spices to compensate for the blandness of the grains because that's all that's in the salad.  The tomato salad was excellent.  The scallops were fantastic.  As for the mains, the Ling cod was moist and tasty.  The brined chicken was moist and delicious.  The fresh linguine was a hit.  The fish and the chicken were cooked to perfection.  Extremely impressive given the limited cooking facilities - I think he has 3 burners to work with in the open kitchen.  Again service and atmosphere were great.  Bruda is doing creative cooking in a very pleasant, casual atmosphere at a reasonable price.  My only concern is that the place was pretty quiet both times I was there.  That's a shame because,  unlike so many over-priced, mediocre restaurants where I've felt ripped off, Bruda is a relative bargain doing good, creative food and it deserves to be successful."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends. Although the menu looked interesting the execution was lacking. Food was bland and overcooked. Avoid in the future."}
{"text":"Nice room, friendly greeting and good service.  Sorry to report, the meal was truly mediocre. We did order off the tasting menu.   Salad was the highight - ingredients somewhat unusual.  3 mains offered, my friend and I both had the pasta, and both asked for salt & pepper, which we used liberally at the table, to try to get some flavour into it.  Pasta was gummy in the bowl.  Our glasses of tap water were delivered to the table, held at the rim of the glass, instead of the bottom. Unfortunately this is a common service error, so easy to correct, it did lower expectations for the rest of the experience."}
{"text":"College Street can be a restauranteurs heaven (if you're good) or nightmare because there is so much competition.    BruDa cafe now occupies the space of Carpano, the short-lived sister location to Sidecar.  The large windows in the front let in a lot of natural light.  The interior is made up of hardwood floors, tables, white walls and tea lights.  The small, open-kitchen is located behind the bar where the chef worked solo to cook up our meals.    I had a Groupon voucher that I paid $79 for that consisted of a prix fixe menu for 4.  The prix fixe menu was quite limiting and there weren't a lot of choices, however, you could substitute various items from the regular menu as long as you pay the difference.    When asked if we wanted flat or sparkling water we opted for flat.  I wasn't paying attention and was surprised when our bill came to $10 for 2 bottles of water.  I have no problems drinking tap water, and charging per-bottle for water is a little bit steep.  Most places just charge you once and you get unlimited refills.    We ordered 3 glasses of Riesling ($10 each) and a mixed drink also.  The food at BruDa was pretty disappointing for me.  We came on a Thursday night, and it was the Exec Chef and his one-man-show pumping out food that led to longer-than-normal wait times (and that was with just about 4 tables of customers).  I sure hope that when they're busier on weekends that they have sous chefs or the wait would be a nightmare!  Complimentary bread is provided and it was quite unique.  The bread itself is infused with flavour, though nobody at our table could discern what flavour it was.  Suffice it to say that it was crusty and yummy.  For appetizers we tried the Duck Confit Spring Rolls, Slow-Cooked Spiced Rabbit, Bourbon-Braised Back Ribs and Seared Scallops.    The duck confit rolls were nice and crispy and the seared scallops were yummy (but a tad salty).  The \"spiced\" rabbit was lacking in spice, and had a chalky taste to it.  The back ribs were lacking in the flavour department as well, and while tender, were not the melt-off-the-bone variety.    For mains we ordered 2 x Ontario Brined Chicken,  Chef-Rolled Gnocchi and East Coast Char.  The chicken was the winner overall for me with a crisp skin and albeit salty was quite flavourful.  The gnocchi reminded me very much of Chinese rice noodles in texture, and different than gnocchi I've tried elsewhere.  The sauce was nice and creamy, though it did not cling well to the actual gnocchi.  The char had a nice crisp skin to it, and was cooked just right.  I'm glad that the mains were a little less disappointing.  For dessert, we ordered a Lemon Tart, a Jamaican Pumpkin Ice Cream, and a Citrus Sorbet.  The lemon tart was quite yummy, although texture-wise I'd have to give it a failing grade.  Runny lemon curd + a hard shell = fail.  The pumpkin ice cream was different but not exactly satisfying or rich in terms of what you expect out of an ice cream.  The flavours were very muted.  The citrus sorbet was a little too tart for our tastebuds.  At the end of the day, we still had to pay roughly $87 for the drinks, substitutions, ridiculously-priced bottled water and coffee.    The food here is pretty mediocre, service is slow (not to the chef's fault as he had no hired hands for help), but the wait staff are pretty hospitable.    I will most likely not return to BruDa again given there is no shortage of good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Great place. Haven't been since it was Negroni a few years ago but I had a great meal here. We had the scallops appetizer and the golden beet and blood orange salad which was also great. For mains we split a fantastic bacon wrapped tenderloin with mashed potatoes and delicious steamed greens and a buttery gnocchi. Peanut butter cheesecake for dessert. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The service in this little restaurant was exceptional. We went there on a Thursday night and had the place to ourselves. In general the food was good. Loved the mushroom soup and meatballs, but was a bit confused by the gnocchi - the consistency was very gooey, not sure what went wrong there. Dessert was homemade ice cream which was a perfect end to the night. Although the food was not perfection, the flavors were and our server was fantastic."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Bruda is a cute, unpretentious European resto in the space previously occupied by Negroni and later, Carpano. Not sure why restaurants here have not done well? Anyways, the interior looks similar to before but brighter and more open: hardwood floors, white walls with some artwork, simple furniture, tea lights at your table with an open-kitchen concept. I had been meaning to try this place, and when I saw a Groupon for a 3-course dinner (($40 for 2 people, or 50% off regular price), I jumped!   Came on a weeknight with a friend. It was about half full, nice and quiet enough to have a good conversation. I had: - Lollo Rossa Salad: celery leaf, taro root, buttermilk avocado dressing. Loved this! Simple and refreshing. The dressing was just right, a little creamy but not too thick. The taro root was crispy and lightly salted.  - Chef-rolled Gnoccchi: delicious! Super-soft and fluffy, served in a buttery broth with leek, brussel leaves, and burrata. Burrata with anything = amazing. Portion size was good. I was full but not stuffed. Room for... - Chocolate tart: the only low point for me. The texture was great. The dark chocolate filling was creamy smooth and the crust wasn't too hard. But the flavour was a bit bland. My DC had the vanilla lavender gelato, which was much better. - Decent wine list with a prosecco and a handful whites and reds available by the glass. I had an Ontario Riesling.   Service was personable, attentive and unhurried. We ended up staying long after we finished our desserts, to chat over espressos (which were great, too and they have decaf). I would be back for sure. The menu is small but looks yummy. There's a fish stew, homemade sausage, and pasta carbonara that all sound promising..."}
{"text":"**Ignore the Groupon cheapskates giving bad ratings: this place is a gem. **  After a few changes, this location on College is now \"Bruda\" and it's fantastic. Great, unpretentious atmosphere, simple, refined menu with a reasonable price for something a bit more upscale and easy going, friendly staff that don't \"Sell\" the whole time.  The Gnocci and the Pork Tenderloin are worth the trip alone, and the Pumpkin ice-cream, made in house, is damn tasty."}
{"text":"Usually ratios work like this: Big portions - Low quality Small portions - high quality  But Bruda doesn't really follow this standard, the portions are small and the quality is just OK. The food is rather bland but the prices are top tier... I don't get it...   After dining here, we went home and cooked some omelets since we were still hungry!  The potential is there but currently they don't deliver."}
