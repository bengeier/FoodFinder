{"text":"Before coming to Khalil's I had never tried middle eastern/Mediterranean food (outside of hummus bought at the local grocery store). My cross-cultural communication class decided to eat here after going to the Cathedral of learning. For my first taste, I'd say it was pretty fantastic.   My friend and I split the feast in half and there was more than enough food and by splitting it, we paid very little for a large meal. While I can't remember the exact names of everything, it was all delicious. From the skewered meat to rice, it was a joy to consume.   The highlight was the bottomless, homemade and authentic pita bread with the hummus. Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm. I have never had hummus that tasted so wonderful.   The staff was polite, quick and organized, especially considering I was with such a large group. They even took time to explain the different menu options to our poor uncultured souls.   Since my first time, I've been itching to go back. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone interested in trying something new and delicious."}
{"text":"Khalil's used to be one of Pittsburgh's best Middle Eastern restaurants. In a recent visit it was like stepping back 20 years a go when I was a college student! The facility itself hasn't changed. It was shabby and outdated. A total remodel is much needed. I and my companions had mix feelings over the food. The hummus was one of the best I ever tasted.  The shish kabob was average but the rice was superb. All in all the food was great. The service excellent."}
{"text":"The finest Middle Eastern Restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is as awesome as ever. Made with loving hands from truly caring people who believe, \"There are no strangers here, only friends we haven't met yet.\""}
{"text":"I am not from Pittsburgh but was here on business.  I had a craving for middle eastern food.  When I asked at the hotel, they couldn't think of any place. This restaurant was only .3 miles away, surprisingly, the hotel staff didnt know of it.  Called in a take out order. When I went in to pick it up, the family invited me in to wait with them.  I was introduced to the owner and his daughter, who seems to be the manager.  Her daughter is the server. They were very friendly, asked where I was from, etc. I got a very good vibe from them.    The hummus and Baba-Ganoush were delicious and came with a large amount of nice thin pitas.   The Kefka (sp?) dinner came with a large salad and rice pilaf.  The salad was just okay.  The rice was very good. The Kefka itself was a little on the bland side. Not bad, not great.  I plan to go back and try a few other things on the menu.  Given the authenticity and warmth of the owners I want to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"This could be dangerous...Khalil's is within walking distance and everything we've tried so far is yummy!   The restaurant and people were just lovely -- very warm and inviting.   The lamb kabob was enough for two and don't think we didn't argue over who got the last bite:-)  The chicken schwarma salad and mazza  sampler were also winners.   We took our food to go but next time I expect we'll stay in and try something new...including dessert!"}
{"text":"My favorite Pittsburgh restaurant is back in business and better than ever! I had delicious lamb kabobs with pilaf and salad. The hummus is excellent too, and the wine glasses are generous. A new wall of windows faces the street and lightens the dining room."}
{"text":"We are frequent diners an have been for ten years.  For two people, try the \"feast\" and split it -- a great way to sample all the good stuff.  The rice is always very satisfying -- but the shrimp is hit and miss, often over done.  Still, we keep going back.  Love the soups and salad."}
{"text":"A gentleman at the Apple store recommended this place to us and I'm so glad we followed up on it.  I'm half Syrian and although I make a few middle eastern recipes I don't often get to enjoy it out.  I had the stuffed grape leaves and my husband had the ground beef kabobs. Both were delicious. The Lebanese rice was probably the best I've ever had. Better than my grandmas even. The ambiance reminded me of my aunts house. The salad dressing was almost exactly like my grandmas. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I was really craving some Middle Eastern food.  I moved to Pittsburgh from Brooklyn and was having a hard time adjusting to a lack of cultural cuisine until I found Khalil's.  It is a mom and pop place, kind of a hole in the wall, but has fun, if shabby, decor like Nights of Arabia, but the silly ambience makes it more fun in my opinion.  The food was really good, authentic tasting. I have spent significant time in Egypt and Jordan and can vouch for the authenticity of the flavors.  I had the Feast which is more than enough food for 2 people- pita, hummus, salad (with a ton of fresh feta), dolmas, lentil soup, shrimp, kofta, lamb and chicken kabobs over rice with roasted pine nuts, and a dessert (baklava).  The total bill with wine and beer was $48 and we had a to go bag.  The waitresses were also very friendly and the food came out quickly.   I can't wait to go back to this place"}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of coworkers on a weeknight.  There was only one other table of diners the entire time we were there--this was my first time at Khalil's, so I don't know if this was typical, or because it was a rainy Tuesday night.  The waitresses were very nice and patient with us, even though we took a long time in deciding what to order.  They brought out wines that weren't listed on the menu and told us about them, without being pushy.  We really admired the gold teapots and glass teacups that came with the chai and orange rose teas we ordered, though the teas were a bit too sweet.  The hummus appetizer we ordered was great.  The chef also sent medamas (pureed fava beans) and the baba ganouge to our table, on the house, and they were also delicious.  I liked the salad that came with my dinner (you can also just order entrees a la carte, without rice and salad), though there was too much dressing.  Some of my co-workers didn't care for the dressing--if I'm not mistaken, it had dill in it, so it was a bit different.  I was a little disappointed with my falafel entree.  It was dry and seemed like it was fried a little too long.  I did really like the rice that I ordered with the falafel, though.  A lot of my co-workers, however, ordered the kabobs and were really happy.  The chef sent another dish to the table on the house, something that's not the menu yet but that they're thinking about adding.  Can't recall the name of the dish, but it had potato and wheat in it and was molded into the shape of a loaf/cake, and was pretty delicious.  With so much food, we didn't have room for any of the desserts.  The decor is pretty nice, with wall tapestries and the colorful tablecloths. It's a shame that it was raining the night we came--the restaurant had a neat-looking patio area.  Despite the falafel, I was really happy with the meal, especially the great service we got and the appetizers.  The chef even came to the table to say hi and came out again as we were leaving the restaurant to say good night."}
{"text":"We just had food at this place on Saturday. This is by far the best middle eastern restaurant I had in pittsburgh.  The kabobs were nicely done and salads and hummus were delight. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I AM SO GLAD THEY'RE OPEN AGAIN!!! Years and years ago (over 20) I dated a cousin of the family and this was a favorite place to eat! Ordered take away and was not at all disappointed.  The tabouli was so flavorful and fresh with just the right amount of bulgar wheat and lemon. Same goes for the signature salad with Sito's dressing. Mind blowing flavor and tastes. The owner's daughter is now responsible for the dressing he created and you can buy bottles to take home. Lubia omg the lubia! Yum times a thousand! The tomato sauce is brilliant and homemade and reminds me of the flavors of the kitchen from my boyfriend's Sito (grandmother). They even have kibbee nayee on the menu. I don't eat lamb, especially not raw but my current boyfriend had it and raved about it. He liked the texture and style of the fresh ground lamb. We also had spinach pies and the dough was amazing. Fresh, light and pleasant on the palate. The portions are nicely sized because we have leftovers for tomorrow! Lots of great choices on the menu. Next time we'll be eating in."}
{"text":"I pass by this place every day and I always wondered what it was about and so apparently they've reopened after a long time and are back in business.  I took my food to go; but I ordered the chicken shish dinner special which comes with rice, salad, and pita. I also got an order of their baba ganoush. The chicken was really good, moist, well-cooked and certainly not dry. The rice has some nuts in it which I wasn't expecting but was also very good. Both were piping hot when I got them. I think my favorite was the salad, which was super delicious, fresh, and light. And they give you a huge portion of it too. The pita was good but by the time I got home it was already hard and dry, but that's probably my fault for getting it to-go.  Not a huge fan of the baba ganoush, it did not taste bad, but it was my first time having it so I guess it just wasn't what I was expecting, flavor wise. I might just stick to the hummus next time, but the consistency and texture was really good.   Since they just opened a little bit ago, it's rather quiet so I  didn't mind that. Everyone was super friendly to me and did nothing but smile. And it seemed like some of the diners were return customers from a long time ago, so it was nice to hear the owners having friendly conversation. It makes the already inviting environment, even warmer. Prices can pretty steep in my opinion; my order came out to around $27 but I'm also a poor college student so... yeah."}
