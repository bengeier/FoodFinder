{"text":"The taste is good. Price is reasonable for the portion. I can't give it more than three stars because I'm very wary of the cleanliness factor. The broth looks kind of dirty. Service is fast but that's about it. Sometimes when I ask the waitress for something she doesn't really acknowledges me so I'm always not sure if she heard me or not."}
{"text":"This place as sadly closed down. Next location near warden and steeles.  May pop up again but doubtful"}
{"text":"I was really jonesing for Thai curry the other day, but my best friend wanted Pho. I hadn't seen him in a while, and he only has Pho was he comes to Markham, so even though I hate Pho, I said \"Sure, why not?\" So we go to this place and he orders a beef pho or whatever. If you're getting pho then you don't have much to worry about. He said their pho is good.  I GOT THE THAI GREEN CURRY. IT WAS LITERALLY GREEN GOOP. GOOP! It was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen. The beef that I got was uh... I don't know. The texture was way off, perhaps it was the goop that changed the texture of the beef, but it was terrible. I HAVE MY RESERVATIONS ON WHETHER IT WAS ACTUALLY BEEF OR NOT.  When we got to the restaurant I was starving. When I saw the green goop I was so put off that after taking one bite (I was starving) I put it aside and I watched my friend eat. I don't know how they could serve WHATEVER that was. It was NOT curry of any kind. The goop may have had a sort of Congee-ish texture. Curry should never have a Congee-ish texture.  If I were a cook there, I would not have the utter lack of self respect that it takes to put that on a plate and serve it. Good Pho or not, I am NEVER going back here. None of my friends are going back here. That goop was abysmal."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for years - way before I was born and up until now. It's the pho that keeps us coming back. It's a downright classic and they do it well here. We usually get the beef flank, tendon,  and tripe and it is delicious and consistent. Not salty - just a nice smooth and rich flavour. Their other items are usually good though quality has gone a bit down for some of their items over the years.  The deep fried spring rolls we get are amazing and the sauce that comes with it is good - though last time I went, the sauce was a bit too tangy and off but other times, it's been consistent.    The only main complaint I have is that the food doesn't arrive as hot as it should be although it comes within 10-15 minutes of ordering. The way the meat is cooked is good but if you have a choice between pork chops and shredded pork in the rice section of the menu, skip the shredded pork - you get more value and flavour with pairing the pork chop with chicken or something else."}
{"text":"This is our first time here today at phone88 @ Alton tower (2 ppl). I had a pork chop, shred pork and egg rice. The minced meat in egg had rotten smells and shred pork is wayyyy too salty.  However our main issue was not food. When the waiter came to us my partner already decide but I was having a last moment choosing between the two dishes. The waiter waited about 5 second and suddently turned to the other waiter complained \"they are too slow\" and left us. From that point our week day dinner was stuffed with fraustration and ruined.  I have never had such awful service experience in Canada and I would not recommend this one at ALL"}
{"text":"My favourite place for Pho.  I'd been going here for years. They just did some renovation... making the place more attractive.   Normally, I just order family Pho ($8). It comes in very large bowl, which is enough for 3 people (or 2 very hungry people). The noodle served hot and the soup tastes good (not too sugary sweet like some other places).   They also have special, which includes drink for under $8."}
{"text":"I ordered a Vermicelli with Pork and Spring Roll bowl for lunch.  The portion of both the carb and the protein were decent.  The spring roll was fine.  The pork tasted funny as if it was borderline spoiled.    The service was quick and friendly for food ordering, food delivery and bill payment.  I asked for additional fish sauce, and it was provided momentarily.  I rate Pho 88 Viet Thai 2.5 stars due to the quality of the pork meat.  Should the pork meat was not spoiled, Pho 88 Viet Thai is a 3-starred restaurant."}
{"text":"Pho 88 is probably the most popular vietnamese food chain in Toronto.  This location along with the Warden/Steeles location are the ones I frequent the most in the past 20+ years I've lived in Markham.    The pho here is excellent.  The best in Markham by far.  The soup is always tasty, the beef is thinly sliced and easy to eat, the noodles are always cooked perfect.    Last time I came to this Alton Tower location with my sister, we ordered a combo meal which was a great deal for $12 (two phos, two cold drinks, spring roll).  I don't recall the name of the drinks (honey lemon ice tea?) but they were probably the best i've had at an Asian restaurant.  Definitely recommended for your pho fix!  :-)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years; definitely the best place for Pho in Scarborough. I've tried most things on the menu and though they're all really good, their pho is definitely my go-to item on the menu (P4 is my favourite). Their spring rolls (A01) are AMAZING, and hands down my favourite spring rolls ANYWHERE, from any restaurant, in any city... good prices, open fairly late most nights, and simply: delicious."}
{"text":"There is alot of mixed reviews here but for me I would say its one of the better pho places and that's why its been around for so long. I went during lunch time on a Friday and the place was pretty much empty.  Got my usual extra large pho with rare beef and tripe $8.95. I love the presentation of the dish because they place the rare beef on the edge of the bowl to keep the super thin sliced beef a bit rare. Never seen it like this before but I liked it and its a good idea. The extra large is truely extra large and it will fill even the biggest stomaches out there. Another thing I liked was the tripe which were sliced into thin threads  and once again I have never seen it served this way before. A very good bowl of pho with decent amounts of meat and comparable to other pho places out there.   The deep fried spring rolls for $3.95 were just as good. super crispy on the outside and packed with all kinds of good stuff on the inside."}
{"text":"Been eating at this place for over a decade now, and the P15 (Pho Sate) has never disappointed me.  Service is quick and efficient, your Pho is out within a few minutes usually.  This place is near the top of my Pho list."}
{"text":"We ordered spring rolls ($3.75), and 2 large pho's: the well done beef, shank and tripe ($6) and the Satay '88' ($8).  Good portions for the pho, spring rolls are spring rolls haha. Come for the good value pho!"}
{"text":"TL;DR PHO88 got our order wrong, they're not nice, food isn't that nice either, don't order milkshakes unless you wanna be thirsty the whole meal.  I've been here once before, so I should've known what to expect. The last time we went here, they overcharged us for a milkshake that no one had ordered and insisted we pay or they call the police. Dinner started relatively well, the waiter gave us menus (there was 11 of us in total) along with tea and water (which we had to ask for). Once we ordered and our food started to come, that's when all the problems started.  They got our orders wrong, first of all. An older woman set 2 bowls of pho without even describing what it was. While we were asking what they were, she walked away and returned with a guy who wasn't our original server. He insisted that we had ordered those 2 and kept repeating the item number instead of describing it. After 5 minutes of us insisting that no one at our table had ordered it, he reluctantly took them back. Everyone eventually got the food that they ordered while I sat there still waiting for mine. I had to go to him and ask where my food was, only to find out that our waiter hadn't even put it on our order.   Once I got half of my food, , things didn't get any better. They didn't bother bringing out the cold shrimp rolls I ordered. As for the satay beef and chicken on rice. The satay beef had a weird taste to it, and felt powdery like someone had put flour and seasoning as an afterthought and had decided not to mix it properly. The chicken, which most other Vietnamese restaurants grill, was fried and tastless. There was a lot of little bones in it so I had no choice but to stop every few seconds to pull another bone out of my mouth. Vietnamese is usually bursting with flavourful but this place is obviously not like usual Vietnamese places.  My friends also ordered milkshakes at the beginning when we ordered everything. And they got it near the end of the meal when they were about finished eating.   I will definitely strongly refuse to go back to this place the next time someone suggests it."}
{"text":"The service sucked bad for my first experience here....   I ordered one order of the thai chicken fried rice which includes your standard thai ingredients: rice, carrots, peas, egg, chicken, etc... plus pineapples and cashews. I was thinking, \"pineapples and cashews... I love pineapples and cashews in my rice (reminds me of home).\" I was saddened to find my plate contained no pineapples and cashews and brought it up with the server.   That's when the funk experience happened.... I tell the server (we'll call her server A) that my dish has no pineapples and cashews. She looks lost for a moment. The server walks to the back and looks at the menu and brings it up to one of her other coworkers (whom we'll identify as server B).. Server A comes back and says we have no pineapples. I tell her I should've been told this prior to receiving my order. Server A goes back again to talk with Server B. Then I see Server B walk to the kitchen and comes back with a can to open it. \"The can looks like a can of pineapples\" I think to myself. She walks back to the kitchen... and sure enough comes back with a serving of cold pineapples and fresh cashews to go into the fried rice.  Frustration kicks in for me.  Now... I've had pineapple fried rice back home in Sacramento.... and pineapple and cashews can also be fried into the rice...... hot pineapples go much better with fried rice than cold pineapples. I get the sense these people don't know what they're doing and cancel my order altogether telling them to take the plate away.  Server A appears slightly panicked and walks to the back to talk with her server B (again). They look at the menu.... talk... and then comes back to tell me I wasn't told to include the cashews and pineapples in the order. (really?) We go over the menu together. There's no indication in the menu that I have to request these to have it in the order. She sees what I see as I call her bluff. She apologizes.  The experience doesn't end there. At the end they still include the rice in the bill even though I didn't eat my dish, told them to take it away, and told them to take it off the bill because I didn't eat it.   Blah... Apparently there was another table that had a pretty bad experience (maybe they'll be yelping here shortly). These people seem to look out more for their bottom line than focus on a positive customer experience. Do not recommend.. One star. Stay away."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the food served at Pho 88, but this was the closest pho restaurant in the area (located inside Alton Towers Circle Plaza) if you want a quick pho fix. Fiancé was being whiny and wanted pho last night lol... so here we are!  Shared a Family combo - includes an XXL bowl of pho, spring rolls and 2 cans of pop. Their soup base was a bit plain... you will definitely need the hoisin and hot sauce. The spring rolls did not look presentable... but it was crispy and the flavours were there. We also ordered the Vietnamese shrimp/pork rolls. They were not that great... not much meat actually. I rather have another one of those 'ugly' spring rolls lol.  Only thing that caught my attention was the $1.99 fruit shakes. I like how there were many exotic flavours to choose from. For example, sour sop, pineapple, coconut, taro etc. We ordered the avocado and durian shakes... both quite satisfying :)  Overall 2.5 stars. Good place for quick pho fix for you non-picky eaters! Portions are good. Food can be better. $1.99 for fruit shake is a steal... must try! No music playing in the background (kinda awkward hearing other customers slurping their noodles lol). Service is quick and friendly (although they did give us short on change!) When the girl went back to fetch us more change, my fiancé was like \"pho makes me sleepy but I can still do math.\" This guy so inchy LMAO."}
{"text":"I am surprised that no one has yet wrote a review for Pho 88 location at Alton Tower Circle! It has been around for over 10 years. This is NOT my usual Pho joint but I think I drop in for a visit for Pho-bruary.   I arrived at the lunch time, usually the restaurants I went to are quite busy however there were only 1 other lonely person eating there for lunch beside me.  There are no lunch specials but there are whole day special like a small pho with iced coffee for $7.50.  The place is runned by Mandarian speaking staffs with Mandarian songs playing so loud that you can barely hear yourself think!  I ended up ordering the rare beef Pho Medium ($6.50). I can tell you the broth is one of the saltest one. I am so thirsty after I eating the noodle and I barely drink the soup! They use dried noodles and it tasted ok a little chewy at first but as I kept eating it got soften up with the broth. The portion is smaller than other restaurant in the area. (I am still hungry :p)  I do like the way how they present my rare beef, right by the edge of the bowel so the beef still stayed rare when I eat them!! The cut of beef is really lean too.  The restaurant was empty when I am leaving! no more patrons at all.  Cash and Interac only!  I don't think I will go back to eat again!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Sunday night and split a family meal which came with a huge bowl of pho (containing beef and beef balls), four spring rolls and two cans of pop. It was a pretty good deal, since it ended up being about $20 after tax and tip and I was definitely sufficiently full afterwards.  I liked the pho at this place, especially the texture of the noodles, which were a little bit firmer than most other places. I also quite liked the broth, which was light and not too salty.  Spring rolls were okay, I'm not exactly sure of everything that was inside them, but there was a very strong carrot-y flavour. The texture inside was a little bit mushy, so I wasn't really a fan.  Service was quick, and pho arrived quite promptly after we placed our order.  Overall this is not the most glamorous place, but it gets the job done and it's good if you want to grab a pretty decent, quick pho."}
{"text":"I was impressed. Decor isn't nice, but food and service is."}
{"text":"This place is so bad its not even funny cannot make a coconut and grass jelly properly. Ive been here a couple time and one time i had to walk out on them for bad service, they seated us and forgot about us after we placed and order waited 30min before that other ppl that just sat down got there food first. Cups are dirty like 10 years old looking, never order any of their drinks. Overall place is bad"}
