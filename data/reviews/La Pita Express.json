{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  I love the shish kabobs (served in a pita or on the skewer), either chicken or shawarma.  There is something about the garlic sauce at La Pita Express that makes the food incredible, and I've never had anything like it elsewhere.  The ful is also very good.  My only complaint is that sometimes the food preparation takes forever, but I at least appreciate that they're making everything fresh."}
{"text":"...this is a great place....sorta diaganally( geographically) opposed to the equally good, Sczechuan Garden....... I had the Chicken Shawarma wrap and fries( cuz I was blue and needed grease)..six -fifty...both were great and delivered the goods...plus, the place has the old tin ceiling."}
{"text":"I did not appreciate this place until hunting for months and months in 3 cities to find food nearly this good. Their ful has taken me months,  to find a good enough recipe for and I can't beat the flavors in the sandwiches. 

 Next time I'm back in town, it will be my first meal. I'm just jealous that you have it nearby.

 Best to call ahead, everything is made home made and takes 10-20 minutes."}
{"text":"La Pita Express is a good alternative to Aladdin's Eatery if you are seeking mediterranean cuisine. The Hummus is good and I enjoyed every other dish I sampled. It is a nice small eatery that features quality food at affordable prices."}
