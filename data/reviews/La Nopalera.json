{"text":"A nice break from what's become the typical Mexican menu. Had a combo with Mexican blta and orange/pineapple juice. Very tasty. They squeezed the fruit to make the juice.   Service is like you're part of the family. They have a play area for kids which is great. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A must stop. The menu is fairly simple. My husband and I went together, and we both got the combination, a chicken torta and a 16 ounce juice. We also had an order of street corn, and enjoyed a feeling, fresh meal for $22.   The torta bread melted in my mouth, the chicken breast was juicy, and the vegetables and cheese were incredibly fresh! The fresh squeezed juice- I had cactus, pineapple, beet, and carrot juice- was amazing.   And the service- down to earth and extremely friendly. I can't wait to go back and try their yogurt."}
{"text":"Came here for first time today and will definitely be back! Ordered the BLTA with a fresh squeezed juice. Sandwich was amazing and included a yummy chipotle sauce along with Mexican cheese and avocado.  You can choose your own juice blend and as many as you like.  Beet, cactus, orange, kale, pineapple and celery made an absolutely perfect juice. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Great food at a great price. I had the torta today and it was amazing. Will definitely be a lunchtime staple.   Excellent vegetarian options."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch and it was very good! We both had chicken tortas and they were juicy and delicious. We got juice with it and it's all freshly made. We had pineapple, cactus, beet, and carrot juice blend. Next time I'd skip the beet as it kind of over-powered it. However, it tasted like it was giving me HEALTHY POWERS! :) The Mexican street corn was awesome. I had to try it so we shared a side of it and it was so yummy.  I do wish they had napkins out instead of having to ask for them. Had to ask twice because everything is very juicy so you need a lot! That said, the service was great and the people working there are very nice. They checked in on us twice to make sure we liked the food. Almost like a sit-down restaurant would, except this is a place where you order at the counter and then they bring you your food. Be sure to tip them though because they also bus your table afterwards. Be sure to try this gem on the near west side!"}
{"text":"Best torta ever ...the bread is soft and fresh , the chicken is an actual breast marinated in a tasty sauce ..great price for what you get. My boyfriend and I go here 1 a week to get street corn and a torta"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for the tortas. They are simply amazing! The combination of ingredients and warm bun are a delicious comfort food. A caring and warm staff ensure I'll be back. Highly recommended for their tortas and fresh juices!"}
{"text":"Caution, Tortas come out HOT! They ARE delicious though. The tomatoes were fantastically thick and ripe, the bread was crisp and delicious looking. All of their juices are obviously fresh squeezed and fantastic.   The fruit cocktail and elote my husband and I added were delivered later, like a desert. The elote was clearly freshly prepared, pieces were still stuck together from being cut off the cob! It was tangy and unlike anything I've tasted before, delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh juice and excellent food. I've been here a few times just for their juice. They have very reasonable prices and you can create your own combination, with as many fruits as you'd like. The cut everything right in front of you so you know it's fresh.   The tortas are the best I've had in Madison. I LOVE the cheese they use, the lettuce is fresh and crisp, and they have a variety of proteins to choose from. I've opted for the cactus, one of two vegetarian options. The cactus is very tasty and prepared well."}
{"text":"Walking in to this restaurant, I needed a bit of guidance. The person working was definitely helpful. I had heard such great things about the torta sandwiches, but I've never had one, so I didn't know what to order. He recommended the pork, so I went for it! I skipped some of the toppings like extra mayo, jalapeños, and the chipotle sauce, but the cheese, citrus mayo sauce, and everything else were delicious. I also ordered the street corn because I've been seeing it on menus all over, and if there was ever a place to try it, this seemed like the one. I should have said easy on the mayo or skip it because the portion was huge. The corn, cheese, and spices were delicious! My friend ordered one of their juices and enjoyed it. Tons of fresh ingredients! I would go back again to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Small menu of tortas, salads, and fresh juice. Doing a \"combo\" with fresh juice is well worth it - they let you combine many fruits and vegetables. Had a grilled chicken breast torta with jalapeños and a beet-carrot-pineapple juice. Great juice and good sandwich. Will def come back."}
{"text":"I never noticed this restaurant previously, and was delighted to happen upon it biking today. I had a torta al pastor with chipotle sauce and jalapenos. Healthier variations of Mexican favorites are possible here without the blase anglicization common in the usual appropriations for the typical cheese curd herds.   A variety of fresh juices is available, making the fair-priced combo irresistible. A visit to \"La Noplera\" (from the Nahuatl/Spanish word for an area abundant in prickly pear cacti) would not be complete without nopales juice, which goes well with pineapple. I completed the meal with a homemade cheesecake that was worth the scolding from MyFitnessPal.  Subway used to be here; if you are tired of being stuck with chains as the only option for a quick meal, this clean and cheerful space is a must to support! English is spoken but the Galdan's are happy to speak in Spanish with respectful gringos looking to practice. Next time I will save room for elote, and return on a Tuesday night or Saturday morning when the restaurant is bombangling with Antonio Morales' Zumba classes."}
{"text":"Fresh food with a Mexican bent, but the emphasis is on \"fresh.\" Kid- and vegetarian-friendly options. Just good quality ingredients prepared mostly by the owners. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First time trying La Nopalera and it was great! The food and service were amazing,definitely coming  back."}
{"text":"Simple menú but fresh.  I love that they offer a variety of fresh squeezed juices that they make to order! Clean and very friendly and attentive staff.  We will be coming back."}
{"text":"The first of MANY visits to come. The tortas are simply fantastic- I don't know what the sauce/dressing is, but it is full of creamy goodness. Put that with the avocado and panela cheese...dream come true. I got the jalapeño sauce on my cactus torta, and the hubby got the chipotle sauce on his chicken torta.   I also got one of their \"choose your own ingredient\" juices. Apple, Orange, carrot and cucumber. REALLY good - perfect balance, you could really taste each ingredient. The only problem is...now I want to buy a juicer!   I'm always a sucker for flan, so had to get that to finish up - couldn't eat it until later though, since the tortas are gigantic!   Cute little seating area, and a play corner for kids. We will for sure be going back again sooooon!"}
{"text":"$10 for a torta and fresh juice. Overall a really solid lunch. The bread doesn't overpower the sandwich like some tortas can do. Quality meat and really good flavors. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Incredible tortas! The best in Madison! Perfect portion sizes and all fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"One of my Favorite sandwiches shop in Madison.  Family own and operated. Most of the time - the manager in site is the owner as well! Fresh squeezed apple / orange / pineapple and Tortas are the best choice for lunch."}
{"text":"A small selection, but what we had was good.  Bread for the tortas was fresh, and unlike many places, the bread was not the size of a smashed football (so you don't feel like you're just filling up on bread).  Elotes was good as well.  Tortas are around $6 and with a fresh juice it's around $8, which is a bargain.  Everything (including the juice) is made fresh, down to slicing the tomatoes for the tortas.  If this were in a trendy Southern California location the juices would be selling for about 3 times as much.  If I wasn't full when I left I would have got some yogurt with fruit to top it all off."}
{"text":"Fresh food, authentic, friendly service, pleasant atmosphere. Small menu, tortas, juices, etc. I had the torta with chicken, it was very tasty and authentic. Only critique would be the fact that our juices were served room temperature with no ice."}
{"text":"We tried it tonight for the first time and it was great! We had a chicken torta and a pork one. They were both good, but I'll order the pulled pork one next time. The staff is friendly and there's a little area for the kids to stay busy too!"}
{"text":"I came in tonight for a cactus torta and a juice. Both were absolutely delicious! I loved being able to watch the juice being made, and the flavor was amazing (I got beet, spinach, kale, and pineapple). The torta had so many great flavors, and worked together perfectly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What it is: a mexican sandwich and juice shoppe What they offer: small selection of tortas, BLTS, Wraps, salads, elotes. They also have made to order fresh juice. With a wide array of fruits to choose from. Yogurt drinks and ice cream are available. Also they have a small mexican grocery items for sale.  Taste: very delicious. And reasonably priced. Worth it."}
{"text":"I'm dreaming of going back for the tortas! The food menu is small, but it doesn't matter. You just need to have a torta. We had the chicken and the blt tortas. Both were fresh, a perfect combo of pillowy and crispy on the outside, and sauces had a great moderate kick.   I tried a juice (beets, carrots, pineapple I think?). It was fine. A little too earthy and it could've been colder. I don't love beets, so probably should've opted for something without it.   I'm worried this place might not last due to the location. Which would make me sad. They are super nice, the restaurant is clean, prices are reasonable and the tortas will majorly satisfy your lunch tooth. So go, support the place and eat a torta!"}
{"text":"Wow, talk about the best deal in Madison to get a fresh squeezed juice. Under $6 for a 24 ounce juice!  Everything is so fresh and the owners are sooo nice.  As much as I would like to keep this place my own little \"best kept secret\" I would highly recommend this place to everyone.   Always great to support a locally owned business!"}
{"text":"Delicious! So easy with my kids including the very picky eater. Love the toy area to keep my wiggle worms contained while I enjoyed my fresh juice and sandwich."}
{"text":"I stopped at La Nopalera yesterday at the recommendation of a friend who had not been there yet, but had read good reviews.  The menu is not extensive, and not what you think of when you think of \"Mexican restaurant\", but my gosh, it is good!  I ordered the sincronizada, which is essentially a quesadilla, but so much more - absolutely delicious, and fresh.  They have other sandwiches, as well as fresh fruit drinks - you pick the fruits/vegetables you want in your drink - any combination you like - which they juice in front of you.  They also are open for breakfast.  Even though I live in the area, I had never noticed this place - what a gem it is!  I plan to eat my way through their menu."}
{"text":"BLT torta (under $7) is one of the BEST sandwiches I have EVER eaten!! Delicious ingredients and complex flavor. Flan ($2.75) was really good too!! Oh yes so was the juice... and Mexican hot dog!! Omg EVERYTHING IS SOO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place; inviting. Kids play area in one corner, couch in another and the outer perimeter lined with counters and stools. A couple of tables in the middle. Not a wide variety on the menu, but it made no difference. Street corn was great and so was the chicken torta; might be better to eat as an open faced sandwich and ask to have the cheese for the street corn on the side. They have some made to order juices, along with some basic groceries, including corn husks for when you're up to makes some tamales. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food was delicious, and the owners and employees were attentive and kind, but the best part was how kid friendly the location was! There's a small play space in the corner, and my one year old played while I managed to eat my whole meal while it was still hot. Great food choices for kids too! Can't wait to go back. Get a torta and a fruit cocktail (spicy)!!"}
{"text":"La Nopalera is such a hidden gem that more people need to know about! I stopped by here today to grab my dad lunch, and got him a combo with a BLT torta and 16oz juice (pineapple, apple, and orange mixed together is delicious!). While I only tried sips of the juice (which was freshly made right in front of me), my dad was also very happy with his torta! It was hot and fresh and filling.  Overall La Nopalera has a sweet, clean, and laid-back feel to it with lots of seating. The owners & employees are very friendly and welcoming, and definitely put a lot of effort into making this place the gem that it is. I can't wait to come back soon and try the vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"First time at La Nopalera today--pork torta and fresh squeezed juice.  So delicious!  The torta: bread was fresh and tender, sandwich included perfectly seasoned pulled pork, generous avocado, lettuce, ripe tomatoes and a delicious mild cheese.  The torta was wonderfully flavorful, thanks to the high quality of the ingredients.  Vegetarian sandwiches also available (including cactus).  Also, a breakfast item, salad and a few other treats. The juices are made to order from beautifully ripe fruits and vegetables.  I am a current fan and future regular of La Nopalera!  I've already planned my next two tortas (cactus, then chorizo, then rotating back to the pork!).  p.s. free wifi"}
