{"text":"This place was disgusting!  I wouldn't give this food to my cocker spaniel.  It didn't even taste human grade.  I knew it was middle of the road, but it turned out o be bottom of the barrel.  We had enchiladas with barely any meat -- chicken and beef sirloin.  The food was also incredibly salty.  I don't understand how guacamole arrives with absolutely no taste whatsoever.  It was bland and mealy.  My mother had enchiladas as well.  We all unrolled them and picked the meat out.  I guess we were supposed to get full on corn tortillas.  My husband ordered FOUR different margaritas and they were disgusting and weak -- full of syrup water and who knows what.  I ordered a vodka martini up, no vermouth lime on the side. The waiter arrived with a SHOT of vodka with an olive in it. How does that happen? We couldn't even get a proper cocktail to whet our appetites.  Our rationale was to at least to try and drink in order to drown out the mediocrity of the food.  Chuys needs some serious help! This lack of quality will not last in Charlotte, even with the super low prices."}
{"text":"We visited Chuy's on whim since the line at Cowfish was ridiculous. Common occurrence, right?

Out of our party of four adults and one child, no one was impressed enough to return. 

Pros: wait time was decent, server was friendly, atmosphere was interesting, food was truly Tex Mex and spicy!

Cons: margaritas were crammed with ice and were gone in three small sips, no beer on tap, guacamole was served on a huge bed of lettuce to appear like you were getting a decent amount (you weren't), everyone's plate of food came out a ton of rice/beans and not a lot of substance, prices were high.

I had the Baja shrimp tacos which was really just a few pieces of shrimp on a tortilla with about a teaspoon of sauce. No flavor. Nothing special.

We won't be returning. Even if the line at Cowfish is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food and the service was fantastic.  My grip is about the margaritas.  They were horrible.   Three of us tried different on the rocks specials and all tasted exactly the same.. sour or bad mix or something.   I ordered one with Grand Mariner.. couldnt taste it at all.  Figured it was fluke.. ordered another one with a \"floater\".. nothing.. tasted exactly the same as the other one.. maybe worse.     Typically a floater comes on the side and you pour it in yourself.   For a mexican or texmex place.. bad drinks.

the place was great for food, atmosphere and service though"}
{"text":"You must try the mojitos! Jacob and Ryan at the bar make the best strawberry mojitos ever!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I'm from Texas, and I have been to them all (almost), including the original one in Austin.  After recently moving here I was so glad one opened in Charlotte.  There isn't a lot of spicy food or TexMex here, and I was really missing the heat!  I love love love the creamy jalapeno dip, but I think you have to ask for it...?  YOU MUST TRY THE CREAMY JALAPENO DIP!  I also really like the beef fajitas.  The flour tortillas are fluffy and delicious, and I always order extra.  Don't skip this place because \"it's just a chain.\"  That's crazy!  It is a chain because it is good and they expanded.  Whoo hoo!  I have been to so called Mexican food places out here since I relocated with flour tortilla enchiladas (what!!?!), \"nacho cheese dip with jalapeno\" (just, NO!), and other terrible so called Mexican food abominations.  This is uniquely TexMex.  They do not claim to be authentic Mexican.  It is fun, inexpensive, and good rock n roll music to boot.  The ritas are great too.  This is the only place this homesick Texan can find good TexMex east of the Mississippi! Oh, and the Tres Leches Cake is unbelievably delicious.

Seriously, Chuy's staff, please put the creamy jalapeno dip on the table.  It is good and no one knows to ask for it.....wth......?"}
{"text":"I love TEXMEX.  It's a nice place and the most favorite Mexican restaurant in
Charlotte.
I reccomed beef fajita and tortilla soup!
Every food is good what you eat!"}
{"text":"Excellent Taco salad - fresh lettuce and loaded with toppings. Fair margarita. Fair service on a Thursday night when restaurant was unusually slow. Big Chuy's fan from Texas. Expected a little better but not so disappointed that I wouldn't get a Tex-Mex fix there again."}
{"text":"Nice bar and free nacho bar. Unfortunately the food lacks consistency. We eat there once a month for the past 1.5 years and always get the same couple of dishes, not once have they turned out the same."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, that I ate here as a third choice due to two local restaurants being completely packed at 9:30 PM. I was not disappointed or over the moon about the food.  The atmosphere was great and my friend from Mexico said that it was true \"Mexican-style\". The service was superb and this is definitely a Tex-Mex restaurant... I prefer Mexican food, but that was not an option at the time.

I had beef fajitas and my friend had the crunchy tacos. The beef fajitas were pretty good, but not the best I have had. My friend liked her tacos, and was in love with the salsa and guacamole.

I would suggest this restaurant if you are looking for a quick and casual dinning experience."}
{"text":"Chuy's is loud, crowded with less than mediocre food.  Not a good restaurant for the South Park area with its tacky decor.  It's like a McDonalds playground with kids running everywhere including on top of the walls around the restaurant and fountain.  You can find much better Mexican food anywhere in this area. It's cheap food and I guess that's the draw.  Zink the former upscale restaurant at that location allowed dogs on the patio.  This cheap, tacky restaurant doesn't allow dogs."}
{"text":"Last time here, waiter dropped ice scoop on floor and he put it back in ice bin."}
{"text":"I waited until our 3rd visit to leave an honest review. First time was around opening, they were trying real hard but lots of errors with order and very slow service. Food was decent though and figured we would come back. 2nd time was a bit worse on the food side, lots of semi warm stuff and average service. Came back yesterday for dinner for 2 and same slow lousy service with a waiter who was very clueless to the menu and an actual sense of service. The food here is just poor IMO. Nothing fresh at all in any way, except the chips and salsa. Prices are decent which is the only saving grace. You can do much much better for your dinner plans in my opinion."}
{"text":"A couple of coworkers and I went for lunch last week. I had heard mixed reviews, but I wanted to try it for myself. Some people don't like the decor, but on a rainy day it was exactly what we needed...bright and fun!
We started with the queso that has ground beef and guac in it. It was super yummy!! Oh, and make sure to ask for the Green Sauce too for dipping....its a do not miss! And the chips were incredibly fresh. I ordered the Baja Tacos, I got one shrimp and one fish, both were excellent. I was so stuffed I couldn't finish my meal. I ordered the 'Green Rice' instead of the Spanish rice. It was a little dry...like it was an old batch, but it was ok. 
The other two ladies enjoyed their lunches as well. The only two things that bothered me were that you can't get an alternate side like veggies or a side salad instead of rice/beans. And they said they couldn't split the dip between the three of us. With the POS systems they use these days I can't see how that would be a problem. 
Overall I really enjoyed it. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were super excited about this restaurant opening up. We lived in Austin and ate there all the time.  Although the food at this location is good, the chuy changa being my personal favorite with the creamy jalapeño sauce, the service is still lacking. I don't believe I've ever been there no matter where I get sat, and have been given silverware and  napkins without asking for them. A place that has a free nacho bar, which I love, those are some damn good chips,  does not think it's important to give you a napkin and silverware!  And when you do ask for it, they seem surprised.   I've held off complaining about this to let the newness wear off but it's been open 8 months now, and it's still happening. Just ate there tonight."}
{"text":"Nothing too special here. It's a great spot. Looks nice inside but it's so loud we could barely hear each other talk (may be just where we were sitting) Salsa was good and so was creamy jalepeno,  Tuesdays happy hour special was Margaritas which was a bonus but they were just OK, not too impressed with my shrimp tacos either, should be grilled and not fried. I had higher hopes for Chuys, have definitely had better and is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Chuy's in Austin, and while I am generally not a fan of chains, I was THRILLED to see signs go up for the new location in Charlotte.  No disrespect to the exciting mexican restaurants in Charlotte--Catina and 1900 Mexican--but Chuy's puts them all to shame.  Paco's Tacos and Taco Max don't even qualify.  In addition to offering a broad array of traditional mexican fare, Chuy's provides an interesting choice of sauces to add to your dish to put a twist on your meal.  Kids will love the bright, fun atmosphere and kids meals that come with a push pop.  Adults will love the large portions (burritos the size of your face) and drink options.  Run, don't walk.  This place is such a great addition to the Charlotte restaurant scene.  Kudos to the owners for a brilliant transformation of the space."}
{"text":"So glad that Chuy's is finally in Charlotte! Great casual tex-mex dining. Staff in Charlotte is great....especially Cori - great server! Fun atmosphere and food is very good and very consistent. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Cowfish fan so I decided to try out Chuy's next door as Cowfish was a little busy on a day when I was in the area. It was definitely just okay. The service was also just okay but I probably would go back if it had been better. A group of servers decided to sit at a table next to us and gossip for a while and none of them ever came over to check on our table. When the tortillas came out they were covered in flour. I inquired about them and was told that 'that was the way they were made\" ...so when I went to eat the flour got everywhere. The flour definitely took away from the taste of my taco making it sticky in my mouth. I also had issues with the 'nacho' bar which was dirty and dusty so I passed on it. I went once and that was enough for me.  If you  do go I would suggest a sangria (It was sweet and Delicious) but there are definitely better places in Charlotte to go get food like this where you will get better service and a cleaner atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been to Cowfish which is nextz to Chuy's many time before. Each time I have said that next time I would go to Chuy's and this time I finally did. 

I loved the decor of the place. It has a relaxed feel to it and reminds me of home, California. Our waiter introduced , shortly after we sat down. And before I could look up we had water along with Chips and Salsa. The chips are great. Freash, crips, light and not greasy. Perfect. They make the tortillas by hand at their tortilla station so how could u go wron:on he chips. We ordered the Queso which was a little spicy for me but I enjoyed the flavor that I couldn't stop eating it. I had a Texas Martini to go with it. It would have neen oerfect but it had a little too much lime in it for my liking which left a little bitter rasye in my mouth.  I ordered the steak burrito which has a very spicy sauce on top of it but our waiter saw that thr queso was a little too much for me so he suggested anotherbsauce for me that was mild and complimented the dish very well. Iy was sooooo good. I had the refried bean with it, which taste like yhey make that as well. 

This place serves delicious food for reasonable prices. I will definitely return to Chuy's again and again."}
{"text":"First timers at Chuys!! I was pleasantly surprised. The food was great and portion size was great. Our waiter was efficient and had a sense of humor. I am wheat free and I was able to eat safely. The reason for a four rating for me is because the GF menu is very limited. You basically can only eat the taco meat but the tacos are amazing and the ranch dressing as amazing. Also you can not eat the rice or chips they bring to the table. The reason I believe this is the case is cross contamination. It didn't bother me."}
{"text":"This is now our favorite Tex-Mex in town.   Service was good. Good chips (salsa was diced tomatoes but they gladly provided Tex-Mex sauce for me.)   Deluxe chicken enchilada sauce had a heavy sour cream flavor that I didn't like, but the chicken was really good quality white meat.   I've had same meal at On the Border and the chicken was absolutely crap.  Thanks Chuy's, you've won my business."}
{"text":"When we moved from Houston to Charlotte, we were heartbroken to leave Chuy's behind...and were thrilled when we found out that they'd be opening in Charlotte this summer. We were out of town for their actual Grand Opening, but finally made it in about 2 weeks after they opened. We were seated quickly around 6:15 on a Wednesday. As soon as our server came over to take our drink order we also asked for a cup of the creamy jalapeno dip to go with the chips - it was delicious, but not quite what we're used to - I think it was missing some garlic, or maybe even some jalapeno. I had a Bloody Mary, others in my party had margaritas.

I ordered my old standby, the big as your face burrito with fajita beef, with Boom Boom Sauce (think cheesy, green chile goodness). I love that I get a solid two meals out of it. The Boom Boom Sauce was extra spicy that night, but had cooled off a bit by lunch the next day.

We're hoping that this location will be participating in the annual Chuy's Green Chile Festival in August."}
{"text":"The worst meal I never ate -  despite all the Disneyland decor this place serves such poor Mexican food it cant have much of a future - service was at best dodgy  and when the food arrived it was no better than a \"boil in the bag\" meal.

The Chimichanga was soggy and the contents so tasteless the so called bang bang couldn't save it. The\" De luxe\" Quesadilla was devoid of cheese looking more like a taco then a quesadilla and enchiladas tasteless and stodgy.  The queso was thin and watery with some taste the chips were nice and crisp though.

Go for the free food because no should have to pay for it."}
{"text":"Tasted good going down but my wife and I spent the night getting sick from it. I feel miserable today."}
{"text":"Great food. I don't typically eat at chains. I have been searching for a restaurant that has an enchilada sauce close to the sauce my dad used to make me , growing up in Texas. The cheese and onion enchiladas are amazing and the ranchero sauce is so reminiscent of my Dads sauce, it was even derived in Del Rio , Texas , where my Dad was from! Most Mexican restaurants in Charlotte have a brown goopy sauce they put on everything, not here. The boom boom sauce is  also delicious on chips or rice . My husband loved the fish tacos.,I have already been twice! It is a huge restaurant, I hope they are here to stay,"}
{"text":"Jason was bartending when I was there to celebrate my friend's 21st bday. He greeted us with a smile, was very attentive and a really nice guy. The atmosphere was awesome, very fun. The hostesses at the door were also very friendly. I'll definitely be back and next time I'm getting food!"}
{"text":"3rd time we've eaten here and it is going down in quality of food and service.  Ordered shrimp tacos, when they came out the second was noticeably skimpier than 1st (fewer shrimp, couple bits of cabbage, little sauce). We said something to our server and a manager came out, gave us a 3rd taco and said \"I brought you another. \" Ummm, thanks. Server topped off spouses club soda with water. 
Everything was HOT with little flavor -- salsa, Pico de gallo, charro  beans,  etc.
When we ordered dessert, they did give us a big piece of cake, though.
Too many better, more authentic options to go back here."}
{"text":"One of the best things about Yelp is that it sets expectations.  I went here knowing that it wouldn't be great, but that it would fit our purpose.
Sometimes, however, Yelp makes you lean too far one way or the other - like that time I went to a brunch place expecting out-of-the-world scones and was disappointed.  The food at Chuy's was better than I expected (I had chile rellanos) but I think I prefer Paco's.  However, what people said about the prices was spot on - very affordable for a family dinner on a weeknight.  The patio seating area was great, and if your kids misbehave you can throw them in the fountain.  You can also look longingly over at the diners at Cowfish and wonder how long they waited for a table."}
{"text":"Sorry, Kim T.  I'd have to rather disagree with you.  Lynn Thompson is such a sweet lady.  I'm usually and by usually I mean I HATE mexican, tex-mex, etc (exceptions for Chipotle.)  However, my experience here has always been great.  I've gone quite a few times and I've gotten to know Lynn on more \"friendly\" basis.  She has come to greet me and my friends quite a few times and talk to us even when she has been super busy. But, that doesn't excuse what you have to say about her. Does she cuss quite loud on the line, yes, but  I know for a fact that she doesn't call her staff \"pieces of shit.\"  She loves all of her staff and treats them quite well.  If you've eaten there so many times as you stated you would realize this.  Also, why are YOU \"supporting\" a company that treats the staff so \"badly\"?  That doesn't make sense in the least.  

Anyways, Kim is a joke.  I'd definitely go check out the place and see for yourself.  It's so cheap (food wise) you aren't losing anything and the service and managers are just wonderful!!"}
{"text":"We just ate there for the first time.  It was kind of expensive for some pretty tasteless food.  I had the classic Tex-Mex enchiladas (onion and cheese).  It had no taste.  I tasted mostly the dough in the tortilla. There was a sauce and I think that's how they flavor their foods - with sauce.  Even the refritos were tasteless. My daughter had fish tacos with slaw.  There was barely any slaw.  There was basically just a hunk of battered fish in a taco.  The best thing I can say was their guacamole was good.  But, for over $30, I expected better.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Rowdy \"Randall\"....good arms though 

Every Saturday, my family has a tendency to blind and gag a family member and drag him/her  to a terrible restaurant against his/her will. Today was no exception. Just as I slipped off my glasses, my mother knocked me out and when I woke up, I was inside an eclectic Mexican warehouse. \"Where am I?\" I asked in a trancelike manner. I was responded to by a pair of ditsy girls who said \"Welcome to Chuy's!\" Ha. More like Chewy's. They immediately seated me and stuffed me with assorted creams and tomatoes. It was quite delicious. Then, egad! Terror struck! I won't name any names (his name might have been the bad lizard monster from monsters inc or perhaps Randy Jackson's full name) so I'll call him Paco. Paco was so abrasive! In the time that we were there, he didn't say hi, threw food at my petite mother, yelled at us, threw away my 4 year old sisters artwork, didn't offer us dessert, and to top it off, HE STOLE ONE OF MY TACOS!!!!! 

yeh food was good 

Highly recommend that they find therapy for Paco's problem......"}
{"text":"It was happy hour and the chips with different toppings they offer for free was a nice surprise.  My table ordered tacos and fajitas and we were presently surprised with the quality of food and the subtle differences of other Mexican/TexMex restaurants. (Quality, Texture, and Taste of Shells being one.). The wait staff were very helpful and kept drinks refilled before they were gone."}
{"text":"I previously came to this establishment and had a wonderful experience. Unfortunately, I can no longer say that. Horrible service and the food is no longer worth while. A friend of mine and I both had the #6 combo with the chalupa, taco and enchilada. The chicken on the chalupa had absolutely NO flavor. It tasted like chicken that was simply boiled and shredded. Our server spilled salsa juice on my friend and menu and never offered a napkin or apologized. He completely forgot to bring us silverware, so when the food did arrive we had to wait to even eat. I'm just disappointed, I raved about this place to my friend and then this is what happened."}
{"text":"Fun Atmosphere if you sit on the patio, the inside is a little bit overkill for my taste.  I had the taco salad, husband had the Elvis plate.  The food was good and the service was prompt and friendly.  Unfortunately we knocked ourselves out on unlimited chipes and salsa before our meals came out and didnt get to enjoy all of our meals :( Oh well, theres always next time."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and their homemade flour tortillas. The salsa is also really great. The new location is really busy but worth the wait. We regularly go and have the chicken tacos. The pinto beans are a must."}
{"text":"Chuy's is a Texas favorite! If you're looking for a laid back atmosphere, great margaritas, ice cold beer and Tex-Mex fare you can't do much better than Chuy's!"}
{"text":"Fast food on a plate. The food was marginal at best I ordered the burrito which I knew would be spicy but  it wrecked my palette and I could not eat any more. I did not think I would have to ask for water but you obviously do and with the slow Service it became a miserable experience. I will take some responsibility for the spicy order, but it won't make up for the fact there is no other reason to return. There are better places close by."}
{"text":"Had lunch with family- started OK, chips & dip/queso good. Server started off spilling creamy jalapeno sauce down my sons back and chair- didn't make much of an apology. They don't give side plates out so you end up spilling salsa and queso all over the table. Server wasn't that friendly and patient with people not familiar with menu. I rang ahead and asked if they had many gluten free options (for my daughter) and they said they did- turns out all they really had was some salad items, corn tortillas and cheese- not even rice.
Then they got my sons order wrong - twice, we were finished before he started. Of the adults 2 liked their food and two unimpressed. I had fish tacos- very mediocre and bland, reminded me of 80's style tex-mex- big disappointment given hype of how different they are. Finished the meal with server setting to-go box in spilled salsa mess on the table- waiter needs to find a different job, seriously. Waiter made no effort to right the spills- food mistakes- not coming back."}
{"text":"Our first visit , we had excelent service throughout the entire meal!  The wait staff helped us understand the menu and the unique sauces they offer .  The food we ordered was warm and very tasty.  Thanks !"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my hubby and 3 year old. This place is really huge with many rooms, and it is child friendly. They have a nice children's menu/coloring book. The waiter we had was pretty good, he served us our food at a good time, and checked to see if we wanted more drinks or needed anything from time to time. 
Their margaritas were good, their complimentary chips and salsa were good, but the entrees we ordered were not good. I ordered their chika chika boom boom and it was ridiculously spicy! My husband ordered an enchilada plate, and his was also way too spicy! Why was there no warning about how spicy their dishes were on the menu?
It was hard to enjoy my meal since my mouth was burning. Other than that, the service was ok, the decor was nice, but overall the food is the most important thing at  a restaurant, so we won't be coming back to Chuys."}
{"text":"Funky décor.  Large patio space.  Found myself here mid-week happy hour time and didn't want dinner, but a margarita and an app sounded good.  Service was good; I can't remember the guy's name but he was friendly and funny and attentive. I had something about a Grandma's margarita - it was good, nothing spectacular, but good.
The 3 stars is for my nachos.  It was a fried tortilla sliced up 6 (or 8?) pieces, with canned refried beans smothering it, a splash of cheese and a couple diced tomatoes with (more) canned jalapeños. In the center was a dab of guac on some lettuce.  It just looked sad.  We asked for sour cream and got a spoonful in a bowl - no seriously I'll post a pic.  I took the pic just in case they upcharge for condiments, which I'm happy to report they did not charge us for the spoonful. The server wanted to warn us the sirloin was ground, and I assumed it would be ok but this stuff wasn't even the consistency of ground.  How could you ruin good steak by grinded it to itty bitty specks of nothing??? 
If I go again, it likely will be for another rita, but I'm pretty sure I can find a better deal elsewhere"}
{"text":"I have been to this Mexican restaurant a few times and every time it's a very good meal.
I got the Elvis fried chicken and it was awesome for a Mexican place I can highly recommended the parking there is chaos at best."}
{"text":"We went here because the wait at Cowfish next door was too long. We should have read the Yelp reviews. The food was very average and the service was not great. We did get many many refills of tortilla chips!!"}
{"text":"We visited shortly they opened, it wasn't very good. But decided to go again after friends had pronounced it up to scratch. Boy did it slide;  the food when it finally arrived was insipid and lack any depth of flavor. Even the rice and beans was well below the mark of some of the local low end joints. This is Tex Mex at it's most mediocre at South Park prices.

Service seemed to be a problem maybe it was the line of unsuspecting punters waiting to get to a slice of this chain's very dull fare. I'm headed back to Paco's and Cantina. I won't be fooled by fancy decor and hype again."}
{"text":"Food was horrible!  I ordered Mexican rice as a side.  They cooks plated my entree with green chile rice instead because the Mexican rice has a wait time of 10 minutes.  I do not like green chile rice and, ummm, most restaurants ask you for your desired side instead of just giving a substitute. Note:  The chalupa is NOT like a traditional chalupa.  Oh and when the waiter (manager) finally brought the rice...his thumbs were in the bowl and nearly covered with our rice.  NO THANK YOU."}
{"text":"Should have gone with my guy instincts for chains...food is terrible.  It's probably a good place to bring your family if you a bunch of little ones.  They'll blend tight in with the other screaming and yelling ones running wild."}
{"text":"Service was horrific.  We couldn't get napkins without begging.  I ordered Fajitas and waited at least 10 minutes after they were delivered to get a plate to eat from.  The chips are really thin.  The house salsa was way too lemony.

I am amazed that this is a successful restaurant.

I'm from texas and am tough judge of texmex.  The charro beans were the best I've had in Charlotte.  Only place I've had really good tortillas but they had way too much flour covering them."}
{"text":"Best value for money tex-mex I know of in Charlotte, especially South Park area.
Great outdoor seating area.
Somewhat long wait time due to its popularity.
Service can be a little slow sometimes."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible food. Bad experience. So basic! The decor is nice which is why they get the one star but the waiter was rude. The food tasted horrible! The beef taco carbon or whatever was horrible don't get it. The pancho nachos suck. The only good thing is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating at this Chuy's as I have had wonderful food & experience at their Austin, TX location.  However, this was a big disappointment.  My first mistake was to go there during the weekend of restaurant week.  After an hour wait though, I was still excited to try this location out.  The food was only okay.  The \"Big As Your Face\" burrito was more beans then anything else (lacked cheese and beef).  The worse part was my server.  He never mentioned the restaurant week specials.  While talking to us about our order he yawned twice (not the little yawn but the mouth wide open and I'm going to try to continue to talk type yawn) with no apologies.  When I asked about certain foods like the fajitas his reply was \"it's okay\".  Then I asked if he could tell me what's popular and his reply was a standard \"whatever you see in the blue writing\"  No suggestions. No descriptions.  We order a few appetizer which one didn't arrive to the table until we were 1/3 into entrée (he appeared to have forgotten that we placed the order). Lastly when we were ready to pay for the order, he tossed the guest check holder on the table which caused our credit card to fall to the floor and just walked away...WOW.  That was the kicker for us.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST chips and fresh salsa (the salsa is one of the most flavorful salsas in all of NC!) You also have to try their jalapeño ranch to dip with your chips (it is free), and it is not very spicy- I don't like a lot of spice.  I would definitely recommend their chicken quesadilla appetizer, because their tortillas are fresh and hand made to order.  There quesadillas are also packed with creamy cheese, juicy chicken and are always served sizzling hot!  This is one of my family's favorite places to eat, because they are quick, fresh, fairly priced and they have an extensive menu.  The restaurant's decor is fun and they have various spaces to accommodate large gatherings, such as birthday parties.  It is definitely family friendly and it is fun for the kids to watch the workers make the fresh tortillas.  It is also a great place to go if you are looking for something pretty casual, but want table service. 
*There is usually not much of a wait, since the restaurant is so large... Also they do a great job refilling your FREE chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst service we've had in a while.
Arrived at 8:30 pm on Saturday night. Placed in the back room. Only one other table occupied back there. Should have been clued in that they were so empty on a Saturday night at 8:30pm. Waitress took our drink order and appetizer order. Took a while for both? We should have cut our loses, but ordered dinner anyway. Appetizer came and was wrong. Waitress went to fix but gone pretty long. Obviously not a priority to fix. Meanwhile no drink refills or offer to get another margarita. No manager checking in.
Dinner arrives. 1 out of 4 also wrong. My correct dinner arrived as others were finishing. Again, their mistake was not a priority to fix. No manager to check in with. Both times waitress said that she ordered it correctly, but the kitchen read it wrong.

Sadly, I think the food might have been okay, but service so bad it was hard to tell.
Dinner took an hour and 1/2 because waitress was so busy doing side work that she was oblivious to the needs in the room.  My wife joked that if someone accidentally got cut and was bleeding out, they wouldn't have noticed until they were dead for quite some time.

Not looking for a free meal or even a discount, but they barely acknowledged that anything went wrong. If the waitress was new, the absentee manager should be ashamed of he/she's over site of their restaurant. . . on a Saturday night, no less. . .

Big fan of Chuy's in Houston. Service never like this. Not sure I'll be back to this location.



Summary- food was fairly good when it ultimately showed up, but don't let them seat you in the back room no matter what."}
{"text":"First time food and drink awesome still new lots of employees tripping over each other. ..that will fix itself as the weed out the non worker's. ..FAMILIES this is Tex Mex so if little taste buds don't want a little heat don't look for a menu change go out fot kiddie food and one day you can eat like an adult again .Had appetizer sampler amazing fresh guacamole some of the best in area ...wife loved her enchiladas and margarita. .will recommend to all in area but again little taste buds may want to wait"}
{"text":"Came here for a bite to eat at about 3 in the afternoon. It was pretty crowded considering the time. I can't imagine the crowds it likely draws in during peak hours. You may want to avoid coming during meal \"rush hours\". Anyway, we arrived and had to wait about two minutes to be seated. I can't complain though, since we had a large party.  But given the time, I'd expect it would take a bit less time than that. After the brief wait, we were seated and immediately jostled with chip baskets. They were mediocre at best in my opinion, and the salsa was horrendous. They also provided guacamole, though it was a wasted effort considering we had already munched on the majority of the chips. To add insult to injury, the guacamole was topped with tomatoes, which I despise. It's not very considerate of those like me who have no taste for tomatoes. I personally would have put the tomatoes to the side to at least give those dining a choice. The guacamole itself was average. After eating all of the chips, I found myself low on the sprite I had requested. Instead of getting more sprite after being asked if I would like a refill, I was disappointed with water. A bit more waiting and our food finally arrived. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and had already given my silverware to another member at my table since I was expecting to be able to eat utensil-free. But, it was huge and floppy. It would've been nearly impossible to eat neatly without utensils, so it was necessary to get some. The portion was so huge I couldn't even finish it all. It's hard to imagine how somebody could've eaten it in one sitting. It wasn't horrible tasting, but unmemorable. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you haven't eaten for 3 days and are willing to pay for overpriced food that is mediocre or below."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Austin original! I understand they just opened the service was somewhat lacking a needed more training some of the food was not consistent but overall I think it will be a great place to eat once I get everything in order."}
{"text":"I love this place usually. However tonight when I along with 4 others dined we didn't have great service. Our server wasn't the friendliest. He tried to talk one of us out of getting an item. An item that he always gets. Then when we asked for an empty to go cup to pour our left over dressing we were told that would be a $1.35 charge. That is beyond ridiculous. I can not believe that we were charged for an empty to go cup. That blows my mind. I have never been charged to take home something I've already purchased. Very disappointed in this trip to chuys. Let's hope I come back."}
{"text":"Have been reading reviews of Charlotte's Chuy's.  A lot of the reviewers seem amused or perplexed by the decor.  Taken out of its historical context, the interior is completely obnoxious.  I've been eating at the original location in Austin TX since 1988.  It's been around since 1982.  The original location is even funkier, catering to the UT college student. It may seem a bit cheesy these days but back in the 80s the decor was revolutionary.  The new restaurants still pay homage to the original. 
Their menu is best  if you avoid the standard Tex Mex dishes.  Try the stuffed sopapilla, chicken Chuychanga, 911 plate, crispy baja fish tacos, chicken flautas, deluxe chicken enchiladas. In general, their sauces are king.  Find a sauce you like and try pairing it with different dishes. The menu is deeper and more satisfying than it might appear at first glance. 
And I agree, their beans have always been sub par, the borracho beans are a bit better."}
{"text":"There's a truth about some restaurants that we sometimes don't want to acknowledge. Like Chotchkie's, the fictional restaurant from \"Office Space,\" sometimes people come to a restaurant for the atmosphere and the attitude. Never mind that the food is astonishingly mediocre.

Hate to break the news, but Chuy's is the Chotchkie's of Tex-Mex restaurants. Lots of kitschy atmosphere, plenty of chirpy attitude (seriously, some of the waitstaff here act like they're spending the last few months of a prison sentence at a halfway home), and the food is simply very bland. And Tex-Mex should NEVER be bland. 

Look, I don't dislike Chuy's, but it feels a lot like what you get when you go to a joint like Chili's or Outback; a so-called \"authentic\" and \"real\" atmosphere that's anything but. For what they're charging you - no kidding, this is some seriously expensive Tex-Mex - you're definitely not getting your money's worth. 

You're better off at La Unica at Indian Trial or Three Amigos off Central Avenue. You'll get a better dining experience, and you won't be bombarded with kitschy silliness that borders on obnoxious."}
{"text":"Some good and bad. First the good:  the chips and salsa selection is very good. A lot of variety of salsa to choose from. The margaritas are also very good at reasonable prices and a good selection.  
Now the bad:  Food. It is bland and flavorless. My wife and I have eaten here two times and tried various dishes. All have been disappointing. Too bad because we love Mexican food and good Tex mex. this trip I ordered the steak burrito that was supposed to come with a green chili inside. The only thing inside was steak. So what I received was a flour tortilla with chunks of meat inside. Nothing else, that's it. When I asked the waitress she shrugged her shoulders and said \"oh\" that's funny. It should have stuff inside. My wife ordered the sampler appetizer plate so she could try a variety of items. All were bland and disappointing.  I can see how this food might appeal to many people who have not had flavorful, good Mexican food.  For me, I will come back for drinks and chips and salsa, but I will not eat here."}
{"text":"I have been to Chuy's 3 times so far and every time its been great!  The service was good and food was wonderful.  I would suggest going early as the place fills up fast (they were full and on a wait by 6:30).  Obviously they are doing something right if people are willing to wait an hour to eat.


I don't recall the wait times for my drinks/food as there was so much to look at and keep you occupied while you wait as well as the free nacho bar - YUM!  Our food was served before we knew it and was excellent!  Hot, fresh and very flavorful.

This is definitely my restaurant of choice for Mexican, and I will continue to dine there even though its a 30+ minute drive for me.  Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Chuy's is a weekly favorite of mine and an easy recommendation. My first trip to Chuys was a complete disaster and left me really hating the restaurant but a unique circumstance brought us back for a second visit and I've been happy ever since. 

The chips are light and crunchy, the salsa is sweet with a touch of spicy, and the jalapeno ranch is so good I would take a bath in it. The famous \"Big as yo' face\" burritos and the Elvis fried chicken are my top two recommendations. Make sure you go early if you plan on getting any of the daily dinner specials... they run out early and often."}
{"text":"Yuck.  My chicken burrito was full of refried beans with barely a tablespoon of chicken...almost no cheese...no creative flavor.  They pass off thin ranch dressing as a salad dressing or entree topping or dip for tortilla chips. They call it something fancy but it's just ranch dressing.  Guacamole was bland. Rice was really dry. There's a handful of lettuce on the side of the plate, topped with the same salsa you get at the table. margaritas were weak and boring.  Chips were fresh and hot, though. The decor was very cute. The wait staff was nice and cooperative for our large group. However, way too expensive for the quality of the food. I can think of about five Mexican or Tex Mex restaurants in the same area of Charlotte, that are sooooo much better. This was my second trip and it will be my last."}
{"text":"On The Border was my go to Mex place until I went to Gastonia (bad). This Chuy's recently opened on Providence Rd. Only a mile away from On The Border, it is so very much better. Hand made tortillas, great salsa, great food and, unlike On The Border.... good service. Thank you Austin, Texas for coming here."}
{"text":"Tasteless, shapeless generic slop straight off the Sysco truck with a brief stop in a microwave. No Tex and even less Mex.  This is ersatz Mexican food as an aficionado of Wonder bread and Oscar Mayer bologna might envision it.  Complaining about the meager portions would be nonsensical since they spared us further displeasure with the meal.

Service was prompt.  Proximity to a mall apparently responsible for a large quotient of babies and toddlers in tow - not exactly the Friday happy hour scene one might expect.  Large fountain just beyond gates also a draw for more hyperactive children who scaled walls, fences and ratcheted up the noise even more - parents couldn't be bothered."}
{"text":"We found this place on a different website. Urbanspoon. It was listed as new and reviewed very well.
Came here for lunch with Hubbie and the fabulous Shirley Martin. Shirley had chicken tacos with rice and beans, and said it was good, more food the she could eat. Garry had chick a chick a boom boom. He said it was delicious, spicey and made his nose run. I had the light combo. Just right. ( no rice and beans)
Ashton was our waiter and he made us feel very welcome, he was attentive, but not pushy. He clerked on our food and offered us dessert, carefully describing some wonderful selections.
You should give them a try."}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos and they were really great :).  We also had nachos for our app - it was the kind of nachos where each chip is made individually and has all the toppings on it.  I like this kind better than the pile of chips with random toppings piled on in places.  

Everything was really yummy - our waitress was pretty weird though - I don't really know what her deal was."}
{"text":"I am a convert. We did not care for the Southpark location because the service was always terrible. In this location (which we have been to maaaaany times) we have always had excellent service. Not just ok service, but excellent service. 

We love the queso! We have to order queso every visit. The regrets beans are the best anywhere and the homemade tortillas are incredible. We just love Chuy's!!

My only complaint is the noise. They really, really need something to help muffle some of the noise. When it's busy, it can seriously be difficult to hear the people at your table."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, we had higher hopes for this Chuy's.  

The thing about Chuy's is that it's not gourmet food. It's decent enough Tex-Mex,  that when combined with a fun atmosphere and great service makes for a place that you want to come back to.  

Based upon one visit on a late Sunday afternoon, Chuy's won't be first on the list for our dining out dollars.  I don't know if our server was a first-time-ever-to-wait-tables newbie or just a painfully insecure guy, but I knew after one minute that we were in for it!  And we were!  He was slow to do everything (orders, drinks, chips, checking on us), the food was very, very slow coming out (did I mention we waited forever!!!!) and despite being a nice enough guy, he did a really lack luster job.  Other tables around us seemed to fare better with other severs, but only slightly so. Too bad."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food nor the service... Waited for longer than usual to get simple appetizers, the waiter kept forgetting parts of the order, water, utensils... The place is popular with families, however there were no attempts to make our kids more comfortable/ jokes/ attention. Bland experience overall."}
{"text":"Chuys has always been a favorite. This location, however, needs some help.  Food was so-so. Didn't taste at all like I was used to in other locations in VA and FL. Hopefully will improve as staff gets better training. Gave them an extra star because they were newly opened but the only thing that was good were the chips and Margaritas."}
{"text":"Sad to say this place is hit or miss. Sometimes you get a good sever and decent food, others ( and more often)  it's an apathetic server or snarky bartender who can't mix a drink to save their life and subpar food. 

You guys are gonna have to do better if you want to compete with everything else opening in this area. Start by teaching your staff to care and then teach the bartenders to be welcoming and learn how to make a margarita. 

We ordered top shelf liquor (tres generaciones añejo and don julio silver, respectively, both with grand marnier) and they will remain on the table when we leave due to the bartender mixing sooooo much sweet n sour in them. Just gross. Oh, and we caught attitude from the twat mixing them because it was a half hour before closing and she wanted to socialize with her coworkers vs waiting on customers. Smh"}
{"text":"This may be the worst food in Charlotte.  Actually all of North Carolina.  Perhaps the US.  Run, don't walk away from this place.  To the owners and managers, please close so a real restaurant can open there"}
{"text":"Was at Southpark mall and the wait for Cheesecake factory was too long to wait with our grandson. Spotted the sign for Chuy's and was so happy there is a new Mexican restaurant decided to give it a try. No wait at all despite looking as if they were full. Sat near the tortilla making station. Server was fast. We were in & out in less than 35 min. Loved the decor. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"2 visits in the last month with horrendous customer service. The food was great but the service was so bad, it will prevent us from returning to this location. We email after the first problematic visit and were told there were sending something make up for it. That never happened. We attempted another visit and it was equally as bad from a service level"}
{"text":"SERVICE WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! My wife and I are huge fans of Chuys and the great food they have.

However, we just came from Chuys and we had Ashley (she has an inside lip piercing ) and it took us 15 minutes to just get water and soda. She never came back to do any refills. She finally decided to show up and take our order.

Then she said \"if you need anything else let me know \". Well if you actually checked on us maybe we could flag you down! 

Then it took us another 20 minutes to get the check.  Couldn't get out of their fast enough!!!"}
{"text":"Two words. Food. Poisoning. I have truly never been so sick as from a night after eating chuys. It was once my absolute favorite restaurant. Be warned.."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was terrible. First, when I arrived, there were plenty of tables available on the patio and NO line. I asked for a table on the patio. They said they'd have one cleaned off for me first. This took a good 10 minutes.  When we got to our table, our server was not very engaging.  She did not recommend anything, or come back for a drink order, even though I had told her I might want something other than water, but wasn't sure at the time. She never checked back on drinks.  When our food arrived, we did not have any silverware. We asked for silverware and napkins, and they brought silverware, but no napkins.  A while later, I hadn't seen our server. I saw the host come by, and asked her for some napkins. She said she'd get them for us but NEVER brought them. My wife had to get up and get the napkins herself!  Finally, no offers for dessert, just a question \"do you want your check?\"  Very poor customer service. This is the third time we have been to this Chuy's. I expect it will be our last.  Oh, the one redeeming attribute? Even though the service was terrible, the food was good."}
{"text":"Please go elsewhere for your food. I had such high hopes for this place that fell flat. Our waitress took forever to take our order. People who came in after us had chips, salsa and their drinks before we put in our drink order. The original entree that came out was not what I ordered. The waitress returned in 10 minutes with my actual order (shrimp tacos). One of my tacos didn't have any sauce at all, the rice and the beans were lukewarm and dry. I poked around on the plate and ate what I could but left still feeling hungry. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place has improved so much in the last few months. Good fajitas and the have a combo called the Elvis plate that is excellent. Make sure to try the guacamole it's fresh and well made. There seems to be lots of attention to details here and the bar staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time for a friends birthday and yes, we had a party of about 10, but good grief. 

We had 2 waiters, an older man who was very friendly, efficient, and all around great. 
We also had a younger girl who was obviously angry and annoyed from the second we sat down. She was rarely present and had a major attitude when she was.

When we all got our food, all I wanted was an extra plate so my husband and I could share the huge burrito he got. The waitress stood off to the side talking with another waitress, making eye contact with my husband as he tried to get her attention and ignored him for a good couple of minutes. He finally just got up and walked over to her to ask for a plate.

I kid you not, she came back with a tiny bread plate and said \"this is the only one I could find.\" ......what???? This is a restaurant and you're trying to tell me there are NO actual plates?

I don't think I've ever had a ruder waitress. She made the already bland meal even worse.
The food was extremely uneventful too. Nothing more than mediocre. I'll stick to Cantina 1511 from now on."}
{"text":"Fresh food, spectacular sauces! What more can you ask for? I went on opening weekend so as you can imagine it was a little disorganized. But, I met the manager and she was very nice and accommodating and made up for the long wait! Definitely give this place a try. I would recommend making a reservation so you aren't stuck with a long wait time. The prices here aren't too bad either. The green salsa verde is a must-try."}
{"text":"Wow. Gus beat me to it. No, really. He wrote a review like 15 minutes before I'm writing mine with the EXACT same complaint in mind. For the crowd it gets and the advertisements I've heard and seen, i was expecting this place to impress. My friend really wanted to try and that is the only reason why I did. I will give it to them. Their salsa is pretty fantastic... but that's about it. Tex-mex should never have refried beans. I mean I'm of spanish background, and I take offense to the concept of refried beans. So gross. I got their chicken nachos and got exactly what Chili serves for chicken nachos. It's the whole individualized big nacho thing rather than layers. I've tried different mexican places in charlotte, and Cantina 1511 is by far the best I've had...true to Tex-Mex.

My leftovers from Chuy's are still in the fridge.."}
{"text":"It was just OK. Nothing special or authentic tasting to me. You could do better with any local Mexican place."}
{"text":"All of the elitists who've given this place bad reviews have seriously skewed expectations when they enter. This is a CHAIN Tex-Mex restaurant. That being said, the service is quick and friendly, the drinks are strong and reasonably priced for the area, and the food is yummy and much better than most chains.

The happy hour is killer: free chips, salsa, and queso from 4-7!! Sit at the bar, snack, and drink with your friends. Their enchiladas are great. AND they make their own tortillas in-house.

It's a welcome addition to the stuffy, over-priced restaurants in the Southpark area where you'll undoubtedly find at least a handful of obnoxious, 20-something couples in Vineyard Vines and Lilly Pulitzer sipping on Moscow Mules."}
{"text":"Strongly NOT recommended especially if you are going with large group. Don't take reservations and worse customer service...don't go and save your time/money and sanity especially when you are hungry ...this place will definitely make you HANGRY"}
{"text":"Chuys isn't much to talk about for me. It's not authentic Mexican in my opinion so you have to take it for what it's worth. 
The frozen margaritas & sangrias are worth a seat at the bar or in the bar area especially during the week between 4pm - 7pm where you can munch on nachos for free while you sip via the Happy Hour complimentary Nacho car.
We've had take out from here once and wasn't impressed as the food lacked flavor and seasoning. My husband and I had the fish and the shrimp tacos and the batter on the seafood wasn't very tasty. Our son had the a child's chicken quesadilla which wasn't very yummy for him either. The cheese seemed to be like American cheese which isn't good cheese for a quesadilla.
I returned today for some frozen margaritas with my neighbor for her birthday and we dined in at the bar. I wasn't interested in trying the good again so we stuck to the FREE nachos and ordered cocktails. I had the frozen sangria and she had the frozen raspberry margarita.
ALL In ALL my fav item was the Tres Leches Yum Yum Yum did I say Yum?"}
{"text":"Oh, Chuy's, as a transplanted Texan, how I have missed you! I'm willing to drive the hour+ from Winston-Salem to eat here. Queso that isn't watery white slop, enchiladas the way they're supposed to be, light delicious chips, oh and the margaritas!!! And the decor is even better than other locations I've been to... But still over the top and delightfully tacky fun. We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great. The food and service was not so great. We had a really depressed waitress and food took for ever to come out. We also noticed the food to be bland and dry. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent TexMex food coupled with fast and friendly service make this restaurant a favorite. Atmosphere is authentic Austin Chuy's. Fresh chips, salsa, tortillas, and creamy jalapeno dip can't be beat. Its awesome that Chuy's is now in Charlotte. I will be visiting them often!"}
{"text":"It was Sunday evening during Christmas season.  We were at SouthPark Mall and decided to try to grab dinner at Cheesecake Factory.  Naturally, there was about a 30-45 minute wait.  We walked over to Chuy's who -- TA DA! -- saved the day.  Fortunately for us (but unfortunately for them, I'm sure), they weren't super busy, so we were immediately seated.  

Our server was fantastic.  Although she did have other tables besides ours, she noticed when our water glasses were halfway and immediately refilled them.  She also refilled our salsa (and chips) when she spotted it low.  That's the sign of a great server: she notices things, and that makes all the difference.  I like not having to ask. :) 

The chips always taste \"light\" at Chuy's (in a good way) and the salsa is fantastic and tastes so fresh (not like that dark red stuff you buy in a jar at the supermarket).  

For dinner, I tried their Sunday Night Special, which was a Macho Burrito.  I've eaten at Chuy's several times, both in Charlotte and Orlando, but this was the first time I've tried this particular entree.  It was amazing.  And probably the best and most flavorful entree I've had at Chuy's.  The menu describes the Macho Burrito as \"a flour tortilla stuffed with roasted pork, green chiles, jack cheese & guacamole, smothered with Hatch Green Chile Tomatillo Sauce.\"  I think it was the perfectly seasoned pork that really made it fantastic.  It's part of their Green Chile Fest, though, and will probably make way for something else seasonal, and I'll be really disappointed not being able to order it again until next fall.  

We had a fantastic experience from being seated right away, to fantastic service, excellent food, and cheaper entrees than Cheesecake Factory.  Thanks for saving the day (and not hurting our wallets), Chuy's!"}
{"text":"Ok option but poor, slow service and just average food. Cantina 1511 in Stone Crest is a better alternative.

Pluses: ambiance is fun, child friendly, chips and salsa, drink options but SLOW
Minuses: slightly below Average Tex mex food, long waits at times, poor service."}
{"text":"Very fun place to get together with friends for drinks. A little on the pricey side but considered average for the South Park area cuisine. Service was average, nothing wrong but nothing special, but the food was below average. The atmosphere is really what you pay for but I'd recommend sticking with drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must visit in the South Park area.  If you enjoy eating Tex Mex foods you really can't go wrong. With the awesome customer service, this is my number one choice."}
{"text":"Really sad. This is one of the first restaurants that opened in the new Waverly shopping center and it is completely unacceptable. My husband and I walk in for the first time on Sunday evening and the first thing we notice is the trash in the lobby (dirty styrofoam take out). We don't realize how bad it's really going to get until we're taken to our table by the hostess. With the hostess in front of us, all we see as we walk around the restaurant to get to our table are dirty dishes and trash stacked everywhere on the tables from previous customers. The feeling of filth was only exaggerated by the amount of food on the floor. With much disappointment, we could not bring ourselves to eat here. We explained this to the hostess before leaving and what could have been a manager. Finally, as we are  walking out, we notice that even their doors had the look of not having been cleaned all day, while the two hostesses stand there with nothing to do. Sad for Waverly."}
{"text":"You can do better Mexican food at home. Quite easily. Not bad if there aren't any other options."}
{"text":"I have been going to chuys since south park days, but every time I go back it seems to be less desirable. The newer Waverly location is just bad. Since it has opened it has been slow service with really average at best food. Even the New Mexican martini has suffered. Save yourself the dissatisfaction of a poorly run bad TexMex experience and eat elsewhere. Hopefully something decent will occupy this space because this chain won't last under it's current direction."}
{"text":"So glad I did not rely on the Yelp reviews - for once. Instead I asked local friends (I am visiting from out of town) where to meet them for dinner. One friend described Chuy's as amazing so I said great let's go! I was not disappointed. Easy to get to, with friendly greeters at the door, we were seated in a crowded but not noisy main room. Our waitress immediately came by with fresh warm tortilla chips and salsa. My friend asked for their jalapeno sauce which she then brought two of. This is a great sauce in which to dip the tortillas! I enjoyed the house margarita (had to smile when asked for my ID) then ordered the Deluxe chicken enchiladas with mexican rice and refried beans. I also ordered a side scoop of guacamole because well - because! The chicken was tender and moist, wrapped in a fresh tortilla and smothered in that jalapeno sauce - yum. The mexican rice was flavorful and went great with the refried beans. All along our waitress was attentive yet not hovering. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is my favorite restaurant in Texas. I've been to the original in Austin and multiple locations in Houston. I've been lobbying for a Charlotte location for years. With all that said...

I've been to this location several times now...so this review is an average.

Food: I'll admit that as many times I've been to Chuy's, I almost always get the Chuy's Special. It's under $10 and is enough food to fill almost anyone up. It's a chicken enchilada, and it's delicious. I've also tried the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom and the Steak Burrito. Both are very good. I've also been with people who have ordered the Fish Tacos and Fajitas (they said both were good). Be sure to ask for the Creamy Jalapeno Dip if they don't bring it automatically (you used to have to ask). It's great with the in-restaurant made tortilla chips.

Service: I've always had very good service. Very attentive staff and they are happy to recommend choices or help modify dishes (eg: the Steak Burrito comes with hatch green chili sauce which is warm...they can suggest other sauces or simply put the hatch on the side).

Atmosphere: The restaurant itself is decorated with a lot of crazy stuff. Each location comes with an Elvis Shrine and Fish hung from the ceiling (I've heard the fish were a gift at the first location and the owners considered them good luck, so they always have them at new locations).

Price: The basic menu has many, many choices for under $10. I honestly have no idea about bar prices, but the food is very reasonable.

Bottom line...I regularly drive to Chuy's from the Lake for dinner. I love it."}
{"text":"So this was my first time here and I left disappointed. I had the steak fajitas as well as the chili queso. The food was good  but nothing special. The worst part about the experience was our service. We went for lunch and the place was not busy at all.  It took almost 40 minutes from the time we order until the food hit our table. We asked one of the mangers for more sauce and he  said hold on let me find your server instead of offering to get it for us. On top of that it took almost 10 to 15 minutes to get our drinks. Service killed our experience which is unfortunate. Average food, poor service"}
{"text":"Mexican diner (note: not dinner, diner) in SouthPark. Mediocre. Staff - all of them - have no basic hospitality skills. Take it to Park Rd shopping center."}
{"text":"So I finally made it over to Chuy's!

Right away I noticed the décor. It was \"interesting\" but I guess that's what helps to make this place so unique in comparison to your typical Mexican joint? 

Our waiter was pleasant and quick; he gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and informed that we had arrived during their \"happy hour\" so there were chips, queso and beef available in the back! It's been discussed enough in all the previous reviews, so I'll just say I enjoyed it very much! But I'm a sucker for unlimited queso and chips! 

For my meal I went with Combination #1, which is a ridiculous amount of food! It comes with comes with enchiladas, chicken flautas, a taco, guacamole and chips dipped in chile con queso. It was all very tasty but my favorite parts hands down were the chicken flautas. They were crispy goodness. I could have had an entire plate of them! Yum! 

Overall, the prices weren't bad and the portion sizes are good so I can see myself coming back!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal-- this place wants to be authentic like the one in Austin. And it's authenticity doesn't fit for that large a footprint in South Park. The service was average, food was average, salsa's tomatoes were less than red and the guacamole was half lettuce. In general I try to be a positive person and I want businesses to be successful and maybe this will be but enter with a note of caution. They're trying really hard to be unique except what makes things unique in food-- service, quality, speed-- weren't there."}
{"text":"First ran into their Tex Mex 20 years ago in Austin, TX. Locals took me there. I was surprised to see the chain make it out to NC, but pleasantly so. Tasty salsa fresca, good burritos, decent chimichangas. Very acceptable chile relleno, as well (stick with the tomatillo sauce)."}
{"text":"Lackluster.  The food quality was mediocre and the server provided our table an ice-water shower with nary an apology.  I had the classic enchiladas, but found them to be simply two, flat unrolled tortillas with chicken in the middle, covered in unremarkable sauce.  Standard Mexican rice and re-fried beans accompanied.  Nobody at our table of five thought their meal was more than \"ok\".  The pricing was reasonable, but we did limit additional purchases of drinks and dessert due to the apathetic server.  When I talked to a manager about the poor service and the word-of-mouth reputation Chuy's was developing nearby, he apologized and provided a full voucher for our next meal.  As a result, we will give Chuy's a second chance but we were far from impressed in our first visit."}
{"text":"Stomach filler :/.   Can't say more.  Not their fault.  Appears to be a chain / factory produced model.  They can do so much more and better if they made a few tweaks."}
{"text":"Watch you bill! My server gave herself a fat tip... more than what my meal cost. And I was only there for lunch. Too bad for her... i was eating there at least once a week but won't go back now!"}
{"text":"I definitely won't be back. We sat on the patio on a nice 65 degree night. The chips were the only good thing like people have said. Also, this is the first place I've ever been to that gives you extra spicy salsa with the chips, which I didn't mind but my bf sure couldn't handle it. The queso was meh. It took us a long time to get our drink order then our appetizer ordered. Then we sat with our menus closed for thirty minutes before getting our entrees ordered. Finally when our food did come it was delivered by a manager who said \"wow if you can survive sitting under this heater you can survive anything\"... from the manager. Yes, we felt like we might need to put on sunscreen, our table was literally hot but at least the Above food warmer made sure our food didn't get cold. Who tests a heater at max level when it's only 65 degrees and doesn't even turn it off after realizing it's burning hot! The food was not so great. Beans were dry, rice hard and dry, cheese enchilada and tacos not great. Burrito bad. They have a lot of work to do."}
{"text":"Who would have known there's a Mexican diner in South Park?  It's super casual and families bring all the kids to try some tacos, even the ones from Concord.  

I had the beef tacos and they were pleasantly spicy with a little cooked green pepper.  Not crazy hot but enough to make me take notice.  The beans and rice were good and so was the guacamole.  Our waiter took the time to listen to our quirky food restrictions and we enjoyed everything.  Even the tortilla chips are cooked in-house and came to our table hot and crispy.  Can't wait to go back!

If you ever pined for a place to take your screaming kids in your cargo shorts for a good hot meal with some kick to it, well you found a little slice of heaven right here."}
{"text":"Came here because the wait for CowFish was so incredibly long (1.5 hours!!).  Wasn't disappointed.  Tried several different margaritas which were all good and the Elvis fried chicken with green chiles was delicious.  I love how all the dog pictures cover the walls; it really adds a fun dynamic to the restaurant.   Parking is free which is a plus, and it's right next to a lot of high end shopping if you're into that."}
{"text":"I thought it was okay in terms of Tex mex. we ordered nachos. Was not a fan of the queso dip. Have been wanting to try their nacho bar."}
{"text":"The decor is fun BUT, the place is extremely noisy.  The food was average and that's being kind.  I tried 3 different dishes (shrimp baja taco and chicken taco&chalupa off the lite menu) and I was not impressed with any of them.   I don't know what all the fuss is about this place.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"When I was a kid I used to not be a big fan of this restaurant because I was a picky eater who did not like Mexican food. Since then I have gained a love for burritos and these are the best by far. The fajita steak burrito is so good and definitely recommended. It is HUGE in size and you will be able to eat it for the next day or two for lunch. Honestly have been craving one of their burritos for so long now and I can't wait until the new restaurant opens up!"}
{"text":"Very good. Reminds me of my decade in Houston TX. Very very good. Best tortillas ever !!

Best. Stephen."}
{"text":"If you're not from Texas (Where the stars at night are big and bright *clap clap clap clap*), then I'm sure this will be a godsend of TexMex. Though I'm not a huge fan of the decor -- loud, loud, loud, cumbersome, kitschy, overtly awful, weird, funny, and loud, the prices are incredible for being located in SouthPark. 

If you're not into paying $15-20 every time you're in SouthPark for dinner, Chuy's might be your new spot. The most expensive menu item I saw on the menu, that wasn't a dinner platter, was between $8-$9. Now, I don't know if these prices will inflate after time, but for right now, it's super easy on the wallet. 

The food itself? I was surprised. You're not really going to get authentic here, but what they're plating from the kitchen is pretty damn good. I ordered the fried shrimp tacos. Wasn't a huge fan of the breading, but the tortillas, accoutrement within, and the sides were spot on. Paired with one of the house margaritas (I'm not a fan of any of the beers they have in-house) and you've got a pretty good meal. We shared a few apps, too. The queso that has beef and a few other confetti-type peppers/veg was awesome. The chips are thin, so double up to avoid breakage. 

The service was going bonkers, but very efficient. In my god-given grace, I decided it was a great idea to wail my arms about in telling a story and spilled an entire glass of water on and under the table. The bus team swooped in like freaking ninjas and cleaned everything up. 

So, though I feel like I may detach a retina from looking at the decor, I'm actually looking forward to revisiting Chuy's. Next time? The patio. 

¡Ole!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice since they opened and I can definitely say that this is the best TexMex food around the Charlotte area.  The fish tacos are quite good, but any of the combinations are excellent, too.  Try the Jalapeno dip and fresh salsa, but don't fill up too much!
Parking is a chore, but know that going in and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"My brother and I came here one day unexpectedly. We were going to go to the Cowfish next door for lunch, but when we found out the line was too long, we decided to try out Chuy's instead and I'm SO glad we did!

First off, the decorations inside were eye-catching and fun! Felt like I was in paradise with the palm trees! We started off with the usual chips and salsa (which the salsa was amazing!). I had the chile relleno, and my goodness it was one of the yummiest cheesy goodness I've ever had! The crusted and fried chiles were stuffed with the perfect balance of cheese, meat (I think I asked for chicken?) and yummy brown sauce (I don't recall what it was...just how good it was!). Got two filling meals out of my one dish! Next time I'm in the Southpark area, I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"My favorite aspect of this South Park Mexican restaurant is the outdoor patio.  As the summer turns into fall, there's no better place to enjoy a Friday evening than on the patio while munching on a big pile of nachos from the \"FREE\" nacho bar.  It's nothing fancy - tortilla chips, refried beans, ground beef, queso, and salsa, yet appealing to a fan of casual Mexican fare.  It's quite a deal to order a drink or two and make dinner out of the nachos.  Make sure you try the white ranch-like sauce that is brought to the table with the salsa.  The creamy, yet spicy, sauce compliments the chips well.

For our entrees we split two selections.

1.  Appetizer Plate...Chile con queso, nachos, deluxe quesadillas, chicken flautas, guacamole & sour cream.

We subbed double guacamole for the sour cream and added a side of a chile relleno.  All of the components were equally tasty.  It's nothing unique or outstanding, but is tasty and well executed Mexican staples.

2.  Veggie... Spinach, onions, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell peppers, serranos, roasted green chiles, corn & cheese in homemade blue corn tortillas with Ranchero sauce.  Served with a side of beans and rice.

This generous portion of three enchiladas was served pipping hot and smothered in the tomato-based ranchero sauce.  It was good, but my only complaint would be that it was a bit too spicy.

If you're looking for an affordable meal and love traditional Mexican cuisine, be sure to check out Chuy's in South Park.  To avoid a potential seizure from the brightly colored and obnxiously decorated interior, opt for the the patio."}
{"text":"I've loved Chuy's since I was a tiny tyke in Austin, TX. I loved it every Sunday for lunch after church in high school in Dallas. I loved it again back in Austin as an adult with kids on the patio. I buy their creamy jalapeno (dip/dressing), queso and tortillas whenever I'm making fajitas for a group because they're far superior to the homemade or store-bought. In short... I love this place. 

When we moved here a year ago and I found out they were following shortly thereafter, I may have done a happy dance of joy. And it doesn't disappoint! All the original food, even better service, prices way more reasonable than some other Mexican restaurants in town and a huge patio and wait area.

I also used them for a large to-go order for the first time last weekend and it was a great experience. They didn't try to talk me into an order larger than I planned to purchase (The Big Daddio for 35 people to feed 60+ people... perfect amount), my order was perfectly accurate and well-packaged, hot (which is never something I can assume with a very large to-go order) and they even said if something was wrong they would fix it asap.

Go to Chuy's. Love some good ol' tex mex and yummy margaritas for what they are. Keep this place in business for as long as I live in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm a Texan currently living in Columbia, SC.  I have to drive 98 miles to get to Chuys because No where in SC knows how to properly make Mexican food?!?  Well anyways this place is the closest to Texas I can get..  Been to the one in Fort Worth too many times to count and I have only managed to check into this location 1 time but have been here at least 20 times.(probably overwhelmed with excitement I don't have anytime to get anything in except this amazingness in my belly!) 

I usually start off with the jalapeño ranch dip(if you don't about this.... ORDER IT!) and queso..  I usually eat so much I have no room for anything else..  But we are going to pack this in like golf through a straw!  I then prepare myself for a Chuychanga (a fried chicken burrito?!?!?!) which usually comes out so fast that I'm not ready for it.  

If you're craving Mexican food and live in SC .....  This place is a must try!  Because if you had Mexican food in SC ..  Your judgement on Mexican food is very cloudy and I understand why it wouldn't be your first choice.  But I guarantee you that you have been missing out on this your entire life!  Nooooow go get you some!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for a good experience.. but, sadly not. Food wasn't that great, and overpriced. Also, I used the valet right outside and when I got my car back, my hood was open! Don't use the valet..."}
{"text":"First Tex-Mex is supposed to be SPICY PEOPLE! With that said this place is legit. The best Tex-Mex I've had in a long time. Food was great and had plenty of flavor. Restaurant was clean and decorated nice. Staff were great and very nice. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Top shelf margarita should have been $3. Chips too salty. Service was friendly but disjointed. Salsa was really pico. Restaurant was dirty. Thought maybe a restaurant in a nicer area would be better than the chuys in Arizona. Not so. Skip it."}
{"text":"Fun drinks, excellent food, and fabulous desserts!  Good service, reasonable prices, a little bit noisy, will be back."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Chuy's and it won't be our last. Starting with the good news, the drinks are flavorful and the nacho car (Monday-Friday) it great. Chuy's certainly has an industrial sized ice maker as the drinks are bursting with frozen h2o! 
My Bride ordered the  Quesadilla  which came in the form of 4 tacos. She was satisfied although thought the protein was a bit sparse.
I ordered the Chicken burrito with the green chili sauce (3 chilis hot). While advertised as \"big as your face\" it is a bit of a over statement especially if you ask to omit the beans, which I did. If it is as big as they say....must be a lot of beans!! 
Our waiter was very pleasant, knowledgeable and well schooled in the art of up selling.
Each recommendation he made was highlighted in green, on the menu, was the most popular and coincidentally the most expensive. I fell prey to his strong recommendation of the Boom Boom sauce. It was good as I ordered a side sampler and payed $3.59 for 3 tablespoons full.

We'll be back for Happy Hour but dinner probably not!"}
{"text":"Mexican cafe with lively atmosphere and decent pricing. 

This place was not at all what I expected from the outside. I used to come here when it was a place called M. It was totally totally different then.  Anyway, it's now a very very bright and colorful Mexican cafe. 

Enchiladas with Boom Boom Sauce and Mango Margaritas were good. I think I'd like to come back in summer and sit on the huge patio. Really good Tres Leches cake too.

I just can't get over the interior though - I think the lighting is just SO BRIGHT, they would do themselves a favor to get a lighting scheme designer to come in and adjust things a bit - make it less of a cafeteria. It reminds me of a place in California - Chevy's... same sort of set up and theme. 

Lots of families and kids. No sense of intimacy - so not a date spot for sure - a good casual place to chill after shopping at the Pottery Barn though.. 

The server we had was a little sleepy but he was nice. I think he needed a nap though."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and had worst experience.  The drinks were horrible  and we ordered the Mexican salad and a burrito.  The chicken was dry in the salad and the burrito wrap was doughy.  To make it worst, a server was trying to locate our table to deliver the meal.  An older gentlemen asked us what we ordered and then said 'I got you boo!'  They just lost a customer.  Happy cinco de mayo!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to have an excellent meal and brilliant service-must ask for RICKY- he made the experience flawless!"}
{"text":"My parents and I went to Chuy's this past Sunday evening.  My Mom had been wanting to give it a try for a while, my Dad is typically not a picky eater and I had a gift card I had been meaning to use. 

This was my third time to Chuy's. During my first visit, I was there for an event and got to sample all of their salsas and sauces along with a number of cocktails and entrees.  I loved everything that we sampled and was just as in love with how knowledgeable all of the staff was.  Learning about the history of Chuy's, how the kitchen operates and the training that each staff member goes through definitely made an impression.

To my surprise when we arrived Chuy's was featuring their Green Chile Menu.  As soon as the bartender pointed it out, I recalled the staff at the event in June to make sure we came back when they featured these dishes.  Ordering from that menu was given.

My Mom opted for the bartender's recommendation of the Holy Quesadillas (handmade flour tortillas with fajita chicken, caramelized onions, green chile chorizo and jack cheese served with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo).  I chose the Green Chile BBQ Chicken Tacos (crispy mini taco shells (bartender recommended soft tacos so I substituted) filled with roasted chicken and Green Chile BBQ Sauce, spicy coleslaw and cilantro - served with green chile rice and refried beans). My Dad stuck to an \"all the time\" menu item and got the Southwestern Enchilada (Homemade blue corn tortillas stacked with freshly-roasted, hand-pulled chicken, cheese & Green Chile sauce, topped with a fried egg). I recommend all of these entrees.  All three definitely have a kick to it, so if you don't like spice these may not be your best bet.

Looking forward to the next trip to Chuy's.... oh, and I might add delicious cocktails as always!"}
{"text":"The chips with jalapeño ranch dip, and Margaritas are excellent!  Other than that though, I don't have a lot of other good things to say.

Typical wait time for food is quite long. If you do risk a trip there, order as quickly as you can, since their kitchen is extremely slow!

The food is pretty uninspired. The \"enchilada\" was some seasoned meat inside a regular tortilla, not even baked together with melted cheese on top.  The relleno was very small.  The tacos were made wrong and had to be re-made.

We have tried eating there 3 times, and have been pretty let down. We tried ordering to go, and it took forever as well.

They have some issues to work out.  Hopefully they get there."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and went to this place with some coworkers. I love Mexican, this place was really great! The decor was very authentic Mexican. Great margaritas!! Great service. I was with 4 coworkers and we all loved are meals! I would suggest this place to anyone!! Great!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just eat at odd times, but I never have a problem finding somewhere to sit here, even if Cowfish is packed.  
I love the thin chips they have.  Be careful with them in the salsa, but once the chip hits your mouth it just melts.  I mainly just go there for the chips.  If you like a firm crunchy chip this is not the place for you, but if you like an airthin chip that is easy on the teeth this is the place.

The Chicka Chicka Boom Boom never fails to satisfy and their chimichanga was pretty good as well.  

Wash it all down with a Shiner Bock or one of their signature drinks and you have a meal!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Chuy's and particularly to the one in Charlotte. I have never heard the management team mistreat any of the employees or heard load, unprofessional comments towards anyone . On the contrary I've heard the management team joking around and laughing with there employees. Seems to me that there are a couple of sour apples (former employees) out to make this establishment look bad. Never the less, give it a try you may or may not like it."}
{"text":"This is pretty great Tex-Mex food! The chips are thin and crispy, the sauces are great, and I love the enchiladas. Chuy's enchiladas beat your standard Mexican restaurant enchiladas in my opinion hands down. The tortillas are fantastic too, so you won't get a cold corn tortilla with some last minute sauce thrown on top, the sauce actually soaks through. I usually get the Elves Presley Combo and take home a bit over half every time, because it's SO MUCH FOOD. I like that you can get one of each enchilada (beef, cheese, and chicken) so if you haven't tried their enchiladas, it's a good way to try them. I will say that the regular beef tacos are average, but you can ask for some of the sauces to spice them up, and they do come pretty loaded with filling. I think what I like best is that a lot of the offerings have a little kick to them, and you can taste the fresh ingredients. We haven't had any bad experiences with the servers, and everything's been fine for us. Remember, this is Tex Mex you guys! So don't expect authentic Mexican tacos!"}
{"text":"Really good Tex Mex! They have happy hour nacho bar from 4-7pm. Everything seems really fresh! I loved the jalapeño ranch dipping sauce with my chips! I had the Chika Chika boom boom which is a house favorite and I was very pleased! My boss had the Baja shrimp tacos! They came individually wrapped in aluminum foil, which was neat because it keeps them warm! If you want authentic tortilla soup this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Chuy's! The food is always consistently good. Don't let 2 star reviews about thin chips or 1 star reviews about servers being busy deter you from checking out this gem. Yep, the chips are thin. They are crispy and amazing that way. Yep, the servers are very busy. They recently opened and that tends to happen with new restaurants.

My only gripe, and it is a small one, is no draft beer. But they have a great selection of Mexican and local beers. They even have some of that yellow water with bud or coors on it if that's your thing. Great service from the bar. Not much of a liquor drinker but the wife loves their skinny margaritas.

I'm so happy that Chuy's is near my house and will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"I am from Houston, TX and the only similarities are the queso and the restaurant design. I got a taco and enchilada and the taco was good but the enchilada was terrible. I can't even describe how it tasted besides bad. The waitress was really nice. Keep them, change the chefs."}
{"text":"I was surprised how good this place was. The portions are huge so it's not a bad idea to share with your significant other. Make sure you ask about the sauces bc that's what makes this place. Try the Elvis Presley dish."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but I'm I'm not sure why it's called TexMex... there is 0 Tex and 100% Mex. Food is fine , price is fine but just know that the menu is a straight Mexican joint menu"}
{"text":"Pronounced (Chew-Ease). Sat at the bar. Chips and Salsa served. Really good Salsa that was Spicey but really chunky too. Bartenders were very friendly and recommended the Steak Burrito and I have to say was probably the best Burrito I've had. Prices are very reasonable and the food was really fresh and good. Regular price on Mexican Beer was 3.75 and a shot of top shelf Tequila was 7.75. Excellent prices considering they are a block from the Mall.
Overall great food and drinks and friendly service. I recommend this Restaurant highly. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was good. The drinks were good but pricey. We sat outside and it was accommodating. Our server was exceptional. My wife had the fajitas and I had the stuffed peppers. Both were good and the portions were good. I would recommend."}
{"text":"We had the house margaritas which were on tap and the drink special for the night. Happy Hour came with free salsa, creamy jalapeño dressing and chips. The jalapeño dressing was really yummy and not overly spicy. I had the taco salad with ground sirloin and my friend had the Mexican Cobb salad with chicken. Both salads were large and had great flavor. Not a huge place, but a great spot for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Was in chuys the other day got the shrimp tacos. They were ok, nice heaping shrimp on a good soft taco. Basic refried beans and rice combo.My only complaint was the sauce to protein ratio. I got like 1 squirt in the corner of the taco and it was incredible, I just wanted more to go with the huge shrimp. The bulk of the meal left me needing a lot of water just because it was a bit dry, but delicious. Service was good, loved the layout, sit on the patio if you can."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in Charlotte for business this weekend. We went to Chuy's last night for dinner. My husband had the Elvis Green Chile Fried Chicken, and I ordered the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom. They were both amazing. The fried chicken was surprisingly crispy, even after being smothered in sauce! We also had the Father Agave margarita and a special drink the bartender put together for me. That bartender was really good at her job!"}
{"text":"The service was ok. I think I was a little miffed because I  got chips and salsa before or too long after they have me my water (salsa.) 
The chips were hot and thin how I like it but tasteless. Maybe it needed more salt? I got a dinner salad. When my food came my salad was the same as the side lettuce and tomatoes. 
I ordered the steak fajitas. Everything on my plate could of had more taste. The only thing I found tasty was the salsa. I probably should of ordered a drink, the people around me seemed to be enjoying them. 
I worked across the street for 3 years and only a couple is people said anything about them. That should of told me something. Need not spend  my money when I can get taco bell.  Lol"}
{"text":"Chuy's has a great, fun atmosphere but it is loud. 
The have the best chips & salsa you'll find anywhere. Good, flavorful food served in a reasonable time.  The service was a little inattentive with our drink refills.  Overall good place that I would visit again."}
{"text":"Walking into this restaurant had to be the most awkward exchange at a hostess stand I have ever encountered. There were 4 employees standing behind the counter, 2 hostesses, a manager and a food runner and they all just stared at us. I had to inquire, \"Hi?! Um, can we please have a table?\" Again all of them unresponsive. One hostess finally replied \"three?\" And the manager barked a table number at her. So unprofessional. Incredibly unwelcoming. 
  The atmosphere inside the restaurant is actually really cool.  It screams Austin, Texas where the chain is from. I especially appreciated the homage to Elvis, but fail to see the connection. 
  The food is cheap, basic Tex-Mex served in large portions but nothing worth explaining in detail. 
  The tres leche cake was the one standout, covered in caramel sauce and extra sweet cream. 
  I can't say that I would ever return to this or another Chuy's location."}
{"text":"One side of me longs for the Chuy's in Camarillo, CA, which is quaint, casual, easy, and low cost. This Chuy's had to overcome many great memories.

The word is Chuy's are owned by one group west of Texas, another from Texas east.

With a purpose, we met during the 4-7pm Weekday Happy Hour, which has a complimentary queso bar. You can have regular queso or you can add ground beef. Both ways are tasty. 

The chicken tacos are quality. The green chile rice is flavorful.

The burrito is gigantic and a great amount of food for the price.

For Southpark, the food prices are reasonable in general.

Great patio - partially covered in one area, open in the others. Keep in mind that the sun goes behind the Residence building in the early-to-mid afternoon.

The \"Perfect Margarita\" is far from it. It's a glass heavy-handed with Rose's Lime Juice plus tequila. It has a very specific lime taste to it, not reminiscent of a top shelf margarita. I suggest their house Marg or simply telling them to make it how you like."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that the food here is just run-of-the-mill Tex-Mex, the manager present on Friday, December 15, 2017, was downright pathetic. He had no idea how to take care of a larger crowd (16) on a Friday night in which a call was made on the previous night starting out wouldn't be a problem and they would be able to work us into a section together. 

We waited for 2 hours and he just continuously kept sitting other people into the empty tables that we were told would be kept together for us. If her couldn't handle the situation, which was obvious, he did not need to continue to feed us lies. We finally confronted him and demanded he seat us anywhere because he was accomplishing nothing for our benefit. 

When we were seated, he told the waitress to make sure her table was taken care of immediately, but forgot to tell the waiter of the tables the same thing. By this time it wasn't important to be served quickly, but we would've liked to have been served together. 

I might have gone back to this restaurant for the mediocre food, but with management like this establishment has, I am certain my money won't be spent here ever again."}
{"text":"Honestly I really wanted to love this place. It's very kitschy and super bright inside!! The menu was on the small side but it seemed to have all the tex mex options represented. I would really love to get ONE good tex mex restaurant in the area but this one is not it. First of all they don't have a hot salsa option, not really. Their salsa was okay pretty standard fair, my roommate makes better at home.  I ordered a chicken burrito and I'm going to be honest their was like no chicken in my burrito it was mostly filler (beans). The pricing is pretty cheap considering where the restaurant is located so I guess you get what you pay for. I hear they have some kind of nacho buffet and some other things so I may give this place another shot once they've had a chance to be in business a little longer."}
{"text":"Wow, you'd never know this was the old Zink location. Talk about a complete renovation and makeover! 

It's a lively spot. Be in the mood for lots of noise and bright colors when you come dine at Chuy's. 

Having lived in the great State of Texas, I was eager to get a little taste of my previous life. However, maybe I've acclimated to the Carolinas more than I thought because I wasn't completely knocked off my boots, er, um, feet from this place. The salsa seemed to be made with fresh ingredients, but maybe not the most tasteful. I ordered the veggie enchiladas and they were good, but not to die for. 

I think I went on the second day they were open. Some of my friends say I'm brave. Hey, I like to live on the edge...having said that I was very impressed with the service. Our server was very friendly, checked on us regularly, and it was seamless for being brand new.

For a late night meal in the South Park area, this fits the bill. 

I've been known to have high expectations and the night I was there was no different. You are always harder on your own, right? And I still claim Texas as part of me...so like any good \"family member,\" I'll have to give it another go to see if it can earn any additional stars in my book. For now, it's a solid 3 stars with plans on returning."}
{"text":"The place was good. Different from any Mexican restaurant I've ate at. It seems they actually make their own house salsa. I think the refried beans must be house made not the typical retried beans I see/eat at the other Mexican restaurants that looks like the mush from the can. I also tried enchiladas for the first time. I can't remember they exact name but it was chicken with a cheese sauce. I would order again. I also had a coronarita for the first time, I enjoyed it as well. If I'm every hungry after a day of shopping I now know where to go instead of the food court."}
{"text":"The reviews have definitely been hit or miss for this place, so I don't know if the planets were aligned correctly or good karma for taking care of homeless animals is paying off, but my visit to Chuy's was a good one.

On a Friday around 11:20 am - way ahead of what is probably a busy lunch time - I was seated quickly in what looks like a table and chairs set that was pulled from a diner in the 1950's.  Bright, vibrant colors abound.  The music was a bit loud when I was sitting in the way back room all by my lonesome, but it tempered as either the crowd filled in or someone else asked them to turn it down.

My waiter, Adan, was pleasant and efficient - fantastic.  I had never been to a Chuy's before, so after deciding on a fajita burrito, I needed some help with their sauce choices, which he helped me narrow down based on my preference for not much heat, and no need for a meat sauce on a meat burrito.

The food:
Complimentary chips and salsa - chips are light and crunchy, semi-heavily salted, served with a fresh-tasting salsa.  The salsa was a bit heavy on the cilantro for my cilantro-hating tastebuds, but for normal people I think it would be serviceable.  
Queso ($6.29) - I twitch when I see queso for over $5, but whatevs.  It was payday and my day off, and this is a SouthPark restaurant, so let's do it.  Cheesy, creamy, nice texture and a mild kick to it that wasn't overpowering.  The light chips did have a tendency to break in the queso, but this fatty wasn't going to let that slow me down.  It was a crock of dairy goodness (and a relatively large serving).
Beef Fajita Burrito ($9.99) - You never know what you are going to get with a fajita burrito - some places place a 1\" chunk of fajita meat in a 3 lb. burrito and call it a day.  This burrito was HUGE and with help from my server, Adan, I chose the Ranchero sauce to go over it.  Served with mexican rice and some lettuce, jalapeno, etc. \"salad\" on the side, I really enjoyed this dish. It was full of very tender, well seasoned fajita meat, and oozing with cheese and beans - delicious!  It was a monster serving, so for the last 1/3 of the burrito, I just picked the meat out.
Drink - Coke Zero (which was kept filled) - score!

From the string of 2-star reviews, I guess I lucked out.  The service was fantastic and the food was quite good.  Although I have a hard time passing Cowfish without going in, I would definitely try Chuy's again."}
{"text":"Chuy's unfortunately does not live up to the hype. The food was just okay and didn't seem fresh at all. The fish tacos were honestly the worst fish tacos I've ever had. The appetizer sampler wasn't bad but wasn't any better than a South Blvd Mexican restaurant. Chips and salsa were good. Our server was very nice and tried really hard but I would be surprised if she had ever worked in a restaurant before. Overall not a great experience."}
{"text":"I have never been to Chuy's but I've driven by this restaurant countless times because I used to work nearby. And Mexican food hasn't always set well with me. I really wanted to break out of my usual comfort zone, and my Girlfriend said I would love this place so, Why not?...

Parking is a little difficult because there are a number of shops and other popular restaurants there, but fortunately there was no wait to be seated. At first we were seated inside, but it was a little Chilé inside (no pun intended), so we asked to move to the outdoor seating patio. Certainly glad we did, the weather was amazing and the fans surrounding the place kept a nice breeze going for you and kept flies away, plus the table umbrella blocked those rays of sunshine. 

Our waiter cane to the table and introduced himself almost immediately and took our drink orders. Candyce B. mentioned the queso and said it was worth it so we tried it... man was she ever right. The queso had a little kick to it like I expected, since it was a Mexican restaurant, and I loved it. I pretty much stuffed myself with tortilla chips and queso. 

Then because it was my first time visiting, we had a choice to try all for their signature sauces. All of them were great and each one unique in their own way. As for my appetizer I had the custom enchiladas, which came with 2 enchiladas and your choice of sauce to smother them with. It was great but I couldn't finish it because I ate way too much queso and chips. 

Service was excellent and out waiter \"Fred\" was extremely courteous and knowledgeable. He knew the names and flavors of all of the sauces and kept our experience full of laughter. This restaurant and expeeience completely changed my opinion of Mexican food and I can't wait to try it again. Overall this restaurant gets a 4.0 out of 5.0."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to go to the incredibly delicious Pacos Tacos just down the road, but since they had a half hour wait, I wanted to find another place to scratch my burrito itch.

Thus, we walked into Chuy's. There was no wait (surprising on a Friday night), and were seated instantly.

The decor was a little weird though. Very colorful, but the themes don't match up. You'll see hispanic decor mixed with 50's rock and roll with guitars right next to them. Not really a fan.

When it came to the food, it was very delicious. I had the steak burrito and it was very satisfying. Not a fan of their salsa (I always wish it were a little bit spicier), but still decent food nonetheless.

It can't hold a candle to Pacos Tacos, but it's still worth your time and money nonetheless."}
{"text":"i like the food it's okay but their service isn't that great 6/10 wouldn't recommend and they do not give the drinks or food out fast enough it takes a long time"}
{"text":"Salsa lovers dream.  I highly recommend this place.   They are expanding and there will be a few more in charlotte soon enough.  

The southpark location was full of women on a thurs night snd the bartender was extremely attentive."}
{"text":"Chuy's is a great place to gather with friends.  The place is cheerful and eclectic with family photos and funky art plastered on the pepto-pink walls.  The portions here are pretty big, but don't expect average Mexican restaurant prices.  This place is a step up from the run of the mill tex-mex, so the entrees are a little more than you might expect them to be.  That being said, they bring delicious chips & salsa to the table-- so you can easily share a meal.  

My favorite thing about this place is the nacho bar at Happy Hour.  From 4-7pm on weekdays you can stock up on unlimited nachos topping them with queso, meat, beans, etc. Come in and order a drink with friends and load up on nachos!

All in all, Chuy's is a great addition to South Park.  The central location and vast seating are perfect for an after-work get-together OR for a stiff drink while you are coming down from your shopping high."}
{"text":"I went here with two friends for a late lunch. It was super! I had a cheese chile relleno and a veggie enchilada.  The chile relleno was phenomenal, the best I have had ever. The jalapeno cream sauce is the one to pick hands down! I asked about it and the waiter brought me some to try.  They had free queso the day we went. James D was our server and he was very attentive and made us feel like we were esteemed guests in his home.  Great representative of Chuy's.  I will def return!"}
{"text":"Quoted 30 minute wait, 1.5 hours later we were stalking tables to try to feed our kids. Food was mediocre, go to la unica for real Mexican, FAST service, and more consideration of your time from hosts."}
{"text":"We are regulars at this place and it's amazing!!!! The creamy jalapeño is sooo good, even my kids love it. The big as your face beef fajita burrito with boom boom sauce on it is one of our favorites. The fajitas are also wonderful. The Mexican and Texas martinis are awesome!"}
{"text":"I have eaten several meals here but most often I order the Chicken Tortilla Soup to go. You get a huge bowl portion in a reusable container that is clearly freshly made with chunks of avacados , fresh corn, tomatoes , etc. Some chips to sprinkle in with a slice of lime to squeeze over it & you are all set. They also give you a huge bag of chips with salsa & a ranch jalapino dip. There is also a frequent lunch card that you can get punched or double punched during certain times & every 6th punch or 11th punch is free. You can call it in for pick up or they can get it ready for curb side pick up. There is also a happy hour during the week in the bar with drink specials & a nachos buffet for free., Great Deal."}
{"text":"While I much prefer the convenience of the old South Park location (this one is practically in the middle of nowhere), I was pleasantly surprised by our experience tonight. The wait was short, around five minutes, and the food was delicious (I recommend the fish tacos or the oven roasted chicken burrito). The real reason for this review though is our waiter Matthew, who was incredible. I have never had more attentive service anywhere. He kept everything topped off, checked on our food, brought the check immediately... His hard work and attention to detail made for a very enjoyable experience and we will definitely be back soon. Thanks, Matthew!"}
{"text":"Cool decor, service was good and chicken was great."}
{"text":"Yay! Best Tex Mex in town! We were really impressed with the atmosphere and the food at Chuy's especially considering that we were there for there practice run night.  This was the first meal served by the restaurant and we had nothing to complain about. If you don't know from my other Tex Mex reviews I deeply love Chili Rellenos and have not been able to find a decent meal of them here in Charlotte. Every restaurant that serves them here serves them soggy, not crispy like they should. Chuy's comes out with a nice fresh pepper that's coating is crispy and delicious the way it should be.

Not only do they have them but they also enjoy the Hatch chili at Chuy's and celebrate the Hatch Chili Festival in August. I will no longer have to order a box from Hatch, NM. I can now go celebrate my obsession locally at Chuy's with the rest of the Hatch Chili crazies.  Once you've had them you'll understand.  For the festival and the chilis alone I would give them 5 stars, but they also really pulled off a great experience for us on a practice run night and we just loved the feel and atmosphere of the restaurant in general.  There is a great bar area for fun with friends. But, try and get a seat outside if you can. The view is very relaxing. The fountain and play area for the kids is just awesome too. They have thought of everything."}
{"text":"I'll give 3 stars because everyone was just so nice, but honestly it was just not the place for me.  House margaritas were good, and the salsa was very flavorful, but it seems like every single menu item is spicy and that doesn't work for me.  For some reason I asked after I placed my fajita order if they were spicy and was told oh yes, very!  Umm, no thanks then.  Switched to shrimp tacos, please no cilantro.  Of course they come loaded with cilantro and I have to pick it all out of the wet cabbage.  My friend got quesadilla as another less spicy option and they were served taco style, weird.  I am glad I gave it a shot but the only reason I'd be back is to have a margarita while I wait for a table at Cowfish!"}
{"text":"We are from Austin and so have a soft spot and big appetite for Tex Mex, including eating at the original Chuy's on Barton Creek many times. 

This location leaves a lot to be desired, bar area is small, dining area smallest of any Chuy's we've ever been to, and the service can be horrendously slow and poor in general. The South Park location was so much better, but also a lot less busy even considering the Cowfish overflow people. 

Still, I give this place 5 stars because the food never disappoints. My wife gets the same thing every time, Chicka-chicka Boom Boom. If you like chicken enchiladas and spicy sauce, this is the go-to dish esp with the hatch chile rice, that you can also sub with any meal. 

I've ventured all over the menu, my favorite is the chile relleno with shredded chicken. Also the cornflake fried chicken is good, always the big as yo face burrito is a good choice esp if you are hungry. 

Hopefully the service improves and the wait gets shorter, sometimes it is as long as 2 hours for a table of 5!  You can always try the open seating at the bar.  With the rest of Waverly slowly opening, I can only hope it improves."}
{"text":"We looked forward to going to the new location since South Park had been closed for awhile. We finally went last night. Our server was great but the food was just ok. The food was warm, not hot. The drinks we ordered were very small for $11."}
{"text":"Chuy's was pretty awesome! The decor was bright and funky. Very retro. 
The service was EXCELLENT!! If you go hopefully you'll get seated in Thomas's section. He was on point the whole night. I don't know about you but when my service is excellent that makes my whole experience that much better! 
Ok so now for the food. So frkn delicious! I had the chicken tortilla soup first. Let me tell you this is THE best tortilla soup I've ever had! It was so flavorful. Next I had the chicken and cheese chile rellenos. They were amazing!!! The batter they used was wonderful. They came out so crispy. I would recommend getting the chile rice over the Mexican rice. Although the Mexican rice is good the chile rice was herbaceous and had a better flavor. My bf got the Elvis combo and omg! It came with sooo much food! We have tons of leftovers. 
Oh yeah get the jalapeño dip with your chips!!! You have to! Just do it! You'll thank me later"}
{"text":"This is some of the worst Mexican food in Charlotte. Being from Colorado, I'm a little picky, but this just isn't even Tex-Mex. I had the enchilada and chalupa combo plate. The sauce on the enchilada was just plain gross. The rice was dry, the chalupa was eh, at best. 
And then there is the noise level in the place - LOUD! We were a table of 8 and couldn't even hear the person that was sitting across from us. Our table was basically in the aisle, so constantly having to pull our chairs in so the servers and people could get by us. Who has a seating arrangement like this?
Every single one of us said we will not be back. Azteca, Don Pedro's and Paco's Taco's are much better! If you know your Mexican food, stay away!"}
{"text":"We went today and the food and service was wonderful.

We stopped going for a awhile but after today we will be back.... so happy they turned it around."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.. We look forward to going back soon.. Great atmosphere and very friend people that work there."}
{"text":"Chuys is an awesome crossroads between cheap, satisfying food, and great sit-down-restaurant quality. Their sauces stand out as unique from other restaurants, and the creamy jalepeño sauce is reason enough to go in. Order it with your chips, put it on your meal, drink it, whatever. This place is great."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite restaurant for tex mex , food so yummy  and service is good and don't forget the price it's so right on for the kind and amount of food they serve. Will definitely be back again as long as I'm visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is great if you like Tex-Mex.  We ate there at lunch today.  Everyone who worked there was really nice and seemed to be in a great mood, almost like they actually like their jobs.  We started with the Chile Con Queso (YUMMY) our main entrees were the lunch combo #3 and salad/quesadillas combo.  Everything was very tasty.  The only thing missing is a good hot sauce.  We tried their hottest sauce and it was not very spicy.  Can't wait until summer to sit outside and drink margaritas on the patio!"}
{"text":"So, I wrote the home office. They say you'll be contacted shortly....I guess two plus weeks isn't shortly enough. We loved the Southpark location. What a shame they couldn't replicate it at Waverly. We went the first time during their second week after opening. Having been in the business before I put it up to new location, new employees, still working out the bugs. I'll always give a restaurant the SECOND CHANCE. I waited six months...boy was I wrong. The most enjoyable part of our second time was our waitress, the Beer and the Margarita. It started out with Chips so salty I had to slurp up two tall glasses of water. Maybe they were trying to up their Beer sales. Off the Children's Menu the Burrito was tasteless and not even hot enough to melt the cheese. My Shrimp Tacos were so heavily breaded I had to peel the breading off so I could taste the Shrimp! There were six thin slices of Red Cabbage and the Cilantro was crammed on one end of the Taco. My Rice was just two degrees over room temperature. My wife's Stuffed Peppers also had an overabundance of breading. For some reason her rice was hot. My wife had walked over to the free HAPPY HOUR NACHO BAR and came back with a total look of disgust; over picked, crusty cheese sauce and dried out toppings. When our waitress came by with the bill she asked how everything was. I had to be honest and I told her she was great but the food was horrible. She said she would get the manager. I explained everything to him and he apologized. He did the correct thing and comped the food. He also gave me a coupon for three free appetizers and entrées and asked me to give them one more try. I said I would but truth be told...no restaurant gets a third try. I gave the coupon to my sister who fortunately had a good dining experience there."}
{"text":"Came on Father's Day around 5 pm. We were sat immediately. We ordered the guacamole appetizer. It was good but at the bottom it was all lettuce which we all found strange for an appetizer guacamole. I ordered the Tex mex salad combo with a deluxe quesadilla. The quesadillas were two tiny quesadillas but they were good. Service was good, not excellent. Drinks ran out and the manager came to refill them. Drink orders were wrong. Overall food and service were good."}
{"text":"We really loved the South Park location and the new location as well! The service is excellent 99% of the time and we enjoy the very casual atmosphere. Food has always been great and like the new area as well."}
{"text":"While in town visiting a friend we both decided to get Mexican food and she said this place was pretty good so we decided to check it out. 

We were greeted and sat right away and our server was with us in seconds. He was very attentive and helpful. There was a queso happy hour so we started with that and it was tasty so it is a must do if you come here. We also ordered some house margaritas to start up.

My first drink was strong and tasty and the second one was all sour mix :(

I ordered the combination of Taco & Enchilada with all chicken. The taco was tasty but it felt apart after the first bite and I had to finish it with a fork. The enchilada had ranchero sauce on top and it was dry and under seasoned. I love Mexican food and I was sad that I did not have a good experience with my entrée but the appetizer and rice and beans were delicious. I guess next time I will have to try something different."}
{"text":"Chuy's is tex-mex pure and simple. It doesn't pretend to be upscale or pretentious.  If you go, go hungry because they will feed you. 

You can customize any enchilada w/ any choice of house made sauces. The Boom Boom sauce is great! Kick it up a bit, or cool it down, they've got you covered.  The stacked, blue corn tortilla house specialty is a really good surprise.

Check in for happy hour, they serve the nacho car.  Its the boot of an old automobile, and in it you'll find awesome queso, salsas, jalapeño ranch dip, and fresh made tortilla chips! Did I mention the nacho car is FREE! 

I'm a fan of the house cocktails as well.  The Texas Martini is $8, served in a shaker, and will refill your martini glass three times over.  They make good margaritas too! 

And if you're feeling really brave try the Elvis Presley Memorial, its crazy!"}
{"text":"Chuy's Food is Excellent! While the service is sometimes a little lacking I give extra credit for the quality of the food! The chips are fresh and hot and super thin....I mean so thin that I'm sure if I eat 2 baskets of them it's lower calories than the other restaurants....Right 
They have the best grilled chicken and the ground sirloin is excellent as well. Thanks for moving down to South Charlotte! South Park's Loss!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at Chuy's!  We do Chuy's at least once every 2 weeks (mainly because I live in the area).  My favorite is their Fajita Chicken Burrito with Queso.  As a starter, I always order queso to go along with the fresh chips.  The service is always good and I never have to wait too long to be seated.  Also, the strawberry margarita is really good!"}
{"text":"I came out for dinner last night and had the deluxe quesadilla. My friend (10 year old Layla) had the 3 soft shell tacos, refried beans and rice. The queso was an excellent decision and Meg came around to refill our chips before we ran out. Everything was delicious - but let's talk about our server Meg for a second. She was awesome! Super friendly, energetic and helpful. Not once did we have to ask for anything, she was on top of extra napkins, drink refills and drinks to go! Meg really made our visit wonderful, and I highly recommend her. She bumped it up from 4 stars to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had to try Chuys since I'm a huge fan of Mexican/Tex Mex food. Chuys is located in the beautiful location of Southpark the decor is very festive and the servers are very friendly! They brought out the chips and salsa the salsa was very bland. I ordered a vegetarian plate that included a chile rellano and a vegetable enchilada with rice and beans. The portions were large so you definitely get your money's worth but the food was not impressive just very bland and average."}
{"text":"If you get a kick out of all things kitsch then you will probably enjoy the décor at Chuy's. Personally, I'm a little confused by it because it's a mix of American diner circa 1950's, a helping of Elvis memorabilia, and various Mexican accoutrements scattered throughout. Their outdoor patio has a completely different feel with it being adorned by tall tulip figures. I like their outdoor patio better and prefer sitting out there over the very busy inside.

I've been to Chuy's a couple times and am always pleased with their service. The wait staff is very friendly and willing to offer suggestions and accommodate any changes to the meals/drinks, if need be. You start off with complimentary chips & salsa. The salsa is a little on the watery side but packs a silent punch when it comes to the heat. The chips are light and not too greasy, have a nice crunch. This go round, I decided to give their blackberry margarita a try. According to our waitress, Meaghann, the blackberry marg is specifically made with top-shelf liquor. The house margaritas run $6 (they're served on the rocks or frozen) and the blackberry margarita runs $9 and is only served on the rocks, so keep that in mind if you're looking to drink at certain price. I found the blackberry margarita to be all right but it wasn't too strong on the blackberry flavor. I could tell it was made was some sort of artificial flavoring.

Each time I've been to Chuy's, I usually order some sort of enchilada. To me, nothing pairs better with a margarita then a cheesy, loaded enchilada or taco. I decided to try one of the combinations (which are a great deal and good way to try other types of things) - the #4 with your choice of enchilada and relleno. FYI: a relleno is a stuffed pepper. I got the chicka boom enchilada (trust me, I felt just as silly saying it as I did typing it out) with green pepper sauce and a cheese-filled relleno. The relleno was fried and coated in two types of sauces plus a drizzle of sour cream. Because of all that, I didn't really taste much of the pepper. The enchilada was delicious and I wish I had ended up ordering two of those instead of the relleno. The standard sides of refried beans and rice were good as well.

Since Cowfish (which is located next door) is crowded quite regularly, Chuy's is a good alternative and encourages you to have a little bit of fun with your meal."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere! We did not make reservations and the wait was not long at all, about five minutes max. The restrooms were really clean also, which is always nice. Our waitress was very sweet and I got positive vibes from all of the staff. Our food came out really fast, and I would say the portions were fair. I would definitely eat her again if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Some girlfriends and I went to Chuy's after work on a Monday; none of us had ever been, but I'd had my eye on it since it took over Zink (boo).  

We were pleasantly surprised to learn about the 4:00-7:00 Happy Hour free nachos in the bar, and they were pretty darn delicious for being free!  I was hoping for some guacamole on the \"car trunk\" buffet, but for free, I'll deal with chips, ground beef, queso, beans and salsa.

Although the decor is loud, fun, and crazy as other reviewers have mentioned, most of the wait staff seemed sad and dumpy, shuffling by slowly but fast enough to never ask if we needed anything.  I ordered two glasses of sangria ($5.95) and there was so much ice that I maybe got 3 good sips out of each glass before it was empty.  

It was a nice enough night that there were a decent amount of people on the patio, and the restaurant side was hoppin' by the time we left at 7:30, but I was surprised that the bar area was just the bar and maybe 5 hightop tables that felt oddly arranged.

All in all, probably a fun place to take the kids or sit outside on a nice night, but something about it just didn't make me want to plan my next visit."}
{"text":"Great food but completely irritating wait staff.  Tons of servers walking around do everything but bringing you your food and drinks"}
{"text":"Great margs! Always end up filling in the chips :) different days they have discounts on drinks! Great location"}
{"text":"Excellent spot for tex-mex selections! The salsa is fresh and the chips are warm. Great drinks, laid back atmosphere and great customer service. The wait was not to long for a Tuesday evening on Valentines Day. We waited for less than 20 minutes. The food came out hot. The drinks were great! They also offer drink specials through the week. This location is new to the area. I would highly recommend Chuy's and plan to go back again. We had a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot!   They have a free nacho bar and the chips are great!   Affordable food and great staff!   My only complaint is with the small bar.  There needs to be a service area so people aren't constantly reaching over you to order their cocktails!  Great Casual Go To Place In Southpark!"}
{"text":"I can see why this placed closed.  Food was awful. Reminded my of a middle school cafeteria. Don't know how this place stayed in business for so long."}
{"text":"This is overpriced Mexican food and it's not even good. My husband and I went on a Sunday evening around 6:00. We were sat immediately. Our waitress wasn't horrible but she wasn't great either. She definitely had other places she wanted to be. We ordered guacamole which was mediocre at best. It's served on a huge bed of shredded lettuce so that it appears that there's more in the bowl than actually is. It makes it very difficult to eat. 

I ordered enchiladas and my husband ordered something that looked like taquitos. We could have gotten the exact same items and quality (not good) from any cheap Mexican restaurant in a shopping center for half the price. 

Needless to say we were unimpressed and won't be back!"}
{"text":"Chuy's is one of our favorite places in Southpark. The salsa is amazing. Get the creamy jalapeño sauce along side it too. It's a cool, inexpensive, and satisfying place to grab dinner. It's one of the few places in Southpark that does not have an ounce of \"snobbyness\" about it. When the weather is nice, the patio is great. It's family friendly while also good for people just want a beer and a taco. The staff is great too. We've only had one waitress who was annoyingly pushing the \"upsell\" the whole meal through, but the other 99% have been excellent."}
{"text":"I tend to err on the side of, \"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all...\" but my kids insisted that I write this place up. Five of us popped in for an early dinner on a weeknight. The colors are a little overwhelming at first but I'm ok with tacky if the food is good. Which it's not. At all. 

My kids sat down and were munching on the tortilla chips when I asked for the gluten-free menu. My waitress returned with a menu that says, \"NOT GUARANTEED ... Gluten-free menu.\" What the heckity heck does that mean? As I scanned down the list, I could have one menu item, no sauce. Regardless of whether or not you are gluten-free, the fact that everything on their menu contains gluten in some form or other - rice, sauces, sides - is a pretty big indicator that you are getting absolutely nothing fresh. Except avocado. I could have a freshly pitted avocado for dinner. 

As my kids were about to munch into some tortilla chips the waitress casually mentioned ... \"The chips aren't gluten-free either.\" Sooo... I think we're done here. 

I had heard such rave reviews from friends in other cities with Chuy's that I was really excited to give this a try. The price point is lower for a reason. I will stick with my slightly more expensive, but way better quality, local joints when I crave some TexMex."}
{"text":"BEST fish tacos in the Charlotte area! Absolutely delicious! Wonderful prices and atmosphere. Service is fantastic. I am definitely a regular."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't know this place opened right near my house sooner! I came on a Tuesday night and sat at the bar with a girlfriend. We had a great time chatting with the bartenders and owner, even though they were crazy busy. I had a frozen margarita and it was delicious and CHEAP. We ordered queso and it was to die for. For entrees, we both had the enchiladas with the boom boom sauce, it was so tasty!!! We had a great time and I was excited to come back which leads to a tale of great triumph.

I dragged my husband here on a Saturday night and since I had seen it crazy on a Tuesday I was expecting the worse. It had a crazy wait at 6:45 and we just went in to see the wait time. We were right behind a disgruntled middle aged man who dramatically hands the buzzer back to the young hostess and tells her \"I give up\". She politely asked if he wanted her to check his party's spot on the list. He says sure and she come back from looking at the list and I saw the most awesome thing I've ever witnessed at a hostess stand. She says so politely with a smile on her face \"sir, you got here 5 minutes ago and I told you the wait was an hour and 55 minutes\". He just looks at her and embarrassing leaves. You go girl! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted by this place, so let me try to list the pros & cons. Maybe that will help you make up your mind.

Pros:
Good service, Above-average food, decent drink/beer options.

Cons:
Tacky ambiance, VERY LOUD music, occasional free-roaming screaming kids on the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Always loved Chuy's when I lived in Austin. Got to introduce the boyfriend to a Mexican martini. Love the veggie combo. He love the steak burrito. Service at the bar was great!"}
{"text":"Your average TexMex food place. Wonderful funky decor and service ain't bad, food selection is okay. 

Food -  Mediocre, could be better. The popular Baja Taco (battered shrimp) was flavorful, but dry. Had to add sour cream and guacamole to help give it some moisture.  My husband liked his steak fajitas, and the chips and salsa were addicting.  The portions are big, enough to take home leftovers.

Drinks - They are generious with their tequila drinks!  

Service - Good. For the past three times I have been here, the food did take a wee-little longer to get to us. Even when we came on a not so busy afternoon on a Wednesday, it was still a tad bit slow.

Price - Was reasonable. I would say it is not cheap, but not pricey either - just in between.  

I would go here on a day when you feel for a TexMex meal, and don't feel like going to PacoTacos.

I loved Chuy's, but that was back two years ago when I lived in Texas. I was soo excited to see Chuy's here, I felt right at home upon walking into the restaurant.  It still had that splash of color and neat Chuy's theme that I am all too familar with back in Houston.   It was and still is a popular restaurant in Houston. It's always packed, it's too bad it is not the same in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place has become my favorite restaurant! Their tortilla soup is amazing! Also enjoy their chicken soft tacos! The tortilla chips are the best, thin and salty. Love, love, love their creamy jalapeño dip and fresh salsa. My only complaint is that they need to make a mild salsa too for the kids and those that can't tolerate the spicy!"}
{"text":"This is my third visit each time I've gotten a server worse than before.  The chips and dips are great. The food spicy, too spicy the waitress didn't even notice we Had not eaten it! Save your mouth fun a phat burrito  or go to the one in Texas!"}
{"text":"New location and it was packed.  The food was fresh and delicious.   The chips are outstanding.   So thin, they taste buttery ans seem to melt in your mouth. The dishes were good too."}
{"text":"Went to Chuy's for the first time today. Was sat promptly and was given chips/salsa & my ice water quickly as well. Our server then started waiting on a large party and we were completely ignored. The service never really quite picked up. 

Our appetizer came out the same time as our entrees (major pet peeve of mine!) and the food was nothing special. The rice was dry and flavorless. The refried beans looked like they'd sat on my plate for awhile in the kitchen and hardened up. I ordered the fish tacos and there was hardly anything on them. My daughter ordered a cheese quesadilla, and it looked beyond gross. 

It was also quite expensive, which I guess should have been expected being in Southpark. 

I am really bummed out as it's a great location with a great patio, and got a lot of rave when it opened - but it's not worth going to again."}
{"text":"Chuy's is a great Mexican restaurant. They serve Chile Rellenos, which are hard to find in the Charlotte area. Their guacamole is good. The chicken burrito was great. I had the Tex Mex sauce. The burrito was huge. I could not eat it all.

It can be hard to find good Mexican. Chuy's hits the mark with high quality food, then exceeds it with great atmosphere and attentive service."}
{"text":"We frequent this place often and the food is always good and consistent.  The service has always been great as well.  This time our order came out wrong and it took 11 minutes to refire which is way to long and it was Luke warm.  We didn't say anything and wanted to see if they would discount on our check they did not. :( the manager didnt even come over to apologize and check to see if the second meal was ok."}
{"text":"We went to Chuys last night for the the first time and we were extremely happy about our experience! After being let down over and over again from mediocre wanna be Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area, we had little to no expecations for Chuys and man did this restaurant not disappoint! It was extremely busy when we got in. Put our name in for two, and was only expecting a 20-25 min wait. So we decided to go to the bar area and grab a drink. It was packed there as well but for some fortunate reason the bartender saw me standing there through the crowd and asked what drinks I wanted?! What! No way, most bars that busy, the bar tenders avoid eye contact with people standing. Surprisingly enough, while that kind bartender was making the drink order, another bar tender asked how she could help. Very great service right off the bat. Got a traditional lime margarita on the rocks and it tasted fresh and delicious. We then looked around the bar area and noticed some open tables. Asked if we could just sit there instead of waiting for our table, and there were no issues. As soon as we sat down, our server came up to us with two waters and talked to us about the menu. Very informative and gave us great recommendations. I ordered the chuychanga and it was delicious!! Would recommend the tomatillo sauce as it is a mix between verde salsa and white queso. Yum! My husband got the chika chika boom boom and the flavor was amazing! Both dishes we would recommend to anyone. Last but but not least, the chips and salsa were the best we've had in Charlotte. The salsa is a pico de gallo type salsa, extremely fresh tasting! They also brought out a jalapeño cream salsa which was my husbands favorite. Definitely a must try bc it was very different! Careful though, chips and salsa are so good you will def get full just on those.

Chuys is a must try! It is now our go-to Mexican place in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"So cheap and not in the sense of crappy I mean inexpensive for what you get. AWSOME drink specials and decent portions for the dough you toss down. This place is a good 2-3rd date kind of place. Sometimes the service if a bit slow and inattentive but for the most part good service. Got through down the gauntlet and get the \"Elvis\" plater. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chuy's AKA \"Expensive On the Border\". It's literally the same restaurant with cheap salsa and really bad service (and a 96 for a sanitation rating).

The bartender makes a nice margarita."}
{"text":"What I love about Chuy's are the friendly folks that work there. I have never had bad customer service and I go there quite a bit because it is across the street from my home and it is VERY affordable. 

What I like about Chuy's is that I have found a few select items on the menu that allow me to fulfill my tex mex cravings. Being born and raised in Texas, this is def not the best, but so far I haven't found better in the Carolinas... aside from this place in South Carolina near the Angel Oak Tree, that place is swell!

It's also a great place to take children. I have seen them give out crayons and coloring books!

Their sopapillas were once huge and fluffy, and every other time they were small and crisp. Something is wrong here; Chuy's, please take note and fix.

I'll continue to visit on occasion. (:"}
{"text":"The Chuychanga was nicely fried and stuffed with a decent offering of shredded chicken and cheese, then topped with crema and plated with a side of super-smoky charro beans and a classically seasoned pile of Mexican rice. 

Sadly, the Shrimp & Cheese Rellenos were so overstuffed with chopped cilantro, you couldn't taste any of the interior ingredients. The fried crust on the exterior of the massive Anaheim peppers was freakishly crunchy - almost like Corn Flakes - and peeled off in one giant sleeve of shell-like goodness. Still, the cilantro -packed into the peppers like grass clippings in a lawnmower bag- completely spoiled the dish. 

The Elvis Green Chili Fried Chicken saved the day with its quirky deep-fried chicken breast breaded with Lay's Potato Chips and smothered in green chili sauce and a sprinkling of cheddar cheese - certainly a dish worthy of \"The Kang\"!

The boozy margaritas help wash down the bagged tortillas and watery pico de gallo-style salsa - we were unimpressed with the rather flavorless guacamole."}
{"text":"The food is good. Plenty of choices to choose from. So far I've tried the sangria and the house strawberry margaritas. The drinks were not spectacular. The food was delicious. The service was lacking. I'm sure they were super busy for cinco de mayo. Still, it was pretty bad. We didn't get our waters refilled. My coworker wanted a chicken and cheese quesadilla, plain. She received two little flour tortillas folded over like tacos with cheese & chicken. They were sooooo tiny and charged a regular priced meal...."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Chuy's really made me feel good about myself. Of course, any restaurant offering freebies is making it easier to win me over. The free nacho car was a nice touch, especially right next to the bar where the drinks were flowing and the bartenders gave great service and face ;-)

My beau and I stopped in on our way to the movies. It's in a high-traffic area, right next door to the ever-popular Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar in The Village at SouthPark. So, I definitely recommend using the Valet. 

We got there right in the middle of Happy Hour Nacho Car which is offered from 4 to 7 p.m.  Monday through Friday. We quickly ordered drinks. Sangria was on special for $1 off the regular price. My beau also ordered the Perfect Margarita (Patron included). He loved it. We didn't get a chance to eat a full dinner but the bartender gave us a complimentary bowl of the Jalapeno Ranch Dip. Awesomeness! 

I can't wait to go back for dinner! Bueno!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go here. The food was luke warm (when it got here). Total time in and out for three was over 90 minutes. I will say that the chicken and pork tasted like they were made in the store and deserve some recognition for their quality. Need better service and better attention overall. Given all the options in this area, I would consider something else for your time and money."}
{"text":"I dined here as a second choice after the wait at a nearby spot was too long. Chuy's was fine, but not particularly memorable. My server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. 

I had some enchiladas that are one of the signature dishes due to my server's recommendation. That was an odd choice for me because I generally find enchiladas to be a gooey mess. These had some texture and I liked the chicken inside. I also ordered  guacamole which was good, but not great. Restaurant guac is always overpriced, and unless you must have it, I would pass here, for the price. I thought the salsa with the chips was pretty runny.

So overall, this was fine. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again, but I wouldn't throw a fit if someone wanted to go here."}
{"text":"Best Tex-mex food around!!! Love the patio, the decor, and the queso! If you go during the week for lunch usually there won't be a wait but prepared to wait on a Friday night!! Place is packed, with good reason though. Nacho Car during their happy hour is an awesome plus as well."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a colleague from the area so when I visited a friend from high school, we went with her family. They had never been but have heard of it. The restaurant is located in the really nice South Park area which was surprising to me. The ambiance and decor of the place was fun and eclectic; there were cameras stuck to the ceiling of the entry-way, fun Tex-Mex themed paintings, etc. Now the real reason we went was to eat, not to take in the art on the wall. The food was not good. At all. Really, really bad. I would have rather eaten at Taco Bell and I haven't been there in about 15+ years. I have made better enchiladas at home, and I look forward to eating better food than I can cook at restaurants, especially at a Mexican restaurant. Clearly the people who gave this place more than 2 stars have never had Tex-Mex before because the food at this place was awful. My friend asked for no beans as a side on her dish. It came out with beans on it. She said I asked for no beans. Waitress asked her if she is allergic. Friend says, no I just don't like beans and I asked not to have them. Waitress says do you want your meal replated or remade. Friend says just replate it without the beans. Waitress says, ok they don't look appetizing anyway. I look down at the beans on my plate...thanks Ms. Waitress Lady for further ruining an already horribly tasting dinner. Half a star for the fries tasting good that I ate off of my friend's kid's plate of a grilled cheese and fries because I couldn't even finish my dinner. Another half star for the restaurant decor. 1 Star total is all this place is gonna get. Ever."}
{"text":"This is tex mex at its finest. I'm only giving it three stars because I'm not a huge Tex mex fan. 

Chips are delish! Thin and crispy. Salsa is more like pico de gallo. 

We got queso as a app. Spicy but warm and flavorful. 

I got the #6 combo and it had great presentation and was a lot of food. Only bad thing, I think my enchilada drowned in the rustic red ranchero sauce. 

My friend ordered the veggie enchiladas. Not a beautiful dish, she said it was good but that she expected better. 

Our server was super friendly and great with suggestions and explaining the concept of restaurant to us.

Won't suggest this place next time it's my choice but will be fine if it's someone else's choice 

Love the decor!"}
{"text":"Just opened down the street from me in Waverly . Very crowded but we had a party of 7 and did get seated fairly quick. The Chips are thin and hot and good ! Table Salsa was fresh and spicy !  Guacamole was lacking and flavoring and mostly chopped lettuce .  The Chili Rellenos were wonderful ! Big and Crisply fried - 2 in the order. I had the Cheese filled ones and I loved them ! Tacos were good, could have had a bit more meat . The Regular Margarita was plain an needed more lime. I will go back again !!  For Tex Mex it was very good !"}
{"text":"Decent tex mex and fun decor - loaded with kids which is why we bring ours. Hostess not great at estimated seat time - 20 min turned into an hour - not the end of the world but annoying to see parties come in after you and get seated ahead of you.  Even worse if you are trying to time dinner for a grumpy little one. Table service was great. Food was fine."}
{"text":"We were able to treat ourselves to Chuy's during a \"soft opening\" night for the media due to my friend, Nikki, knowing everyone in town so Yay for us.  The place was packed!  They had drinks on special and I treated myself to a virgin lime frozen margarita.  NOOOO GOOOO on the virgin margarita.  It was super sour.  The food, though, was quite delicious and made up for the drink.  I had the Chuychanga with queso and YUM.  My friend had the Bang-bang sauce over chicken enchiladas and they were to-die-for.  Honestly, very good Tex Mex and for someone who has lived in Ft. Worth, TX for four years, it was nice to remind me of my years there.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience we have ever had in this area. The guac we ordered tasted like it was prepared days in advance and kept in the fridge. When I told the waitress she toolkit back and showed the manager and they were both questioning its lack of freshness. The main dishes we ordered were waaaay to spicy, and we love spice. We will never return to this establishment unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! The food is delish. But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE provide us real salsa. Not just the fermented pico de gallo. But true salsa! Give the people what they want! :-)"}
{"text":"THE Best Mexican food restaurant in South Charlotte. But all dining business went to Cowfish.   RIP Chuy's!! Will miss your chicka-chicka bang bang sauce!"}
{"text":"It has been only opened for about 3 months now and I have gone almost every week now. This place is amazing. 

I would consider myself a connoisseur of chips and salsa, and Chuy's currently ranks #1. They are so addicting. Im almost never have the appetite anymore once the food comes out. :D

A MUST GO"}
{"text":"First off.. I never post and if I do it is a short summary. I used to manage restaurant and understand the business. That being said......

We went for a little family fun Friday night. They are supposed to have a little cart in the bar with chips, dips and taco meat until 7pm.At 6pm the cart was barren. no queso, no salsa and the taco meat that was left was dried out. 

We sat in the bar and asked if it would be restocked. They refilled some but never refilled the meat. Not the end of the world but if you offer it to attract customers don't do it 1/2 as@.

Dinner was disappointing as well. Food was fair. Hence 2 stars and not 1. The first drink from the bar took a long time and had something in it. The waitress returned it to the bar and I watched the bartender give it away to a regular sitting at the bar. (I was also walking by the bar shortly after and the bartender gave the same group another apparently free drink since he said here you go I made this by mistake.)

The food came but was hard to eat without silverware or plates. The kids taco looked horrible. After 5 minutes and cold fajitas we got silverware. A third drink that  was ordered during dinner arrived 10 minutes later when we were done 

In short, average food and poor execution ."}
{"text":"Originally we were planning to go to Cowfish for lunch which is right next door but then we decided to venture out and go with Chuy. We were greeted  and seated immediately. As you walk in you'll noticed a mixture of 50's diner furniture, some fun paintings, patio lights and Mexican mosaic tile patterns. What really makes it stand out to me though is the tortilla station. Literally someone was making fresh tortilla for your meal. The results of the freshly made tortilla? Superb. The salsa tasted so fresh and the flavors were great. I thought it was a bit on the salty side but still delicious. 

I was a little disappointed that they do not serve my favorite Mexican drink. Horchata! It is a refreshing cold drink made of rice, almonds, cinnamon, lime zest and sugar. Even though the drink has a milky appearance it is completely dairy-free. At least the manager or owner came out and apologize. She wish she knew the ingredients so they could provide that to customers who knows their stuff. ;) I was starting to think there wasn't any great Mexican restaurants around the Charlotte area. Then this place said \"No Wendy, come to us and we will change your mind...\"  and guess what? It did. (for some reason I just read that like the voice of Jack Black from Nacho Libre) Anyways, enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is great! They're always on point and filling up our chips and salsa. It's loud so perfect if you have kids who are loud also :) the food itself is decent."}
{"text":"Chuy's has the best Tex-Mex I've ever had. I've been to many locations including the original in Austin, Houston, Little Rock and the food is just as good here. I'm not sure why this one has so many bad reviews except that maybe they are still new. For those who say they have no flavor, I'm not sure what they're eating because the food here is the best. During the week they have a free nacho bar during happy hour. Our favorites are: make sure to request the creamy jalapeño dip (it's free) with your chips, tortilla soup is the best I've ever had, beef fajitas, boom boom enchiladas, shrimp & cheese relleno, Baja shrimp tacos, their refried beans are to die for, hatch green chile rice and Mexican Martini (you can ask for 2 glasses). My 5 yo son loves to get just a side order of fajita chicken, refried beans and Mexican rice. Since we moved here I've been about 3 times and the service was fine."}
{"text":"My husband & I are big fans of Cowfish (next door to Chuy's), so that is usually our go-to choice when in South Park.  We decided to try something new today and Chuy's was fantastic!  

The Service:  Our server, Trevor, gave us excellent service.  He brought chips & salsa (the chips are soooo good!!) almost as soon as we sat down.  He was fast, courteous and helpful!  It was such a treat to not have to worry about anything during our dinner.

The Food:  I had the beef fajitas and they were spot on!  The meat was perfectly cooked & tender.  Fajitas are my favorite \"eating out\" food & Chuy's version did not disappoint.  My husband had the Baja Tacos with Shrimp and he was a big fan.  The refried beans on the side were delicious too!  

The Drinks:  I don't know about you, but my favorite part of a Mexican restaurant is the margarita!  I ordered the House Strawberry Margarita, frozen.  It was very smooth & tasty!  I thought the price of $5.95 was great, too.  

The Atmosphere:  I really felt like I was in EPCOT at Disney.  The theme of the restaurant is so well done!  I loved the kitschy atmosphere.  Each area is decorated differently, but the themes are cohesive.  It is whimsical and super cute!  

I am sad that it took us this long to give Chuy's a try, but glad we finally did!  Can't wait for the next Tex-Mex dinner date!"}
{"text":"So we have been here 2 times already. The first time we had a friend come visit us from out of town and we stopped by for some lunch. During that visit we found the staff to be friendly, the food came out quick and it was delicious. On our second visit we took our sons out for their birthday's for dinner and we had to wait over 45 minutes for an appetizer to come out and then another 20 minutes for our dinners to show up. The food was good, not as good as the first time but that is the only thing that would bring us back again. The wait staff was pretty much non-existent during our 2nd visit. The hostess had to take us to 3 different tables before she found one that was supposed to be vacant. They seemed to be totally disorganized on the 2nd visit. Hopefully the service improves as they have a good food selection and it is good."}
{"text":"my family and i absolutely love chuys! every weekend we go out to dinner, and the past few weeks we have not been able to stay away from all the great mexican food they have to offer. the hot thin chips with either the salsa or queso is fabulous, same with the steak or chicken fajitas! i would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"WORST TEX-MEX I've ever eaten, and my dinner companion felt the same way. Servers didn't seem very happy, and someone (a fireman) told me that an angry employee put a pot of boiling oil underneath the fire detector which set off the fire alarm which not only emptied every \"Village at South Park\" shop but also the people who lived in the apartments above them. Apparently they set off that fire alarm numerous times - just an arrogant, badly run establishment with yucky food. Don't waste your money, and if you plan to eat there have a good supply of Pepto Bismol (which was the color of their facade when I went) in your car. Otherwise make sure you're wearing a \"Depends\" The photo below to the left is VERY HELPFUL as it looks exactly like what you'll see in your toilet bowl later (and it won't take long)."}
{"text":"Our intention was to go to the Cowfish but there was a ridonkulous wait so we went across the way to Chuys which, of course, didn't have any wait.  I've already written about the décor, and the service was good last night which earned this place an extra star.

The food here is horrible.  It lacks flavor, imagination and is never like the description on the menu.  Sweetie is a vegetarian and they only offer one option which was a breaded and fried chile stuffed with squeeze cheese no flavor, a blue tortilla covered with squeeze cheese, no flavor and looked like something a dog threw up, and some beans undoubtedly from a can, no flavor.  She rated it the 2nd worse meal she has ever eaten in her life.  I had the combo fajitas for one.  The menu said something about being marinated for 24 hours in some juice or something.  Not possible.  I know, trust me.  The chicken was dry and was completely void of flavor, the steak only had a taste because there was so much fat on the beef, and who doesn't like fat?  The tortillas were made in house because I saw them making them but they were dry, and dusty.

Chuy's is in this area because they have \"chain\" money behind them, otherwise they wouldn't last very long.  It is extremely kid friendly but me thinks that once your kids figure out that you can go get a # 2 at El Cancun or something and spend less $$ and get a better meal that will go away.  You should know better once you go one time."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try Chuy's . My expectations for the food itself may have been a little more than actual experience but overall it was okay.

The ambience was Fun Friday kinda of feel. Big colorfully decorated museum/fun house flow. Good drinks which provide a lot of bag for your buck. Never ending warm chips to compliment various salsa options. Make sure to inquire about the choices, our waiter never told us you could get other styles besides the typical fresh cantina style.

Now for entrees... I ordered the waiter recommend \"Chica Chica Boom Boom. Shredded chicken wrapped in tortilla covered in spicy cheese sauce. It was just okay and maybe a little better with creamy jalapeño sauce. Hubby had Ron Chille, huge spicy stuffed with shrimp peppers deep fried and drizzle with creamy sauce. He thoroughly enjoyed the dish. Different from your typical Tex Mex dishes.

For dessert we of course ordered the popular tres leche cake. This may be a specialty and well known dessert but not for me. Tasted like a weird almost cornbread consistency type of cake with Carmel drizzle and sweet cream. Definitely could have done without the extra calories from the couple of spoonfuls had. So again overall rating=Just Okay"}
{"text":"I rarely write a review, and ironically one of the few I have written was for Chuy's and it was positive.  In fairness the food with respect to its price and quantity is still solid.  However my most recent experience was a bit of a debacle.  We came in at 7:30pm and were told a wait was 25-30 mins, we were finally sat at 9pm.  I realize the time hostesses provide is not an exact science but wow, that was quite the underestimate.  We kept checking with the hostess desk to see when our party of 5 was next on the list and kept being assured we were close to being next. Had they even told us the wait was an hour, we would have left, without any bad taste in our mouth understanding it was just a busy night.   At one point an employee informed me that some parties had sat themselves irrespective of their order on the list, which was part of the source of the delay, I was shocked to see that a group could do that and yet still be served.  Lastly even when we did sit, it took about a 30-40 mins for food to get out after order.  The waiter appeared to be doing what he could, it just seemed whether it was the bar or kitchen, things were just dragging.  Which was even more surprising because by this point it was almost an empty restaurant!  Felt like we could not win.  All in all we finally left at 10:30 PM.  Needless to say it was not in our plans to turn dinner into a 3 hour event.  Like I said food is good, but I would be very hesitant to come here during peak hours again,  take any time to seating forecasts and multiply by 3!"}
{"text":"Went there about a week ago on a Saturday night with a party of six. We had to wait around 30 mins or so for a table.  Although the food took a long time to reach the table, the server was very good and checked on us frequently.  Management stopped by to apologize too.  We were having a good time so the wait wasn't a big deal. It was extremely crowded. The chips and salsa were good and picante. The food was just ok. Nothing special. I had a roasted chicken burrito.  Chuy's is a good place if you want to hang out with some friends and have something to eat  but if you want a good Mexican meal, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews, but I want people to know how awful this place is. The chips and salsa were the only good thing I had all night. The guacamole was bland, and made up of only a little bit of avocado with a lot of lettuce underneath it as a filler. Then, they completely messed up my order. I ordered veggie enchiladas since I'm vegetarian, and they gave me chicken enchiladas. I didn't realize it until I took a bite and it was too late. And the veggie enchiladas, one of the few vegetarian options, weren't good either. Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"Same comments as many already here.  ThIs place is the real deal.  We went last night.  Service was excellent... And it will only get better as they get their systems down.  I had the 9-1-1 Hot Plate, which is now just called the Chuy's Special... Same great taste as Dallas, Austin, Houston locations that I've been dining in since the 80's.  Hatch Green Chile sauce on the side was great.  Wife had tacos al carbon which were great, and son had kids beef tacos... Of which I sampled and approved.  

Two things i look for that set Tex Mex wannabe's from the real deal are tortillas (corn and flour), and the beans (charro and refried).  Both are spot-on at Chuy's in Charlotte.  The flour tortillas are handmade... And you absolutely can taste the difference between handmade tortillas and those that come in a stack of 150 in a plastic bag... (On The Border, Qdoba, Moe's, Salsarita's, Taco Bell... Etc... I'm looking at you!)

Very few Tex Mex establishments in Texas serve black beans.... I hear you... They may be healthier... But it just isn't part of the ingredients.  Try the charro beans when you are in Chuy's... You'll see what I mean.

Anyway, ecstatic that Tex Mex has arrived in Charlotte.  As this place catches on, it is going to be crowded!"}
{"text":"I went within the first two weeks of their opening, so my experience may have been impacted by the new staff and such. Having lived in Texas for 10 years, I was super excited for Chuy's to come to town. It's impossible to find authentic Tex Mex in town, and our options for decent Mexican food are limited, too. So I had high hopes for Chuy's. But I was pretty disappointed by my experience and may not return to give it another try anytime soon. There were 4 of us in the party - 2 boys (10-12) and two moms. I ordered a margarita, and although it was $11, I found it to be VERY lacking. It was more like a watered down limeade. Pathetic. We each ordered a different entree, and nobody was very enthusiastic about their dishes. I had the enchiladas and was unimpressed. I think I've had better enchiladas at Chi Chis! Yikes. The service was slow and incomplete (requiring multiple requests before receiving things like salsa, fresh water, etc.)

The one positive to the experience is their house-made tortillas, which are yummy and fresh."}
{"text":"Spicy salsa!!!
Fun place and great atmosphere for families, quick service, relatively good food.  Not sure why the guacamole had lettuce at the bottom but it was still tasty."}
{"text":"Chuys is tasty. This location would benefit from a little grudge like the original Chuys in Austin. If they could make it look less like a chain and relocate away from Cowfish they would be golden. Wishing it replicated the original and was located in NoDa or Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"It was o.k.  Service had really bad breath and would disappear on occasion.  I'm not going to say his name - he wasn't horrible, but could have been better. (and he should floss more often)

The person who brought my food wasn't paying attention to what she was doing and as she was trying to quickly put the plates down dumped my plate on me.  It was hot but no damage done.  They got another plate out to me very quickly.  Made me wonder why the original order took so long though.

Food, o.k....but that's Mexican to me... it's all kind of the same stuff, not a lot of differences.  Good amount of meat in the flautas I got.  Rice, normal.  I didn't eat the beans...those always look gross to me.  Brown beans, not black beans.  

Nice, thin tortilla chips.  Yum.  Could have made a meal off of those and almost did.  They don't have queso blanco, just the yellow cheese queso, it was good and there was plenty of it.  

The guacamole though...that was exemplary!  Nice and chunky and a good helping of it.  

My friend got the crispy taco plate.  It looked good, but the taco's were small, but seemed to have a good amount of meat as well!  Made me wonder what the Thursday mini soft taco's must look like though - teeny-tiny?

Barefoot Wines $4.75/glass...now that's a good deal!!!!  Merlot is nice and fruity.

Decor is fine...colorful, vintage-styled \"portraits\"...not sure what Elvis had to do with any of it, but there \"HE\" is.  

Pet peeve...why do restaurants seat from the back of the house?  They started to take me down some hallway past the restrooms and I turned around and asked them to seat me in a booth closer to the front.

Since I'm not a fan of Mexican, it hasn't converted me, but it is what it is and pricing isn't horrible."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. If you haven't tried the jalapeño cream sauce, it will rock your world. I ordered the southwestern enchiladas and I was very pleased. They were stacked versus rolled, and topped with a fried egg. So delicious! Very spicy and lots of flavor. 

**update - I figured out the amazing service was from a guy named Ty, who I had again today on 9/22. He is absolutely amazing!!**"}
{"text":"Service was good, but we weren't too impressed with our meal. It was just generic tex-mex. Blah. Didn't seem like especially fresh ingredients, especially the salsa which seemed like it was frozen. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"The steak fajitas were wonderful but the Tres Leches cake was ridiculously fantastic. I dream of that cake."}
{"text":"We had just returned from out of town and I was craving Mexican but the man wanted to watch the game. We decided to use Eat24 to order Chuys and unfortunately we both agreed we should have starved instead of ordering from them. But to back it up let me mention that I was super excited for my Elvis combo. I wanted to try a little bit of everything with all the meats! I also ordered a soup because I love tortilla soup and I am pretending it is fall already so it is prime soup season! The man ordered a chicken \"big as yo' face\" burrito.
 
Now it probably wasn't the restaurant's fault that we waited for 2 hours before our lukewarm food showed up. However we were getting 'hangry' by the time it showed up only to find we had the completely incorrect order! Ugh! Since the receipt for what we ordered was in the bag of different food I think I can put this one on the restaurant. So this review is for the random food items we received.

Nachos - the chips were super-duper salty and the salsa with them was not impressive. Whoever ordered them left off the cheese and beans which would have made it better I think. The chicken fajita burrito that we received had a couple pieces of chicken and a little bit of cheese. The rest was all beans. If you want a bean burrito definitely order this item, but not if you want chicken. I had the unfortunate experience of the veggie enchilada which had very few vegetables or cheese and a semi spicy sauce but was mostly tortilla. The best part of the meal was what I think was the deluxe tomatillo sauce. Thank you random stranger for ordering this it made eating everything much better! 

Now all of this would have probably warranted a 2 rating except for a couple things. First, Chuy's charges a \"packaging fee\" for to go orders. I didn't see any mention of this anywhere on their website. Hidden fees are not cool! The other reason for the low rating is that both of us had upset stomachs after eating our various items."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. The food and service is always amazing. My personal favorite is the chicka chicka boom boom enchiladas or the macho burrito Friday special as seen in the picture attached"}
{"text":"Wow this place blows all the places I have eating. What a fun place to eat.  They have a huge menu to choose from.  Huge drink selection also. Definitely see one go to it!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a big fan of \"Tex-Mex\", but we were hunting a place for lunch and thought we'd give Chuy's a try.  I'm so glad we did cause it was yummy  :-)  

The place is so interesting visually that I found myself distracted on numerous occasions during our lunch.  From the moment you walk in, your eyes are drawn to colorful entertaining images everywhere.  The service was great, the food was reasonably priced (considering it's at South Park) and the sweet tea was tasty.  We all left full and satisfied.  

My only issue is the parking- you've REALLY got to want to eat here to deal with the enormous hassle that South Park always has with their parking areas being way too tight and not nearly enough spaces.  I'm not a \"mixed use\" space kind of gal, I like open spaces and plenty of room- neither are present at South Park.  I guess if you're a local resident and wanted to walk it would be fine, but for me, it's just not worth the hassle when I can get Mexican food on any corner all over town."}
{"text":"Found a bug in my salad halfway through eating it... And not just a little fruit fly... This was a HUGE CRAWLING BUG! I was so disgusted. Thankfully, they said they would refund me but I will never be back."}
{"text":"This place is the wort.  Staff is friendly and maybe someday will get its act together.  They bill themselves as \"world famous\" but I have no idea what world they are talking about.  Place is noisy,has created noxious odors throughout the Shops at the Village of SouthPark, has kids that run crazy around the fountain with little or no adult supervision. food is plentiful but also about the worst Tex Mex ever,  Do yourself a favor and run for your life from here.  So many other good places in Charlotte.  One other thing - how the h.. did Simon properties let them get away with the totally obnoxious pink exterior that is totally out of place in the Village.  Somebody needs their head examined.  Avoid this place at all costs!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Completely disrespectful. My wife and I came in and sat at the patio. Our waitress Christin came over and asked for drinks, we both got waters, she came back with them and chips and salsa and then things seemed to horribly decline. 

My wife asked a simple question about a menu option (about being able to select a certain enchilada on a combo) she seemed very annoyed, rudely said \"I'll make it happen.\" Then just walked to take my order. We both wanted Charro beans instead of refried beans but were both so distracted by the attitude, we completely forgot and she never asked what kind we wanted anyway.

Following this she never came back to refill our chips and salsa or waters, and ignored us, we watched her bring more to several other tables around us. (We know she saw we were out of everything as she looked at our table several times) We sat there with nothing left to snack on and no water. (See Pics) we literally finished the entire meal and sat around for about 15 minutes and she never once even asked or offered anything. Following our food coming out, she didn't even check back in to be sure everything was ok or that it had come out correctly.

After about 15 more minutes of sitting there trying to figure out what we could have possibly done to her, she returned with the check without asking about needing anything else, or dessert (which we originally planned on getting). At this point she did ask if we wanted boxes and we declined. When she returned with my card, she sat it down on the table next to me and said \"here you go.\" And then walked off. No \"Thank You\", no nothing. So awkward.

On the bright side, the girl who ran our food out was really polite and thankfully she came because we weren't given napkins or utensils. Not sure what her name was, she seemed around 20's possibly and had several tattoos and she was great. The food was also pretty good and the space had a nice vibe, but that was crushed by our waitress who just seemed mad at the world.

Overall, the food was very good, but the service killed this place for us. And just to clarify, the restaurant was busy, but not crazy and she seemed to tend to the tables to our left and right without any trouble. We just felt very singled out for no reason, it was very strange."}
{"text":"We first went to Chuy's not long after they opened, and perhaps for that reason, were not impressed. It took a while to go back, and it turns out, we just don't seem to be fans of the place.

There is a bit of kitschy appeal to the place, the food definitely takes a backseat to the overall decor. They've done a nice job of revamping the joint so that it looks nothing like Zink - though Zink was actually a pretty decent place (especially that patio!) before.

On the inside, you have trees, and noise and kids and, like others have side, IT IS LOUD. Maybe I'm showing my age more and more, but I could do without all the extra props and noise - I'd much rather have better food instead. What is there is okay, but when you throw everything else into the mix, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim and so glad we did! We were driving down the road actually going somewhere else for dinner and the sign caught my eye. For some reason switched plans on the fly!

This was our first time at a Chuy's and our waiter did a great job giving us a rundown of the menu. He brought out our chips with salsa and a thing of Jalapeño crime sauce... wow. So good. I ordered the a huge steak burrito that was very very good. The amount of food was insane and I simply could not finish it.

Prices are about what you would expect and just an overall good first experience, no doubt in my mind we will return at some point."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chuy's since back in the olden days when it was located all the way in Southpark. I used to travel there via my RC car. Sometimes the battery on the remote would die on my way there and I would have to phone a miniature horse to get me the rest of the way. Once Chuys moved to its new location it only became a few days away traveling by hot air balloon. I come here often when I can get my hot air balloon to start up. This place is as good as some butternut squash on a hot day. When I come here I try to see how many chips I can stuff in my body before they ask what I want as an entree so that I can leave like the cheapskate that I am. I prefer the creamy jalapeño dip here, it is fantastic. A lot better than the chunky, moldy cheese that I've had in my refrigerator for the past 2 decades :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Chuy's before but just not at this location. We came here on a friday night and there was a 45 min to an hour wait. Eh, ok we will wait. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. They have a nacho bar from 4-7 and it was fantastic. That definitely made time go by fast. We probably waited about 45 mins and got sat at a booth. 

Our server was very nice and gave good ideas on food. Burritos are huge and fantastic. I got the appetizer sampler. It was good. Came with an assortment of food. I noticed I had 1 quesadilla but I saw a picture on yelp for this location that someone got 2. No biggie. Salsa is very fresh. Jalapeno sauce is also good. I already have in mind of what I wanna try. 

I seriously can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay, very small menu, the server lacked enthusiasm and never even told us her name. I had high hopes because I heard good things- but to be honest is was just run of the mill Mexican food.  The only thing I was impressed with was the homemade tortillas but that won't be enough to bring me back. Lastly, I am a wine drinker- only offering Barefoot wine (they have one wine on their menu) that alone was enough to keep me from returning."}
{"text":"Been to the one  in Greenville  but this was nothing like it. Service was slow. Beverage service was slow. Location did not have the fun feel of other places. Food was good though, but our waiter was so bad I would have to give 3 stars. 
Love the Greenville location, you guys should go have dinner there and see what you need to do"}
{"text":"This place was great! I'm actually lactose intolerant, so I had to work around the menu, but the staff was so friendly and helpful. They helped me pick out something that satisfied my tastebuds as well as my diet needs. The chips are great as well!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Chuy's for awhile and after tonight's experience I'm not sure I'll ever come back.  It was busy Saturday night but some reason the pager the hostess gave us didn't work.  After inquiring about our table we found out the pager didn't work.  So the hostess told us to wait even longer.  The bartender...Brian was very nice and helpful.  He even comps us some for waiting.  
After getting to the table our waitress disappeared...and after awhile we decided to leave.  I don't know if the food is any good but the service here is terrible!!"}
{"text":"I've had better food at Taco Bell. I was so disappointed in the food here I don't know where to start. First off the chips were too thin for my taste. It kept breaking every time I tried to get some dip. I got one of the combos that come with chicken. enchilada and chicken chalupa. It looked almost the same as my friend's combo, who had a Taco and enchilada???? If anything my chalupa looked more like a tostada. It came with rice and beans. I told my server that I didn't eat beans he stated he would give me two sides of rice. When the food came I got beans and rice. (Honest mistake, I told the runner that gave us the food. She told me she would bring it out and we never got it) I usually eat all my food...my friend and I ate less than half of both of our foods. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because our server was nice and refilled our cups and chips often. The nacho bar that was included with our meal was nice, though there was only three things to select from. It probably woulda been better to have salsa or hot sauce available at the bar. With that being said though, I also added points for the dips we got at the table (salsa and guacamole). Just for those two points though, I wouldn't come and eat their food again. I might come back for some drinks because they looked good but that's it lol."}
{"text":"I came here twice! The first time was not a great experience. The servers didn't seem focused on working. We saw our server go out to his car with several girls while we were waiting 10 plus minutes for our margaritas. Food was bad, it was cold, dry and my fish was \"fishy\". I was not upset, I understood they could of had a rough night. So I came back to give them a second chance. Once again poor service and poor food. 
Suggestions - Educate and inform staff how to properly run a restaurant. Make sure food is fresh and not dry and pasty. Maybe new management?? I mean idk. I hope others have better experiences."}
{"text":"There is nothing better when you are hungover than chips, salsa, and queso. And a giant Coke. And a nap afterwards. 

This isn't your typical Mexican joint. The decor is wacky. They sell hysterical t-shirts. The place is massive. I'm pretty sure you could play an endless game of hide and seek here. 

The chips are light, the salsa has a kick to it. They have a ton of different sauce options here. I really like the queso. Menu wise, I think I get something different each visit based on what I'm craving. I'm a big fan of the Classic Tex-Mex enchiladas. I mean, how can you go wrong with something covered in chili and cheese? Chuy's also does daily specials and has different drink deals each week night. 

I've always had great service and everyone is so nice here. It's hard not to smile when you're here. It's just a fun and happy place."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night (honestly because we couldn't get into Cowfish) and it was mediocre at best. 

Started off with the house chips and salsa and ordered a side of guacamole. The salsa was too spicy for a house salsa, with lots of jalapeño seeds. The guacamole was flavorless. No flavor what so ever. Squeezed my margarita lime into it and added table salt. Still didn't help.

I ordered the chicka-chicka boom boom per the managers request and enjoyed the boom boom sauce, but that was about it. The rice was dry and the beans bland. Canned beans are better. 

My boyfriend ordered the combination dinner; the sirloin taco meat looked questionable. 

I was expecting this to be a decent Mexican restaurant but it was beyond sub-par. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"As always delicious and nutritious!  Not as busy as expected for a Saturday night with a Panthers Game. Server was very comedic, and attentive. Big as yo face burrito with oven roasted chicken, creamy jalapeño sauce on top...MUST have. Only dislike my lime wedge was cut too big to fit into my corona. I wouldn't  recommend the bar area tables for 3+ people, either. The Sangria my girlfriend had was tasty. I don't know why other tex-mex restuarants in Charlotte even try to compete."}
{"text":"Chuy's texmex food is very disappointing. The food doesn't have any flavor what so ever. I was highly disappointed. I was looking forward to Spanish restaurant near my house, however it was not to my liking. I will not be back here. I have had texmex before but I have never had it before with little to no flavor."}
{"text":"i had heard good things about this place and was excited about its opening near me.  We went when it opened in Dec and had horrible service and food was mediocre at best   i chalked it up to a new opening and figured I would give it settling time.  So we came again tonight.  Waited at least 10 min before being acknowledged.  We were finally brought drinks after 2 servers came to us, 1 beer and 1 margarita.  Took another 5 min and asking where my daughter's coke was before we got it.  Food was ok, not the best but not the worst.  Could have maybe been ok with it and coming back 1 more time.  However, ordered another drink and waited 15 min, 2 servers checking and both said it was coming.  When it was finally brought to me 1 of the servers whispers to me how bad the bartender is and that they are tying to get rid of him.  Proceeds to tell they have had multiple firings for drinking behind the bar.  Needless to say I doubt I will be giving more of my money to this establishment or recommending it to anyone else"}
{"text":"The worst. There quesadilla tortilla shells were made of flat bread, so it was like eating a biscuit with Mexican chicken and cheese. Not good at all. My husband said his food was kind of bland. I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Sadly we won't be back. This place always seemed to have a wait, so we strategically popped in for a late lunch. Upon arrival the hostess seriously appeared as though we were bothering her. She dumped us at a table right in front of the kitchen (seriously high traffic and the waitstaff kept knocking my purse off the back of my chair). We ultimately moved to a booth. The young lady that waited on us was sweet. VERY YOUNG, so I can let it slide that we waited a long time for her to take our order or check on us. (Seriously, we never complain about that either - but it was a noteworthy amount of time between visits to our table). The guy who filled our chips was hysterical. He appeared so angry at everyone and definitely seemed hung over - at one point he literally missed half the basket and chips were all over the table and on our laps. (Nope, he didn't even look at us to notice his mess or our chuckle). The food was fine - came out warm, was seemingly fresh, but a bit sloppy (tacos had cheese, lettuce and such falling out instead of actually just being on the side). Our little guy seriously LOVED the kid mini tacos and he cleaned up the rice and beans too, so that's something. (He never does that). If service was a bit less comically tragic, we'd consider going back - but it's ok, we figure it'll catch up eventually. This place is rocking busy and people won't tolerate that for long before Management catches on. We'll try again in the fall."}
{"text":"4 stars for Great atmosphere!!!!

But overall the food was too SPICY. We actually like hot food ,but this was so hot/not enjoyable, starting with the complementary salsa that comes with the chips on the table. We have eaten at Chuys before, and this was not the same. When we asked for less heat in the salsa, they graciously brought us different sauces that were milder. 

There was WAY too much jalapeño in everything we ordered, except for the guacamole and the kids' meals. But that may just be our taste.

On the bright side: Our waiter was great, and the service was fast. 

The kids loved it too!

My only truly negative comment is that there seemed to be way more hostesses than needed (3+ on a Sunday afternoon) , to the point that they would rather stand around socializing than bring people to their tables. And the girl who originally greeted us was sitting off to the side on a bench with a giant make-up kit, putting on her make up, not even acknowledging guests, when we left. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Im from Texas and never found any good Tex mex food till I came here to chuy's people who say it isn't good it's a huge lie I'm from Texas I know the food and this place to the best"}
{"text":"Good run of the mill Mexican food-tried this location instead of Southpark. Same great chips and salsa. The staff was a bit harried but, they just opened so....

Outdoor area to sit and eat/drink. Located in the Waverly complex-this will be a mad house in a few years. Parking lot with multiple other shops and restaurants and apartments."}
{"text":"We came here about a month ago. I didn't feel that the interior of the restaurant matched the exterior. That is, the restaurant looks really nice on the outside, very inviting. However, once inside, felt it was very, well, meh.... The inside is nothing to rave about and they have tried to give an \"outdoor feel\" to being inside. This usually doesn't work. Further, there are pictures on the wall of who-knows-who, and they just seemed really out of place with everything else.

The food was bland. I had the soft tacos and the beef was overcooked. The \"regular salsa\" was scorching hot (way too spicy). Portions were large. Nothing to write home about. Service was good and attentive. Prices were okay. Nothing really special about this place to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I really dig this place! The atmosphere is great - laid back, fun and just makes you feel relaxed... like the first sip of booze after a long day of work  : ) 

The prices are incredible for a place in South Park. Thanks for not price gouging because of your location, Chuy's!

The first time I stopped by I had the Chimy Chimy Bang Bang - quite tasty! The entree comes smothered in bang bang sauce whic is definitely worth asking for a side of even if you don't get this dish. And the jalapeno ranch - ask for a side with your tortilla chips. I'm actually not a fan of ranch (I think I'm the only person to ever say that) but this dip with a bit thicker. Creamier and a smooth, cool flavors. 

Awesome side note, go Monday thru Friday during the week between 4 and 7pm - free queso car! Complete with several salsas, yellow queso, black beans and ground beef. Yum!"}
{"text":"Good times! Great food. Great service. Got the chicka chicka boom boom and it was all that and more."}
{"text":"Not a fan of it. Never have been and think I will never be. When they opened it. I tried it again and it's just another concept trying to make it big with no vision. The tortillas are way too thick. The steak tasted cheap. The presentation is not even worth the price. You are better off going to on the border and I won't even recommend anyone going there."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying......  I'm from Texas.  I've been to the original one in Austin and frequently visited the one in my hometown back in Dallas.  Saying this to say that's how much I'm a firm believer of Chuy's.  I love this place.  I can now check off my go-to place for Tex-Mex in the charlotte area. 

Was able to check out Chuy's last night and I was so greatful.  The restuarant is bursting with color.  It's well lit, it's spacious, and they've expanded the patio area in the back.  The reasons why I love Chuy's:

1.  Prices.  My Baja fish tacos (Had grilled shrimp) were $8.99 for TWO and it came with the good'ole refried beans and rice.  That's dirt cheap in South Park.  Other places are $10.99 for two tacos.  They were so good.  Suggest putting them on corn tortillas instead of flour.  What's up with folks putting fish tacos on flour tortillas??  haha!  The food items on the menu are good.  You can't pick a bad dish.  They're all good.  I didn't try them all last night, but I'm confident that it'll be good.  Staff from Texas came here to train the workers in CLT, decorate, and participate so I know that they're really into consistancy across all of their locations.  

2.  It's just a fun, causual, laid back place to eat.  Sure, there are other places around that are prob just as casual, but there's just something about having that non-fluffy stuffy mexican food.  It's just good ole Tex-Mex.  No it's not authentic.  It's Tex-Mex.  

3.  Margaritas.  They're good.  Enough Said.  Well....wait.  I will say that my favorite was the Texas Martini.  It's a margarita but it comes in a martini glass and a huge plastic shaker that you poor yourself.  smh....so you can either go big and just drink the giant margarita from the shaker (lol) or sip and stroll and pace yourself.  Made with Patron and another taquilla.  Well worth the moolah for that Texas-sized drink.  

They have Kitschy-cool decor and it makes no sense but I love it.  There's a salsa bar that's in the back of an old car...i think?  That was funny.  There are pictures of chihuahuas dressed up in people clothes on the walls.  Makes me giggle.  

Give it a whirl.  It's just another place for those in South Park to try if they want some good no-fuss Tex-Mex food.  The guac I was slightly disapointed in.  It's normally flavored more so I'm hoping that works itself out.  The patio is awesome and can't wait to have a Texas-sized margarita on the patio in Clt.

yee-haw!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here a few days ago. We had the fajitas which were amazing. The charro beans were outstanding too. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. The meal comes with chips and Salsa. The chips are light and crunchy and the salsa spicy and tasty. This is the best chips and salsa I have had in Charlotte!

 I ordered the steak burrito which came with charro beans and green chili rice. The chunks of steak was really tender and flavorful. The burrito came with some type of brown sauce on the top and the sides. I think it's some sort of beef broth sauce but it had a nice surprising spiciness to it.   The Charo beans were good and I'm not usually a big fan.  I am well pleased  with the meal.  The portion was big for a lunch selection. It's big even for a dinner selection.

The service was ok. The server did his job. I just didn't think he wanted to be there. He wasn't rude or anything.  Just my opinion.  Everyone's entitled to a bad day.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Some may say that the decor is a bit overwhelming and a sensory overload but that's what I love about it! It's kitschy theme of everything Tex-Mex to Elvis is what makes Chuy's a dining experience unlike any other. 
Ohh yea, the food's not bad either! I ordered the Chica-Chica-Boom-Boom and it was delicious. It had just the right amount of spice and zing. All their entrées are the perfect balance of traditional Mexican with a Texan flair to it. 
I would without a doubt recommend this restaurant to everyone and go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Chuy's is a breath of tex mex air to Charlotte. For over a decade I have pined away for true Mexican food and now I have found it. 
Everything is great here. My current crush is the steak tacos al carbon. If this is your first time here you have to have the fajitas. I also like the flautas. Great kids menu and the patio is heated with TVs. The service is fast and friendly. 
The Perfect Margarita is near perfect -  good amount of tequila."}
{"text":"It's like a greasy Taco Bell, but slightly more expensive. If you want good mexican go to a real mexican restaurant. This is a chain and not a very good one. Nothing on the menu is remotely healthy except maybe the salads. Greasy chips, greasy tacos."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. Fun retro-designed interior, large portions of food. Cool location as well (in the up-and-coming \"Waverly Neighborhood\" by Ballantyne). Food doesn't have a \"wow\" factor but it's still a pretty fun place. I knocked off 1 star for the food being \"pretty-good-not-great\" and the crappy beer selection. Definitely worth going if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The environment is very welcoming and happy. I tried this place because they always bring free food into my work. I absolutely love their salsa! So fresh and spicy! They food is never disappointing. Very good spicy ranch sauce also. Yum."}
{"text":"I love Chuy's.  I like the salsa the best and even come get it for carryout frequently.  It really is one of the best salsas I've tried in a long time.  

I followed this restaurant from South Park to its new Waverly location.  I usually get a la carte tacos because they are the best deal for me, since I don't like beans or rice.  The tacos are really good.  The meat (ground  beef) is full of flavor and the shells are crisp and delicious.  All of the insides are fresh.  

The service is awesome.  The staff greets you at the door and makes you feel right at home.  The restaurant, being brand new, is extremely clean and well organized."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! A friend claimed this was the best Mexican food in Charlotte - and he might be right. 

As soon as we sat down, they served us an endless amount of chips + salsa. The chips were thin and fresh and the salsa had a bit of a kick. We ordered the queso and Mmmm, so good. 

If you're deciding between the house margarita and the Texas martini - go Texas!! Same price and you get much more bang for your buck. 

I was most excited about my main course - the southwestern plate. so good!! A sunny side egg on top of soft blue tortillas filled with pulled chicken pulled chicken, topped  with an impeccable sauce. Comes with rice, beans and a little bit of lettuce. So authentic and fresh!"}
{"text":"Let's say you have four hungry, noisy, picky eaters... This would NOT be the right place to bring them. Noisy is ok, because the acoustics inside made it hard to hear myself think, so kids who squabble, sing, and push each other out of their chairs (we are still talking hypothetically) don't bug any of the other patrons. But someone, and the waitress assured me it wasn't her, couldn't get the orders straight.  On the first attempt, 5 out of 6 of the meals were so wrong they had to go back. It was like they brought the wrong table's grub. Second try, only two were wrong. They got them all right on the 3rd attempt, and comped everything. I think that if we had ordered as is from the menu without all of our hold-the-cheeses, it would not have been a teary disaster.  The food was pretty good when we got it. On weeknights, they have a free nacho bar from 4-7."}
{"text":"Food was good service was not on par the waiter mixed up my wife's and I drinks up she is diabetic can't have sweet tea but easy fix other then that would have gave 5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been here three times.  The food is good, but the service leaves much to be desired.  The second time I came here, our table of 6 waited over 30 minutes to order and then another hour and 20 minutes for the food to come out.  After that experience I vowed to never return.   Two years later, my husband dragged me back stating that they had improved. We came in on a Friday during the lunch hour, the restaurant was barely filled with people. Just like with our other visits, the food was good.  The service was much improved from my last visit, but still slow given how empty the restaurant was. At every point of the process, we were just hanging out waiting for the server to return. Side note, I would not recommend their sweet tea to anyone, it was weak and watered down."}
{"text":"Chuy's is AWESOME!!! Guess what's even more awesome besides the food...THOMAS, one of the servers!

First of all, the decor is fantastic. The hostess was perky and friendly. As mentioned before, Thomas was an incredible server. He made sure our chips were frequently refilled, gave great suggestions, and kept a genuine smile on his face. 

Ok, enough about the cute server. 

The food! It was super delicious! I got the Chuy's special which was composed of blue corn tortillas filled with roasted chicken, covered in tomatillo sauce and topped with sour cream. Delish! The side sauce of creamy jalapeno was also a great addition. I also had a frozen strawberry margarita...it was extra yummy. 

I'm glad Chuy's has arrived. The place is massive, and while I LOVE Cowfish, having Chuy's right beside it as a marvelous alternative is pretty sweet. Not that Chuy's is just an alternative to Cowfish... 

Ok, what are you waiting for? Go! Go! Go!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Charlotte!  

We loved the chicka chicka boom boom. Chips and salsa are delish!  The best Jalepeno salsa on the planet."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Service sucked. Food sucked. I'm usually a very patient patron because I work at a restaurant and I know how things are but this was seriously one of the worst eating experiences I have had. Taco Bell is better than this place."}
{"text":"Zip-A-Dee-Do-Da it's a wonderful day -- the day I stepped inside a Chuy's for the first time! It's colorful and inviting. Our waiter could not have been more upbeat and helpful. They even have a free mother-slapping NACHO BAR!!!! 

The colors and smells and sights, they combine for a delightful time. I went with friends so it was even more enjoyable.

I ordered the Elvis Presley combination and had no idea how giant it would actually be -- not to mention is was only $11 and change.

I almost forgot to mention the amazing ranch/jalapeño dip -- I need an intravenous drip of the stuff because it's THAT good. So, yourself a flavor and find a Chuy's. They're even changing the way I think about chain restaurants -- maybe."}
{"text":"Miss good TexMex places like this from Texas. Any place that makes their own tortillas in house automatically gets a 5-star review from me (unless there's something significantly wrong).

Nacho/Queso bar from 4-7pm for happy hour definitely makes it a bonus for an early dinner."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Chuys in a while. Every time the wait was 45-60 minutes. No more. The place was weirdly empty even though the wait at Cowfish was more than an hour.  We were greeted by a man who said: I have no idea what to do - I'm a busboy. 

Food was ok but service was terrible. Apps and food came out at the same time. And too fast to be fresh. Our waiter was frantic and inattentive. He didn't bring water or napkins. He tried to clear the table while we were still eating. He was fast at bringing the check. He seemed like he just wanted us to get of there. He never offered coffee or dessert. The table next to us had to grab someone from the front to order dessert. 

Won't go back anytime soon - no matter how long the Cowfish wait is."}
{"text":"I'll start off with saying that the prices for the location of this restaurant are outstanding! I went this past weekend with a friend to enjoy sitting outside. The patio was quite enjoyable! 

We started at the bar since the patio was full and I wanted a \"fresh\" mojito. You know the one that doesn't include mountains of simple syrup, etc. The bartender was very accomodating and made me a great mojito! 

Our table was ready in just a few minutes and a nice gentlemen showed us to the patio which I believe was the manager. The service was great all around so that's a huge plus! They give you free chips, salsa, and jalapeno ranch (I believe). They were both great, I loved the spice in the salsa. However, I am giving 3 1/2 stars due to the actual food. The guacamole was just eh and the queso was oily/incredibly salty. The chicken quesadillas were bland and full of cheese. And my least favorite were some sort of chimys. Horribly bland and the sauce ontop was even worse. I really wanted to enjoy this place but maybe I should have gotten something else!"}
{"text":"My family recently decided to try out this new Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa were only ok, not fantastic. 

Sadly, the food was very poor. Nothing special about the dishes we ordered. Our server disappeared for quite some time and we were left thirsty while we waited. We wanted some more chips and my son finally went to get them for us.

I faced some challenges since I was a vegan/vegetarian and asked for the vegetable burrito without the tortilla. The quantity of vegetables was tiny and I left hungry. One son ordered a combination platter of a variety of offerings. He did not enjoy any of them. The best part was that this place was close to home so there wasn't a long drive and the drink special was a margarita. I think the drink price was good.

We do NOT want to ever return. My older son said that his friends are not picky and love the quantity of food at cheap prices. We are more inclined to eat less and prefer tasty food.

Oh, I almost forgot, they have very creative ceiling details and strange paintings of dogs everywhere too."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place.  Honestly, the only reason I gave it two stars is because the queso dip was very good. The chips were overly salted even for my wife who usually puts salt on EVERYTHING.  Also, the waiteress kept bringing more chips in this giant scoop and each time spilled about half of them onto the table.  I make a big enough mess without the waiteress helping.

My wife had the quesedilla.  It was served as what looked like 4 minature tacos.  Which would not be bad, except that the tortillas were oily and flavorless.  My wife said the chicken and cheese was just OK.

I had chile rellenos with shrimp and cheese.  The breading didn't stick to the chiles and the chiles were too crunchy.  The filling was just OK.  To be honest, I would have just preferred to have a plate with just the filling."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I love free things... You know what's better, though?  When the free stuff is delicious... 

Apparently, Chuy's has the happiest of happy hours... Why?  From 4 until 7 on weekdays, inside their pretty, pretty locale is a trunk of a car... Inside that trunk?  Chips, queso, ground beef, refried beans and various salsas... FOR FREE... What's that you say?  Yep... In addition to their tasty drinks (which also have daily specials), they give you some delicious nacho components on the gratis tip... Love it... The chips were light, but didn't get soggy under toppings... The salsas weren't really spicy, but they have hot sauce if you want it... The ground beef had a good seasoning without being salty and the queso was super tasty... The beans tasted like refried beans... 

We tried the frozen and rocks version of the Chuy's Classic Sangrias and they were both delicious... Not too strong, but you knew what was in there...

My favorite part, though?  Next to the nacho car is a small sink... You can wash your hands right there!  That makes my heart light... I mean, how much easier can you make it for people? Fabulous... I do think they should put a little more distance between the nacho trays and the sink, though, because they're right next to it... Maybe move the upside down salsa bowls over instead so people that don't dry their hands with the available paper products don't shake their leftover water into the nacho trays?  And add a little trash can next to the side... I had to bring my paper towel with me to the bar... Someone could have taken it to empty and forgot to bring it back, though... 

Overall, it was fantastic, though... I can't wait to go back and try more things here!"}
{"text":"Cheap forgettable food in a loud, bright atmosphere. A fork and knife in  paper bag on your table. Service is what you would expect from an overworked staff. Our waitress was pleasant but hard to find when you wanted something. The chips are tasty but so thin its impossible to dip any guac with them. The salsa is more of a Pico De Gallo than salsa you may be used to. It's fresh, tasty and has a nice little kick from fresh minced chilis. For my dinner, the beef burrito was more beans than anything else. The side of rice was dry and tasteless. I ordered a beer and I was brought a can and I had to request a glass. Maybe an ecomical fun place for a family with several kids? If your idea of a good restaurant is On The Boarder (which is much better in my opinion) or IHOP, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I hate to say this, but this wasn't something to write home about. The chip bar never got refilled and I had to ask the bartender for some more which he brought it to me in a scoop. While the queso was  good, that's all I got that was redemptive. The tacos were good but way overpriced, as was my $5 beer. The service was a tad spotty as well. Won't be back."}
{"text":"For the people that give Chuy's anything less than 4 stars for the food can you please tell me where you will find better TEX-MEX anywhere along the Eastern Seaboard? I went 1 time last week when I was in town for business and this location could thrive in Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio or any other hardcore Tex-Mex competitive city. The service was great and so was the food."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time. It was really good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Been to Chuy's three times now. For the most part pretty standard fare for a TexMex place. Good portions on each plate. Can't tell much difference in the two rice options. The chicken is actually kinda bland in the flautas. The nachos are really good because they are not just chips tossed on a plat but rather they have attention placed on each one. The Boom Boom sauce is excellent. My biggest downside is that the last two times we've been there we had the same server and he is extremely lackluster and doesn't pay much attention to his customers. He's walked away from me twice as I was making a drink order and trying to ask for more salsa but he didn't hear because he was walking away from me. I'd definitely want a different server if I went back. Decent place and always busy but not the best Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Chuy's.  Bri was our server and she did a great job.  I was very impressed with the entire staff.  The place was very busy, but we didn't wait for a booth. When a party left the staff quickly turned the table around for the next party.  We were regularly visited by Bri and other staff dropped by to make sure everything was okay.  This seemed like a well run operation. 

This is a family restaurant.  Our party was much older than the typical patrons, but that was not a problem.  

The restaurant is surprisingly large in size and is divided into several sections.  Maximum capacity was posted at around 287, as I recall.  They have a large outside open porch/dining area that would have been great if it hadn't been so cold.  Maybe next time.  

I ordered the No 5, which was a chalupa and enchilada, with rice and refried beans.  There are no photos of the dishes, so I ordered strictly by the written description. When it arrived it looked like the sort of dish I would not have typically ordered, but it was fantastic.  Our party also ordered two servings of fajitas and one cheese and bean burrito.  We were all very pleased with the meals.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Go for the margaritas. Stick to the margaritas. Nibble on the chips and salsa. Come back home.

Somehow, I always stray from that plan AND regret it. The food is well, it's Tex-Mex chain food. What do you expect?

The service is good and the salsa bar at Happy Hour doesn't hurt. In fact, I bumped up the rating to a three star thanks to the staff and the free salsa bar."}
{"text":"I just came from one of the worst Southpark dining experiences I've ever had. Actually when I heard that Chuy's was coming to town I was a little surprised; when you think Southpark, Chuy's isn't exactly what I would have in mind. Don't get me wrong, the food was good (Maverick's is better) - service was as well as could be expected given the crowd and how patrons were stuffed into dining rooms like sardines; Chuy's is reminiscent of the restaurant at South of the Border off interstate 95...I swear I was looking for Pedro! This restaurant is definitely geared towards the minivan generation...cheap eats! But don't let the inexpensive menu fool you...it comes at a price. My ears are still ringing from the noise level; kids running around unsupervised and harried servers trying to navigate around kids and overcrowded dining rooms. Given the history of this location (at least four other restaurants have come and gone) I hope that cheap, loud dining will survive in Southpark...if not, I pity the next restaurant that has to redecorate."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by our first visit to Chuy's in Waverly.   We waited 55 minutes to be seated ( 4 adults,1 child) after being told 30 minutes to start off. Then when we were finally seated we waited 15 minutes until the waitress even came up to take her drink order.  Next, salsa was delivered with no chips and we had not received the drinks yet they arrived about five minutes later.  The waitress then took our order and brought the wrong queso about five minutes later that we sent back.  When the food finally arrived 45 minutes later it was cold and one of our party's salad was not served with the others... We addressed this with the waitress. While we were waiting for her food to arrive about 10 minutes later the waitress comes back and says that she's told the kitchen three times that she was missing the Grilled Chicken Salad but they still have not made it for her so she was sending the manager to our table.  When he arrived he had salad in hand and did not apologize for such the delay.  Very poor service....oh yeah and we had to ask to receive silverware twice.   We will not return"}
{"text":"The remodeling job was excellent, you definately could not tell what it was previously and there were no reminders of zink... that was about it. We went close to their grand opening so it was overly packed... we sat near the bar and had people around us all the time, leaning on our chairs, squeezing by, kids running around the table... we forgave all that since they are new but the food was extremely disappointing. I ordered something that reminded me of Lean Cuisine's Chiken Enchalada Sauza... sadly the LC version is much better than what I received. Hardly any chicken, the chicken had ZERO flavor and NO seasoning.. the sauce was ok.. but that was my entire dish... the hand made tortillas were the main part of the dish... fBF had some massive combo plate... it was basically different meats/lots of cheese/tortillas smothered in sauces.. he said it was ok. We both decided that was our first and last visit. Our impression is if you have kids and want to go out someplace they enjoy and eat the food, this is your place. If you want good tex-mex and to enjoy a meal, this isnot."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience at Chuy's. We went at an off time, but the bartender was incredibly friendly, my margarita had a nice kick, and the nachos were delicious. I have to come back for a full meal, but I definitely know I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Chuy's where have you been all my life!!??

I'm not typically one to get all hype about a chain restaurant, especially one that has been so overly exploited and commercialized..BUT I have to say it is with great cause that Chuy's has become a household name.

We had a party of 6 on Saturday night and arrived around 6:30 so as expected, we had a long wait.  The outside area has plenty of places to sit while you wait (because you WILL wait) so if it ever stops raining in Charlotte you should be  relatively comfortable while you wait to be seated. 
  It was an hour, not a minute more or less.  The bar area is small and it is pretty challenging to find a spot to stand without creating a major traffic jam but we found a little corner conveniently located by the salsa bar.  Naturally we helped ourselves to a basket of chips and salsa while we waited and that made everything all good.  In fact, the salsa was so good it just got me even more excited about what was yet to come.  The chips were thin and greasy but I will overlook that for now.

My immediate response to the interior was \"WOAH\"...it was busy, it was bright, it was confusing!  There just seems to be a lot of patterns and colors going on at one time.  The layout of the restaurant seemed a little awkward and even somewhat different from Zink (restaurant there prior).  I guess in the scheme of things it doesn't matter but it just seemed like a poor use of space.  There were too many walls and random tables here and there...no method to the madness, or so it seemed.  I didn't get to check out the outside patio but I am happy they have one!


Once we were sat we asked for a dip that was not offered on the front-end by our waitress.  One of my friends is currently living in Texas so he knew to ask for the verde salsa which was almost like a ranch dressing.  I am glad he was with us because otherwise they had plans on keeping me from this heavenly goodness that I very much needed!!  

We all ordered something different...HUGE burritos, tacos, chalupas, quesadilla's, etc.  I ordered the soft tacos with fajita chicken which came with homemade flour tortillas, charro beans and jalapeno rice.  It was awesome!!  The tortillas were fresh and fluffy and not falling apart...The chicken was juicy and was actually a plump piece of meat as opposed to a shriveled up piece of grilled sodium.  The condiments were fresh and full of flavor.  Everything really was VERY good.

I don't know how they do it but they truly set themselves apart from the traditional Mexican or tex-mex places we have around here.  They definitely gained a new fan.  I hopped right on the bandwagon with no reserve whatsoever.

The only thing that concerns me is the location and the tendency for them to stay packed all the time like cowfish.  When I want a quick Mexican meal I typically want to just bum around and go walk in, get seated right away and have my food come out before I finish ordering.  But this will take some getting used to.  There will be a lot more effort and drama to get to eat here and I don't know that I would personally make the effort on a regular basis but we'll see!"}
{"text":"It was OK... not rave-worthy. I tried their Baja taco and it wasn't that good, there was no sauce or maybe my waiter didn't offer it. Oh well... The decor just meh. It made me feel like I was in Monkey Joe's, and have kids crying and throwing stuffs didn't help my situation either. Overall I'm going to stick with my regular visit to Cabo, since I think it suits my taste (no pun intended lol)."}
{"text":"Retro, energetic and fun. Chuy's is a blast from the past. 

Kara, our server, was very good and patient with us newbies. The Chips and salsa starter is pretty tasty. The chips were warm and very light. And the salsa has a nice little kick. 

I was hungry so I went with the chicken burrito. With burritos, you can pick your sauce. I'd sugguest taking the sauce your online ahead of time so you don't hold others in your party up. There are several, maybe five or six to choose from. Kara had to help me.  I went with the deluxe tomatillo sauce. Excellent choice. It was a creamy white sauce; I wasn't in the mood for a red sauce after salsa. 

Burritos are HUGE! They come with a choice of rice. I selected Mexican rice. The dish was very tasty. It was just too large even for my hunger status. I probably finished about 3/4 of it before waving the white flag."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is worst ... we had bug on our place ... manager came and he is like because door is open it come in ... so just be careful about the service"}
{"text":"Waited forever for people who came in after me to get seated. The hostesses are idiots very disorganized. There were four of them who sat around and socialized and texted rather than seat people. Food isn't very good either. Would never come back or recommend."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love Chuy's! It is our go to lady's lunch location. Granted she is 4, but that can be a great compliment from a toddler. :-) The stacked enchilada is great. I like to order extra verde sauce on the side because it's so good. Queso is tasty and of course the fresh made tortillas are a treat! The kids meals come with a push pop, which while my daughter loves, she still likes the queso and tortillas best! I think it's the only restaurant in the area that comes close to authentic Tex-Mex. We moved from Texas a year ago, so it was a welcomed find!"}
{"text":"Nice new Mexican place in the south park with reasonable prices.  

The place is brightly colored and bigger than it looks from the outside entrance.  The place is still finding it's stride as there was some confusion between hostesses and wait staff.    The outside patio is really nice is the weather is cooperating. 

Their two salsa's with the chips were great. Spicy Red salsa and a creamy white spicy salsa. 

Coming Colorado, I crave a good green chili.  So far i haven't found anyplace that can compare to local west chili's, but this place green chili sauces were still good.  I have the deluxe chicken with their green chili sauce.  It has some neat heat and flavor, but I'm picky with my chilies.

The appetizer sampler was pretty big and offered a good sample.  Also, get the house margarita if its a Tuesday.  ( its on special.)"}
{"text":"Dinner with family, for some reason I couldn't convince them to go to our usual taco place. So we thought we'd give Chuy's a try.

The chips and salsa were quite good. Not a puree of tomatoes, there were actual pieces in there. A bit wet, so it's drippy. We also got an order of guacamole to go with it. It arrived in a medium sized bowl and it looked like a lot. Until we got near the bottom and discovered that it was sitting on a small nest of shredded lettuce. Oops. The chips were hot and fresh. Thinner than I'm used to, they had a habit of breaking off in the guac.

Deep menu of burritos and tacos and salads with Mexican beers, sangria and margaritas. When I cut into my \"chicken\" burrito, it turned out to be beef. The waitress was most apologetic and offered to replace it (she said the kitchen made it wrong even though she ordered it right) but it was good so I stuck with it. My daughter had the Elvis special which is a bucket load of food. Unless you are a serious eater, I'd recommend you move on to something else. My wife had the chicken taco salad which of course comes in a massive fried tortilla shell.

The music and noise in the restaurant is extremely loud. The pictures on the wall and the angles of the walls do nothing to absorb sound at all.

They say it's TexMex, but I dunno. It just seemed like fancy Mexican to me.

Parking isn't easy but it's doable. Try the parking deck for Southpark if it's legal."}
{"text":"I cant say enough great things about this place. It is often super packed, so come early. I love the free queso chips and taco meat that they offer during the week from 4-7.  The Jalapeno ranch is great.I have found that it is on the bar in Texas, however you must request it at the Charlotte location.  We always ask for the waiter Cam. He is excellent!  I have had the flautas and shrimp tacos. I really enjoyed the flautas more. I am looking forward to trying more things on the menu.  This is our go to Friday night spot."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and service.  This is our local go to place for good Mexican.  The chips were thin n crispy with delicious salsa.  We always get the queso with ground beef to have with our chips as well.  I highly recommend the fajitas and chicka chicka boom boom enchiladas. Side note, if you like slightly spicy ask for a side of jalapeño ranch.  You can eat this with chips or with your meal.  I wish they sold bottles of this deliciousness!  The perfect margarita was exactly that, perfect.  We had one lime and one mango.  Lastly everything is fresh and waiter was very attentive.  He was working quite a few tables but he moved quickly and stayed on top of things.  Manager stopped by all tables to make sure everything was ok.  Very nice gesture."}
{"text":"We visited Chuy's the first week it opened and they were still working through the kinks.  Service was slow and food was kind of blah.  We have visited several times since and have been more impressed with each visit.  Seating was prompt and service was awesome.  The food has been delicious, and we always leave stuffed!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting at all! The decor is very funky, odd decorations all over the walls, each room has a different \"theme\" I'd guess you could say. Paradise style room, hub-cap room, famous Mexicans (im guessing by their pics - don't know who they are though) room, etc.  They have kind of 50's style tables and chairs. 

The food was quite pretty tasty - great salsa!! For drinks I had a margarita, quite good but nothing special. This place is really about the décor and atmosphere, not so much the food.

Best Tip about this place: in the foyer look up!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people like this place. There wasn't anything wrong with the service but the food was awful. Very weird... Especially the salsa and sauces."}
{"text":"Everything is nice, clean, the people are friendly and the food is great! What a combination! I'm so glad they decided to move to Waverly it's just another great meal we can look forward to."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm not sure that some of the other reviewers actually ate in the same place I did but I had a great time here and the food was really good. Starting out with the chips, they do it right. Nicely salted to a point where you will always ask for another basket. The people were great, welcoming and happy. But the one thing that will really get your attention is the ceiling which depending on which room you go into has so many wonderful things tacked on to the ceiling. Hubcaps in one, cameras in the other and then of course there is  . . . Elvis!"}
{"text":"After moving to North Carolina from Texas, my husband and I decided to drive four hours to chuy's for our wedding anniversary dinner. It was a favorite of ours back in Texas. 

Although the food was probably five stars, the waiter was a negative five. We sat down and he said what do you want to eat and drink? And I was like can we have second to order. He literally came back a minute later and asked again. We ordered an app and our dinner. He didn't explain the menu when I asked a question. We ended up ordering a salad dressing for our enchiladas because he was pushing. 

When we were almost done with our food he took away our plates and put the check on our table. Keep in mind we are the only table with people in the whole section. We were close to the kitchen and he went and high fived the manager. The manager said \"wow that was fast.\" And he replied \"what can I say... I have talent.\" No sir you're lazy and pushed us out of your restaurant and we will not return. Thanks for ruining our experience and anniversaries dinner. 

Circling your patrons to make them feel uncomfortable and leave is rude and messed."}
{"text":"Brittany behind the Bar was fantastic.  She made great recommendations on different margarittas and even gave samples until we found something to our liking.  The Baha Fish tacos were great as well as the chalupas were excellent.  Other than a short wait we had a great time, great music and the Best bartender and service."}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte from Dallas-Forth Worth, TX and discovered they had Chuy's! My short time in Texas I fell in love with Tex Mex from all the spices and heat in the food. I've visited their Arlington & Fort Worth Texas locations and they both fall on the same level with this location.

The service is great! I've never ran into any bad servers or any missed items.

While I have only sat at the bar at the Fort Worth location, they were extremely friendly even though they were getting ready to close at the time I went.

The food. That is what it is all about. You HAVE to get boom boom sauce. You can add it to anything for only $1 and it is amazing. I don't know what is in it (nor do I want to because I'm sure it isn't all that good for you...haha) but it is like a spicy cheese dip sauce. Every item I've ever ordered was great quality. I recommend the fajitas burrito, the Chica Chica boom boom, or the Elvis Presley. 

Lastly, the environment is lively and upbeat which wraps this package into a 5 star rating for me!"}
{"text":"I was so excited that this restaurant opened. I heard a lot of good things about it. The first few weeks after they opened there were long waits.   After finally eating there I don't know what the hype is all about."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food and restaurant experience ever. I could buy microwave or Taco Bell that is better. Staff has no management direction. Pitiful. Do not know how these people are in business. I honestly tried to think of a worse experience and could not come up with one!!! Awful, pitiful, untrained and unprofessional staff!!!!"}
{"text":"Being from Texas and having lived in Austin for years, I can say that Chuy's Tex-mex is legit. Handmade tortillas, queso compuesto and a variety of unique sauces for enchiladas (or chips!) are the pillars of its greatness. And don't forget amazingly fresh tortilla chips and salsa and of course, the dot and swirl margaritas! Stop by weekdays from 4-7 to enjoy the free queso bar- you won't regret it! The fun atmosphere and funky decor works for date night, family night or any night!!"}
{"text":"Im a fan more so of the playful vibes this place gives off  versus the food! The area first of all let me say is everything where it's located.The bright colors on the outside draws you to want to come in and try it out so i did. Im giving up on eating out at Mexican restaurants that aren't  authentic, i wanted to give it another try. Staff was more than friendly but i don't feel like this is a place i would frequent again. I ordered the chicken stuffed avocado. Pretty tasty it was but it left this weird after taste in my mouth. Would recommend anyone to at least give them a try for i only tried one dish and again it was great but wasn't authentic."}
