{"text":"Looking for butter chicken? There is no better place to go! I'm a huge fan of naan bread and sauce and hands down, this place has it perfect! Make sure to check out the garlic naan!"}
{"text":"Great food, and the place looks great inside.  Reasonably priced.
They also have a private booth (cool) and mezzanine level for larger groups.
Staff is great too.
Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"I went to this place for my boyfriend's birthday. The decor is very elegant, and the food is even better! It's not too pricey for its quality. The service was nice. I recommend the Onion Bahjee for entree!"}
{"text":"Dark and swanky. Large patio out front. Overall a nice vibe. Food was better than average, I should have asked them to take the heat up a notch or two. Curry vegetables were the highlight for us. Papadum is unique and delicious, en gratis!  I'd count on 25-30$ a head."}
{"text":"Atma is what happens when Indian cuisine and SoBe decor collide - very trendy but not over-the-top. Whoever put this place together deserves a pat on the back. 

It's cozy but has an exotic flair to it. Shaped like a shotgun, there's a mezzanine at the end. Candles dot the tables and the India-specific decorations are kept to a minimum in an effort to keep the place as relaxed as possible.  An excellent date place, by the way. 

The service is typically good, and the food is more or less all done right. All the usual staples are there, and there are no weak spots on the menu. The cooks are very competent. 

Prices are average - whatever a typical Indian restaurant is plus a 30% premium for the decor and ambience, which is probably worth it. 

A solid 4-stars."}
{"text":"This place is a gem that is hidden in the busy St-Laurent Blvd .
A rare combination of great authentic Indian food with fancy ambiance ."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, nice decor! I love going here for a romantic date night, or even a group dinner.  They are very accommodating no matter if you are a few or a lot of people.  If you are in the mood to try something new they are also great at recommending some delicious things to try. Always happy when I go there."}
{"text":"Best butter chicken in town!! Definitely the best Indian food in town!"}
{"text":"I've been to Atma quite a few times and can definitely say the restaurant is a jewel.

First off, it's vertically spacious which reduces the heat and noise levels. Its decor is simple and very discreet, so you can actually focus on your party and your food.

The menu caters to all tastes, though I believe the vegetarian part relies too much on dishes with a mushed consistence. I have always had excellent experiences with Atma and will be returning as often as I can.

Why not 5 stars?

1)  When they are busy, the service and food can be pretty slow. It's obvious, but when the delay becomes noticeable to a reasonable guy it's a bit too long. 

2) Our party of 4 once ordered several Madras dishes and they were nowhere close to the spiciness of a Madras. The same dish on other occasions was, instead, enough to make a pepperhead like me sweat. 

I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. For the time being the 5th star is in the works."}
{"text":"Really cool decor, food is served on beautiful traditional dishes. The street outside is very busy so patio might not be the best place to have a conversation - the interior decor is worth a see anyways (but you should make a reservation for that, they did get very busy when we went for  dinner). Lighting is dim."}
{"text":"Considering the Indian options in Parc-Ex, Atma is not my first choice for Indian in Montreal. I came here with two friends last week for a casual dinner. First of all, the ambiance may work for some people but for me it was very off putting- the lighting was so dim I wondered what they were trying to hide. Also, the pillows on the banquette were disgusting. The zebra- printed plush cases don't seem to have been washed in decades. Onto the food- the chana samosa is good and as expected. The Chicken Madras was fine but not the best I've had- could have greatly benefited from a squeeze of lime and some coriander. The palak paneer was decent. However, we requested the food be prepared 'properly spicy' and it really wasn't- it also didn't help that the waiter asked maybe five times if the food was spicy enough. Skip the naan- way overpriced and not great.  

While Atma is passable, I would not recommend it given the other dining options in the area. And please, turn up the lights!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Summary:
Service - extremely poor
Food - good
Ambiance - good

I brought my family to Montreal for the first time and we decided to go to Atma for dinner. We made online reservations for 8 pm for a party of 6 people.  We arrived at the restaurant promptly at 7:55 pm and were told by the owner that it was a busy night and we would have to wait 20 minutes to be seated.  25 minutes passed and I asked the owner/attendant for an update.  He said it would be another 10 minutes.  I advised him that our reservation was for 8 pm and he just told me its a busy night and he can't 'ask people to leave'. We contemplated on going to a different restaurant, but thought 'let's just wait another 10 minutes or so'. 
By the time we were seated, it was 8:50 pm, and it was 9:05 by the time someone took our order. We ordered appetizers and mains. We noticed that two other tables which were seated after us had already started receiving their food.  At 9:45 I asked the owner why our food is taking long, and just said it's a busy night.  Only when he went to the kitchen area and asked about our appetizers, is when they brought out all the food at once.  
So by now it's almost 2 hours since our reservation was made and we are just starting to eat now.  Not only did they bring the food all at once, they also forgot a side which we had ordered.
This was by far one of the most unpleasant experiences at a restaurant that I have had.  The owner not once took ownership of the fact that he had taken on more reservations than he could handle.  He also was to occupied socializing with regulars and paying very little attention to other customers.
As for feedback for the owner:
-Please try to be as honest as possible when advising customers on how long a table will take.
-be cognisant of how many reservations you can handle
-show compassion and sincerity when an error has been made on your part
Though the food was good, the service left a bad taste in my mouth.  At the end of the night, they offered us complimentary dessert, however at that point it was too little too late. My family and I were pretty upset with this being our first dining experience in Montreal.  I would not recommend this place to my friends or family."}
{"text":"I knew I was going to love this place when I saw the dome -shaped doorway. This restaurant is sexy, and my wife was there which makes it extra sexy (Give me my brownie points). 

My wife and I went here for our 5th year anniversary and we absolutely loved this place. I say it's sexy, because thats the best way I can describe the ambiance. The lighting was nicely dim, the background music was smooth indian music, the beautiful ceiling drapings in the bar area and the covered candle made this place very romantic. It was the perfect place for our anniversary.

The service was great. The waiter was very attentive. He answered all our questions and even gave us suggestions on what to order. He was very friendly, and he made sure that we were taken care of. 

Now lets talk about the most important part of going to any restaurant, the food.  When I first got there, I remember seeing someone else order something that was sizzling that got me super excited, so we decided to order the same. So for our appetizer we had the \"Lamb Sheek Kebab ($10)\" and Naan Bread ($4). The Sheek kebab was DIVINE. The spices were perfect. It also came with sizzling veggies with FRESH  coriander.  The Naan bread was really good too.

  For the entree, My wife ordered the \"Bhoona\" ($14), which is Curry lamb with fresh onions, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger simmered thick sauce. I ordered the \"Lamb Korma\" ($16) which is boneless leg of lamb marinated and cooked in a cream sauce with nuts, exotice spices and garlic. Both entrees were amazing. The Lamb Korma was my favorite. It was just bursting with flavor. The lamb was perfect and the portion sizes were generous.

I can go on and on about how good this place is. I'm very happy we decided to go here for our 5 year anniversary.  The food is great and the prices are reasonable.  Please keep this place open and check this place out. Your tummy will thank me later!"}
{"text":"Excellent indian food, delicious okra and nam with spinach and cheese. We went there a few times the food is consistently good!
Service is discreet but attentive. Atmosphere is very nice, candle light. Will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"I tried indian food a couple of years ago, a restaurant on jena talon road and was very disappointed, from the service to the food, and left saying never again.. but being so in love with indian culture, i went to Atma for my 1year anniversary with my bf. The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere, the decor is beautiful and classy, candlelit tables and romantic vibe and you feel welcome from the beginning. We ordered two cocktails that were deliciousssss! And the food didnt disappoint. We had the dal and veggie soup, the butter chicken and the chicken curry with the simple rice and naan bread. Very kind service and informative. LOVED IT"}
{"text":"Don't get me started on how rich and creamy the butter chicken is - SOOO good!

The restaurant has really nice decor and has a romantic ambience - dim-lighting, cozy seating, and candle-light on the tables. Most tables are for 2-4 people, but they have really cute booths for larger groups. 

We ordered garlic naan bread,  butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, pillau rice, cucumber raita, and mango chutney. They served us papadum to start, which was yummy and helped open our appetite.

I HIGHLY recommend the garlic naan, butter chicken, pillau rice, and cucumber raita. This combination was SOOOO delicious! My boyfriend and I still crave this creamy and flavourful butter chicken till this day (and it's been a few months). The chicken tikka masala was a little on the drier side and was not as flavourful. Also, the mango chutney was a little too sweet for our liking.

Service was really good, super friendly but a little on the slower side. As for pricing, it was reasonable (~$25-$35 per person).

Tips: Make a reservation beforehand because they do get busy for dinner. Also, ask the server if the food you ordered is enough - he recommended that 1 pillau rice was enough for the both of us and was right!"}
{"text":"Excellent, tout simplement.

De l'extérieur, le restaurant ne paye pas de mine, on peut passer devant sans même le voir. Par contre à l'intérieur la déco est très soignée, c'est très joli et le cadre agréable.

Les entrées et les plats sont vraiment délicieux et tout est très copieux (attention surtout sur les entrées qui sont trop copieuses pour une personne). Heureusement nous avons pu emporter ce que nous n'avons pas réussi à manger ;-)

Le service est efficace et aimable, toujours arrangeant à toutes nos demandes. Un petit oubli lors de la commande s'est transformé en petit dessert offert pour se faire pardonner. Top !

Aucune critique à faire, merci !"}
{"text":"On my first visit to Montreal, I decided to take my family here after reading yelp reviews.

Unfortunately our experience was worse so far.

The food was tasteless and the owner is super rude guy. Everything's overpriced and portions were ok. Overall I would not go here again neither recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and let me just say, the food is amazing. The 3 stars is based on service only. 

The first time we were there, there was a younger guy who appeared to be in charge. He was very friendly and while sometimes seemed negligent, we figured he was just trying to do too many things at once. 

The second time we went, there was an older man in charge and service was terrible. We had to wait 15 minutes just for someone to come to our table. Being a birthday dinner that we wanted to enjoy, we started by ordering an appetizer and drinks. The server (same older man), told us that they were super busy so if we don't order our food now, not to complain about having to wait a long time. I thought that was a rude way to put it, but we took his advice and ordered. 

Overall it was a good evening and the food was great, but unfortunately the pompous and unpleasant attitude of the man in charge made it impossible to enjoy 100%. We would have loved to have any of the other staff attend us, as they all seemed incredibly friendly and far more competent than the guy in charge."}
{"text":"I went with my sweetheart and we had a lovely time. I enjoyed the food very much and the service was prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"Solid indian food.  I'm a weekly consumer of Indian in NYC, and my fiance is of Indian descent - we both thought it was good.  Vindaloo had great heat to it when we asked for it extra spicy, malai kofta balls were very well done with plenty of gravy.  Service was nice and prompt.  It was so dark that it was hard to read the menu, but in general pleasant ambiance."}
{"text":"Super bel endroit! Lumiere ultra tatisée, musique envoutante... Idéal pour une date..

Portions petites donc finalement ca peut revenir cher meme si les plats ne semblent pas l'etre individuellement."}
{"text":"Location: On the main, corner Rachel. Street parking is available (metered) but check to see what the restrictions are. I think Mon-Wed the meters stop at 6pm but I'm not sure. If you're using transit, you can take the subway and either get off at St. Laurent (green) or Mont-Royal (orange) and walk over. You can also take the #55 bus up St. Laurent. In my experience, parking during the week is OK if you get there around 5-7pm but of course, no garanties.

The place: I got take-out, but the space looked quite nice. Very simple decor, and looked spacious (as in your neighbors aren't sitting in your lap).

The goods: I only got the Butter Chicken, which was, in a word, awesome. The chicken was all breast and so tender that I didn't need a knife to cut through it. It literally cut itself. The butter sauce was incredibly flavorful but not too creamy like some other places, where it's super thick. Not too sweet and not too spicy (pretty sure you can modify the heat factor but I forgot to ask). The rice was perfectly cooked - not starchy at all. 

Service: N/A - I got my order and paid. No issues. 

Price point: If I recall, the dish was $16. I think it's a little steep for the portion, however personally, I was full by the time I finished. Not to mention that this was the sh*t!

I'll definitely return to dine in-house"}
{"text":"The food here is quite solid Indian food. It may not be exceptional, but I really enjoyed everything. The mango lassi was particularly good. I also really liked the atmosphere. It was a bit fancy, but not stuffy or overdone and felt more modern than many Indian places. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Indian with a twist! One of the coolest spots on st Laurent. As soon as you walk in there's a gorgeous long bar where you can wait for a drink before you're seated or actually just grab a seat there to eat if it's packed. They have a little relaxation seat in the window filled with rocks gives a zen feel to the place on busy nights.

Service was great and food was excellent. The samosa was our favourite part it wasn't your average fried 2 piece samosa with a sweet sauce instead it was open faced and was all mixed up with a great sauce. The tandoori shrimp were packed with flavour and spice, if you don't like spicy then I suggest you let them know or pick something else. Butter chicken was great not to sweet and not to tomatoey just right. The lamb korma was perfect they nailed it And of course you have to do the tandori platter it's to good!

Great owner and great servers. If you're looking for a large group area they have a cool seating beside the stairs a big table or at the top of the restaurant they have a spot with large booths where you take your shoes off and walk on to fluffy carpet."}
{"text":"Our food was decent but the service was horrible. Our server was rude, hurried our meal, and gave us a dish we had canceled (and subsequently also charged us for his mistake). We enjoyed our food and had a mediocre bottle of wine, but did not like eating in the pitch black; we probably wouldn't go back based on the poor lighting and poor service."}
{"text":"Atma is really good (Northern) Indian restaurant in a cool neighborhood. A chill atmosphere with great food and attentive service. The place wasn't busy when we arrived, but gradually filled up during dinner. All the Indian menu staples are available, and then some. Get some atchar mango pickles."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I have to say the service and the decor were very exceptional.  We sat upstairs on the couches and ordered a bunch of food.  My favorite dish was the shrimp pakora and the lamb Korma. I definitely will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend for a date night, the food was amazing and the service was great! The ambiance was very relaxed and romantic. I love everything about it :) I would go back again !"}
{"text":"Just to let you know I am a vegetarian.

Our experience was really bad that's when I decided to give them 1 star. Let's start with the good points (as the list is quite small) 

1) The inside ambience was good. That's ALL! Which anyway wasn't even available for us. 

Now bad points-

1) We were unaware that this restaurant requires reservations. So went there walk-in. There were many other groups without reservation too. The owner was adamant that without the reservation, he can only accommodate trespassers side. (Patio) It was chilly and windy, we still said fine as we were hungry.

2) The complimentary papadum took a while to arrive.

3)  After confirming with the server, we ordered chilli paneer thinking it to be curry as it was a part of Main course. But to my surprise it was made indo-chinese and an appetizer size which doesn't go with Naan bread.

4) So with bread we asked if he can get us some spicy curry in Paneer. They had none. So we ended up getting Tarka Dal.

5) We requested everything spicy. But it was tasteless and non-spicy. 

6) The owner by default charged us 18% TIP with the bill. I would be happy to give that if I was happy with them. He is either the rudest person and doesn't care about feedbacks or extremely racist man. He wasn't even curious to know further when he asked how our experience was and I said it was not so good and just Okay! I guess, no room for improvement. 

7) The vegetarian curry portions are too less compared to the price. We were 3 of us and paid 80$ 

8) The worst part is when you request for a curry vegetable and you get to know that none of the vegetables has sufficient amount of curry. It's basically just less or no curry. 

I obviously would not go there back nor recommend my friends."}
{"text":"This is not your typical Indian restaurant. Gone are the red velvet chairs, the bright lights, and the tacky decorations all over the walls that so many of us have come to expect. Atma is the trendiest Indian restaurant I have ever been to. I love the decor. The service is proper. And the food has always been divine.

They have a fantastic upper section that can easily accommodate large groups.

Atma is an experience. Go!"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but this place deserves it. This is the first time I've had good SERVICE in Montreal. Our drinks were never empty. Perfect for any occasion. The patio is beautiful and very casual, and inside is nice enough for a special celebration like anniversaries or dates. The food was amazing and the desserts to die for. Beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Authentic Indian cuisine with a beautiful ambience. The owner was actively involved in taking care of everyone and took the time to talk about his business. He's had the restaurant for 14 years and is still extremely passionate about every detail. Will definitely come back to experience it again"}
{"text":"Who knew Indian dining can be sexy?!  One of my favorite Indian restaurants ever. Truly authentic (I've been to India twice). Food is bomb, decor is rad and super trendy. Indian acid jazz beats set the mood. It's a great place for a date as the music is low and lighting is dimmed accented by candles. Also a nice place for groups as they have a nice little private room at the back that sits about 6 people.  Bathrooms are tiny but cool Indian grafitti on the walls make up for it. 

Id go here every night of the week. Word!"}
{"text":"Shout it out I must: this is without question the best Indian restaurant in all of Montreal.

I have been here many times over the years and always enjoyed this gem of a place. I have been reluctant to write about it because it is a very intimate and sensual place and I mistakenly thought it should always remain a well kept secret; a place that one would only recommend to their close friends.  Especially those who live to dine out.

I reached this conclusion having eaten in many Indian restaurants, running the gamut from the curry joints in Parc Ex, and the slew of hole in the wall places that have sprung up on Blvd St Laurent, and some of the more upscale places downtown. Having tried some of best of Indian restaurants in New York, London and Delhi, Atma is surely competive with these. It is world class.

Attention to every detail makes Atma superb. The atmosphere is classy as you 
can be seated in the dining room where the decor is south beach meets south asia; comfortable and sleek. You may also be seated in the upstairs dining room where you will dine on the floor, on comfy pillows and join the very cool crowd in what could be a dinner party a Raja's crib, perhaps.

You will be served your dinner on authentic metal Indian tableware and white table cloths. The food is presented in beautiful vessels and pans that really increase the eye appeal of your meal.

The menu is extensive with options from most every aspect of the Indian pallete.
The curry dishes can be custom spiced so if you wish to take a capsaicin ride go right ahead, but, you can always put on the brakes and have your food spiced timidly.

The kitchens of Atma are very authentic and the tandoori ovens turn out 
exceptional naan of many varieties and wonderfully tender tandoori chicken, kabobs and shrimp. The Korma of lamb, chicken or shrimp is creamy delicious and brings good Karma. The vegetable dishes are formidable we had the light and cheesy saag paneer and an exceptionally complex eggplant curry.  Atma's chefs use the ingredients that are always fresh,not frozen, which is a practice that needs to be adopted by of a lot of the local Indian places, where the offerings are often highly seasoned splat over rice.

There is a remarkable variety on the menu so you are not stuck in one region's cuisine and at Atma you can take an extensive tour of Indian cuisine.  It is one of the best dining values around considering all the attention to detail provided by owner, Ravi Anand. He runs a very tight ship and you won't be disappointed.  If you want to make the leap to fine dining, India style, Atma is the place."}
{"text":"Updating because Atma is on Foodora now and we are all sick in my house so we made mountains of Indian food come to us to heal us and it did. 

Atma is especially good for vegetarians, feels like there is a bigger range of veggie dishes here than the usual, and plenty of protein options. I forgot to take pictures before ravaging all the containers but we tried samosa chaat (so good), malai kofta (tasty! Like chickpea dumplings), matter paneer (soooo good), rice, and cheesey stuffed naan. 

Even outside of the romantic decor in their restaurant this food is really, really good. It does a number on my stomach but I feel like it's burning the cold out of me and it tastes so dang good it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"We came here with 11 and we were easily accomodated.  The service was fantastic from when we called to make a reservation and they created a pre-fixed menu for us since we are a larger group.  Looking from the street it looks a like a very small eatery but once you walk through the \"shower curtains\", it is pretty spacious for diners.  It also has a full bar so you can enjoy most drinks to meet your drinking pleasure.

The food was very nice, we all enjoyed the pre-fixed set menu.  We had some vegeterians in our large group so they were very accomodating with our pre-fixed menu.  Everyone enjoyed the food, the service and each other's company.  It has a nice booth table set in a corner for a little privacy and think when I return I will see if we can fix maybe 6 of us.  

One of the dishes that I remember very well was the samosas which was the bedding for whole garbanzo beans.  The butter chicken was another good dish to try.  We were not too crazy about the \"donuts\" as they were a little too sweet.  

This is a place to visit if you enjoy Indian food, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great indian restaurant in Montreal, we had various dishes, all were fabulous and very tasty, I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Tried vegetable biryani , shish kabab , rojenjosh .
Not special, I tried better food else where , pricy compared to other .
If you are a group of 6 people , they w put automatically 18% tip."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Indian food. Actually I hated it until I tried this place. The food was delicious. The waiter was very helpful. It's a super chill place, décor is cool... I love it. Minus the dirty martinis. Those were NOT good at all. But hey, you win some, you lose some. The butter chicken was great. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to update to 5 stars! My last review was based on take-out and just had a chance to experience their ambience. Absolutely fantastic service and beautiful interior. Would strongly recommend for anyone looking for quality Indian food!"}
{"text":"Toujours aimé cet endroit. Belle ambiance et nourriture excellente. La section du haut vaut le détour ainsi que le menu à volonté pour les groupes de 10 personnes ou plus."}
{"text":"C'est mon restaurant Indien préféré depuis hier soir ! Super bon, super service et tranquille! Le décor émerge la culture indienne. Le seul hic c'est que j'avais demandé une table en haut et j'ai eu une table en bas. On m'avait conseillé de manger en haut puisque c'est vraiment plus tranquille et c'est plus réservé. Les tables en bas sont un peu trop collé l'une aux autres et bon si tu pèses un peu plus que 190livres tu devrais avoir de la difficulté à te faufiller jusqu'à ta place sur la banquette puisque c'est très serré! Le service est impéccable! Je n'ai jamais eu un service aussi parfait et les serveurs sont toujours poli et souriant! J'avais demandé un plat épicé et le serveur a répondu tout au plus de mes attentes il m'a servi  un plat épicé, il est revenu me voir pour me demander si cela était assez et m'a meme apportez d'autre sauce piquante(j'aime vraiment cela épicé), dans le plat curry avec poulet on a été servi avec générosité des piments fort serrano(je crois je ne suis pas certaine). J'ai adoré! Merci aux cuisiniers vos assiettes sont succulentes! Tu es assuré d'avoir un repas chaud, il arrive et il crépite très fort !"}
{"text":"Cannot get over this place. I would love to stop thinking of this place, but I honestly just can't. The food was so delicious and our waiter was so hilarious and attentive.
It's got an amazing design to it, and manages to feel traditional, indian, but sexy and sophisticated all at the same time.
It's got a nice bar at the entrance, and more intimate seating in the back.
Our meals were both super delicious and I can't wait to go back. Already recommended it to a friend and she fell in love with it too!"}
{"text":"Juste superbe !

Je suis allée au restaurant Atma pour un dîner avec mon entreprise et c'était une excellente soirée. Nous étions installés à l'étage où la décoration est très chaleureuse et intimiste. On doit enlever ses chaussures et les tables sont basses avec de jolies petites banquettes.

Au niveau de la nourriture, c'est sublime. C'est simple, TOUT est bon.

J'ai testé de nombreux plats : poulet tikka, samosa chaat, butter chicken, curry de légumes, baignan bharta (aubergines). Ils étaient tous succulent (mention spéciale au samosa chaat qui est sucré et plein de saveurs).

Jusqu'à présent, c'est de loin le meilleur restaurant indien que j'ai testé à Montréal. En plus de la nourriture qui est excellente, l'endroit est idéal pour une soirée entre amis, ou même un dîner en amoureux."}
{"text":"The food was very good, the service was quick. I could barely read the menu the lighting was so low or see the food I was eating. The decor was very impressive. We almost walked out upon arrival because the host was giving us a hard time about not making a reservation for 3 on a Sunday night, the place was empty. Also we ordered a salad that never came, I meant to check the bill but forgot. All in all, great food but not so friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Service and ambiance cool. For an Indian resto, decor is great!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Très beau décor, par contre service très arrogant dès notre arrivée. Pour avoir essayé la panoplie de restaurants indiens de  parc-extension, du plateau et de south beach, mes papilles  gustatives sont habituées à la bonne bouffe ( et à la mauvaise bouffe indienne).
Donc, notre visite au Atma à bien commencé avec le decor, mais l'acceuil était froid...
Nous avions commandé trois plats distincts, dans l'ensemble les plats étaient quelconques et l'un d'entre eux était infect...

Nous avions demandé si c'étais possible de le remplacer par un autre plat. Par la suite, le serveur est venu argumenter et nous dire qu'en 5 ans cela ne leurs était jamais arrivé. Nous nous sommes senties un petit peu intimidés, finalement le patron à decidé de ne pas nous le charger . 
Sincèrement, si le service aurait été plus chaleureux et personnalisé, cela aurait fait toute la différence"}
{"text":"Samosa chaat in appetizer is a must try if you love spicy food. Its a combination of chick peas and Samosa. Out of the world taste and really loved it. Highly recommended. Butter chicken in main course was good but i was expecting it to be little more spicy and strong i.e. Authentic punjabi style.  Place lives up to its name. The way seating has been planned is also interesting."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place.  The food was good and I would go back for it.  The atmosphere was dark.  A little too dark; we couldnt read the menus.  We were brough minature flashlights to help us out.  Appart from that the decor was quite nice compared to other indian restaurants I have been to.   I would recommend the naan bread; some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Just came back from Atma and my boyfriend and i loved the food!! The service is very good, the staff is really nice, always smiling. We took one entree for two the samosa chaat, it was amazing!!! For the main dish my boyfriend chose the butter chicken and i went for the chicken korma, both were so yummmmmmyyyyy!!! All the flavours and spices wow!! I forgot to mention that when you enter the restaurant, there is a very nice food smell. The ambiance is really nice and it's cozy! I really recommend Atma especially it is your first time trying this type of food, this is the place you should go to!"}
{"text":"Bonne adresse 
Ambiance sympa
Beaucoup de goût dans les plats
Tout le monde à apprécier les différents mets que nous avions choisis"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food, and very helpful and pleasant staff.  Don't miss the butter chicken.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very cute place. You can take off your shoes and sit around a comfortable floor seating. Atmosphere is great. There is so much variety on the menu, especially for vegetarians. Price was not too high. And food was very tasty. I would come back with a group of friends or with a date."}
{"text":"This restaurant is family owned and the cooking is definitely home cooking.  Beautifully decorated (which is quite unique in Indian restaurants), with rounded white walls, archways and great lighting.  The bar is quite cozy and spacious, but you can also reserve these great separate rooms with cushions and sheers, the second floor is where you will find a great big area which can accommodate up to 10 people at a time, others are for 2-6, you must remove your shoes to access the second floor seating.  The food is really tasty and can accommodate newbies as well as experienced Indian foodies, the mulligatawny is the best we ever had"}
