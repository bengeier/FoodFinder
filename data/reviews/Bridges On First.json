{"text":"This place is adorable ...a comfy pub eatery with Wagyu beef burgers and all sorts of fun food combos. I am super excited to try some of the other items in the future (home made tater tots what?!). Tonight we tried nachos, three of the burgers, chicken wings and the salted caramel cheesecake. I can't say enough good things. The burgers are so juicy and delicious! Fries are good. Go hungry because it is a very big burger!"}
{"text":"This place has potential. I went when it had recently opened -within a month I think. The food was good, but the service was really poor. Every stage of the visit took so long. Getting seated, getting water, ordering drinks, ordering food, then finally getting the food-holy smokes, this was the longest wait. The food was good, but it took forever.
This place does advertise as family friendly and it is, sort of. Kids five and up would probably be fine, but any younger would be an issue. The tables are pretty small so items tend to get knocked off. The place is loud and very crowded so there isn't really that easy to have a young kid in there. 
I'll probably give it another try, but I'll wait for a while until they figure out the kinks. Apparently they're getting more fryers soon so the food will come out faster, I guess I'll wait and see. 

tl;dr Food good, service not so much. Only kind of family friendly"}
{"text":"Ok - here's the deal. I really, really, really wanted to like this place. I went to the Black Pig and I LOVED it. I thought Bridgeland absolutely needed a place like this. Alas it was not to be. 

I was so excited to hear that the same ownership was starting up a pub in the neighbourhood. Bridgeland really needs a great casual neighbourhood pub in my opinion. My wife and I went for a couple of cocktails at Cannibale earlier in the evening and thought we would round out the night at Bridges on First afterwards. Our first experience was the smell... I mean it stunk in there - like raw sewage. We asked the server about it and they claimed not to notice, which I found very hard to believe.

The pub is a nice layout with updated decor. One thing I could not help but notice, was the clutter - boxes underneath and near the foosball table, random stuff under the bar. It looks as though the place was starting to give up. I couldn't get past that smell....

My wife ordered a painkiller and I had a pint of the IPA. I had a couple of sips of my beer and my wife noticed something very large floating in my glass. I mentioned it to the server and she kindly asked if I wanted I refill (I lost my appetite by that point).

What a shame - I really, really wanted to like this place. I looked forward to checking it out because of the previous ownership and their fantastic reputation. 

I really hope Bridgeland gets the local pub it deserves and needs...."}
{"text":"I was severely disappointed by the service and the menu. The waitress even acknowledged that she was \"lacking in attention\". The GF on the menu is misleading as they cook everything in the same fryer. (Technically that's not GF). The waitress could only suggest one item on the menu that was truly GF."}
{"text":"It's got potential, but little things need to be addressed.

Co-worker and I went their for a Thursday lunch. Surprisingly, it was quite empty, where the udon noodles spot next door was packed. A minute after ordering my drink, I got to hear from the back, \"Hey! Tell your nephew not to drink all the ice tea!\" That, was hilarious. We ordered a bucket of bacon to start; the waitress told us their bacon is cured in-house. Thick slices with really great pork flavor in the meat. However, every strip was more than half lard and their is nothing more gross than a huge chunk of fat. 

I got the Bridge Burger with poutine and me co-worker got the tomato soup with grill cheese. First off, that gravy in the poutine, was the best gravy I've ever had in any restaurant in Calgary, ever. Sooooooo good! I will definitely come back for the poutine. The burger was also quite tasty; well cooked and very juicy. The problem was the 'onion straws' that were on the burger. They were more like well over-cooked onion stones, that literally chipped a tooth (a first!). Co-worker said the tomato soup was ok but thought their might have been too much smoke infused into it, which I agreed with apon tasting it. She was not a fan of the grilled cheese.

Their is good things here to be had, the waitress was friendly and efficient but the kitchen needs a supervisor for quality control."}
{"text":"A coworker and I went here for lunch awhile back. The restaurant itself is nice, and the concept is great, but they could really work on their execution. Also their price points seem a bit all over the place.

It was a Thursday, so we ordered the bucket of bacon which was in house cured. I like that it was savory and came with a ranch dipping sauce. Most places do candied bacon and I'm not as big a fan. 
The bacon tasted great but the fatty parts were not cooked  crispy enough for our liking. 
Coworker got the bridges burger with a poutine. The poutine has a good amount of cheese and a really nice gravy. I'm told the burger was good but the onion straws were hard. 
I had the smoked tomato bisque with grilled cheese. The bread was stale and way too thick for my liking. Had the bread been fresh the thickness would have been okay but the sandwich was crumbly and dry and just overall very bland and had a terrible bread to cheese ratio. 
The soup was good, I liked the crispy capers for the salty element  but I found it was a bit heavy on the smoke. 

The presentation was lovely for all the food we had, and our waitress was very friendly and accommodating. 
They ran out of iced tea and it was quite apparent that the owners nephew had drank it all. 
Overall, I'd go back and try it again, but they have some work to do before I'd recommend them to \"you gotta eat here '"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a Saturday it wasn't busy I ordered the california eggs benny recommended by waitress it wasn't hot and the avocados were mashed I would of prefered them to be nicely sliced pieces of avocado. My friend had the eggs benny brisket which think she enjoyed."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped here while waiting for Cannibale to open.
I enjoyed Mac and cheese, my hubby tried the burger forget which one he enjoyed it! The cocktail I had was refreshing but not as sweet as I would've liked, and no happy hour price on cocktails which makes it one expensive drink!!
Service was excellent but it wasn't that busy!! They had specials on oysters and beer but we didn't order that! I would go back but I really need happy hour for cocktails!!"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday just before the lunch hour and M just had finished a competition and was hungry. We were browsing brunch places when G mentioned Bridges on First. I had heard of Bridges and have seen posts of their food on social media so I was totally down to try them out. Located along the main strip on the corner of 1st avenue in Bridgeland it was easy to spot. Lots of street parking available.

Bridges is Bridgeland's first neighbourhood pub that is family friendly and focus on comfort food. Entering, it's a typical pub feel with 76 seats available and flat screen TV's on the walls to watch the latest sporting events. 

We were greeted and sat at a half booth half table and handed the brunch menus. Brunch is available only on the weekends from 10am-2pm. The menu had a good variety of brunch items, classic bacon and eggs, benedicts, hash, breakfast burrito, pancakes, breakfast poutine and some burgers. There were four of us, two of them ordered the breakfast poutine, M went with the magic mushroom and cinnamon bun pancakes and I went with the breakfast burrito. 

It wasn't too busy at the time we went but it felt like a long time before our food came out (probably 'cause we were starving). The poutines looked smaller than I had envisioned but G had been here before and assured me that it looked small but was really filling. It was a classic poutine but with tater tots and hollandaise and came with braised pork belly, 2 poached eggs, a hush puppy and was sprinkled with bacon bits and green onion. The hush puppy looked really good and according to them, it tasted good too. The magic mushroom burger was a 7oz wagyu beef patty and came with portabella mushrooms, truffle oil, lettuce, bacon, borsin cheese and a side of hash browns. The burger looked smaller than its average size but in actuality it was probably the perfect meal. M had ordered the cinnamon bun pancakes too (she hungry) - 3 big buttermilk pancakes, topped with cinnamon icing glaze, whipped cream and candied walnuts. She really enjoyed the burger but the cinnamon bun pancakes were a total miss. I tried them too and I wasn't a fan at all. When I think cinnamon bun pancakes, I think that there's cinnamon glaze or something within the pancakes but these appeared to be plain with a little drizzle of cinnamon glaze on top. Unfortunately, the candied walnuts were the best thing on the dish. My breakfast burrito was supposed to be filled with Mexican rice and beans, scrambled eggs, salsa, cheese and sour cream and came with hash browns as well. It wasn't anything exciting - I don't recall having rice in the burrito. From what I remember, the 'salsa' was just diced tomatoes and I didn't taste much sour cream. Hash browns were good though.

Overall, the food was okay. Nothing to phone home about. The breakfast poutines seemed to be a hit though! But my burrito was OK - I wish it was more saucy or gooey because it was pretty plain tasting. Like I mentioned above, cinnamon bun pancakes were a total miss which made us sad because we were expecting something spectacular. I think that the descriptions of the dishes seem more appealing than they actually are. Service was good, there enough to ask how things were and fill our drinks but not always interrupting, which was nice. 

I don't know that I will return for brunch because it just wasn't memorable. I bet it would be a cool place to hit up for lunch or dinner and to catch a game on TV with some friends. Maybe I'll do that."}
{"text":"I so want to like this place but it's just not going to happen, every time I go it gets worse.  
Let's talk about the last visit. 
Walk in, it's dark and lots of the tables are dirty. I think, hey maybe they just had a rush.  After watching the staff walk by the tables numerous times and not touch a thing, that illusion wore off.  It took forever to get service and there were only a few people in the location.  Three of the things we tried to order were out.  We settled on a platter.   Easy, right ?   Well 40 minutes in and starving, still looking at a half empty restaurant with a bunch of dirty tables we ask the waitress if our meal was arriving soon.  She let us know they have to cook it, wow this came as a revelation :( 
Well the food was not worth the wait, the service was mediocre at best, the location just looks worn and in my personal opinion this place is destined for failure.  Which is a real shame as it's a great location and the area needs a solid pub."}
