{"text":"Came in with co-worker to grab take out for an office party; your experience dining in may be different.  Order time: We ordered beef & broccoli (x2), sweet & sour pork (x2), yeung-chow fried rice (x2) and fried beef noodles (x2). It took around 30 minutes to receive the order, which is actually reasonable.  Restaurant size: This used to be a Harvey's (you can still see where the decals used to be on the doors), so there's plenty of space inside.   Food quality: Sweet and sour pork is one of those items that has many variables affecting its success, such as toughness of meat, meat to batter ratio, sauce. Home Feel did a really good job with the sweet & sour pork! The meat was very tender, yet firm, and without a large amount of batter.  The beef and broccoli, and fried beef noodles were as expected, without the beef being overly chewy. The fried beef noodles could have had more onions and \"wok air\" though?  However, the yeung chow fried rice was a little disappointing with its blandness and general sparseness of ingredients.  Service: The main server (owner?) speaks English, Cantonese, Mandarin and possibly other languages. He was willing to include 8 pops (or soups, if you so chose). Not much to do while waiting though.  Final thoughts: I don't foresee myself randomly dropping in again, but it's good to know there's a place with good sweet & sour pork around that area."}
{"text":"A group of us have been going to this location once a week for years and years. It has had several different names and Home Feel is just the latest incarnation. Often there have been long closures between name changes. However, the menu hasn't really changed despite the name and presumably the owner changes. The food is good...not fabulous...but definitely good. It is served promptly and it comes hot. The portion size is reasonable and the prices are in line with the food quality.  All in all...not a fancy place but not a bad place to grab a casual meal without any pretence."}
{"text":"Came here with the family to try something new.  The restaurant is located in a small plaza which can easily be missed at night as it is dimly lite.  The parking is also very limited so try so be sure to get there no later than 6pm.  Once inside, you can be sure you will definitely get a seat.  Traditional chinese cuisine and menu items.  Would recommend ordering from the \"chef's recommendation list\".  We ordered the braised fish and peas, tofu, vegetable and meat stone pot, salt and pepper pork chops, cubed beef and broccoli, peking duck wrap and lettuce wrap.  Looking at the selection, it should be enough of a variety to gauge the cook's expertise which I must say it does.  Never have had food that lacked so much flavour. There's no flavour whatsoever in even the beef and pork chops which were both so overcooked that the beef cubes were tough and the pork chops thin and fried to dense pork chips.  Only items I would say had some flavour were the peking duck and lettuce wrap as both uses the same duck for both dishes.  However, slicing and prep could be better improved as pieces were not all uniformed and the minced duck for the lettuce wrap had bones in it.  The flour wrapping for the peking duck was the probably the best item on the table - thin and delicate the way it should be.  On the other hand, looking at service and if I based my experience on this would be sadly unfortunate.  Only when you start ordering that they are attentive.  After that you rarely see them walk the floor to see if diners needed anything.   Would I visit this place again?  Not very likely.  I hope the experience for others is much better during the day"}
