{"text":"Finally a Peruvian resto that knows the food is what is important to Peruvians. Ceviche was excellant, Lomo Saltado done with \"sazon criolla\", Huancaina with real peppers and fresh cheese... Fantastic! Loved it

It has improved vastly from the original owners who opened it up a few years back. Now the importance placed on the food is back and the result is a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Recently visited this restaurant again.  I think it got sold and a new owner is running it. 
Food is still tasty but not as perfect as it used to be :("}
{"text":"My Peruvian girlfriend and I were craving Peruvian good on our way to Canada wonderland when we saw this place and couldn't resist trying.
We had the lomo saltado and ceviche mixto with chicha morrada - everything was super delicious and we felt like we were back in Peru.
The manager,Carla, is from the north herself where it's been said that people there know how to cook- well she certainly did.
We'll keep this place in sweet memory and be back soon!
Hasta luego!"}
{"text":"We were there for dinner on Saturday night. There was a terrible DJ that didn't know how to use stereo equipment properly and kept messing up plus 

He would raise the music 'a volume so loud that we all left with ringing in our ears. The place is much too small for the loud music that was playing. The service was incredibly slow and disorganized. They never really came to our table to request drink and food orders, we basically had to wave them down to ask for things. 

The food was ok, edible but not good. It took about 40 minutes for dishes to come. The mixed drinks hardly had any alcohol in them. I would not return to this place."}
{"text":"Great menu, great tasting food and nice portions for price. However, you can definitely taste that most of the food are previously frozen and thus will have a bit of an off-taste. Additionally, some of the dishes are cooked with a bit too much oil. 

I have tried the lomo saltado, ceviche, anticuchos, la humita and paella."}
{"text":"All I have to say is wow.  What the hell happened to this place?  The food is now terrible and the portion sizes are very small.  Defiantly won't be coming back here."}
