{"text":"Never again because the owner is a racist and was calling my friend a \"gwai lo\" and other things talking smack behind him before he even left the restaurant thinking he didn't know what they were saying. Just this rudeness is not appreciated and won't be back. If you want to talk about your customers, at least wait until they are out of your restaurant and can't hear you."}
{"text":"The ingredients in the spring rolls had \"bounce.\" Everything looked and tasted fresh. We ordered on a whim, not knowing the place, and would have been fine with mediocre food but ended up with an aromatic, savory, and truly enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Don't overlook Pho Kitchen. It deserves to be in the Top 10 list of Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas. There have been several Vietnamese restaurants at this location over the years, but Pho Kitchen is a new restaurant with a new owner. Pho and Bahn Mi are both great. Portions are generous."}
{"text":"Newly opened pho house. I tried the combo beef pho and it was very good.The guys running it are trying to accommodate the local pho eaters and what they want. Check it out and make suggestions if needed. I made a few and they were very receptive, just minor things may new place experiences."}
{"text":"A.C. feels like heated air, sauce is salty, my order of beef stew was watered down, water tastes like plastic & soapy. Just overall no good, service was just WHATEVER."}
{"text":"Very nice service!   I had the bun bo hue, and the portion size was huge.  The flavors was on point.  I finished the whole bowl.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese food. What more can you ask for? They've got the best Pho tai bo vien in Vegas. Tastes like home made Pho which is the best kind. Also have tried their Pho satay which was also delicious, a different taste from typical Pho. Their egg rolls are also good. Only flaw is menu inconsistency, otherwise it's a five star Viet restaurant. What I have pictured is a rice plate-- com suong (pork chop) with egg. I'm a credible source...I'm a Nguyener!"}
{"text":"The Restaurant is hidden away on the corner of the Korean Supermarket next to the Lee Korean BBQ , My husband and I were looking for some place close by did  not want to drive too far , so we stop there for dinner . The egg Roll are sooo... good , and the BBQ pork so flavorful ...Yummmy.  The owner daughter is so sweet , so friendly , very nice and when you received the good service it makes your dining wonderful.   We know there are many VN Rest and very competitive,  We really  hope they keep it up with the business Cuz it hidden on the corner  not many people know about it !!!"}
{"text":"We just tried to eat there for our 1st time, and the place is all locked up.  Nobody there......"}
{"text":"What a surprise! Place looks run down. One could call it a hole in the wall. But it was actually decent pho! I get weary about eating at places that aren't necessarily clean looking but everything was clean and food tasted great!   Pho Thai- noodles were just right! Soup's flavoring was delicious!!  Pork vermicelli- Crispy egg rolls were yummy. Sauce was a bit bland. Pork was great! Wish there was a bit more though.   Customer service- ok. Not the friendly smiles you'd expect but they were prompt."}
{"text":"We decide to have pho for breakfast.  This is a new joint.  We all order pho Tai bo vien.  The broth soup is a little lighter than most of other pho places.  If you like healthy pho, this is it."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with this place due to the good reviews it has received thus far. Pho Kitchen is in the same plaza as the Greenland Market, next to Lee's KBBQ.  I walked in to a nice, clean open restaurant. The worker asked me how many and I said take out. He walked to the counter and held out a menu. I thought he was going to give it to me but he just stood there looking at me with the menu out. I walked over to the counter and took it myself. I then ordered #24. He said \"do you want egg?\" I replied saying \"it says it comes with two eggs with the rice dish.\" He looked at the menu closely with a frustrated face, mumbled and scribbled into his pad.  When my food was done he just stared at me from the counter. When I looked over he said \"ready\" and walked away. Once again, I had to walk over to the counter to get my food. Ok so service isn't the best but that is commonly found in a lot of Asian restaurants. Now onto the food and let's see if it makes up for the lack of service:  The eggs were too overcooked for my taste. There wasn't enough meat for the amount of rice given. I generally get more meats at other Vietnamese restaurants. The meat itself wasn't too bad but still mediocre.    I wanted to like this place, as it was conveniently close to where I work, but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The best beer battered egg rolls ever, you won't find these anywhere else! The pho broth is the most flavorful in the city."}
{"text":"Don't stand around 2hrs on a Fri or Sat night waiting for ramen, come here! 4 times the size, clean fresh food quickly with friendly service! Didn't give 5 stars only bc they were out of 2 items, otherwise perfect!"}
{"text":"Best pho in town! So glad we found this place. Everything else is delicious too! Sweet owners as well."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is delicious. I love Pho and eat it all over Vegas and I can tell you this is the best Pho in town. In addition to the great food the staff and owner are amazing. I was about to dine alone when they offered me to sit with them and enjoy the football game together while all ate. I was touched by the generosity of spirit and homestyle atmosphere. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"My parents and I tried this place after finding out that the Vietnamese place in the food court was closed. This place is a nice mom and pop establishment with friendly and respectful service. The pho didn't taste bad and was a good portion, it was a little on the fatty side. I typically add a little more fat to my pho, but I didn't have to with this broth. Take that as you will, some people like it lean some don't.   Be sure to check out the signs on the wall since they have other dishes that may not be in the menu. This place seems to be starting out and growing, hopefully they do well! Check them out."}
{"text":"Owner is a racist a^^%$#@! Maybe next time you wont talk shit in front of your customers thinking they don't understand you. A bunch of fake 5 star reviews wont help bad customer service"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the place is very hot.  No customer, we were the only one.  . They have fans on which help.  The place looks nice.     They must have the temperature at 85 degrees.  We  were greeted by what looks like the owner. He did not say hello just said \" how many \" with a frown on his face.  Looks like he just lost his paycheck at the casino.  When I ordered the chicken noodle soup \" mien ga\" he said \"No eggs ok?\" While pointing to the picture of the egg on the menu.  When my father ordered the Vietnamese pancake appetizer he just said \"NO \" in a very stern voice.  I don't think he was being rude to us but it's the personality of a thug or someone who may have grew up in a bad place.   While we waited ,The owner and his friend was chatting at one of the tables. I heard some profanity \" mother fxxker\" in Vietnamese.  Not too professional.     When we got the food it was average. Every time the owner brought us something like water, menus , food, I said the thank you.  He didn't reply.     Overall I can not recommend this place.  Average food , poor customer service, uncomfortably hot environment."}
{"text":"This place is awsome Ill come back and recommend to my family. They are very nice and friendly Not bad"}
{"text":"I order to go,for the first time(never had pho food before)the place is clean and ok,the food is good but the reason I came back again today is the girl that works there,I belive her name is Kiki,this girl is not just a server,as I experienced server I know how to interact witn clients,but she goes above and beyond to make ger clients happy,she bring my food to my car,every time I order to go,and she is the sweetest kindnesst server I ever had.Thank you so much Kiki you are the best!

{"text":"Okay, years ago we loved this place under different owners. When they sold we gave them 2 chances and said we would never come back. New owners and management have resurrected a gem. We were heartbroken when Pho Vietnam Grille closed. We have searched high and low for that quality and flavor.  We have finally found our new go to Pho joint. The broth was delicious before putting any condiments in it.  There was no trace of MSG. I flush if there is.  There was no trace of the cloying greasy flavor of cheap restaurant Pho. The veggie option was filled with fresh veggies that are normally not as diverse. I loved it. My husband had #7 combo Pho and he was very happy. We have been searching for a place this good for a long time. We have tried many places once.  This is one we will come back to over and over.  The Bahn Mi was really good. Not great , is just really good. The BBQ pork in it was delicious, just a little too much mayo for our taste.  It opened my sinuses  and seared my throat. I felt like I was coming down with something when we came in and felt great when we left.  Pho is my favorite cure for a cold. It works almost immediately.  The prices were very reasonable. We got out of there under $25.00 and we had to take home half a sandwich and 1/3 bowl of Pho. Service was friendly and efficient. Table next to us was boisterous and loud until their Pho came and then silent. Eating good food soothed the chaos in the dining room."}
{"text":"Umm just ordered my food to go and as I was sitting there waiting I saw a Roach crawl across the floor I hope it didn't come from back in the kitchen and they do not honor the free soft drink for checking in"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and it's very clean and modern inside. Great lunch specials. They have a huge menu and offer dishes that other they have quite a few authentic Vietnamese dishes that no where in Vegas serves and the taste is amazing. You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"This is the place to get the best pho for the best price in Las Vegas. Fast, convenient, and great to dine in or call for carry out. The pho broth is just perfect"}
{"text":"The pho was great! Ordered the pho tai, it had plenty of meat. The basil was fresh, a big plus. Egg rolls are one of my top favourites in town.  They gave us each our own dipping sauce, not many places do that. The service was friendly. Definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"I had their BBQ Bahn mi in both steak and pork, they are probably the best I ever tasted, hands down the best in Vegas that I had. The Bahn mi is big and they don't skimp on the meat, one will definitely be enough for one person and maybe two."}
{"text":"It looks like this place is recently new. The restaurant is very clean and nice inside. I like their red chopsticks they have and the condiment station at every table is organized and convenient there for the customers. I ordered the spring rolls and bun bo hue here because it looked good. The spring rolls was skinny and was good. They give you plenty of sauce for the spring roll. The bunbohue was also good. Came with enough veggies on the side. It was neatly presented and served. The server was friendly and prompt and he refilled my water frequently. I think if they advertise more they would get more customers because I was the only one that came in for lunch. I would come back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Dont forget to read my previous review as well on the bottom. It has 10 pictures.  This time we tried the Chinese menu  as well.  Salt and pepper pork pieces was ok and came with a bowl of rice.  Salt and pepper chicken wings were was ok as well.  Pho ga was always on point.  Pho dac biet was great as well.  They now take credit cards on order over $20. Big win."}
{"text":"Go here not for the service but for the delicious pho!!! Pho Kitchen offers one of the better bowls of chicken pho around here. The dark meat used is tender and not dry (which is how pho ga tends to be). Savory broth.  Good amount of pho noodles. My boyfriend always gets the pho with beef balls and rare beef and says that it too is delicious.  Interestingly quiet restaurant but don't let it deter you from trying their food. I haven't tried any of the other dishes- just pho! Too good to try anything else, but there are several more noodle and soup combinations offered."}
{"text":"Great food. Owner was very nice and spent some time chatting with me about how his Phô was made. The broth was very very good! The meatballs he uses also were excellent compared to most! This restaurant absolutely deserves your business. They are new and definitely have the Phô to compete. Much simpler experience than Phô Kim Long and possibly better. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and it's very clean and modern inside. Great lunch specials. They have a huge menu and offer dishes that other"}
{"text":"The food is very well-executed. Great spot for authentic viet food. Portion is great also. Definitely going to come back and bring more friends with me. Inside is clean and very spacious. Great spot for hanging out with your friends. The owner and waiter are attentive and provided good service"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opens for couple months. This is the only place that I can find My Quang as good as my grandma's My Quang. They also offer Cao Lau, not 100% as same as the one you have in Hoi An but it is very close and delicious.  The menu has a lot of options of Vietnamese authentic dishes also offer some of Chinese dishes like wonton noodle soup, chow fun, salt and pepper porkchop. The restaurant is big and clean, service is great and friendly.  The owner came to talk to me and recommended Banh Beo, Bun Rieu. In haven't try their Pho yet, will come back to try other dishes! A great new Vietnamese restaurant in China Town."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp spring roll and bun bo hue. The spring roll just tastes like anywhere else but the rice wrap was partially dry and not able to be chewed. Bun bo hue was very lack of flavor, you just can't dissolve smg into water and pretend it's bone stock broth. Beef and pork blood were not fresh enough. It's like you can taste the hatred in the food from the chef towards the owner. 2 stars only for the service, my water was refilled twice before empty. maybe because I was the only one there at dinner time?"}
{"text":"Came here with friends and I have never been to a Vietnamese restaurant. Let me tell you the food was amazing. This is a little nice kept in this neighborhood.  The atmosphere is quiet and the customer service is amazing. The owner brought out our food and she is so sweet.  I would love to come back and try something different."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant  just opened few months ago.  It's now one of my favorite place to go whenever I crave for Vietnamese soup.  Place is clean and service is fast! Come check it out!l"}
{"text":"AYCE was good last time. They changed ownership and stoped doing AYCE. I'm sure regular menu is the same though."}
{"text":"If you like real Vietnamese food from Soc Trang, VN this is the place to go to. The owner made the best Bun Mam and Mi Quang. This is the only place in Vegas that have it and know how to make it the right way. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Simple, slightly austere....excellent Phood!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's definitely not the nicest restaurant in term of decor. But the food is amazing, by far the best Vietnamese food I have in Las Vegas. The eggroll is wrapped in rice paper so extra crispy compare to other restaurant. The banh mi sandwich is so fresh. And the beef rice plate is yummy. Will definitely come back more often for sure"}
{"text":"Cruising in from AZ to shop for soju at the Korean market, we were famished. We saw a small place called Pho Kitchen in the corner of the shopping area. I love good Vietnamese food and checked it out. Wow, delicious pho, rice noodle, rice, sandwiches and exotic beverages were waiting. Maybe it was the long drive but service was friendly and quick, pleasant young Vietnamese woman. We had pho house special, grilled pork and shrimp with rice, egg rolls,"}
