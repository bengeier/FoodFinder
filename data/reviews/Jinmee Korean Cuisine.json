{"text":"This will probably be one of my favorite Korean restaurant in Toronto!  Wow,  good food , great service and nice environment! 
Try their Cheese Chicken hot pot and cold noodle~ yummy yummy"}
{"text":"Dropped by after work one day just because we felt like some nice out Noodles and it turned out really good.   Unlike some Korean places that gives just picked Kimchee or turnip, this place gave a nice variety of appetizers that all tested good while we waited for our noodle soup. 

I got the pork bone one and my wife got a vegetarian one.  The broth was deep and tasty and had just about the right amount of spiciness.  My pork bone hit just the spot and the price was very reasonable.   Would come back again more often for sure."}
{"text":"If you wish to taste a Real Good Authentic Korean Food, Here is the place. A Delicious real Korean BBQ, Hot pots, Pork bone soup and Hot Seafood noodle(Jjam-pong) are far beyond my expectation.  A Clean place and warm services are the bonus."}
{"text":"The unyielding quest to find fantastic pork bone soup continues, leading us here, to Jinmee, a new Korean restaurant featuring a 15% opening discount. After ordering an extra spicy gamjatang and reassuring the waitress that I indeed wanted extra spicy, our somewhat large group was presented with two sets of banchan. Interestingly enough, one set contained one more dish than the other. I guess they're still working out the kinks. It's safe to say that all seven side dishes were tasty with several requiring a quick refill.

The gamjatang ($9.99) arrived bubbling, a bowl of white rice on the side. At first glance, it looked promising with meaty pieces of pork neck bones stacked on top of each other. Then, picking up the spoon and giving it a stir, I was disappointed at weak resistance, the soup clearly lacking heartiness. Yet, as they say on those cooking shows, \"taste is king\". One spoonful of broth later and my hopes were diminished. The broth tasted overwhelmingly of perilla seeds, which should have come as no surprise given the disproportionate amount of ground perilla on top, and bland spiciness (i.e. heat, no flavour). This dish's saving grace is that the pork is cooked well, the bones separating from each other with a gentle tug, and the meat releasing itself from the nooks and crannies with little effort. Yet while the pork bones are easy to navigate, the flavour leaves me dissatisfied.

Quest failed."}
{"text":"Came on a holiday when everything was closed. We got plates to share. Really recommend the big pot of Gamjatang, it even had dumplings in int (mind blown).

The side dishes were all delicious, we ask nicely for refills, and our wishes were granted.

We order duboki with cheese, and it was the first dish to disappear. That cheese really made it, and each rice cake were so tender, melt in your mouth. Not a lot of chewing required.

The price was fair for the portion sizes and quality. Our table of 4 was a fan.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm legitimately surprised by the amount of mediocre reviews for this place. Perhaps it's the cursed aura surrounding this unit?? (used to be Sumo Sushi which was really not a good dining experience) I believe it is a family owned business as the same 2 waitresses greet us warmly every time. The kalbi tang (kalbi in soup) is phenomenal here as well as the cheese dishes (The ribs with melted cheese, the spicy chicken with cheese and the spicy rice cakes with cheese). Anything on the menu that has cheese attached to it is fabulous here. The mandu (dumplings) are also surprisingly good (we tried both the fried and steamed).

The flavor has always been on point whenever I come with my friends so maybe it is certain dishes that are over salted. Have not tried the gamjatang (pork bone soup) here but my friend said it was definitely above avg. Price wise, it is slightly more expensive than your typical korean resto but I highly recommend you to bring a friend and try one of the two person dishes as they give you a lot of food and is better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Same owner as the Jin Mee fast food stall in the Galleria plaza. With the higher prices, was expecting better quality, but unfortunately the food tastes the same as the food court. So many better Korean restaurants nearby (Cho Sun Ok, Piggy's, Koryo, Ho Shing Tang, etc...). Tried once and won't be back."}
{"text":"Quiet on a weeknight but food was good.  There were only 2 waitresses but we received good service.

Our favourite was the spicy chicken with cheese hot plate.  Came with lots of chicken.  Had onions, cabbage and ricecake.  And a ring of cheese with corn on the outside.  The corn and cheese were delicious.  You wait for the cheese to melt then dip the chicken in the gooey cheese.  Delicious but very rich tasting.

The \"army\" hot pot casserole was very tasty as well.  But the ingredients were quite inexpensive.  Mostly spam, sausage, fish cake and ramen noodles.  Very tasty but next time, will try bbq meat or the seafood hotpot.

Service was efficient and sidedishes were refilled when asked.  Overall, very good food and value.  

The best was the kimchi.  Very fresh and spicy.

Will definitely return again for tofu soup, grilled mackerel and pork belly bbq."}
{"text":"Newly korean place that replaced Sumo Sushi location. I wanted to go there last week but they were not ready on opening day and were still working the kinks of sorting out the dishes and getting the sign up. 

Tonite was busy due to father's day. A lot of people were smart to book ahead. My friend and I were quite lucky when we walked in and grabbed the last small table for two people ( there was just one).  

A lot of tables opted for Korean BBQ but since me and my friend weren't too hungry, we ended up ordering a PBS and a bibimpap, at $9.99 each. There were in total 6 side dishes and the eggplants were my favourite one for all. 

I felt my PBS lacked taste and was not spicy enough. For $9,99 I really expected more meat on the bones and bigger pork bones. I think I will pass on the dish for next time.

My friend's bibimpap was the typical BBP and as expected, didn't come with lots of meat. It came in a big ceramic bowl so no crispy rice.

Service was prompt, courteous and with a smile. 

Overall verdict: I will come back.

This restaurant actually has a location already at the food court in Galleria, on Yonge in Vaughan."}
{"text":"I first came to Jinmee during their 15% off grand opening with 5 other friends. In terms of food, we all thought the food was decent but did not find anything to be outstanding. The service however, was a step up from other Korean restaurants that I have been to. The waitresses were really nice and attentive.

This second visit I came during their afternoon hours between 2-5pm with 10% off on CCUE. If you search CCUE Jinmee, they also offer 10% off on birthday and free cake with prior booking and 5% off with seniors or parents (not sure if they mean senior parents or if you can just get the discount if you come with your parents). This time I got the Bibimbap and it was good but once again, nothing out of the ordinary. 

When I think about Jinmee in Galleria and how they took a leap and expanded I want to support them however, I don't think I would go out of the way to go to Jinmee versus another Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"A lot of people gave this place alright reviews, but I am personally a huge fan of their group dinner sets.  It has quite a big portion of food and even though it says for 4 people, it can actually feed close to 6 people comfortably.  Their seafood soup is pretty good as well and I really like their beef short rib soup also known as the KalbiTang.  There are a couple of things that need to be improved before I believe that other people would give it better reviews and that is the fact that their service is sometimes lackluster in some ways.  Especially when it is a busy time with over 10 tables and only 2 people really taking orders.  However, the lady serving us are really friendly and they always make it a great experience for the guys and I to come over that it has become a staple for us to come on a consistent basis. 

Will be our go to Korean place in the Markham community as we consider it a good value for the amount of food and the quality of the entrees are pretty decent as well.  A must try for any Markham/Richmond Hill dweller that craves korean food."}
{"text":"This restaurant replaced sumo sushi. Jinmee first location is in galleria on Yonge st in the food court. The decor looks pretty much the same as sumo sushi, and the servers are Korean. The menu has the usual fare of korean dishes similar to nak won, but not quite as extensive as piggys.

Total of 6 side dishes were served, kimchi, pickled radish, bean sprouts, potatoes, eggplant and spinich.

I got the cold noodles while my other half had bibimcoksu.

I actually found both quite dissatisfying overall. Neither dish had much flavor. The cold noodles came in a smaller then usual bowl. They did not provide the usual scissors, vinegar and horse radish.

I can forgive them a bit since they are new, and they do have some dishes that I want to try, but personally I would come back, but i would hesitate to recommend them at this point."}
{"text":"I loved Korean food and had eaten at many Korean restaurants but unfortunately this place is not one of the good ones. I wouldn't say it's terrible or else I would give it 1 star, but I won't go back.

The banchan (small dishes that serve with your main meal) is pretty good, I think it's the only good thing I remember. We had the soon tofu soup, korean sausage stew, and bibimbap. The soup and stew was too salty. My friend ordered the bibimbap and he wanted the one with the hot stone bowl, but they gave him the one in a regular bowl. The waitress was arguing with him saying that he ordered the wrong one. I don't really know who made the mistake but why would you argue with a customer??! Anyway, they did change it but was unpleasant.

I rather travel a little further for great korean food.

{"text":"So apparently this restaurant said they don't put M.S.G in the food. I can't really tell because the food were spicy, I find the soon tofu soup a bit too salty. Fish was ok. The chicken I would order again next time. I tried the  rice it was tasteful. Over all the service was friendly. The portion of the dish were more than what u expected and the price are decent. One more thing. The traditional beef broth soup was good I heard, will order that next time :)"}
{"text":"New Korean place, orders ja Jung mien and a gamja tang. Unfortunately I can't say much more. The noodles were authentic and decent, nice flavor and no msg. The gamja tang was awful. The pork bone lacked any flavor and the potatoes tasted like boiled potatoes. Nothing in it. We didn't even finish the rice that came with it. Never coming back, completely disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this place and pleased that it had changed my first opinion in the positive way. Originally I would have put 3 star but my second visit earned them another. Food wise this place isn't bad at all. Lunch today was packed but not super crazy. We managed to get a seat. Service a bit on the slow side, I'm not sure if it was due to the tables already occupied and busy. Had ordered the Soon Tofu Soup in a hot stone bowl and a cup of rice. For $10 big portion not a bad deal. The soup was quite tasty and with enough kick go spicy. I would reccommend this place if you were in the area. The place boasts no MSG which is good .  I would want to come back and try their Cheese dish for sure ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.  Very extensive.  Better than the terrible Chinese run Korean places in the area. For folks in the area it beats driving to Yonge and Sheppard.  Cold noodles are good, soondobu is also good.  Will try the bbq in the near future.   

And some other review said the little plates are small.  Clearly they have not been to Korea.  Its unlimited refills.  Come on son."}
{"text":"Cold Noodle was perfect for a hot summer afternoon! 

I came here with no expectation with the poor review but was pleasantly surprised! 

Mul Naengmyeon ($9.99) was nicely presented with chewy buckwheat noodle. I could use a some vinegar and mustard to spice it up a little but overall it was tasty. The ice in the broth can be in smaller chuck but it ended up keep the noodle chilled for longer.

The banchan was plentiful and tasty. I was served the same number of dish even as a single diner. 

I will be back for more Cold Noodle and might try out other items."}
{"text":"This place has been open for a while but we've never actually noticed it till recently. We finally came to try it and it didn't quite meet our expectations.

It's located in the plaza at Highway 7 and Times Rd, beside the Tim Hortons. The interior is very nicely decorated and clean. The menu we were given was updated (from the menu photos on Yelp) and most items were about $1 more. We ordered a soft tofu stew and a marinated beef stew. It's nice that they came with 6 side dishes (many places only give 3 or 4) and they tasted pretty good. The stews that we got looked appetizing and they came with bowls of purple rice. However, both of our soups weren't very flavourful.

Jinmee boasts that everything is made with NO MSG, which is great. However, maybe we've just been accustomed to eating foods with MSG so the flavour wasn't quite there. Looking at the other reviews, people seem to have good reviews about some of the other dishes here, so maybe if we ever go back we'll try something else."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when this place opened. First off, this space seems to be cursed. No business has been able to survive there longer than a year or two before folding. Secondly, I've frequented their outlet in Galleria Supermarket before and the food was quite subpar.  

All those warning flags aside, I decided to give this place a try. I ordered the dumplings and rice cake soup. The soup was overly salty and the dumplings weren't fully cooked. My partner ordered the omurice and it was DRENCHED in ketchup, not added on top sparingly. The inside filling was bland too. Ban chan (side dishes) were not fresh either. 

Final verdict: drive the extra 15 mins to go to a better Korean restaurant in Thornhill or North York. If you're really famished, get some Popeye's next door instead."}
