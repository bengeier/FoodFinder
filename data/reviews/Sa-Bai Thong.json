{"text":"Ordered Drunken Noodles. The first time around, the noodles were chewy. I told the waitress who agreed to take it back. On second attempt, the noodles were just less chewy. It tasted like somebody had made the noodles out of those bought in a grocery store. Low on flavor. Low on veggies and tofu. Service was polite. But they REALLY need to work on the food - even Chin's Asia Fresh beats them hands down. How pathetic is that ?
Not going back."}
{"text":"This is the closest Thai place to my home-convenient and acceptable but not the greatest. The atmosphere is brightly colored and cheerful (they remodeled a few years ago) and they can accomodate a group if you call ahead. They are efficient and accurate with carryout. The food is a little hit and miss (I think I got spoiled living on the West coast for years) and you might have to try a few different dishes until you find one they do well here."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here often, its typically our go to take out place.  We frequent the Odana Rd location because its closer.  Food is always great except the 1 out of every 15 orders that is missing a sauce.  The crab rangoons are my absolute favorite along with number 66, the volcano chicken.  My husband loves the pad thai and the various curries."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 4, mainly because of their good consistency. In my opinion, I believe this is one of the best Thai places in town, but I've been to most of them and I don't get why they all try to change the food, the way it's really supposed to be cooked. I sometimes ask what region of the country people are from, it lends to the different nuances of flavor. I've found people just like playing with the flavors of the food. I am usually not a fan of that. Having lived in Thailand for a couple years, I like it authentic as possible"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but the service was the worst ever.  Waited about 20 minutes before the waitress stopped by the table.  At that point she did bring water, however did not take our drink or food order.  That took a while longer.  It took almost an hour for our appetizers; and then another 30 for our food.  Will never come back to this one.  Leftovers- she put everybody's in one carton.  Who does that?  Unbelievably poor experience."}
{"text":"A couple words for my experience here: \"FLY ATTACK!\"  More importantly, the sanitary standards must be raised here!  

Been on a Sabbitcal from Yelp! but it's experiences at places like this that drove me back to writing this.  We were driving around Madison trying to decide what and where to eat.  Couldn't initially decide but eventually found this place near UW on University Ave.  

From the outside the place looks innocent enough as one business along a row of others in a tiny plaza.  Walking in the front door, this restaurant has different awards from local magazines lining the walls of the vestibule (which we found a huge disconnect between our experience and what has been written about it in the area; may I also add that it appears that the awards appeared to be granted in the 2000-2002 time frame and probably *before* the change of management since).  

The other facts are that the place has been decently interior decorated in a Thai accent.  Pricing for Thai food here is about $10 per plate, give or take, which is about what we'd expect for 'market price,' not incredibly cheap nor expense for a Thai restaurant.  Accordingly, we were looking for food quality prepared similarly for this price.  Food here I must say tastes \"good\" to \"okay\" but not excellent (I don't mean to sound like a \"Thai snob\") and may be hit or miss but certainly this first experience for us here will also be our last.  

My observations on the management and staff:  At least for our one visit here, the place seemed to be managed by one mid-aged lady that seemed a little stressed and under-staffed.  We were there just before dinner and eventually a handful of college-aged staff arrived for dinner service (but the attentiveness to our table did not improve).  The lady that waited at our table did give us the courtesy of informing us that she will now be leaving to 'open up' the other Sa-Bai Thong location in Madison when help at our location had arrived.  

Our possible first omen was when we were taken to our tables, we found the tables filthy.  This tells us that they do not get wiped down often enough (found part of a noodle on one of our seats).  We soon thereafter learned that my five year old godson started to have a reaction of puffiness and redness under one of his eyes!  We believe that he was rubbing his eyes with his hands after sitting at the table for no more than ten minutes and must be from the traces of peanuts (which he has an allergic reaction to) on the table.  

They kept \"pushing\" the \"#32 Pad Thai\" when we were deciding what to order.  We decided to try an order of this and found it a bit on the \"saucy\" side and were disappointed.  Every Thai restaurant we've been too makes it w/less sauce.  We found this saucy dish and the \"#30 Bamee Chao Nue\" or Chicken lomein noodle stir fried (with bean sprouts, green onion, celery, garlic, black soy sauce) to be on the salty side and heavy on the MSG.  

My \"#44C Kanom Jean Gaeng Kiew Wan\" or Green Thai curry w/vermicilli noodles was a bit on the watery side for me.  Taste was actually good and liked the red peppers, bamboo shoots, basil w/eggplant.  Another problem w/this was that there was no vermicilli noodles!  They realized this and made a conscious effort to correct this.  I requested to have rice with this instead.  

Another person in our party found a long-white strand of hair in his \"#38 Pad Ka-Ree\" noodles, yeeellch!!!  Presumably from the cook.  They were apologetic and offered to redo the order.  Some in our party said that they would have left the restaurant if that would have happened to them but we stayed instead.  

All this mind you, the whole time during our meal experience we were swatting away 4-5 annoying flies at our table that decided to keep us company.  You swat one away, the other two comes in.  You swat the other two away, they circle around to surprise you on the other end.  Fair to say that this definitely became an issue during our dining experience because my two godsons hysterically made it a game laughing through out our meal by trying to swat away the fly attacks:  \"Hey look!  There is another one!  Here it comes again!\" ... Jeezz!"}
{"text":"Bad service, mediocre food at best.  SERIOUSLY consider being extremely firm on the staff if you like good / real thai food and go here.

Good selection and menu - pictures and descriptions are above par for most thai restaurants.

Had to request the soup to be sent back three times because it was not hot enough (read: lukewarm).  I have been to enough thai restaurants around the country to know its not served like that.

For the entree, atAsked the waiter for spicy 'hot', exact words \"Thai natural hot - the Oh my god I'm on fire hot\", what did I get: a lit matchstick lost in a blizzard.   It was more of a congealed oozing mess on a plate not a distinct toss of noodles, chicken, and spices.. I agree with the reviewer who said it was hard to mess up certain thai sauces but coconut soups dont have a full can of soup poured in.

I had to get up multiple times to get assistance.. I don't think the waiter was deliberately negligent, nor was he overloaded.  I think his mind was somewhere else.  First to get the chopsticks and hot sauce that we had asked for and second to ask for getting the soup heated up and to get more water.

The tables are close enough together that when the waiter did not bother to look over at me or the table despite my \"Hey, I'm the customer asking for something\" hand up and looking right at him, it was clear I was being ignored. 

When I did not leave a tip because of the service?  The waiter ran out of the store after me to ask if I did not have good service.  -- don't chase me down to my car, your manager (?) will hear about it one way or another.

:soap box:
Thai (and other asian) restaurants - when a customer says \"give me authentic, i've had it before\" - dont pussy foot around and feed me the regular food.  I know you can do better.

American restaurant-goers - stop giving out tips just because you are eating out.   Be realistic enough to give $0.00 tip if you don't get the basic service - if there is an error and the waiter does not apologize or even wait to see if it is to your liking - that's a clear sign.  You wouldn't buy a tv with no electricity would you?

I'm a firm but fair tipper.  Be one too.  You and your pocket book are not cheap - especially in this economy.  And this restaurant's waiter helped to remind me. 
:soap box:"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Service was horrible. We went close to closing time. The waitress just rude and was not helpful in answering our questions. After giving us the food, we never saw her come by again."}
{"text":"Gaang Ped (spelling?) with the red curry sauce & chicken... fabulous.  Great service, very tranquil inside.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times in the 4.5 years that I have been in Madison. The first time I was here was definitely not planned. My roommate and I were heading to Saigon noodles, but they were super busy one evening (before they renovated and expanded the area), hence we stopped by Sai Bai Thong. I have had the pineapple dried rice, which was a pretty nice and interesting dish. The fried rice was contained in the shell of the pineapple instead of on a plate. The natural pineapple flavors infused into the rice, adding a truly refreshing taste to it. I am not sure if this dish is still being served, that was one of their specials some time back. 

Today I dined in again and had the duck curry. Serving is decent and our waitress was good. But I find that the curry is a tad too salty for my taste. Given the price range and the type of food this is not one of my regular go-to places, but once in a (long) while, if I am looking and looking for a place different to eat, I would give it a go."}
{"text":"If I were just reviewing for the food, my review would be much higher.. But, considering this was the absolute slowest service I've had in as long as I can remember, that cannot go forgotten. 

Our server seated us in a section with only one other group there and first made us wait about 8 minutes before even bringing us water and menus. Of course, we had to wait far longer than necessary before we could order. We decided to each get entrees and then split an appetizer. By this time, the other group in our section had already left (so in other words, this place is not busy, and in fact fairly empty) and we had  to wait over 30 or 40 minutes for our *appetizer*. The waiting's not over. Then the waitress brought out my friends' food about 10 full minutes before mine. (By this time, it had already been at least an hour from when I ordered), 

Q. Did I order something special or difficult? 
A. No. I ordered soup. 

By the time it came for paying and getting our check, we thought our server must have gone on break or something. It was beyond ridiculous how inattentive she was.

The entire experience took about 2 hours in total in a not-busy restaurant. Good thing the food was fairly tasty, but that wasn't enough to get out the bad taste in my mouth about the service."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place as Pad Thai is a favorite of mine and their website boasts \"Best Pad Thai in the state!\". Honestly, is this some sort of joke? My lunch special was teeny tiny, and luke warm at best. I ordered my dish \"Adventure\" level of spicy which is second to most spicy and, honestly, this Pad Thai has zero spiciness to it. Not a mild level of spicy, NONE. I have a pretty bad cold and I was really looking forward to some spicy food. There are a few stray pieces of beef mixed in with the pork that I ordered. It was edible, but I am not sure I will be back.

Edit: I thought I would give this place another go since it's the closest Thai restaurant to my work. Again I got the pork pad thai. It was hot this time and it was spicy, but again not as spicy as I was anticipating for choosing the spiciest option. I may go back from time to time."}
{"text":"I regularly frequent both this University Ave. location & the westside Sa Bai Thong on Odana- and cannot say which I prefer, which is probably for the best- since either location will serve you delicious food in a comfortable and easy-going environment; I'd hate to steer you towards either direction. Go wherever is convenient and experience the best Thai in Madison (at least in my opinion)... Lao Lang Xaan is a close second, but I appreciate the style of Thai cuisine served here, and that the ambiance is a little less \"busy\". 

Vegans, rejoice- all of their curries are made with coconut milk; traditionalists will find solace knowing this info as well. The sauces I've tried in all of the curry dishes I have ventured to order have been delicious and well-seasoned. Brown or white rice if you're feeling adventurous (as adventurous as you can get by picking a different color for your rice). 

I appreciate the consistency of Sa Bai Thong, I've ordered the same dish multiple times at either location and it is always yummy! I can't attest to the \"authenticity\" of the Thai grub here- being a Madisonian born and raised and never traveling to Thailand... (perhaps the reason why I am not giving it a full 5-stars?)

But, I very much enjoy healthy and delicious food- and this restaurant has never left me disappointed. 

Thanks Sa Bai Thong,

Victoria"}
{"text":"Worst service ever:  Dinner partner asked that entree not be served until we completed appetizers.  The female server pulled a face, stormed off, and returned with the main course fifteen minutes later, set it rudely on the table, stalked off without saying a word, ignoring our empty beer glasses, returned twenty minutes later, asked if we would like more beer.  Justifiably peeved, my dinner partner said, \"no but we would have when you dropped the main course off. \" The server replied that we were being, \"really rude to her and making her feel uncomfortable,\" and sent another server by to, \"take care of us.\"  When we requested to speak to the manager, he replied that the restaurant does not have a manager, whereupon we opted to leave.  The food was not particularly good, but coupled with the service, I can only suggest that curious diners  AVOID THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very friendly staff! Things labeled \"spicy\" on the menu aren't really spicy, though. But the food is always amazing, so it's forgivable."}
{"text":"I was so excited to move to Madison because of all the ethnic food.  We love Thai food- mostly curries and Pad Thai.  We chose this place to be our first Thai restaurant because it seemed to have pretty great reviews... We did takeout, and I feel bad giving it a one star because I'm sure they are nice people... So, I'm giving it 2 stars because it wasn't disgusting... But... It wasn't good... At all.  I ordered Pad Thai with tofu...yikes. Sorry... Where is the best Pad Thai??! Help! Who knew Phoenix had better Thai food??!"}
{"text":"The yellow and red curries are delicious, and the eggplant was good too.  My girlfriend said the primary color scheme felt like a Gymboree.  We did have to wait a while to be seated and have our order taken.  Better Thai food than I expect from the Midwest.  I will be going back as it's a nice alternative to all the crappy chain food in off the beltway."}
{"text":"Sa-Bai has great food at affordable prices. Great Curries and great Pad Thai. The Pad Tai noodles have changed at the Odana location. Both places are great but the noodles on University are the best. I'm not a vegetarian but I love their tofu! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am in love with pad thai.  No, really.  And Sa-Bai Thong was the matchmaker.  I travel often and when I run into a Thai restaurant, I often order pad thai.  

And then compare it to Sa-Bai Thong's.  

None, and I mean, none have matched the perfect balance of sweetness, saltiness, and sourness of Sa-Bai Thong's pad thai.  I've been to Thailand and back and am still thinking about Sa-Bai Thong's. 

Unfortunately, we are now long-distance lovers.  

And all the talk about their volcano chicken--oh yeah.  Ooooooh yeah.  I am salivating just thinking about it, which means you just have to try it yourself to know why.

P.S.  I remember waiting for my party at the entrance of the restaurant and noticed Sa-Bai Thong had received an award for the TOP 50 Thai restaurants in the USA.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Update 6/13 - Hadn't been here in 5 months. First, sad to report the size of the curry portions have decreased substantially (obviously noticeable in the size change of the take out containers) and the cost increased. Really chaps me when places do this to the point where it becomes less enjoyable. Secondly, they got the spicy order of curry mixed up with the non-spicy curry (sounds small, but when one person can't take spicy, this is a major major issue). Finally, we got a beef salad and the beef was very gamey. I mean, I seriously think it might have been venison. Down to 3 stars Thong, close to 2...

-----
Started eating takeout here regularly a couple months ago because it's close and we like Thai food. After exploring the menu a bit I've got the deal here now.

Get the curries. Don't mess around with the noodle dishes or soups unless you're really into these. The Pa-nang and Squash curries are the ones we've focused on, and now order little else. 

The pad thai is meh, the coconut soup is not good and the several other non-curry dishes have been flat out bad.

The online ordering is great and the food is always ready when we show up. 5 stars for the curry, 3 stars for everything else."}
{"text":"Last visit here left much to be desired. Our food took more than 30 minutes with nobody refilling our waters or responding to polite requests for an update on our food after 30 minutes. The place was far from full and I have had better pad thai s ."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a friend and the food was okay.  I had the panang curry with chicken which was alright.  It wasn't oily like other panang curries I've had at other thai restaurants, however, it was a lot more peanutty than what I expected.  Also, they could use more chicken in the dish especially when you have to pay more for the meat.  Service was alright, we didn't have to wait long for a seat and got our food and drinks quickly.  Wouldn't mind checking this place out again.  The prices were not bad at all."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian restaurant ever. The service was excellent very friendly staffs. The food take a little long but that's okay because the food was awesome. Big portion, reasonable price. This is the number one place I would recommend for the Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros:

Love their veggie panaeng (sp?). ..and I love, love, love the veggie Tom Ka.... and their egg rolls... and their spring rolls...

Cons:
* Sometimes there are communication problems ordering by phone, so now we go there and place our take out order in person. Also they claim to deliver but when we tried to have an order delivered they said they couldn't find our street  so we had to pick up.

* Went there 30 minutes before closing to dine in one time and they refused to seat us, saying they were going to be closing, but said we could order take out :(  Maybe they should advertise the last time they will seat people instead of what time they close.

*While they serve lunch on the weekends, they don't offer their lunch menu, only the dinner menu. (Their lunch menu portions are smaller than the dinner menu, as well as less expensive.)

Even with the cons, I love the veggie panaeng too much to stay away."}
{"text":"I just love this place. I like to try something new each time I go, and I haven't tasted anything less than stellar. My favorites are Pad Ped and their yellow curry. Om nom nom."}
{"text":"I could eat their Kao Pad Fried Rice every day - it's that good. And their crab rangoons! Making me hungry right now just thinking about it! Service is always great whether you dine in or order takeout/delivery. Fast, easy, delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, but it's constantly incorrect when you order to go. Quadruple check your order and check the receipt AND the bag. 9/10 times my order is wrong."}
{"text":"Curry dish there is awesome! esp. the duck curry.
love the Thai iced tea too but the pad thai is just okay."}
{"text":"Would give them zero stars if I could. Ordered take out from this Thai restaurant. They forgot to give me half the order. Did not realize their error until I got home.  They were very unapologetic. They then asked me to return to pick it up. We kindly requested them to deliver the food as it was their mistake. Two hours later, and after several phone calls, they finally delivered the food.  Terrible service. Mediocre food.  Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Everything was great. Crab rangoons are a must have and the curry fried rice was wonderful. With so many options on the menu, you could eat here regularly and never get bored. Also surprisingly good ambience for a strip mall restaurant."}
{"text":"Asian food doesn't usually agree with me, so I avoid eating at asian food spots all around. The only exception is Sai Bai Thong (and Bandung). The pad thai, shrimp, and cucumber salad are my favorites. The soup is also very tasty. Mmmm. This is a locally owned restaurant which I appreciate.  The service is always pleasant and the pricing is decent."}
{"text":"This wasn't the best thai food I have ever eaten in my life, but it was pretty solid.  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and immaculately clean.  Some have complained of slow service, but when we went we had an excellent and efficient waiter.   Like others, I think that the curry dishes are better than the noodle dishes and will be ordering curry from now on."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in my food tonight. The Tom Ka soup was sour with no spicy kick and the noodle dish was very bland."}
{"text":"Sa Bai Thong has pretty tasty food, all in all, but I've now been there three times, and each time it took forever for the food to come. The *least* I've waited is 30 mins, which I'd see as too long at L'Etoile, let alone here! On my most recent visit, my watch tells me that I waited 45 mins, though if you told me I was 5 years younger when I entered, I'd believe you.

Not only do they take their time, but they don't really seem to care either. The waiter came to apologize after a full 40 mins. 40 mins?! He didn't think I might have been hungry a whole 25 mins ago? And then, as if to rub salt into the wound, he proudly told my wife and I that the extra bowl of rice would be complimentary. I'm surprised he didn't add that the lemon in my glass of tap water was complimentary too!

As for the food, it's pretty decent. I say \"pretty\" to hedge my bets, since I've now tried 6 dishes there in total, and I'd say that 2 were below average, 2 were good, and 2 were excellent.

Thus, I'd recommend you go to Lao Laan Xang or Vientiane Palace instead. Even if you don't live near either of those places, the time you'd spend getting there would be wasted waiting for food at Sa Bai Thong anyway."}
{"text":"This is really not a good Thai restaurant. Their dishes are severely lacking in vegetables, freshness, and flavor. Case in point; The summer rolls had brown lettuce, meek amounts of mint and/or cilantro (if any). Pretty sure the Pad Poy Sien only had onions and mushrooms although the description suggested it should include pea pod, baby corn, bamboo shoot, napa cabbage, mushroom, cauliflower, and broccoli. And the Kao Pad Karee
had little to no crab meat, and two halves of a cherry tomato (one single cherry tomato!). Madison may not be the Thai restauarant capital of the world, but there are plenty of better options to choose from and I highly suggest doing so!"}
{"text":"Food n service was great. Nice ambience. We had spring roll , fried rice , and was made amazing , so far best thai restaurant in madison area"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Thai food. I've had better. They could easily provide a little more sauce, as the food seems kind of dry. They give you a generous amount of food, but it's a little pricey considering the slightly-above-average quality. All in all, if they added more sauce to the food, I would be a happier customer. I'm a sauce guy, I'm all about the sauce. The sauce is boss."}
{"text":"Just awful.  Pad Thai tasted greasy, gooey and sweet.  Ginger beef, the Friday night special, tasted even worse.  Not sure the beef was even fresh, it may have been chipped beef it was so dry and flavorless, and the curry sauce tasted like it was out of a can. Sa Bai Thong was a favorite of mine years ago but it's food quality has fallen.  Service slow too."}
{"text":"The Tom Kha soup, the scallion dumplings and the green curry are all toe-curlingly good here.  Once in a while, a stir-fry may be uninspired. It's a huge menu you...so you just don't order that again.

The service is consistently good, but the food comes out fast, so if you want a relaxed meal, order your drinks, wait a bit, order the dumplings, wait a bit, order the main. Otherwise, you might be out of there in a blink."}
{"text":"All was good until we struggled to communicate splitting checks. Group of 9 of us went and ordered 8 dishes to share. I didnt actually do the ordering so I will try my best to remember.  Volcano chicken (crispy yum! - sauce tastes pretty much straight out of the sweet dumpling sauce bottle...), some duck curry (good, huge chunks of duck!), some red curry (pretty standard), scallop and veggie dish (salty/seafoody), pad thai pad seew ( both standard), fried rice (standard/more saucy than other places)."}
{"text":"Not as good as my last visit. The Tom yum soup smelled like a fried fish. The pad thai was ok."}
{"text":"Sa Bai's two locations, one (recently renovated) on the near West Side, one further West on Odana's restaurant strip, serve reliably satisfying and very tasty Thai food and are justifiably local favorites in a town that loves Thai food and supports quite a few of them for a city of its size. (Lao Lan Xing has its advocates, and is also very good, but I think Sa Bai is the best of the local choices). it's rare for us to enter the University Ave location without running into one or more sets of friends.There is a large menu with many delights; at least until recently, the Odana (not Obama, not Osama) location had a few additional dishes, especially good at dinnertime. The chefs are cooperative with spicing requests, allowing for more assertive dishes than are available in most Madison Asian restaurants. Food usually tastes fresh and lively. Soups and noodle dishes are usually excellent (my wife is addicted to their tofu pad thai, and we both love their tom ka gai); I also enjoy their duck dishes, which are better than most duck dishes available in Madison. Service at the University Ave location is friendly and usually quite quick, even at busy times; the Odana location is spottier, often with long waits at dinnertime.  Parking at Univ Ave location can be awkward at peak lunch times--the shopping mall parking lot is relatively small and badly engineered for the activity level.

BTW, for an entirely other dimension in Thai cuisine, get yourselves to Arun's in Chicago for a sublime gourmet tasting menu, at 4 star big city prices and worth every penny (if you have been saving pennies for a long time, and don't need them to pay for health insurance)."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and both the service and food are great. The space is a little small but you definitely don't feel cramped at all. It's also nice and clean.

The servers are always really nice and attentive, which I appreciate. For appetizers, I have had the Shrimp Purse and the Crab Rangoon. I prefer the Shrimp Purse over the Rangoon - I've had better Rangoon at other restaurants.

For main dishes, I have tried both the Pad Thai and the Mus Mun curry. The Pad Thai is always good, definitely a safe bet here. I've only gotten it with Tofu. The Mus Mun curry was my latest adventure - it was very good! The seasoning was perfect and I really appreciated both the sweet and white potato in the curry. It could have used more peanuts but that's just me being picky. 

Food always comes out within 15 minutes of ordering. We've been in and out in less than an hour. Is it the best Thai food in Madison? No, but it still has a lot to offer!"}
{"text":"I take my family here ( a bunch of picky-eating-indian-oldies) and they LOVE IT. With a  good amount of spice in their dishes, this place is a go to if you like Thai. I recommend the jungle curry- it's a winner. I also like their teas. 

So overall, a great place I'm pretty thrilled by it. I will always go back (or order in, free delivery after 5)"}
{"text":"We've been patrons of Sa-Bai Thong for many years but tonight was enough to put us off. Our normal order was insipid to the point of yucko, and when I called to talk with the manager I was informed that everyone had left already. Not the experience I expect and I'll see what response I get tomorrow morning, What a disappointment after a long day"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with a roommate. I ordered number 57 or 55, a curry of veggies with chicken off their favorites menu.  It was good.  It was an orange or red color curry with different veggies including Thai eggplant.  It also came with thin clear noodles, which was a pleasant surprise for me.  The plate came with a side of white rice.

The roommate ordered a roast duck curry and that came with four pieces of duck that was breaded and fried.  Mmm... it definitely wasn't what I was expecting, but the fried duck was delicious.  It was fatty and well cooked and seasoned.  This also came with an orange/red colored curry and came with bamboo shoots, grapes, pineapple chunks, and red peppers. Yum.

The service was nice and the place was clean and new.  A bit overpriced and moderate portions."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Sa-Bai Thong, it was awful.  I ordered a noodle dish that gave no indication of the sauce, and it was a soupy brown flavorless sauce that drove me nuts.  I ended up dumping an entire condiment dish of chili pepper into my food just so SOME flavor would come up as I fished my wide noodles out of the sauce.  NOT happy.

The second time, though, was better.  I had the red curry squash, and it was decent.  Not great, but okay.  My partner's Tom Ka soup was alright as well.  

Overall I would give the food 2 or 2.5 stars.  But I'm adding another .5 stars because I really like the cheerful decor and the huge windows that let in lots of natural light.  If they could just somehow find a way to dampen the obnoxious conversations of some of their patrons, the atmosphere would be great."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place more stars, I really do.

This place has a really nice interior that's cozy and intimate. 

The service is also great, and we were never lacking for water.

Plus, they give you chocolates at the end of the meal, instead of cheap candy.

However, as a food lover first and foremost, I can't give this place more than 3 stars. I got one of their rice noodle dishes, and while the portion was good, the taste left more to be desired. 

The entire meal was too one-dimensional (for the lack of a better term). The soy/hoisin based sauce was just too overwhelming. Everything tasted the same, from the noodles (which were overcooked by the way, so it kinda just melted in your mouth. I don't know about you guys, but I like my noodles with texture) to the vegetables to the meat.   

But then again, I've only had this one dish, and my friends assure me their curry is quite good. I will give them another chance in the future, because I honestly do like their decor and service.

PS: You get a free banana fritter dessert on your birthday!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food. We've been to Sa-Bai Thong on the West side many times and it's always great! So flavorful and delicious. I was looking forward to trying this location.

We went for a late lunch on Saturday. There was plenty of parking and plenty of seating. Our waiter ushered us to a table and then brought us water. We ordered the gui chai (chive dumpling), the pork larb, and the pad thai. I've had chive dumplings before, but this preparation was different. There were two steamed rice-flour dough bite-sized dumplings. I was not a fan of the texture. I definitely prefer these fried. The flavor was good. I've also had amazing larb before but this was not it. Two lettuce leaves filled w/ground pork and onions. It was fine, but not particularly flavorful, not at all spicy, not much ground rice and I thought the portions seemed small. I was still quite hungry after we finished. Similar to the larb, the pad thai was fine but far from the best. Very little spice, not a ton of vegetables, it was a decent portion and had some hints of flavor but didn't have the fresh and intense flavors I associate with Thai food.

We'll probably just stick with the West side location."}
{"text":"aweful service. I came here by myself for dinner and ordered a pad Thai and Thai tea. Their food is fine, you can find similar quality Thai food in Madison elsewhere. Here is the fun part: 
Not a single time the server came to my table and asked about the meal. She gave the check to me when I'm not even half way done with my meal.  The only time that she asked a question to me is when she returned the credit card slip and \"reminded\" me, this receipt did not include tip, you need to tip me..."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Thai food here, and great prices for a lunch. Today's choice was #39, a great coconut soup noodle dish that reminded me a lot of a bowl of Singaporean laksa. Very friendly staff, clean and pleasant atmosphere. My one gripe is that you have to ask for your food to be on the \"adventurous\" side of the spice level, and even when I do that it still comes out laking fiery heat. And when I've asked for the food to be very very spicy, the heat level is jacked up with the addition of extra chiles on top of the food, and it seems like the flavor hasn't permeated the whole dish. But if you like your Thai on the mild side, no worries at all."}
{"text":"Mediocre thai-food, nothing to write home about. The service was mediocre. Bonus points for delivery, which is nice when it's freezing out and you don't want to leave home."}
{"text":"Everything was great until I experienced a colony of flies at the corner of my table, and spent the whole meal killing them by snapping a wet rag at them.  I've been there many times, but it will be a long time before I come in again.  A customer should never experience that."}
{"text":"We come here often because we love thai food and it's the closest one to us, but honestly it's not that good. 

The pad thai is not good here. In our most recent visit, it tasted really off and I didn't eat more than two bites. They didn't ask if anything was wrong, or offer to replace it, just If we wanted a box. No Thank you. 

A consistently great dish, thought is Yum ta Wei. The peanut sauce is excellent."}
{"text":"I've been to both the downtown and west side locations. Decent Thai food.

I like that Sa-Bai Thong offers more appetizers than most Asian restaurants. I especially enjoyed the Shrimp Purse. Their entree menu was already pretty extensive, but I've only tried the noodle dishes and haven't ventured out further. The staple Thai favorites -- Pad Thai and the Pad-Z You -- were decent. 

If you're craving Thai food in Madison, you'll have to go to Sa-Bai Thong because it's the only Thai restaurant in the area. But they're not a bad option. Service is a hit or miss. I've had horrendous service here, but I've also had pretty good service here as well."}
{"text":"I actually like the food. It's delicious! They give you a fair amount. The ONLY thing I do not like is the service. I'm not saying all the employees are bad or that they suck at what they do, but there IS one particular employee that is quite .... unbearable. Honestly, I think this lady is one of the people who owns the restaurant. She's an elder woman who just gives off a negative vibe. Every time she came to give us our food, she kind of slammed it on the table and she just looked like she didn't give a shit."}
{"text":"Delivery review.

Good food. Their online delivery system is hit or miss--last time I ordered from them, we received no delivery confirmation, and when I called the restaurant, they said they never got the order, so we reordered. About 45 minutes later, our food arrives. Great! We eat. 30 minutes later... our food arrives. Whoops! Guess they did get the first order only had no record of it...? The delivery person was super understanding and it worked out, just makes me hesitant to order online.

Great food. Very complete GF option list on their website--most of their food is GF friendly, and they deliver, which many places don't. I love the pad thai and spring rolls. Addicted to their soup!"}
{"text":"So I changed my mind a bit. Fair is fair. I really didn't like this place when I first came to Madison. The service was terrible. I still would be careful if you are busy. The Pad Thai is still not my favorite. But there are some good options there. I really like the appetizers a lot and their curry is pretty good. The food is consistent."}
{"text":"Food was ok.Service was absolutely horrendous.Monday night, empty restaurant i.e we were the only diners there and the server had the audacity to ask us to give him the full order so that he wouldn't have to keep coming back.WTF? After he got us our food we never saw him again. I had to go looking for someone to ask for the check and some containers.Go figure.I was wondering where everyone was so while leaving I took a glance and there were 4-5 staff sitting around a table talking their heads off, laughing, joking, what have you.This is the last time we visit this place."}
{"text":"Amazing yellow curry! My favorite in Madison. The ambiance and building is old, but the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Overpriced and really not great. Even more Madison Thai food, it under performs."}
{"text":"Always look forward to getting take out here. The staff is friendly, and the Tom Ka soup is to die for! Delicious!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. Do not order delivery from this restaurant.

Our food took 2.5 hours to arrive, and the manager refused to refund our money. The first time it was supposed to arrive, it took over an hour, but then the delivery driver called to inform us that it had exploded in the car so he had to go back to the restaurant to reorder it. Then it took another hour. By that time, my boyfriend was on the phone with the manager, who refused to refund our money and offered only a 20% discount. 

I've worked in restaurants before and have had enough bad dining experiences to know that the manager in this situation should have automatically refunded our money without even being asked to do so. That she didn't is the sign of a bad manager who doesn't care about keeping customers--she lost me as a customer. I will never eat Sa Bai Thong food again."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to the area about 7 years ago and when in Madison we often have dinner before the hour drive home.  We get in a dining \"rut\" sometimes, often visiting the same restaurant over and over.  But we never get tired of Sai-Bai Thong. We often end up there when we had earlier decided on a different restaurant.  My dinner is always excellent.  The portions are good, and there is always enough for an adequate lunch the next day.  The staff is always pleasant and courteous and a clean environment.  Try the Summer Roll appetizer.  We love them.  I have tried the meals with Crispy Duck, and found them a bit fatty, but that's duck in general, and I am not a deep fry kind of guy.  I have to say also, that I find some of the lesser rated reviews a bit base-less on my experience. We'll always return to Sa-Bai Thong."}
{"text":"Curry fried rice is pretty amazing! 

I ate here last night and was very pleased with my choice of food. The curry fried rice is delicious with the right amount of heat. I tried my friend's pad Thai and it was just okay. Certainly not something I would ever order. 

Service could most definitely be better. Once our food was brought to the table, we didn't see our server again until he brought the check. My Pepsi was empty for half of the meal and I really wanted a refill. 

I will be back for the curry fried rice."}
{"text":"Very good Thai. Ordered 3 entrees to share with 3 people and still had leftovers. We loved the Pad thai, pa neng curry was delicious. Delivery came quicker than anticipated. Will order again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice lately and both times have been impressed. I am always looking for the perfect Pad Thai and this is right up there for the Madison area. Their everyday special is Pad Panang, which is pretty much the same thing and very good. A must try if you like Pad Thai. This was at noon and our waitress was very good and the food came fast. I got the dinner portion for around 12 dollars and it was just right for me. The smaller lunch portion is fairly big but I was hungry this day. They do have beer and wine so you can also relax with that if you want. The parking can be a little sparse here at the wrong time so be prepared for that. It is definitely a restaurant worth checking out."}
{"text":"My husband, 20-something son, and I enjoyed our dinner last Sunday evening at Sa-Bai Thong on Odana Road. The restaurant was clean, nicely decorated, and had the most delicious dishes. Our bus boy brought us water promptly, took our drink orders and answered our questions with ease about the menu.  The fun continued when the manager?? Fawn?? cheerfully brought our drinks and chatted with us about the different dishes we'd ordered. My husband likes really HOT peppers, so she brought him 4 dishes of her hottest peppers. I had the rice noodles with peanut sauce, chicken, shrimp, and veggies,-a special that night, my son had a dish with bean sprouts, red curry sauce and veggies w/ rice, and my husband had -Pad Bai Ka Prao **
Basil, mushroom, bamboo shoot, green bean, red and green pepper with fresh chili sauce with beef, and above mentioned hot peppers smothered on it. Fawn and the water guy were very attentive and friendly. The red curry sauce was amazing. I would definitely recommend eating here and maybe you will lucky enough to have Fawn as your bartender/server. My son is planning on ordering take out and delivery in the future given the reasonable prices, large portions, freshness, (did I mention how great the shrimp and chicken were in my dish?). 
I have eaten at the one on University Avenue in Madison 3 times, and all have been great."}
{"text":"We shared a coconut chicken soup, cucumber salad, crab rangoon and shrimp pad Thai with oolong tea. Each item was absolutely delicious! The cucumber salad was perfectly topped with chunky peanut sauce and balanced with the right spice. The soup was not too spicy and enough for two of us to each have hearty bowls-- soooooo good! The crab Rangoon could've had a bit more crab, but it was still wonderful. The shrimp in the pad Thai was also great! Small, quaint place but EXCELLENT service!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and it wasn't half bad.

Ordered the Guey Teuy Kee Mao with Adventure spiciness and it was actually pretty decent. May be a staple for me if I can't get over to Ha Long Bay!"}
{"text":"I went to Sa-Bai tonight with my younger daughter.  She loves red curry, and the menu I found online had many.  I was just simply loved it!  Had veggie egg rolls, Mieng Sabsi, Red Curry with tofu and veggies (Gaeng Ped) with added baby corn (kidlet loved her some baby corn!), a dish with veggies and chicken, can't remember name, the one with lemongrass sauce, extra spicy.  All of it was just wonderfully, flavored, and the right amount of sauciness, pad thai was perfect, red curry just spicy enough for my girl, and my dish spicy, but I added lots of their hot sauces and pepper flakes anyway. And that Mieng Sabsi was really nice.  I had asked for the eggrolls and asked the waitress for a recommendation.  She said the sabsi becuase I already had a deep friend appetizer.  A great idea, and it was really tasty.  Some noodles, a shrimp, nuts, some flavors, on a small lettuce leaf.  And a great sauce.

Also a wonderful shout out to the waitress, she was just so nice, she helped us with the menu (they had so many red curries, we had a hard time picking, so she listened to what we said, asked a few questions, and she came up big), and when we left she told me how to make some good fried rice with the extra white rice we ordered :-)

I reccomend this place highly, it was just right for us, for whatever reason."}
{"text":"My mother, sister and I had an unexpected girls date here after the cafe next door that we had planned on going to was closed. My sister and I are vegetarian, our mother is not. I had the tofu pad thai, which was delicious. I'm not a big fan of tofu, but this was spiced to perfection, so no complaints here. My mother had accidentally been given a shrimp entree when she had ordered the beef, but one bite in and she was glad she didn't ask to have it rectified. We sat out on the patio, which was super nice on a bright sunny afternoon. Our waitress was overall pretty attentive and made sure our glasses were always full. Would definitely check out again."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in the Mid-west. It reminded me a lot of the Thai that I have had in San Diego.  Very delicious.  They never asked me how spicy I wanted the food, but otherwise it was great.  The food wasn't too spicy though.  When I have Thai, I am always concerned about the heat.  

The Panang Curry was outstanding.  It had just the right amount of peanut sauce to coconut milk.  An

The restaurant is in a strip mall, but don't let the looks deter you.  The food is what you come for.  They give you a lot, so make sure that you have a big appitite or take some home. And as always the Thai Iced Tea is delicious."}
{"text":"I loves me some Sa-Bai Thong.  I might love it as much as I love Vientiane Palace, and that's saying something.  

They've redecorated recently, and it's very pretty.  In the past, it was not so much with the pretty.  But now you feel like you're having a fancy, lavish dining experience, even if you're only paying $10-15 for dinner.  That is a feeling I can get behind.

I love their Curry Fried Rice.  It is SO good.  This, above all else, is what I would recommend that you try first at Sa-Bai Thong.  I always get tofu, but whatever, pick your favorite protein.  I've had a few other things, but none are as good as this dish (obviously, since I can't remember what they are).

The waitstaff is beyond courteous and pleasant.  They deliver, which is a bonus.  Things can be a little bit slow, but not too bad overall."}
{"text":"Sa-Bai Thong started out as one of my favorite places.   But over time their dishes became more and more underwhelming.  Now the last time I had the duck it was quite good and the ginger tea is very good too.
Then we took a relative of ours who loves Thai food and he was actually upset with their lack of spice.  He said that it was not Thai when we left.
Their service has always been slow and this gets old over time so we have gone elsewhere for quite a long time now and don't expect to go back until we hear that they have improved their food and service."}
{"text":"Good thai food. Very standard fare but consistently good. I've been here many times and ordered take out as well."}
{"text":"This place was good, but not super memorable. You'll want to order well in advance if you are doing pickup or delivery since it takes a long time to get your food. I've never eaten at the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"The food was great! I enjoyed it a lot, although there was a lot of food for one person. But the service was horrible. Our waiter never approached us and we waited for at least 10 mins before we got our check, which was brought to us by another waiter. Over all the food was good but due to the service I would not be going back again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but only if the waiter gets the right order. 

First time ever where waiter has gotten my order wrong, but she gladly replaced the wrong dish with the correct one after I told her about it. Good service otherwise."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I've dined in twice and gotten carry-out twice. I think the portions might be slightly larger for carry-out, but they are really large, either way.

They have tons of vegan options if you just tell them you are vegan. I usually get the masaman curry with vegetables and brown rice, and it's delicious. My boyfriend loves the curry fried rice with tofu. I ordered a noodle dish once and was not as impressed with it, but it wasn't bad. I'll always go back to curry, though.

All the staff are SO friendly, too!"}
{"text":"This place has been a staple Thai place for a long time. Conveniently located by the UW-Hospital, it's a yummy and affordable lunch spot for me and my research team!

I recommend any of the curry dishes. Huge selection and you really can't go wrong with any of them. Fresh veggies, perfect level of creaminess and the rice is fresh and  hot. For lunch, you are also given a choice of a soup/salad with it.

Most recently, I ordered the Roast Duck curry. Roasted duck was also fried which I wasn't expecting, but was actually really good! The meat was still fresh and the crispy skin exterior added some nice texture to the curry. They do not fall short on the portions either! I recommend sharing this dish with another and then ordering a noodle or soup dish to share as well. 

I also ordered the Tom Ka with Shrimp which equally delicious. It was just the right amount coconut and creaminess and the lemongrass/ginger really shined through!"}
{"text":"Not great. During college I had the fortune of having four Thai restaurants next door to each other, spanning all levels of fanciness, authenticity, and price range. Also I had a close Thai friend who frequently came with me, so I feel like I have a good idea of what makes good Thai food. Thus, my hopefully informed verdict of Sa-Bai Thong is that it's underwhelming.

My standard order whenever I'm at a new Thai place is: chicken coconut soup and either a sweet-and-sour fish, pad thai, or massamam curry. I've had all of these at some point, and I don't find them exceptional. I thought the chicken coconut soup should be more savory. The fish sauce was a bit too thick and sweet. The pad thai, being so common, was not better than somewhere cheaper. And the massamam curry was again not savory enough, and I am almost certain that peas do not belong in it. 

I like Thai food in general, and since I also live really close, I've kept telling myself to give this place another try. But time and time again, I keep coming home disappointed. Don't make the same mistake I did."}
{"text":"A lot of dishes are almost flavorless. Like others have mentioned their curries are almost embarrassing.   Large menu so I'd imagine there are some decent dishes but overall pretty blah.  One standout is their soups."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend, and we both really enjoyed our meals.

Fast and friendly service, really nice dining space, extensive menu, large portions.

We stuck to the noodle dishes. I had the \"Pad Z You,\" which was just the right amount of sweet and came with TONS of broccoli. The rice noodles were soft and perfectly chewy.

Plus, the meal ended with an Andes mint for each of us. Yum."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at this actual restaurant, like I have the west side, but I've gotten plenty of deliveries from here. It's never really differed from the other location so I'm just going to copy the part that applies, \"The take out has always been FANTASTIC. I've tried many of their curries and I've never really disliked any of them. I definitely think the place is over priced, but I crave this place too damn much and end up paying the prices. I always have left overs and end up needing extra rice. Usually I'll just make it at home myself when I'm heating up left overs the next day. The times I've gotten extra rice, it heated up pretty well when microwaved with the curry.\""}
{"text":"First visit. Enjoyed decent  but not great green and red curry.  what we got portion size vs. price was out of line though. Service was very good but ive had better thai food  for less  and in just as nice a place."}
{"text":"Got take out here tonight - very nice people on the phone and in person, prompt service, delicious food.  Tofu was done to perfection and the food was piping hot.  The only reason I only give 4 stars is because I've only had one dish as take out and would need to sample others and check out the service and atmosphere before upping my star rating.  Great, quick dinner."}
{"text":"Came back another time. Was seated very quickly and service alternated between slow and excellent. Tried the pa naeng curry and the guey teuy kee mao (a stir fried flat noodle) with beef. The food was delicious this time. The noodles were spot on and the beef was nice and tender. In addition, the curry had a very good flavor and I was impressed with the vegetables they used. There was a huge lull in service and we weren't able to get chopsticks for 10 minutes after our food was dropped off though and it took awhile for us to get our bill (however, our server was very kind and I saw her drop off a birthday dessert for the table next to us so props to them). I would say it's a good place to come back to but the portions are very small for the curries for the price for what it is so its not an every day go to."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Thai cuisine, so this was one of the very first Thai restaurants I went when I moved to Madison. Ever since this very first time, I've returned and taken friends and family. This is one of my all time favorites thai's in town. Although on busy days service can be a little slow, their staff is very friendly and service is great.
Randomly I've always been there during lunch time and never for dinner, so I cannot comment on the dinner menu but I can give a review about lunch.
My favorites on their menu are Pad Thai, Pa-Naeng (be careful if you have a nut allergy) and Gaeng Kua."}
{"text":"We come here when ever we are in town. Great Thai food, reasonable prices, good service."}
{"text":"This place is decent. I don't really think you can go that wrong with Thai food and having just moved to Madison this was one of my first meals so it was pretty good. I had the massamun curry which was not to sweet. The pad thai here was also pretty good. Overall a decent restaurant in the area and I will probably come back if I am craving some Thai food."}
{"text":"I asked a neighbor from Thailand what he considered the best place for Thai food in Madison, and he pointed across the street. I'm still not quite sure whether the penance I would pay was a set-up. Ordered a few things here for takeout when my family was visiting, and what I remember best, the pad thai and spring rolls, were fantastically and unsavably bland. The takeout estimates were also way off. This would normally amount to an \"average\" experience but that I spent our last horrible, horrible winter without a car and without takeout from this location should speak to the impact of that experience."}
{"text":"Sa-Bai is one of my favorite places on the near-west side of Madison. The service is always relatively quick, the food is consistently good, and the location is very convenient.

I love the quirkiness that every time you go, the soup that comes with your meal is always slightly different. It makes going weirdly fun and mysterious."}
{"text":"The Gaeng Ped Red Curry entree with eggplant was incredibly savory!  I chose beef as the meat. Tofu is an option. I only wish the dish was larger for lunch for the price of $9.  It is one of the best curry dishes I ever had. 

Nice touch to have the soup prior, although only served about 1/4 cup, (small cup half full).  Wondered why for inexpensive vegetable broth with a few carrot and potato dices...

I always seek out curries in restaurants and wonder if it will provide the depth,intensity, and savory sensations of a good curry dish. Sa-Bai Thong did not disappoint. Loved the mixed brightly painted walls of the interior.  Would definitely return next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"i'm not quite sure what possessed me to give this place another shot, even though it was a different location this time. i guess i just really wanted some pad thai, even knowing that it would be mediocre at best. however, the food isn't what is giving sa bai thong a bad score this time, but rather the exceptionally poor service.

we got there around 1:30. there were about 2 other tables of people, and despite this fact, it still took 15-20 minutes for someone to take our order. the food took forever to get to us. the pad thai was better than the same dish from the west location, but that's not saying much... it was still greasy as hell and kind of bland. 

we were done with our meals for another 15-20 minutes before we were able to flag down the waitress to ask for our check. our plates were never cleared from the table. and then another 15 minutes went by... so we just grabbed the check and paid at the cashier. i shouldn't have even left a tip, but i did anyway. 

that was officially the last chance you had, sa bai thong. never again."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town! I love a good curry, and all of theirs are delicious. But my favorite is the pa-naeng curry! Oh or the gaeng ped or the ka-ree. You know, whatever you're in the mood for! Also the Pad Thai and Wonton soup are amazing. There is always really good service. Downside: waiting for a to go order to be ready. Upside: having a glass of wine while waiting for your to go order."}
{"text":"Always one of my go to restaurants for consistantly good food. Love their Yum with chicken. Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I eat take out from this place every week because someone else treats me. It gets worse every week. The very first time I went to Sa-Bai Thong the Pad Thai was adequate, however their curry was, and continues to be, awful. A Thai curry should lend a wonderful sensation of sweet and savory, but there is no sweetness in their curry. When I had the Panang there was some hint of flavor there, but later when I had the Masaman, I tasted nothing but a flavor akin to weak peanut butter suffocating my tongue. The take-out Pad Thai isn't even as acceptable as the dine-in Pad Thai, but this may be because it is suffering from the time elapsed during delivery. However, this does not excuse the dry noodles that fall apart as I scoop them up. Some curried green beans are the \"best\" dish that I have had, but again the flavors are so weak and flat that I am left pondering, what kind of curry is this?

And yes, there are an atrocious number of flies in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent Thai restaurant with a nicely-sized list of GF options on their menu. Their most recent remodel has created a nice, serene ambiance for a restaurant that's located in a strip mall.

Pad thai and spring rolls are excellent. Loved the Pad-Z-You before they switched from a thin rice noodle to a thicker one (it ends up overcooked and turns to mush.)

Delivery as an option is also useful."}
{"text":"All food we tried was fresh and tasted good. Love the fresh cilantro and other herbs I have no idea what they were (yeah, so I'm uncultured).  

Everyone in our group cleaned their plates. One of the diners wanted caffeine, so I suggested a Thai coffee. Between the sugar in the condensed milk and the caffeine, she was full of energy. She loved the drink so much she wanted more the next day. 

There's lot parking. 

We had an enjoyable meal and all agreed we would return."}
{"text":"I have been here plenty of times....lunch as well as dinner. The food is almost always good. In fact, the location on the west has a nicer ambience so I would go there, especially for dinner."}
{"text":"I simply feel like there are far better Thai food restaurants in Madison. 

I've tried the pad thai here twice, at both locations and have been disappointed twice. Too much sauce and it was too sweet both times. My significant other loves their pa-naeng and even he admits it is hit or miss. I once tried the Tom Yum Talay Hang and was really impressed. However, one meal out of 10 is not what I'm looking for. I'd rather go somewhere in town where the odds are better.

Try Lao Lang Xiang or Sala Thai for great thai food in Madison."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. Also a place that can satisfy most tastebuds from the picky eaters to the food snobs. This is also a great place to introduce those who only have had Chinese fast food. Trust me, their eyes will open and so will their tastebuds. Some of my all time favs are: roasted duck curry, Kra-prao and salmon cooked in banana leaf.

Their appetizers are pretty tasty and some are fun like the shrimp purse (basically egg rolls bundled up in a cute pouch), meing sabai (mini lettuce wraps), gui chai (choice dumpling). I've had entire meals of just a variety of their appetizers (tapas-style, why not?).


Service is pretty friendly but there has been a few times where they lack on checking back. So if you need anything or they missed an order, you'll need to just grab whoever comes by next cause there's a chance the next time you see your server, is when they hand you the bill."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to dining in, but after a long day out and about, all I wanted to do was curl up on my couch and watch Netflix. Thankfully, Sa-Bai Thong has an easy to use (albeit glitchy) online ordering system which allows you to place orders for pick-up or delivery. 

I ordered the pad thai, angel wings, and the pa-naeng (per the suggestion of a friend).

Sa-Bai Thong claims that their pad thai is 'the best in the state', so naturally, I had to try it. Although it is not the best I've had, I do think that it is one of the best pad thais I've had in the Madison area, but I wouldn't say it is THE BEST in Madison. I actually meant to eat half and save the other half for a friend, but I ended up finishing the whole takeout container full of pad thai. #noregrets. Tip:  A little bit of lime juice really brings out the flavors!

I'd never had angel wings at any other Thai restaurant before, so I decided to give them a try. I was hoping that they weren't deep fried, but they actually are - so if you are watching your diet, I'd stay away from them! For $4 you get two stuffed chicken wings, which I found pretty delicious, but I would probably never order them again.

I ended up saving the pa-naeng for a second meal. It was a little thick coming out of the fridge so I added a little bit of water and some broccoli/sweet peas which made the curry just perfect!! I'm really glad my friend recommended it!

I can't wait to be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I have been here countless times and have never been disappointed. They also have prompt delivery for those campus dwellers who are sans car. Everything here is delightful and amazing.  For vegetarians this menu is daunting. (So many options, but almost all menu items have a seafood, chicken, or beef/pork option.)"}
{"text":"The Sa-Bai roll was pretty weird.  Volcano chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a lower star than one because of how horrible the service was at Sa-Bai Thong. I had ordered food from  here via eat street. After waiting two and half hrs my food never showed up. The restaurant was using their own drivers , not eat street. After 90 mins I called the restaurant and got hung up on by someone then called back and got told they are running behind but my food will be there in 20 mins. After 40 mins, I called back, got hung up again, then called back and was told the same thing but still my order never arrived. Eventually I called eat street to cancel the order and a refund because the food never arrived.  

The worst part is there food is actually good, at least for madison,but their customer service and delivery is horrible. I hope whoever the owner of this establishment does a better job training because was some of worst service I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour 45 minutes and eventually cancelled the order.  You'd think they'd want to get the food out faster for delivery since our bill was $60.  The guy on the phone didn't even apologize.  I've eaten here before and the food is average.  I will never go back or order out from here again, period."}
{"text":"Great flavors, friendly staff, huge menu. Been here several times over the last year and have tried at least 6 different entrees, which were all delicious. 

The dining room to the left of the cashier area is surprisingly large and they could probably accolade a group of 12 with notice."}
{"text":"wow, i was kinda disappointed with this place. my stomach even feels kinda queasy, we just got home. 
i expected more - we went on a friday night, the place was busy. i didn't think it was hard to mess up sauces with coconut milk. i love coconut milk. 
we ordered: the potstickers (steamed) they were fine. one person ordered a soup-it was ok. it came with potstickers though that wasn't listed in the menu. 
someone ordered the curry fried rice with tofu-probably the best of the bunch.
i ordered the squash curry. hubby, curry duck. Both came with red curry. we know duck in general is fatty, but this was really fatty, and fried. the squash and thai eggplant in my squash curry wasn't ripe. My dish wasn't spicy at all.

i think there are too many items on the menu. Maybe editing down the menu would help?
we've had Thai in DC at dozens of places and all were better than this.

considering my positive experiences at many other Madison restaurants, i was surprised by how bad this place was."}
{"text":"I prolly would have the eggplant curry with tofu as my last meal if I was being executed. Glad it hasn't come to that. Portions have gotten smaller over the years but still enough for a normal meal--just want more of it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy ordering carry out from the restaurant.  They have just added on-line ordering so it is making it so much easier.  Food is great.  I try to run there for lunch two times a month.

On the few occasions I have eaten in the restaurant, I have found the staff helpful and friendly.  You get a salad or soup with the entree.  Yummy."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for my poor sister who ordered their delivery last night.  She ordered the spring rolls, summer rolls and mieng sabai.  She specifically asked no peanuts because she is still breastfeeding and her son is allergic.  After an hour wait, she received her food; ALL of it contained peanuts.  She called back the University location and was told that they would call her back. They did not. She then called the Odana location and was told that none of those dishes contained peanuts...hmm, funny because they did! The woman on the phone did not offer to remake the food or even offer an apology...tsk tsk. I understand that this is a family owned restaurant and inconsistency in service/food happens - but to simply not offer to remake her food was ridiculous because the order was wrong and she was unable to eat the food that she paid for.  

Service has always been a little iffy here, but because food continued to be yummy, we could not stop ourselves. But this time was the last straw. I hope Sa-Bai Thong can re-evaluate their customer service, or else they will continue to lose loyal customers their business is built upon."}
{"text":"I have been a longgggg time fan of Sa-Bai Thong.. never had a dish I didn't like. I did however order food to go tonight, and I'm wishing I hadn't. I have the University Ave number in my phone and it's the only one I ever call. I placed a very large order tonight to take to family I have at home, I get there and wait 20 minutes no problem. When I offer to pay to expedite my wait time I'm told that I called and places the order at their Odana location.. I didn't. I doubled checked in my phone to be sure. At first they offered to make me a new order but then the manager told the employee helping me that I'd have to wait for their delivery driver to bring it to this location from their Odana one and that it'd be another 40 minutes. No one apologized of even acknowledged that this was frustrating or out of character, on the contrary I was blamed for calling the wrong location even after showing that I had not.  I waited because the food would be thrown out if I just left and I'm not as rude as the service I received tonight. I am tentative about what I will do in terms of eating at this place in the future :("}
{"text":"I grew up in Madison and Sai-Bai Thong was the only Thai restaurant I'd ever been to until college.  Because of that I thought I hated Thai food.  

It wasn't Thai food's fault.  It was Sai-Bai Thong's fault."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai restaurant in town, but is an option for a simple meal.
They have more options in their dinner menu.
I like the roasted duck curry a lot, but not so much into the yellow curry. Pad Thai also seems good. Will give it a try next time."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place in Madison. Highly recommend this place for entrees, appetizers and their Thai beer. Took my wife and brother here and everyone loved it. Please try this place, you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  The service is a bit slow but the wait is worth it.  I prefer to get takeout.  The curry is amazing!"}
{"text":"Decent service, good atmosphere, great food! If you are looking for thai type curries and dishes this is definitely worth the try! I was pleasantly surprised by the Som Tum appetizer which is a salad mixture of shredded green papaya, carrots, tomatoes, green beans, peanuts, and an awesome spicy limy juice type of dressing . It was a refreshing start to my meal! As far as their curries go, my personal favorite is the Veggie Pa-Naeng or the Roast Duck Curry. Game Changer Pro-Tip: Substitute the roast duck for your curry sauce of choice. The duck is really crispy and adds a lot of flavor and texture to your dish!"}
{"text":"A little pricy for lunch but the peanut chicken, cucumber salad, and potstickers lunch special was pretty good. Food came quickly and service was good. Quiet music and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everytime minus one I go to SaBai Thong, I'm always satisfied.  Although I prefer Vientaine Palace (PARTICULARLY the one on Gorham) for Thai, this place is close to home, service is great, food is delish (AND HUGE portion size, I always get 3 meals out of this) and well... That's about all I have to say about that.

He he, You're probably thinking \"what happened to the minus one\" time?

Given that this is yelp, I'll tell you.

Being a vegetarian always limits my options (duh) not only for flesh including food, but also for things such as fish sauce or beef or chicken broth.  Mind you, I'm not dumb, and I know that while many times meals are *supposed* to be vegetarian, they probably include fish sauce or the sorts...

But I digress.

Once I had a dish (it was the something noodles, I don't remember their name, because I tried to remove this memory from my brain a la Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind), and i THOROUGLY asked whether it was made with beef broth.  Mind you, I have no idea why I asked BEEF broth in particular, but I was assured that it wasn't.

Yeeeeaaaaahhh...

10 mins after the food comes, my stomach started doing, well... ungodly things.  I ask again whether it has beef broth to a different server.  He assures me that it is.  4 mins post this I was in the bathroom, violently returning what I had just ingested.

Two days later, I was still in this mode.

After that, SaBai Thong got NO visits from me for at least a year.

But I still do love their cucumber salad, Kai Pad Kaprao, and Pad Thai..."}
{"text":"I don't think I've given a 5 star review for a Thai place yet and I'm happy to have SA-Bai set the standard. Fresh and interesting menu with options of beef, chicken, pork or tofu for most entrees make this somewhere I can bring my veggie friends. The staff was very helpful in selecting items and the menu clearly indicates the different spicy levels.

I got a red curry with chicken, squash, and pineapples and it was scrumptious. I'm usually really so so on Thai but if I ate here more often I could become a raving fanatic in no time! 

The portion was big for me, but was rightly sized in relation to the price. I still had plenty to take home and I had to literally force myself to stop eating so I could be able to move after dinner. It was that good.

Right near campus and with plenty of parking, this is a great location for the adventurous student, Eagle Heights residents, or anyone looking to get off the medical campus for a bit. I wish I knew about this place when I was a student!"}
{"text":"I've been here about three or four times.  Usually, it's pretty decent, but this past visit was not.  We ordered a Chicken Basil fried rice, which had a very nice flavor, but the chicken was over-cooked a bit.  The other item we had was a noodle beef dish. I had to spit out bites of grizzle on several occasions during the meal-yuck. The booth seating gets rather uncomfortable after about 15 minutes.  The lighting is odd and at times makes it difficult to read the menu. Our server was as nice as can be, but I asked her for chop sticks three times with no success.  Eventually, my meal was served, so I had to get up and ask a different employee for them. I don't plan to go back there any time soon. There are plenty of other Thai options in and around Madison."}
{"text":"Yelp looks like it's just taking off in Madison, so I'll forgive the paucity of 5-star postings about this place.  Suffice it to say that Sa-Bai Thong is the reason I learned to love Thai food at a young age, one of two suppliers (the other, the down-the-block Bahn Thai, sadly now closed) of what seems, in retrospect, like my weekly intake of curries, galangal, lemongrass, chilies, and tofu.  My mom, sister and I used to know what we wanted by the numbers on the menu only: 44B, red squash curry; 21 (was it?) Tom Yum soup.  It's won Best of Madison, like, eight or ten years in a row.  And Madison ain't lacking for Thai restaurants.

A recent post-tofurkey pilgrimage over Thanksgiving weekend reconfirmed in my mind all that is wonderful and godlike about this place.   I ordered my old standby, the squash curry, and was not disappointed.  I wished my stomach hadn't been so distended by mashed potatoes and vegan pie so I could eat 3 helpings' worth.

Having now been to Thailand and had the Real Stuff (TM), I can say with utmost conviction that this place is totally authentic in every way but one -- to accomodate the Midwestern palate, they've toned down their spicing menu to a four-star system: Tiny (*), Careful (**), Adventure (***) and Fire (****).  This time, I asked for Adveture, and was rewarded with a dish that was nice and warm, but nowhere near anything most Thais -- hell, Californians -- would call \"hot.\"

Verdict: Will rock your socks off.  Just ask for more fire."}
{"text":"Did not like the Crispy Duck.  Thought it would taste more like crispy skin duck.  Instead it was battered and fried and plopped in a pond of sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"Ran into this place by accident and really liked it. Cozy atmosphere, ethnic music and a good server added to the mood. The food was excellent. I'd recommend it to everyone who loves Thai food. One of the better places in town."}
{"text":"I just remembered that Sa-Bai Thong delivers and ordered in the other night when I was too lazy to cook or go out. It was a great decision. 

They were a little slow to get here but it was worth the wait. We ordered a feast-- I got the red squash curry and pad prio wan and spring rolls. He wanted to try something with duck (I think duck is too fatty in general and after this meal he agreed. people who like duck may like it, though) The serving sizes are large so you can split them or take home leftovers (this feast fed us for days)"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable, the review strictly applies to their delivery service. I'm in town for Epic and wanted to order food, I call at 4pm then the lady tells me they won't delivery until 530 (even though website says 430), I agree and remind her at least five times to pack some hot sauce/soy sauce. The food arrives around 540, it's cold noodles with no fork or condiments. The guy tries to argue and annoyingly says \"there are 2 locations, other one is closer to this hotel\" I understand that so I reply that I'm obviously not from Wisconsin so if distance was an issue, they should have said something when I called. I re-heat the food in the lobby microwave & then call the restaurant. I try to stay calm while I tell the lady that I requested condiments more than once, didn't get anything, no fork with my noodles and my food is cold. She has the nerve to argue over the phone then suddenly ignores me & starts talking to her co worker in their native language. I can't say I'm surprised, if language barrier is an issue then they should have someone who speaks proper English. In the end I just hung up while the lady the lady went on a rant with her co worker, never again."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Delicious food, all the time. I make it my small splurge for the week. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I like the curry here, pretty solid other dishes including volcano chicken."}
{"text":"I had a really nice meal here during a sad trip. It made my day better. Thanks!"}
