{"text":"Wonderfully delicious cupcakes! With a wide range of flavors to please any taste buds, the fact that these are gluten free is almost hard to believe. Friendly service and easy delivery."}
{"text":"There is no way that these treats can be good for you. I have never had Vegan, gluten free cupcakes, that tasted like the real thing, anywhere else!!! The only problem is they are not calorie free, because I would eat a dozen."}
{"text":"I have dietary restrictions right now, and I had a hankering for sweetness.
I asked the owner of Sugared Edge bakery if she could make cupcakes without sugar. She said she could try it, not having done it yet. So, I asked for an order of her famous cookie dough cupcakes, and a few days later I got them.

THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY DECADENT.
If I gave you a cupcake off of my plate, you would never guess it was only seven net carbs and gluten free. They are rich, moist and just to die for. I'm going to have a long night eating every one of them. They're just insanely good.

If you're reading this, you need to go there. Your kids birthday, your buddy's bar vitzmah, your wedding, a baby shower- who cares, you need these cupcakes there. 
Best. Cupcakes. Ever."}
