{"text":"Absolutely horrible.

In no particular order - 

- waited for 40 minutes for salads while restaurant was very slow
- wedge salad was a chopped salad
- waiter filled wine glass to rim and did not offer a tasting prior
- signature 3 finger pork chop was very bland for 48 hours of marinating
- signature prime rib was gray and very bland
- service was extremely slow and impersonal

Based on their website you'd believe you are going to a 4 star restaurant to \"indulge\" - don't be fooled.

I'd suggest one of the other chain restaurants by Concord Mills."}
{"text":"I've visited Rocky River Grille several times with my husband for dinner. After one bite of their burger - I was hooked! The restaurant is a hidden gem in the Embassy Concord. There is a separate bar area, which is nice if you want to watch TV - the restaurant side is fairly casual-mod, they even set all the tables for dinner with chargers.

The service can be hit or miss. The steakhouse sides are also hit or miss - the roasted asparagus was amazing, but the cowboy grits and bacon and mushroom mac & cheese were just so-so.  But I don't care about the service or the sides - just give me another burger! They are huge and juicy and cooked perfectly. Burgers are $9-10 - and totally worth every cent.

Follow them on Facebook, they put up specials from time to time (like free draft beer if you wear a jersey during football) and they also participate with restaurant.com."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on a Tuesday. Declined the buffet and ordered from the menu. Ordered an 8 oz filet (large)(medium rare) and my date ordered a Rib Eye. My filet came out extremely rare. Sent it back - which I normally don't do- would rather not eat. They fixed it by providing a 5 oz filet (small) extremely well done and almost burnt. I asked where it the rest of it ?  \"Well the chef cooked another piece for you\". So I paid for the large and got the small ?? They comped a dessert. Really? It came out still defrosting from the freezer.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Nice bar menu. Plenty of frequent guest at the bar enjoying a drink. If you're lucky Jessica will be behind the bar entertaining the customers."}
{"text":"Came in for the Queen's Feast. We had a great meal with fine service. It's worth a trip!"}
{"text":"I would like to thank Mr.Wood for his quick  response to my issue at the RRG on 11/9/14 (Embassy Suite, Bruton Smith Blvd, Concord NC). We spoke and I have accepted his apologize and me and my family are looking forward to returning soon for dinner. As I stated in my previous review the Food was Great!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon from the Charlotte entertainment book for $13 VIP certificate to Rocky river grille. We were staying at the embassy suites hotel & I was excited to have an opportunity to dine here. Service started out very slow. I waited for the hostess for about 7 min, then my waiter took another 10 min to see me. I waited that long only to be told that I was restricted to use the coupon to a menu that didn't accommodate me as a vegetarian. (The only entree meal I might could have chosen was fish) I didn't want any meat at all. They sell vegetarian burgers & I asked could an accommodation be made because of my diet. I was told no & sorry we can't substitute. Being that I chose the restaurant based on my options from the coupon book I purchased, I decided to leave. In a restaurant like this, I was surprised there was no full veggie option on the entree menu."}
{"text":"Sad to say this was the worst place me and my fiancé have ever ate at. The service was okay once she realized we were there, but the food was disgusting. I asked for my steak medium, it was black and tasted charred. Luckily we were offered a dessert after showing her the steak and that was the tastiest thing we had there."}
{"text":"Firstly I have to say that the food tasted good and I ate everything.  That being said, the steak was very well done and was ordered medium.  The side dish was not what was on the menu.  It called for risotto and we were served stuffing. The desert was supposed to be pineapple cheesecake but, instead it was a raspberry cheesecake with about a tablespoon of pineapple topping on one edge.  The service was good.  The drinks were good.  It was just not the meal I was expecting."}
{"text":"Staying at the hotel for a week and I've eaten here 3 nights. The food is great and the customer service is even better!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. The food is fantastic. I got the petit filet - they cut all their steaks right there.  Cooked perfectly - I like mine medium to medium well. I asked for a little bit of pink but not too much. It was absolutely perfectly cooked. The bacon wrapped jalapeño appetizer is my son's favorite and again they did not disappoint. He also got a bacon cheeseburger which was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. We went with a large party (14, including several smaller children).  The staff was super friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service. Fresh menu choices. I had salad with seared tuna avocado grapefruit and watermelon!!  My favorite ingredients for a summer salad!"}
{"text":"Staying here at the Embassy for a meeting. Initial impression: quick to be sat; very slow for a server to greet me and get drink order. No sure if they were changing assignments as it was little later in the evening 
Bacon wrapped jalepenos were awesome! Filet was delicious."}
{"text":"Average at best. Great drinks, the servers and bar tenders are Fantastic!  Ordered the steak, took 30 min. To be delivered and over cooked horrendously. Kitchen has problems. Never ate there, they could not get it together enough to serve a meal."}
{"text":"So far service sucks...disagreement with the hostess started the evening off. A restaurant FULL of of dance kids and parents continued the noise aspect. Asked about Mac and cheese as a side and were told she didn't think they had that. Next to us, kids get a meal with Mac and cheese. Maybe the server should know what is available. Not a large selection of vegetables as sides for meals. Asparagus and purple kale OR broccoli, she thinks...God help me. My filet just get here and has NO seasoning and my cheese grits are so hard that my fork can stand up in them. Never, NEVER will I return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came on a Convention weekend. After being surprised by high prices (we are weeby teens after all) two of us got from the buffet while the other got an artichoke spinach dip appetizer. The buffet food was dry and bad, the chips for the flavorless dip were stale, and our service was really slow. Our price was 50 for 2 meals and an appetizer that were all bad! Don't go there my dudes, and if you do, don't get the buffet!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went with friends for the Charlotte Restaurant week.  Excellent choice!  Our waitress, Deja was FABULOUS!
First we were served a glass of wine.  Not being much of a wine drinker, Deja explained the different types of wines and asked our preference.  She guided us to the type of wine that we would probably enjoy.  She did a great job.
The salads were perfect.  At our table the Rocky River Salad and the Caesar Salad was ordered. Both were excellent.  
Next we were given the Chef's Daily One bite which was a jalepeno stuffed with pork wrapped in bacon.  One word...YUM!
The entrees were perfect.  The prime rib was cooked to perfection.  When ordering, again Deja explained the different degrees of how a steak is cooked, to make sure each of us ordered it exactly like we liked.  The Carolina Turkey Tenders were also ordered at the table and all I can say (since I did not order it) was there was nothing left.  So it must have been good.
Desert... Again Excellent!  The carrot cake was delicious.  The chocolate cake was absolute perfection.
This restaurant was a great choice and the Deja was a great waitress.  She joked around with us, but also knew her job well and took great care in making sure we enjoyed our dinner.
I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great diversity of menu and excellent service!!!
Would highly encourage locals to go check it out... It's a hidden gem :)"}
{"text":"Always a great place to get a great meal. We live nearby and come whenever we want a great meal that is fresh and a little upscale. Pork chops, meatloaf, dips, cornbread.... All delicious. Service had also always been top notch."}
{"text":"I had been to this restaurant before on holidays and for lunch with family and solo, so after using the spa's services, I decided to have lunch (July 2, 2014) before heading to my next meeting. The hostess seated me at the first table. A few other tables were still occupied and being served. She gave me a menu and told me a server would be right with me. The waitress kept coming over to the other tables asking diners about drink refills and totally ignored me! Didn't even explain that the table was not hers. Didn't get the waiter whose table it was for me. After 10 minutes, I finally got the attention of the hostess (at this point I was about to just get up and leave) and she seemed surprised I hadn't been waited on although she was only a few feet away. She took my drink order and got the bartender to come over and take my order. I thought perhaps this waitress was over booked until two couples came in and sat down at the empty table next to me. This waitress immediately came over to them and was very friendly -- taking their drink order and telling them specials (which I was never told). Their food came out the same time as mine. I paid my bill and when I got up to leave and bring the tip to the bartender ( to ensure she didn't get it), she says \"Have a nice day, M'am\" -- NOW she notices me? Needless to say, it was a humiliating experience. I am a business woman who frequently takes clients out to lunch and dinner, but I will NEVER again come to this restaurant alone or with family or friends. NOTE: I didn't give this review the lowest rating because the food was good -- not great, but good."}
{"text":"Juan was amazing. Offered solutions for every issue which occurred. Restaurant manager/ fill in \"supervisor\" or whatever was lacking however. Stale chips with an $11 appetizer... no apology... steak cooked Medium well when ordered medium rare to rare.. no apology. Didn't even table touch. The most we saw the manager do was show a server how to place silverware on the table correctly, I guess that's as far as his skill level ranged. Tip of the day, don't send the main chef home and keep your back up on the day after Valentine's Day or well ever. People expect better from $30+ priced steaks that could be incredible but again lacked by far. A free app and dessert isn't suffice and doesn't make up for a simple apology from a manager and/or \"supervisor\" as he was called. From one restaurant manager to another I am simply appalled. Our first visit the food impressed us and during a revisit you have lost my interest. I'm assuming many others who know The business feel the same way. Needless to say I expected more and once again want to thank Juan for being a great server and making us feel as welcome as possible and being extremely apologetic. It is in no way his job to do so, it is a manager or supervisor, so thank him once again for me or better yet, have your \"supervisor\" in the blue shirt do so."}
{"text":"I ate and drank at the bar..... It was wonderful,  the staff of Megan & Misty was great.  These two really know how to make great drinks and carry on conversation like the best! 

Food was good,  I had the Caesar salad with chicken and it was fabulous!.... 

Highly recommend trying the bar here inside embassy suites... Wonderful time...."}
{"text":"Terrible Mother's day brunch buffet for $35 a person.  Better food in dumpster!"}
{"text":"For the price, food was mediocre. Gnats flying around table and waitstaff not on par with prices on the menu. Dressed up Applebee's at best. Manager more concerned over policy than addressing customer concerns. Disappointed I wasted my money."}
{"text":"We were staying in the hotel and didn't want to drive to get dinner.  When we weren't interested in $32 steaks, they gave us a lunch menu so we could order something lighter.  Service was good.  Food was good.  Wine list was good.    I wouldn't make a trip to eat here.  But, if you are already there, it's a decent choice."}
{"text":"Nice open atmosphere but retains that Convention Center Feel

We were shopping nearby and had dined here before so we decided to give it another try.

It's a nice place to dine particularly if you are staying at the hotel or attending a Convention. WiFi only works if you are one of the two.

Beautiful decor and if the weather is right, good outside dining. As it was, it was in the'90's so we chose to stay inside.  While it has a nice decor, it's somewhere between a Convention Center and a Sports bar in theme.

Service is good and we were seated promptly and our server made sure we did not want for anything during our stay.

After looked over the menu, I decided on the Broiled Crabcake Sandwich and my wife decided on the Half and Half with the Sandwich part being turkey. Not sure what her Soup selection was but she described it as being a bit bland.

The Crab Cakes however were excellent, The fries that I had with it were a bit undercooked and had little taste or texture to them. On the whole, not bad but nothing outstanding.

My wife did enjoy her turkey and indicated that it was very good. 

I would definitely recommend the Crab Cakes Sandwiches. My wife indicated that next time, she wanted to try them as well."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious creations. Love the planked Salmon! A masterpiece. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Loved our failed Restaurant Week Lunch pick. Definitely get the chicken & corn wontons to start, and *do not* skip the cheesecake - add vanilla ice cream! Service is excellent and patio is beautiful."}
{"text":"Here for a workshop so not much time before the first presentation. The spinach salad and crab cake were delicious that I had.  My husband had the steak which was good but not great.   The service was excellent.  Our waitress was Sharon and she put a smile on our face and serviced the food quickly."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food. They need to get their act together. Third time here and never again! She forgot the bread, forgot my salad until dinner time, gave me my husbands meal. I had to send the salad back because it was a soggy mess. Very pricey and very poor quality for the price. Food was also very salty. Not a good sign. The baked potato was 3\" round, could you spare it??"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very open with low walls separating it from the hotel. On Friday night it was particularly noisy with loud convention music down the hall. I always worry when the waitress doesn't write down our order. Sadly she didn't remember everything and both our plates had to go back. Once the food was correct, it was tasty - prime rib and sea bass. Please note that the menu on Yelp did not match the actual restaurant menu.  Probably won't go back. Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"We called ahead to make reservations, but they only take reservations on certain nights (not Thursdays.)  Anyway, we arrived at 7pm and had to wait 15min for the servers to \"catch up.\" Not a big deal, so ordered a bloody Mary from the bar.  The drink was $9.  We ordered an appetizer, which was good, not great.  We also ordered salads which were quite good and huge as far as portion size was concerned.  Service was ok.  Had to wait for drink refill, etc.  Overall, atmosphere is nice, most entrees are reasonably priced, and the food was good.  We would go back again."}
{"text":"Staying at the hotel for a \"show\", the Rocky River Grille is the only place to eat without driving somewhere.   Waited for awhile for a Caesar salad that had barely any of the bottled dressing on it, waited again for a little bit more of the dressing.  Ordered the chicken pot pie.  Menu says nothing about  it being \"deconstructed\" as it was described to me when I asked what it was after I told the waitress it was not edible.  Scrawny piece of cold chicken in a cold soupy base with a little biscuit on the side.  Oh my! $19 and the salad was extra.  Gentleman in my group of 4, got a nearly raw Delmonico rib eye when ordered \"medium\".  He was also told the kitchen had no regular butter when he asked. Never had a water refill.  Place was not even half full for such poor service.  Please jump in your rental car and find someplace else."}
{"text":"Terrible and overpriced! Ate there twice unfortunately. First time, I got the salmon and it was over cooked and smothered with sauce that didn't even taste good. Second time, I had the black bean ravioli. It was disgusting and tasted like it was came from the freezer. The kids meals were way overpriced for what you got. The kids sides were fruit cups...not even fresh!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and so far everything is really good...try the turkey burger...it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Located in an Embassy Suites Hotel. This is one of a few eating areas in this specific hotel, that also holds a convention center. The service was fabulous and food was good. They offer various sandwiches, salads, flat bread pizzas and such for lunch. The dinner menu is more extensive. There is a full bar and dining tables outside as well. I would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Located inside the Embassy Suites you'll find a little restaurant called the Rocky River Grille. 

The service was excellent it was fast and friendly. The food was great; offer a good selection of food, and specials that change daily.  I ordered fried green tomatoes which were very delicious and on point. I also go a steak cooked prefect and with an awesome Cherry Glazes that was to die for. 

The service area was clean and well maintained. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant, check the menu to see if your favor or not."}
{"text":"Don't go here.  We are no longer visiting this place as our experience wasn't very good.

The stab in the back is the Caesar salad.  They mix Italian dressing with Caesar dressing (a 1 to 1 ratio).  The end result is that you lose all the salty anchovy taste of a Caesar salad (they have no anchovies on this salad at all) and replace it with the sweet and vinegar of a cream Italian dressing.  I sent it back and it was replaced free of charge with a passable blue cheese salad.

Why does this matter?  It sets the tone for everything else that is wrong.  Too much complaining?  The wait staff are competent and very friendly.  Counterpoint: the entire evening ran slow taking almost 3 hours to have dinner.

You will wait . . . and wait . . . and wait at this place.  Someone sent their food back to have it heated up.  We were in a group of 8, not small but not large right?  It just didn't work out.  My water glass spent a great deal of time empty.

I had the rib-eye and it was fine.  They overcook all the meat so expect medium rare to be medium (or at least 1/2 the way to medium).  If you get it well done you will end up eating a dry rib-eye.  The entire point of the rib-eye is the fat and resulting juices - be careful because you will be short on both.

The desert is $8 and I had the cheesecake.  It was the size and quality of one you get from Sam's club in the refrigerator aisle.  Maybe slightly better but the same size.  You also get a single strawberry and some whipped cream.

Bacon wrapped jalapenos: dry.  Bacon anything shouldn't be dry.  It can be crispy, it can be salty, but it shouldn't be dry and this was.  Not even a touch of pink on this - cooked brown towards black."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today and there were not many people there.  We grabbed a table and our waitress brings us the new menu.  She made a starter suggestion of the gravy fries.  OMG - these were awesome.  Be careful to share them because you may not be able to eat your meal when it arrives.  I ordered the Chicken and Dumplings and the mixure of that sweet tea grilled chicken and the plentiful dumpling made it a perfect lunch.  The only problem was there's was too much to eat - for me.  Our waitress was very friendly and shared stories of the Charlotte Raceway.  The location is in the Embassy Suites.

{"text":"Any restaurant that takes Christmas Eve reservation  27 days in advance for your son's 16th birthday then emails on Dec 20th to say they won't be open is never getting my service.  So not cool.   Still upset over the lack of notice and now running around to find another restaurant to make his day special on short notice.  Your service and management is frustrating. I hope you learned something from this in the future."}
{"text":"A surprising oasis in the base of the Embassy Suites - not quite what you would expect at all. Though the location could be a bit more secluded, as you feel like you are on display a bit and only separated by a small wall, so while they want you to feel you are in a different restaurant, you don't quite get it.

Service is excellent, and the menu is executed well to boot - definitely more than you would expect from being a \"hotel restaurant\", especially attached to a hotel that itself may have an issue here and there.

Wherever we have run into their food, either at the restaurant (in the hotel, that is), or at various events around town, everything has always been tasty, and well worth taking the time to try it."}
{"text":"Wow. Should have gone to hooters. That should pretty much sum it up. If it wasn't for the very nice staff it would be one star. First off it took forevvvvver to get our food and it was not busy. Second my wife's burger was cooked tartar and not medium as requested. They were happy to replace it and comp'd it but it took another 15 mins to get a new one and the table was done eating by then. This place should be reserved only for when you are to drunk to leave the hotel."}
{"text":"It's a hotel restaurant. The service is very good. Menu is a bit limited and lacks a lot of healthy options or fresh vegetable sides but overall a fine place to eat. Especially is you do not want to leave the hotel."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 14th anniversary here and everything was great. The food was delicious and the service was amazing! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Embassy Suites for a conference and went down to the Grille which is on the first floor. Decent bar and okay food. Tried the pork ribs. That was a lot of meat and I could hardly finish it."}
{"text":"I came to this establishment primarily because I am staying here at the hotel.  I have had good experiences here in the past.  I sat at the bar. I started to order one menu item but was quickly advised not to by another patron.  I ended up ordering chicken pot pie.  The waitress repeated it as \"reconstructed pot pie\".   I asked if the cook could just keep it \"constructed\" as it should be.  Well..... When it came I realized that the chef didn't make it  a pot pie at all. I got a piece of chicken on the bone (small leg and thigh ) served over rice with some cream of chicken condensed soup around it.  Oh..... I forgot the biscuit and the lettuce on top.    $ 19 for this!  
I DO NOT recommend the \"reconstructed pot pie\".  While obviously made to look appetizing, it makes no sense and it certainly is NOT pot pie.   
If this restaurant did not have hotel attached to it, it would be empty.   As a regular traveler, I know I am getting screwed when I eat at the hotel, but at least serve up a good menu with quality food."}
{"text":"Skip dinner, go for drinks only. You'll thank me, I promise...I'm literally sitting here contemplating throwing this out and finding another restaurant  still open outside of the hotel. Pretty disappointing considering the time, my level of exhaustion, and the money I just wasted ordering food here. 

Drinks / drinking atmosphere isn't bad though...silver lining?"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!   We have eaten here several times now and enjoyed it every time. We are here for Valentine's Day weekend and it is packed. To alleviate the volume on the kitchen, they added a buffet that was wonderful!   Prime rib, chicken cordon blue, white fish, veggies, salads, and deserts. All delicious. Very happy!  Good job!"}
{"text":"This was our second time to this hotel for business.  The first time we went to the bar and it wasnt busy at all.  We felt like we were bothering the bartender and service was horrendous.

Second time, a year later, we went into the restaurant for lunch.  It took 1 hour for our food to come, 3 times we had to ask for a sugar caddie for the iced tea, and our order came out wrong.  Overall, it took them 90 minutes to serve a lunch that should of been 30 minutes.  

If your service is this bad, no one should eat here no matter how good the food is.  

My advice, stay away at all costs."}
{"text":"Went to Rocky River Grille at Embassy Suites for New Years Eve dinner with my wife and daughter.  If it wasn't for our waiter Juan this restaurant would have got 0 stars, but you can't give O stars.  I stay at Hilton properties only when I travel but this Embassy is an embarrassment to the chain!!  My ribeye and my daughters surf and turf were served warm at very best.  Mashed potatoes dry and not hot.  We spent 180 dollars including tip for what?  We could have gone to great wolf lodge down the road and got better food.  Supposedly they were also serving a basketball team from St Louis, but why should that make a difference?  Especially when I spend 180 dollars.  

I am sure this review will fall on deaf ears and nothing will be done, but Hilton Operations group really needs to take a hard look at your Rocky River Grill!

My email is elaub@rackroom.com if management would like to attempt to make this right, but I am sure this will just get filed away!
 
I normally do not write bad reviews as you can see, but for 180 dollars you do not deserve mine or anyone else's business that was at this restaurant on the evening of 12/31/17 at 7 PM.  If you do not believe me check with your waiter Juan.

{"text":"Great food on the old menu. The new menu as of 7/1/13, is not nearly as diverse not as interesting as the old menu. The service has been consistently good."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is friendly and professional.  The restaurant is clean, but oddly set-up.  It is very open, which gives it a cafeteria feel, instead of a cozy restaurant.

Beer: The have a really small selection of draft beer and and even smaller selection of bottled beers.  You can choose from one domestic or another domestic.  Most of them are Pilsners or Lagers.  At $8 a pop for a 12oz domestic draft, I didn't worry about the lack of variety and just didn't order one.

We ordered: Honey-Habenero Wings for appetizer, which were very tasty.  I ordered my hamburger Medium (I normally go Medium-Rare, but saw the previous review about under-cooked food) and it was Rare, almost Tartare.  I didn't mind The temperature, because I'd anticipated it, but the burger was very under-seasoned and served with some platic cheese.  Luckily, I had some blue cheese left-over from the wings to help add more flavor.  My wife picked the Philly Cheese Steak, which looked like a hot dog bun filled with tasteless steak-ums.  The fries were good, but over-salted.

They serve some fancier foods , a few cuts of meat, and selections of fish from the sea.  However, we'd have a hard time trying them for the price, considering the mediocre meal we had last night.  Still, not a bad hotel restaurant and thank goodness it was open during the storm."}
