{"text":"Place has def become 1 of my favorite spots. Everything looks amazing on the menu but can't bring myself to not always get the O.G bowl with added spicy tuna and spicy mayo on top . Portion size is great with just the regular size, I got the large last go round and had to save some for later. Restaurant is always very clean and staff is nice. Mochi pops are great, my girl is a big critic of mochi having lived in Japan for a year and she loved them!! Do your self a favor and stop by you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe here and food is fresh ..I went on the day of their grand opening ..this place is hopping!
Location - convenient to the freeway and gym
Parking - lots 
Food - Fresh, quick and well prized 
Staff - friendly 
Overall a great experience will be back with clients and friends!"}
{"text":"If you want the freshest Poké ingredients in town, look no further. Tail and Fin has what you want delivered in a package that's convenient, delicious, and fairly priced. I drove all the way from summerlin just to see what all of the hoopla was about. I wasn't disappointed and you won't be either.  Great job Tail and Fin. Nailed it!!"}
{"text":"This is our new go to eatery in Summerlin. The OG and Angry Bird bowls are delicious, so good that we went twice in one weekend. The owner and staff are super friendly and happy to answer questions about the menu. Make sure to sign up for the loyalty program."}
{"text":"Amazing. Simple menu and a fantastic mix of flavors. Even our kids, who are not familiar with sushi, scarfed down their food. Adults had Yo Adrian, kids had the junior, and PB& A available bowl."}
{"text":"Delicious and FRESH bowls and burritos - pineapple express and yo Adrian are the top two for us! Great friendly service and nice eat in area."}
{"text":"Let's just say hello to my new favorite spot. The food was .com. The rice was cooked to perfection not too hard, mushy or grainy... But just right. The ingredients were fresh and amazing.  It's conveniently located next to 24hr fitness so I'll definitely be coming back here more often. This place is a must try. Health and tasty for the win!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing fresh fish.Mmmmmmm ...  Their signature bowls are very creative, close and convenient glad theres a place like this close by. Im def going to be a regular"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, & yes.  So happy we have something like this now. This place is absolutely delicious. I was raised on steak & potatoes so fish is a very new thing for me. I am huge on textures & I've had fish before that has something funny or stringy in it, when that happens I literally have to focus on holding back gags. This food is absolutely amazing. My boyfriend & I did build your own burritos with soy paper & they didn't even last long enough for us to snap a picture. We will become regular here for sure."}
{"text":"I took my mother in law here since we were in the shopping center anyway and she has always wanted to try sushi burrito. The staff was extremely polite and friendly but some of the tools they needed to perfect a sushi burrito was not working and they were trying so hard but even with giving it 110% the burritos were messy which was fine my concern was with the quality of fish. You know it's not good when you toss your other half of the burrito in the trash. After a few bites I kind of figured I have a 50/50 chance of getting an upset stomach. The place is beautiful and the staff was wonderful the food quality or storage needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"BEST new sushi burrito spot by far. We ordered the stupid good tuna, crabby bastard, shrimp tempest, and a strawberry mochi of course! Each burrito had so much flavor, and all the ingredients worked well with each other. I also liked how there was minimal rice so it didn't take away from the good stuff. The place was very clean and in an awesome location. This will be the only sushi burrito place I visit from now on!"}
{"text":"This is my new craving...absolutely fresh sushi and other healthy ingredients.  We shared two Signature Creations, the Stupid Good Tuna (ahi tuna, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, tomato, cucumber, red onion, tempura flakes, yuzu miso sauce, unagi sauce) burrito wrapped in seaweed and The Omega burrito (salmon, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, seaweed salad, furikake, jalapeño, unagi sauce) also wrapped in seaweed.  Both were delicious and satisfying.  The side of Miso peas was addictive.  Although the place is small, it is stylish throughout and definitely is NOT a fast food spot.  Think Nobu in a casual style.  I cannot wait to go back and create my own burrito.  They encourage you to add your own selection of ingredients including a variety of sauces."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Staff is very friendly, and food is very fresh. My favorite roll is The OG. I have tried it both in burrito & poke bowl. Both delicious. I get brown rice with mine. It comes with fresh salmon, yellow tail, ahi tuna sashimi, poke sauce, cucumber, green onion, romaine lettuce, and I add avocado to mine & sometimes shrimp tempura if I feel like it. It's $9.95 for regular size & $11.95 for large. I feel it's worth the money. You get a lot of protein & rice. Portions are amazing. And sauce selection is to die for! I'm obsessed with their Chili Aioli I could put that sauce on almost everything it's so good! I go once or twice a week sometimes! I'm obsessed!!! Give this place a try & you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed with this place, the pricing is absoutely ridiculous. I did the build your own and got something really basic as there wasnt really much of an option of proteins. And for $10 a piece plus added charges for avocado which are a must on sushi items in my case, thats absolutely absurd. I spent $30 on 2 crab, shrimp tempura with added avocado, where one was like twice as big in proportion to the other one. It was good food but if youre looking for sushi burritos specifically try Soho Sushi Burrito on Sahara, its way better than this place."}
{"text":"Tail and fin has by far become my new go-to meal! My gym is right across the street and the poke bowls at tail and fin are the perfect after workout meal. The staff is always friendly and the food is fresh no matter what time I go. This is the best addition to the area in a long time"}
{"text":"I have been to the first tail and fin location so many times and recently decided to move to summerlin and while looking at houses I visited the new location and am ecstatic that I will have one in my new neighborhood. I always get 2 sushi burritos so I can save one for later. My favorite is the flaming tuna and the OG but I might be addicted to their new Acai bowls. Must try!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were so excited to have a sushi burrito spot in our neighborhood, and we really wanted to like this spot. I did give it two attempts, but sadly we will be going to Soho from now on. 

My first trip I ordered a shrimp burrito on seaweed paper. Right away the woman putting my burrito together pulled out soy paper (I have a soy allergy) and started assembling it. I got her attention and asked her to please make it on seaweed paper because I am allergic and her response was \"But you asked for soy.\" Why would I ask for something I was allergic to?? I reiterated that I cannot have soy and needed seaweed. She became very agitated, aggressively threw the soy burrito in the trash, and started making it on seaweed. Then at the register we literally stood there for over 5 minutes while the woman working it had a conversation with her friend. It was not busy and they were discussing something personal. I nearly walked out. The food itself was passable at best... the burrito fell apart completely after one bite and the whole thing was extremely watery. 

Last night I ordered again through Postmates, and the yellowtail was DISGUSTING. It was definitely not fresh. It tasted like one would imagine a dirty fishbowl tastes like. One bite and I actually got physically ill. I ended up throwing the entire thing away. 

Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"After calling in, I went to pick up the 70$ order and waited an hour for it! 
Didn't even get a discount!"}
{"text":"I drove past this gem one day and decided to stop by. I walked in not knowing what to expect, luckily the staff was able to help me make a decision! I ended up creating my own sushi burrito. Spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, sea weed salad, tempura crunch, spicy garlic aioli and ponzu. This was amazing! The best thing I've ate all week! I'm definitely coming back 


2/14/17.. I ordered pick up through Eats24 scheduled my pick up time to be 7:15pm. I arrived at 7:17pm.. wasn't greeted by any staff members, finally was greet by a rude cashier saying my order wasn't ready and it just came through. Watching orders being made I saw one staff member repeatedly pull up his pants and touch the food he was making with the same pair of gloves! I was super disappointed! It's now 7:30 and I just received my order. I come home and the wrapper is drenched in aioli sauce that I ordered on my sushi burrito, it was falling apart. Barely able to eat it. I've ordered here 10 plus times and never received the service I had today. I quite disappointed cause I really like this place. I hope they resolve these issues with scheduled to gos and other orders."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE TAIL AND FIN! My co-workers and I have become regulars here because we can't ever get enough of it. It's quite a drive for me but I go the distance at least once a week because it's so good! I've tried other poke places and not a single one comes close to how good this is. Always fresh and their choices are great! A gentleman named Chris usually helps me when I'm there and he is amazing! Remembers my name every time and always makes me feel welcome! If you haven't tried it, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"In town for a conference.  Had seen this place on Facebook a few months back and wanted to try it.  Loved it.  The food was great.  Staff was excellent and very friendly.  Answered all our questions while me and friends tried to figure out what we wanted. They told us they were franchising and looking to spread out to other locations.  Would love to see one brought to Baton Rouge, La."}
{"text":"Omg just came here about a month ago and had the pineapple bowl dish since I saw it on FB. Tried it and it was great."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite poke bowl places! The sauces are amazing and the fish taste fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome Awesome 
Great food with fresh items perfect lunch or light dinner. The staff are great and very helpful. I would go here every week if I lived here- a perfect mix of food and fast friendly service"}
{"text":"The sushi burrito was delicious! Loved it! I came here excited to try the sushi tacos, but I probably wouldn't order that again. It was difficult to eat. Couldn't fold it because everything fell out. Seaweed was too soft and was too small for the ingredients (and I only got 2 items as recommended). But I would definitely come back for either the bowl or burrito! DEFINITELY THE BURRITO FOR SURE THOUGH!"}
{"text":"Head awesome things about this place, the service is great and the fish is fresh! I was there a few days ago and totally worth the money and trip!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, good customer service great food. Ample portions of protein and it's very fresh. Veggies crisp and tasty. Good too place!!"}
{"text":"I normally do not write reviews on places... but today I felt the need!!! I have eaten here many times and never liked the service... very slow!!! But I did love the concept of this place and thought it was healthy eating. 
On my last visit a few days ago I got major food poisoning... for the last 24 I have been sicker than a dog.. had to call out from work. Needless to say I will never come back to this place again nor will I visit another place like this."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat at, hopefully they figure out the employee situation..... but good experience overall does not deserve anything less than 5 stars"}
{"text":"Second time ordering off Postmates from here and second time the order is jacked. 

Ordered salad bowl and was told upon DELIVERY that \"they were out of spring mix so substituted rice\". What?? 

None of the toppings I ordered and paid additional for were included either.

Get your ish together."}
{"text":"This place is just ok when you compare it to other sushi burrito places around town. I thought I would give it a try since it was new, but I wasn't too impressed. The line wasn't that long, but the workers seemed confused - which is okay if they are new. The food was a little bland and the Crabby Bastard could've used a little more sauce. Everything in the bowl was fresh, which is a good thing, but there was just nothing exciting about what I had gotten. Not sure if I would come here again knowing that there are other places that have better tasting food combinations."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Tail and Fin and probably go there 2-3 times a week. However, I have been very disappointed in my recent visits. The food is always fresh and delicious so that is not where my complaint comes from. The customer service my last several visits has been awful. I am not only not acknowledged when I walk in but with no one in front of me in line it takes over 10 minutes to make a bowl. If I ask for a product that they have to restock from the fridge they give me attitude and act annoyed. It's your job!!! There were three employees and instead of trying to make my bowl in an efficient manner they stood there and chatted. My meal was $15 and I always leave a tip so when I am spending $17 dollars on a meal for myself even though it is somewhat fast food I expect some decent customer service. I got handed my credit card back after I paid and did not have a single closing remark such as \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\". Honestly it seems like this place cannot function without a manager on the floor. Sad to say but if Tail and Fin keeps heading in this direction I'll probably just start taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I anxiously awaited the opening of this place and I was not let down the Crabby Bastard is a must have. I'm super excited to try some of the other choices they have the only problem is when I try something I like I have trouble straying from that."}
{"text":"Had the stupid good tuna burrito today and it was amazing. The high quality of fresh ingredients is amazing for a place so far from the ocean. Staff were helpful and store manager David was very friendly and engaged in conversion at will. With seafood you get what you pay for, it may be a little pricier but well worth it"}
{"text":"The food is actually very good and very fresh. The service last evening was awful. I think a 3 year old would have been more excited to serve me. It was only my second time ordering here and I don't know much about the different dishes or toppings and it seemed as though I was wasting this girls time by asking questions. I'll go back, but only because the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food and easy to order. I had the Flaming Tuna Bowl, a must have!! Very clean establishment with a great staff! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did.

Pros:
- It is conveniently located across 24-Hour Fitness in the Albertson's plaza on Maryland
- The staff was friendly and attentive
- The raw vegetables (my bowl had red onion, cilantro, and cucumbers) tasted fresh

Cons:
- The seafood in my bowl didn't taste fresh and had an unusual texture (probably a good idea to get some after-meal Pepto-Bismol if you decide to ignore my review and go here anyways)
- The bowl was drenched in sauce that was extremely salty
- The seaweed salad was really low quality, another issue with its texture and it being abnormally slimy even for seaweed salad. If you read the ingredients you find out it has a bunch of additives like corn syrup and hydrolyzed veggie protein
- The green tea mochi was good... initially, then I was surprised by the aftertaste of rubber glove (probably mishandled at some point by one of the servers)
- The tables are awkwardly low. I'm 5'3 and I had to hunch over to be in a comfortable position to eat my food
- The structure of the restaurant just doesn't make sense- the dining side is cramped while the section you're supposed to wait in line is way too wide, so wide that it's not functional and it was hard to figure out where the line actually started
- The \"vibe\" in the restaurant could use a lot of improvement- white walls, no decor, cheap interior materials and furniture all topped with \"ambient\" (trying way too hard) loud house music

I'm guessing this place has a high-star rating because of all the nightlife industry people that get comped by the owner (who's partner is an Omnia promoter)

Side note: I'm giggling at the first image posted here where there are people all texting at the table. (Say hello to the promoters that were comped and asked to write a five-star review for this less than mediocre place.) It's obviously staged.

Tip: Drive about a mile from this place to get the good stuff at Island Sushi's Poke Express."}
{"text":"Actually was going to Subway, but it was too crowded so I waked in here and boy was I pleasantly surprised. The place is very clean and the workers were very knowledgeable and helpful. My bowl was so fresh! Def will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"WOW! I read the reviews and decided to try this out. This just opened. It is new and very clean. The staff was so helpful. I ordered the Angry Birds and I was impressed. The chicken was very flavorful. Everything was very fresh. What a great experience. I highly recommend it.
Don't be fooled by the 1 stars reviews. They must be from competitors as this place is really knows what it takes for a great experience."}
{"text":"Awesome food, a must try! My favorite was the Angry Bird dish, it wasn't too hot and the portion was perfect."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill. We have eaten here several times since it first opened. Was one of our favorite go to places for dinner. We've been out of town for four months and I couldn't wait to have dinner here. Was SUPER dissatisfied and disappointed. Place was dirty. Girl took very long time because she had no help. Just isn't what it was. Maybe we will give it one more try...."}
{"text":"Summerlin needed an amazing place like this! The food was delicious!! Great service, adorable outdoor patio and did I already say it.. yummy Ahi burrito!"}
{"text":"My experience at this location wasn't the best. I feel like the workers were new and inexperienced. There wasn't many people in line during the time I went, yet to took about 20 minutes just to get my burrito. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a really good sushi burrito. In addition the lady put too much sauce for my liking. I'd say try Soho Burritos or Jaburritos"}
{"text":"Service was good, but food was not. I got the Stupid Good Tuna bowl, but it was just a clever name. The fish tasted off, the crab was bland and the sauce was really heavy and syrupy. I've eaten at a few other sushi burrito spots around town with varying results, but this one is definitely at the bottom of the list."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place every time I visit. Fresh, delicious food, great variety, excellent service. Surimi crab sushi burrito is the"}
{"text":"Just came by for the first time and was happy with everything. Tried the flaming tuna and Pineapple Express burritos and enjoyed both. Service was quick and friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 times and two out of the three have been terrible experiences. The staff is by far the most rude I have ever encountered. My second visit was the only time that I had received good service and the staff was welcoming and helpful, but the other two time were the total opposite. On my most recent visit, the guy became extremely annoyed with me because I asked for shrimp tempura, but I guess \"at 8 o'clock they shut down the oven to be cleaned\"... which doesn't make sense because they're open until 9. If this is the case, there should be a sign posted saying last call for baked food is 8pm or at least make the customer aware of the situation prior to ordering. (Sadly none of the employees wear name tags so I was not able to recognize the employee by name so that I could give a high five to the good ones and a thumbs down to the not so good ones... or management could). He then proceeded to touch everything like the phone, his hat, his hair, all of the countertops, his clothing, utensils, and then began handling my food. I had to ask him to change his gloves because I witnessed all he had touched and realized he was then going to attempt to make my food with the same gloves. The rest of the time he was very short and rude because \"he had just gotten in trouble by his manager for turning on the oven past 8\" although he kept saying \"oh it's no big deal. Don't worry about it. It's not your fault.\" But clearly I could tell he was annoyed. You know how they say \"third time is a charm\"?... well yeah this is probably the last time I will eat at this place. Unfortunate because it's right down the street from me but it's their fault that I am going to take my business elsewhere. This is the definition of \"hit or miss\" and I've definitely missed on this one. I am one to rarely go online and post a review because I am very patient and do not like complaining, however when it comes down to service like this.. I have no other choice but to let others know what to expect before eating here."}
{"text":"Amazing! First time here, tried the poke bowl with spicy tuna and crab. The miso sauce on top is a must! Great service, great food, and a great concept! Looking forward to trying everything else on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I got the stupid good tuna.. So good! Everything tasted really fresh and the sauces were amazing. 
New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Probably the best poke in Vegas!!! Food is fresh and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Two words: food. poisoning...... 
I had spicy tuna and the next day just was not fun. People at the front were not too excited to work (which I get it who really is) but just at least fake it."}
{"text":"We come here a lot. Everything is fresh and the prices are reasonable. I wouldn't say anything is outstanding but it is all around pretty good and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"It wasn't what I expected since I saw it on insider food served in a pineapple! But no...not today y'all! 

I ordered the sushi burrito and it was sloppily made. It didn't taste as fresh  ran out of a lot of ingredients it was only 1pm... Not a fan."}
{"text":"I visit this spot by myself once in a while for lunch as well as with my family for dinner. But tonight the sushi Artist made our bowls pretty and showed pride in his work. It made it more enjoyable to eat because he didn't just dump the ingredients in the bowls.  This guy should be teaching the rest of his co workers to make a bowl. I normally dont tip when i do take out but you deserved it.  Great job.."}
{"text":"5 stars.....  These five stars aren't for the food, although the OG bowl has no rival, the food is just sushi done fast. They aren't for the establishment either, I'm not sure what has changed as far as ownership or management, but I'm in there after crossfit 4-5 times a week and have seen the definitive difference. 
     These 5 stars are for the OG Bowl...or anything else on the menu, made by Sophia!!!  Customers don't repeat based on food alone, we can get it anywhere, we repeat because of the interaction and service... Sophia doesn't disappoint..... 100% character and conversation, 100% of the time... from the crazy amazing smile and greeting as you walk in the door, to the casual, out of left field funny conversation while you watch the food evolving into your favorite sushi bowl, Sophia will not disappoint......
     Whoever made the decision to hire her....Well Played!!!! Well played indeed!!!"}
{"text":"I would have given it a 5 if it weren't for the following:
-I told the staff about 3 times that it was my first time there and they didn't really show care to guide me through the menu. Even after I had questions in regards to my options. They weren't very helpful and a couple of them just looked annoyed to be there. Customer service is lacking but sometimes it feels that CS is no longer a norm.
-asked for extra sauce and the guy there was helpful. However, it should be pointed out that if you are taking your food to go it's highly recommended to get the sauce on the side. The container the food comes in is not water proof so it soaks up some of the sauce and whatever the container doesn't soak up the rice definitely does. Perhaps if you dine in is not a big deal since you can just get up and ask for more, but if you take it to go you will be eating sauceless tuna/fish and soggy rice. 
-the container is not helpful if you want to toss your salad/bowl. Maybe there should be an option to get your salad tossed.  
The food was good but the experience wasn't memorable"}
{"text":"Oh my lucky Sushi this place is so GOOD! Everything is fresh, the combinations are amazing, and the staff is wonderful! 

Please don't feel discouraged though if you come at a busy time and the line is at a medium pace. This place has only been open for a couple of weeks, and the new employees have such potential in becoming more efficient. I've worked 10+ years in customer service and I know great help when I see it!

Bruce and Dave! Those are your \"go to\" guys if you have any questions or concerns. Great leadership with a good foot forward. 

Sophia! I have no idea if she's a manager, a lead, or WHAT! But let me tell you all, she handles this place and puts it down when it gets busy. 

I have been there a total of 4 times in past 2 weeks and I have tried *the Stupid Good Tuna* in a bowl, *The Omega* in a seaweed wrapped burrito  (  my FAVORITE), the \"Yo Adrian\" in a soy wrapped burrito, and I JUST ate their *Pineapple Express\" and no I'm sorry there isn't any weed in them  but it's a perfect combination of sweet meets savory. These are all delicious by the way and I hope you find this place as yummy as I do. If you like sushi of course, no offense to Tail & Fin but husband can't stand raw fish haha. 

Much love to you all at Tail & Fin and I will be coming in again!"}
{"text":"Talk about amazing!  I stopped here for a quick bite, and am so glad I chose this over some fast food grease!  I ordered the pineapple express sushi bowl.  This bowl was so delicious and full of flavor! It had a ton of sashimi and tuna!!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I got sushi burritos from here on postmates and they were really good. I did not know if I'd like them or not but me and my family really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Not fresh. Lacking flavor. Dirty when we went in. 
Way better off going to Sushi Burrito or To See Roll !!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.. only down fall was my burrito was all soggy from too much sauce in it. It was also too saucy. Order sauce on the side or light on the sauce."}
{"text":"This is the worst poke place I have ever been in. The quality was the wrist I have ever experienced. Their new sushi taco was probably the ugliest and the worst thing I have tasted when it comes to raw fish. I ordered only salmon for my tacos and man was it terrible. As soon as you pick it up it's soggy and breaks apart before you can even put it in your mouth. Apart from being overall soggy, the fish was not fresh. Every bite I took was fishy and God awful. The second I ordered was their burrito and man was it ugly and unappealing. Taking it out of the bag I noticed a ton of shit already falling apart. Granted that it's seaweed, they should have added another layer at least if they were going to roll it in that way. 

Price: The price is very debatable depending on what you add onto your poke. The thing that pissed me off the most was the fact that they actually make you pay extra for certain toppings like masago. I have never been charged for masago at any poke place that I have been to. Aside from that, you would find all the toppings you would like and then some more. 

Customer service: Isn't this what makes the customer intrigued to come back for more? I swear my wife is just picking out the toppings she would like on her poke and all 4 workers stand there rushing us to finish up our order. Overall I would not recommend anyone go to this place because there are plenty of other options in the area. If you live in California in the areas of Riverside or Westminster go to \"Low Key Poke.\" you will not be disappointed. It's a good way to take this crappie  quality out of your mouth.

P.S Their 4 star rating is bull ****"}
{"text":"It was alright. We've been to different poke place and this is my least Favorite. They have special/signature bowls and what i got is not special at all. Bland bowl, needs more side dishes that are free. Other poke places you can throw in different toppings / side dishes for free to add more flavor. The serving was plenty but i prefer quality 

Won't come back"}
{"text":"Sushi and Poke Burrito spots have been popping up all over town like hotcakes. Lol! While each spot has their own unique combination flavors and styles, Tail and Fin is the only spot that has me absolutely addicted, where I crave my sushi bowl like a maniac. The Crabby Bastard is the object of my obsession...the mix of the sushi rice, soft shell crab, crab meat, pomegranate seeds, avocado, furikake, eel sauce, and mango (a special added ingredient a little birdie suggested to me) is absolutely delicious!!! My mouth waters just thinking about it. The ingredients are always super fresh and the portions are enough to provide me w/ two meals. The staff is always friendly and welcoming and the vibe of Tail and Fin is awesome! I love Tail and Fin and suggest everyone stop by at least once...or once a week like I do."}
{"text":"There portions got smaller since they opened and there employees look Miserable... And I SERIOUSLY HATE when Managers, got paper work to do or just trying to catch up with work in there regular clothes and they let there kids wait for them, at one of the tables with a coloring book, crayons and electronics... Then make there kids something to eat, while your in the middle of being assisted!!! SAD FACE!!!"}
{"text":"Just came here for lunch. It was SO YUMMY! not to mention, the employees were so nice. We lucked out: they had JUST made a pineapple express, two tacos, and an avocado boat thing for a photo shoot- and then offered them to us for free! The fish was so fresh. It was the closest we've ever come to the poke we've gotten in Hawaii. 
Since we got the other food, we didn't even have room for what we actually ordered- we're so looking forward to eating it for dinner!"}
{"text":"I just got done eating at the place and I highly recommend it. Excellent quality of fish, they do it the way you want, & most importantly it tastes great. This is a great place to go for a lunch that is healthy and light. I had the OG poke bowl."}
{"text":"Food is ok, nothing spectacular. The sauces make or beak the meal, and it would be nice if every employee didn't touch their phones with their gloves on then make your meal."}
{"text":"Unbelievably great food.  Crazy good.  Just found my favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"Good Poke....Fresh ingredients....Nice size portions....Their own take on it really expressed through their sauces, nice selection (of sauces) interesting flavours....Everything reasonably priced

Bad:slightly undercooked endamame....slightly overcooked soft shellcrab"}
{"text":"I have only had the sushi tacos here and I love them! Only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because of how much extra an avocado slice is:/ but other than that the service was great and the place was very clean. I think two tacos are around $4.50? I know they are under $5!"}
{"text":"Good lunch. 
Like a sushi chipotle.
The salmon is always super fresh.
Pick the accoutrements andadd a sauce.

Such a recognizable product, I saw someone out of the corner of my eye at a Golden Nights game....I said, that looks like a poke bowl. It totally was. At intermission, I saw the Tail and Fin cart."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on my way through Vegas, and it's definitely worth checking out! I got the salmon and tuna tacos and the fish tasted quite fresh. The tacos were on the small side, but they didn't skimp on the filling and for $6 for 2 it's not a bad deal if you're looking for a solid snack. 

Everything is set up Subway/Chipotle style with all the fillings/toppings/condiments in front of you to choose...the only problem was that there were no labels. That would have been nice, since I had no idea what I was picking. 

ADVICE: If you don't know what you want or what pairs well together (like me), I would recommend asking your server for suggestions. That's what I ended up doing and my tacos were bomb. Still have no idea what was in them, but they tasted good and that's all that matters, right?"}
{"text":"Great new spot! Had the Crabby Bastard and it was perfection. Definitely going to come back. Food was delicious and service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I have tried a few sushi burrito restaurants but none compare to Tail and Fin, the fish is fresh and the burritos are delicious and oh yeah, the staff is friendly and very helpful, I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute BEST!!!  I love that we finally have a sushi burrito place in Vegas that is worth going to over and over again!  
I love the poke bowls and sushi burritos!  The best part is being about to customize it so I get everything I want.  I was skeptical but my friend recommended this place to me and I'm so glad she did.  I could see this being my new addiction!!!   Yummmmmmy!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place -- fusion of Asian with Mexican cuisine. I ordered one of the specials (can't remember the name) and it was really good. The service was friendly and helpful.  Will try it again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Since I'm vegetarian I only really eat imitation crab which I'm glad they had and so far so good. The burrito was big. $13- they add avocado for $1.50. They charge extra for tomago as well. I like this location because it's right next to the gym I go to and it's really fast and convenient. I will eat here again. I would give 5 stars if it was a better price or didn't charge extra for things that normally come in sushi. 

So I came back and I tried it again and they made the mistake of making my sushi burritos large but they didn't charge me for it. They didn't charge me extra for any of the extras either. I know that's just by chance but I'll have to give it five stars for this. The food the second time around was equally as good. My fiancé loved it. I was really full 3/4 of the way through it. I also got a dollar off with the loyalty program they have."}
{"text":"First time eating here & it was great!!!  I hade the Pineapple Express made with soy paper which was wonderful & my husband had the Stupid Good Tuna which he said was very good. Everyone was super nice. We will be going back soon :-)."}
{"text":"We had The Crabby Bastard bowl which is soft shell crab/surimi crab and toppings. The guy helping us was nice - he went over the menu for us first-timers. But 1) he left out the pomegranate (one of the toppings) and 2) the rice was cold. We asked if it's normal to serve the rice cold. They said their brown rice is refrigerated and their white rice is at room temp. Wow this would have changed our decision to order brown rice, because as Asians, you never eat cold rice!! It's criminal. Rice was starchy and difficult to swallow. Ick! The lady offered to give us a bowl of white rice but we declined because we already ate most of the toppings and quite frankly, our experience was already made .. 
We wanted to like it. But we won't be back. Also try this place in comparison to Soho Sushi bowlrrito -- Huge difference!!"}
{"text":"So glad this place finally opened! I always get the build your own poke bowl. Everything is always fresh and delicious and the staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"Came here while in Vegas. I love the idea of poke tacos. We ordered the tacos, burrito and a bowl. All were good."}
{"text":"Great food! Hands down the best Sushi/Poke place in town. Love the new location! I recommend the OG burrito it was great!"}
{"text":"Tail and Fin was my first poke experience and it was definitely worth it! Everything was so fresh! The employees were great helping me by going over the menu and giving me recommendations. I even came back two days later and ordered the P B & A acai bowl which was great as well!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi burritos place I've been too. Great food, and staff. And the rewards program is nice too. I have been to many of these establishments around town and I will continue coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the The OG on my first visit,would like to see nutritional info added to menu. Employees very attentive and Friendly- will be back"}
{"text":"So been to a few \"sushi\" burrito places but this one was by far the best...
Love the ambience of the venue, all white making a must to be super clean.. and then the food execution was awesome. They give you an option or regular size or large size burrito, which while watching it get made was not at all sure how all the fish was able to be stuffed into the burrito. 

Definitely be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great good. My first time here. The oven was down, half the things I ordered I couldn't have, so my first impression was off to a bad start. But the staff was friendly, great at helping me pick the things they had available, and even though at first I felt I was settling with my order, it was amazingly good. The bowls, burritos, and everything else are great. 10/10 staff and food"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place. Always fresh, workers are always courteous & food is awesome."}
{"text":"Really slow service. Really disorganized. Really loud. Will not be dining in again. Maybe we'll consider delivery but even then, expensive food that wasn't worth it to us. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth $15."}
{"text":"I was excited that a new eatery went in close to my house that I can eat at.  I purchased a build your own burrito on my first visit 2/20/17.  Service was very good and the young gal who assembled my burrito included a generous portion of avocado which I appreciated.  The total cost was $10.76.  Today I stopped in and ordered the same thing.  When I asked for the avocado, I noticed several that had been cut open and were browning.  He did cut open a fresh one but hardly put any on the burrito.  I asked if I could have more and he stated it was an extra charge which I okayed.  When I checked out, the price came to $13.98.  For some reason, finishing up my order took a good 5 minutes more when they only had to add chicken.  While I waited, I looked at the receipt and saw I was charged $1.49 for each serving of avocado.  I checked the menu and yes, that is an extra charge on the build your own so I got a bargain the first time.  However, for a $1.49, I expect a serving of avocado that I ended up paying twice for.  I'm going to question the avocado next time.  They seem a little disjointed and probably need some better training.  I hope they work out because I do like the food, it's convenient and there is a lot of turn over in the space."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi rolls (ordered the Flaming Tuna with Spicy Ponzu Sauce), immaculate place and staff is super friendly! Plus a special bonus for leaving reviews:) We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Tail and fin was super yummy! I got myself and my dad a poke bowl. We did the create your own. It was filing, and lots of veggies and protein to chose from. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"OKKKKK real talk: maybe because I went late in the day but the fish did not look fresh at alllll. But life is short and I still ordered #yolo. I got a bowl and put in salmon, spicy tuna, edamame, wakame, lettuce, jalapeño, and brown rice (the salmon and the spicy tuna looked the safest). Anyhow it was nothing special. It tasted exactly how I would expect - satisfying but not amazing. I also got miso soup and it tasted like hot water. Maybe, again, because it was the end of the day. I don't know. Perhaps I might try again in the day time. 

For the bowl, miso soup, and I drink I paid $14.00."}
{"text":"The poke bowl and sushi burrito trend is crazy popular in Vegas- but Tail & Fin is one of the strongest contenders.  Sure, they've got friendly service, clever menu names (like the Crabby Bastard), and fresh fish like all the others. But they've also got a ridiculous attention to detail, a stellar sauce program, visible and involved ownership, and an adaptability that'll keep them in business even after the trend dies down- menu items like avocado boats (to bring in the low carbers), mochi pops (simple but fun), and sushi tacos (all over social media) make them more than just another sushi burrito place. 

Keep an eye out for a Summerlin location opening soon!"}
{"text":"First time trying a sushi burrito and I'm hooked! The food was fresh and the service was great. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just moved from Seattle and found out about the grand opening of Tail & Fin through Instagram. Was greeted by friendly and attentive staff upon arrival. The ordering process is similar to Chipotle and is streamlined which makes the experience a fun and interactive way to the finished product. I ordered The Crabby Bastard (CB) Burrito and The O.G. rice bowl. The CB was delicious! I was surprised but delighted with the addition of pomegranate seeds. I wish I had gotten the O.G. in a burrito instead as the presentation of the bowl was not as impressive. But its only opening weekend so I hope that can be improved. Although it is a bit of a drive from Summerlin, I will be visiting Tail & Fin again!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Las Vegas for a Sushi Roll or Sushi Burrito however you want to call it I've been here  just once but for my first experience It was awesome and the taste of the food was magical and of course it doesn't damage your wallet that much. TRY THE ANGRY BIRDS BURRITO OR THE YO ADRIAN TACOS"}
{"text":"This place was just okay. Wanted the seitin wrap but they were out so just got the veggie wrap. It's a bit weird that it's like a sushi burrito. The flavor was just okay. I don't think I'll be craving this place anytime soon. The service was good but people tend to take forever in line trying to make their decisions."}
{"text":"I don't understand the sushi tacos, it is just lazy way of making a messy hand roll. It was almost impossible to eat without getting sauce all over my hands."}
{"text":"Today was my first experience here and I must say it was a GREAT ONE! I had a large sushi burrito and is amazing! The fish was soooo yummy! Chris gave my cousin and I AMAZING customer service ! He was really friendly and helpful. To me, if the food is great but customer service is poor I won't come back, but because my overall experience was a GREAT one I'll definitely be back to this Tail&Fin so I can continue receiving exceptional customer service and super delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"Officially my new favorite poke/sushi burrito place! The fish tastes fresh and the tacos are yummy! Love the presentation of their food and ambience inside. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first, but I'm an open minded guy. 
I'm glad I came in. They were extremely friendly and  Melanie was extremely helpful & sweet. It turns out it's freggin delicious!  I'll be back agin soon."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Walked in for the first time and had no idea what to choose first. The staff was very patient , informative and helpful. Did a build your own bowl and it was so good! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for T&F's second location! 
The bright Summerlin location has the same menu as the Henderson one, with FOUR awesome dishes that make them stand apart from the many other poke bowl spots in town.

+ Avocado boats! Good low carb option with healthy fats. Poke scooped in an avocado half. Light and delicious.
+ Poke tacos! Available at 2/$5 as an app that works as a fun snack, able to be customized with an added topping or sauce. Super fun new way to do Taco Tuesday!
+ Pineapple bowls. OMG. I'm not much of a pineapple fan but dangit if I don't want one of these. Same as a regular DIY or specialty poke bowl, just served in a scooped out pineapple half. It's like the oversized citrus version of the avocado boats.
+ Acai bowls! Wanna make healthy choices but don't want fish? If the chicken/beef options aren't your thing, the acai bowl is another option. Pretty and fresh, I'll be getting one of these next!

Service is friendly, but staff seem to be new so there may be slight delays as they get more familiar with the menu. This location is slightly closer to me than the first. I'm thrilled to have another location to frequent when I want to pick a reliably great place for poke. Take your order outside to enjoy on the covered patio!"}
{"text":"I will give this place a few more tries since it's a walking distance from my house.. the menu looked really good but unfortunately the items I tried tasted a bit more like fast food sushi. What was really frustrating is how SLOW the service was.. WOW, just painful to watch the employees and the line getting longer and longer and not moving.. I know they opened just recently though so I want to be fair and give it some time.. fingers crossed"}
{"text":"I'd been enjoying their Crabby Bastard (fried soft shell crab) rolls ever since they opened. The staff is very friendly, and I even joined their frequent diner program. However a couple weeks ago I walked in and was told their oven was broken. Ok, I can accept that. Fast forward two weeks. I walked in at 9:30 pm to order the Crabby Bastard but was told the oven was off. Apparently they turn off the oven at 9 pm even though they close at 10 pm. Good to know for future visits. I'll have to explore their vegan options too."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the friendly staff and the awesome menu. Very fresh if you ask me. Price was excellent as well compared to others around town or an all you can eat sushi which I felt equally as satisfied! :)"}
{"text":"Very excited to try this place, but very underwhelming. Fish is definitely fresh, but its not much different than any other sushiritto/poke places around town. They do have poke tacos and avocado boats and pineapple bowls obv from all the photos. 

2 stars because of an incident I witnessed here a few days ago that I felt compelled to tell because I thought it was so pathetic. Came in during lunch and theres a short line of 4 people. One employee is helping the first lady in line, a second employee is about to help the second guy in line but the lady says her second order to him instead so both employees are now making her food. The guy behind her gets super upset. He's a regular from the fact that a third employee knows him by name and by order and she asks him whats wrong. He goes on a tangent about how rude the lady ahead of him is and people in general are so inconsiderate and gets kind of aggressive. 

Poor lady (whos in her nurse scrubs) realizes her mistake and starts apologizing. Says shes super sorry to the guy and is really polite. She wasnt paying attention. Honest mistake, nothing intentional. The guy just seems to get angrier. At this point the manager is now cashier comforting the lady. Angry guy hears and starts ranting even more. Makes everything awkward and everyone uncomfortable. Honestly idk what this guys deal was, but either way he would have to wait to order and pay after the lady. He got such a horrible attitude from something so small. He should be ashamed of himself. I wanted to eat there but I just took my order to-go instead.

Overall, I know its not their fault but the least they couldve done was tell that guy to calm down. Very passive with the way they handled it. Anyway my poke bowl was fine but overpriced. $15 for a regular size.."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff, and delicious food. My friends and I will definitely be back again to explore other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I tried the Yo Adrian. It was just okay. the burrito was soggy and fell apart after the 2nd bite and ended up eating the burrito with a fork. $10 isn't worth it for the size you get. Go to the other sushi burrito places for better quality and value. This place definitely is not a place I would drive across town for, but if I were in the area I may try it again."}
{"text":"The concept is awesome, the restaurant is clean, and I know that the staff is trying. Unfortunately I was in line behind a particularly difficult customer. The staff handled it as best they could, but my simple order ended up talking over 15 minutes to complete because everyone behind the counter was overly flustered by the other customer's requests!"}
{"text":"Quick, customizable, fresh, with great sauce choices! Everything was good. Everyone was friendly and the place was clean. My only complaint was that my poke bowl rice was cold and my husbands was warm (much better)."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorites as a foodie and lover of sushi! The food is amazing I love the customer service as well"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I figured that if the restaurant was able to open up a second location, then it must be that good to be able to afford a location in Summerlin. It's the closest poke place to me, so I would've loved to be able to drive up Town Center Dr whenever I needed a good poke fix. But alas...

I came with a friend on Thursday around 5:30PM. We were greeted by the staff upon entering, which was nice. They have lots of seating and even have a patio with lights. Very cute! But the wait man. THE WAIT WAS SO LONG. These poke places are supposed to be like assembly lines. You're supposed to walk in, order what you want down the line, and then be out the door. BUT THIS WAIT WAS RIDICULOUS. I know this place just opened, but I've been to plenty of other similar establishments in both Vegas and SoCal--I've never waited this long before. Just watching the employees move so slowly was so excruciatingly painful.

The price point is just right. They had less premade combos than Soho, but it seemed like they had more sauces to choose from. I enjoyed The Omega bowl I got, and my friend liked his Stupid Good Tuna burrito enough. Initially I felt like the honey sesame aoili had a weird thick viscosity to it and tasted a little odd, but it definitely grew on me. Also, their ingredients were very very fresh. 

They also have a rewards program.

Overall, I felt like the food was very good, but that wait just killed me. Maybe I'll come back in another 3 months and see if they've picked up their speed.

4 stars for the food
-1 star for the ridiculously long wait"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this new place so we decided to give it a try when we were out this way. The staff was super nice and patient while stared at the menu trying to decide on what we wanted. I ended up getting the shrimp tempura roll and swapping out the crab for spicy tuna. It was so good and I went back for seconds on exactly the same roll! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I had an hour lunch break from work and a couple of coworkers and I came here because we were craving sushi bowls. Coming here, I expected it to be like most other places I have gone to in the past so I was excited for lunch. Walking in, I was looking at the menu and it looked somewhat similar. Their regular and large bowls only differ by $2 and 2 scoops of protein. I opted for the large bowl - they got me with the only $2 more dang it lol I got half and half of tuna and salmon. When looking at the sauces, I was not that impressed because of the lack of variety. I literally asked for plain sesame oil and the girl gave me some attitude -  she had this look of uhhhh that's not one of the choices. Then she looks at the girl next to her and they suggested  I try sesame aioli but I dont like mayo so I said no. I was just a little annoyed, because it was awkward when I asked for just plain sesame oil and she looked at me with some 'tude. The salmon was ookkk and I believe I only ate like a couple pieces of tuna. The tuna was not fresh at all and it was kind of mushy. No bueno. The lady at the register was really nice though - might be the owner? the other workers looked like teenagers or possibly her kids?"}
{"text":"I was in there with my family basically this entire weekend from Friday to Sunday and there was this particular girl who had a smile that can brighten up a room her personality was amazing , it was so welcoming me to my family and I and a lot of the other customers.  I had ordered a flaming tuna and a stupid good tuna burrito and bowl and I just loved how she made me feel at home in a sense.  The food was perfect & so I had asked her for her name and she said Jackie , more people need to be like her ! I swear you have a repeat customer every time ! And also thank you so very much Cheyenne , Jared and Carlos ! They all were generous and amazing.  They all made my visit memorable"}
{"text":"Found a new favorite! Shrimp Tempera, spicy tuna, crab meat, romaine lettuce (for xtra crunch), with Eel sauce and Siracha."}
{"text":"Poke was fresh and tasty! Great that you can choose 4 proteins and as many toppings as you want."}
{"text":"Very cool healthy concept. It feels like a treat. Amazing ownership. Employees were super friendly and full of smiles. Great energy! Everything vas very clean and the space felt very bright and open. It's a very easy location to get to. Prices were very reasonable and food was delicious. I love the \"I like it raw\" fun and playful!Will def be back."}
{"text":"Man - I wish we had a place like this in the DC area!! I love the concept and was blown away by the delicious sauces and fresh ingredients. You have your choice of a sushi burrito, poke bowl or even tacos. I opted for the spicy sushi burrito bowl and asked for an extra side of sauce. The service was impeccable and the price points are spot on compared to the amount of food that you get. I was only able to finish half of my burrito!

You can make your own creation or choose from one of their options. They even let me add crunchy tempura flakes to mine and my husband was able to modify his burrito as well. This place was very clean and they have both indoor and outdoor seating so we were able to enjoy the nice day.

I will definitely be back the next time I am visiting my family in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Seen questionable practices of sanitation. They are stingy compared to every other poke spot. Wasteful of rice for sushi tacos and used a paper cup to cut shape into circle. Wastes so much rice. Then they recycles paper to wrap food, Gross. Disorganized and sub par at best."}
{"text":"I'm here almost every week, because the food and the staff are all so amazing. They hand make everything, and it's always so yummy. Sophia is so kind and funny, and makes coming in that much better. Highly recommend coming in if you're around this area!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough wonderful things about Tail & Fin! First off, I am not the biggest sushi eater, but this place just changed my mind!  I am a sushi convert!!! 
I had the OG Bowl. The fish & all of ingredients were so very fresh and tasty and the presentation of the food was very pleasing to the eye. The staff was so very friendly & warmly greeted me as soon as I stepped In the door. I also quickly noted the cleanliness and nice decor of the place. 
The staff was so helpful! They made it so easy for me to order each ingredient so that I would have the best experience. I love that I could add  additional avocado! I am not only a convert but will also be a regular customer! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmm! One of my biggest issues of being a big tuna lover is the lack of quality options when it comes to getting high quality tuna establishments. Usually you need to go down to the strip in order to get a good tuna poke or at least a higher end restaurant. The problem with this is the time it takes to get ready go down and then sit wait for the food. Well NOT anymore! 

Tail and Fin combines the best of both worlds high quality product, and I mean high quality the fish was literally as good as Nobu, and the convenience of a quick service restaurant. 

I walked into the Restaurant and was greeted politely by the entire staff. It was clean well organized with the tables on one side and a lineup for people to order on the other. It's similar to a chipotle where you get to choose what kind of protein and toppings you want on your burrito or burrito bowl or salad. The choices to put on we're very diverse and let me have many options for my most favorite poke variation cravings from the classics like avocado to a little more unique like pomegranate arils. Next up the sauces, the classic poke sauce is delicious but let me tell you what, YUZU MISO SAUCE is the business! Finally you get to end your choices with a combo upgrade which lets me pair my favorite side dish ever cucumber sunomono. 

So in conclusion..... This place is a going to be a giant franchise very shortly. It's fast it's clean and most importantly is so good it makes you want to go everyday. All I can say is thank you I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a Sushi burrito restaurant to finally come to Summerlin and I couldn't be happier that Tail & Fin was the brand to do so! I built my own poke bowl and every ingredient was fresh not to mention the spicy ponzu sauce was by far the best I've had. Their outdoor terrace is going to be my go to place for lunch when the weather gets better."}
{"text":"Yum! Tail and fin is awesome! We came here over the weekend and I got the angry birds since I'm not crazy about seafood. My sister was dying to try this place though and she was thrilled. She went with the omega bowl and loved everything about it. The small bowls are the perfect size and have a perfect meat to rice ratio. The angry bird was even better than I thought and I was so glad!!! I would come back here anytime to try the different creations."}
{"text":"Very convenient and fast device!  Excellent food and service! The owner Dan is awesomely em. Everything's very fresh and nice variety. We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"All the ingredients were so fresh! Great food and service. Crab and ahi with pineapple! All the sauces were great as well. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Fish is always super fresh plus service is really friendly and fast! Never disappoints. Great spot to grab lunch. I really like how they offer bowls, salads and burritos-regular or large! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow... my very first sushi burrito--sashimi crab roll. It was the bomb!! I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Bomb and fresh! And I don't say bomb a lot. Good service nice staff great food. Line is a bit slow compared to soho sushi burrito and a bit smaller burritos but still a great choice."}
{"text":"I do not get the hype here. 

I came here with high expectation because of the high ratings on yelp. I walked in to this store around 3:40pm, there was only one person in line. Lieterally took them 10 minutes to get that person's order. The employees who make the rolls or burritos seemed like they just started working there. They were looking at the menu while they were making the rolls/burritos in front of customers. 

I stood in line for 5 minutes and finally it was my turn. I ordered the stupid good tuna burrito and the crabby bastard burrito. I waited about another 10 minutes to get my orders. Again they were looking at the menu I was standing in front of them thinking I would have been faster if I were to make one. I get it that they just started the business but come on, think about a lot more customers waiting in line waiting for their order. I wish they can speed up their orders. Finally I get to try both burritos. Man! Those rice were sticky as hell. Like chinese sticky rice!!!! These are not sushi rice for sure. It is one of my pey peeves when it comes to sushi. The rice is the most important factor but here nahhhh. I was very disappointed. Overall the flavor was okay but man that rice just ruined everything. 

Another thing I did not like was their portion. I am not a big eater but when I saw those burritos, I was bummed. Jaburritos offer almost the same price but their portions are as twice as more. I paid freakin 23 bucks for tiny sushi burritos that were not even good. Not worth it!!! Totally not worth it :("}
{"text":"This was ok, but I would never go back here. I got one of their pre-made bowls, and it was a very gross combination of flavors. Tuna, tomato, red onion, sweet sauce. Really gross.

Also, the tuna itself didn't have the freshest flavor.

2 stars since this place is fine if you're in a hurry and the help was nice enough. But their portions aren't as big as other poke places I've been to either."}
{"text":"This is the closest poke bowl/sushi burrito restaurant near me. I've been here 3 times now and thought I'd finally write a review.

I ordered the poke bowl with sushi rice, spicy ahi tuna, crab, seaweed salad, and spicy mayo sauce! Everything tasted good except the rice was a bit hard. The last couple of visits I've noticed that the rice is always like that. 

I've been to other poke bowl restaurants similar to this and I can say that nothing really sets them apart. I've noticed that I pay almost the same price (maybe even less?) at SOHO Sushi Burrito and they fill the entire bowl so that I get my money's worth. The portions here seem a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Tail & Fin yet, you seriously need to go... like now! Let me just tell you about all this goodness right here  First, I made my own poke bowl inside this delicious, juicy pineapple  (those little tempura flakes on top of my ahi tuna and crabmeat mixed with yuzu miso sauce was DA BOMB)  bottom left is the avocado boat appetizer -- AMAZING -- give me all the avocado  Next to that is a TRUFFLE edamame that was SO GOOD and the perfect little side to munch on. And then that's my husbands poke bowl on the right that he totally devoured in about 10 seconds  PLEASE do yourself a favor and go eat the cleanest, freshest raw fish for bowls, burritos, and tacos -- oh, and did I mention the menu was designed by Nobu's former executive chef-- yeah) FIVE FREAKING STARS."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and fresh!! 
HOWEVER, I truly hope they invest in training their employees better. Sweet girls working but they were clueless. It wasn't even busy and it took forever to make our burritos. I work in the industry and am very forgiving when it comes down to it but I have NEVER been asked multiple times about what else was supposed to go in my burrito. I ordered the omega so there were already a list of set ingredients (avocado, salmon, lettuce, tomato, onion, and 2 sauces if I recall correctly). The menu with the list of ingredients was on the board behind the employee. No one should be put out on the floor not knowing the ingredients. And even if they don't know, LOOK and DO NOT ask your customers multiple times what else is supposed to go in it. The person I was with was also asked multiple times what was supposed to go in theirs (i forget which burrito was ordered). It didn't seem like any of the others knew what they were doing either. Condiments were either completely out or almost out, no ice in soda machine, and my acai bowl NEVER came out until I had to ask the girl down who said she was making it but decided to go clean windows instead while we were standing there waiting (who also asked us to step aside so she could get to the windows better). By the time I got it it was melted. I have NEVER felt so awkard eating somewhere before. Like I mentioned, they were very nice, but should not work in this industry. I don't think I'll come back because of it."}
{"text":"It was the second time having poke, first time was in Chicago.
I came in-between rehearsals during work, me and my bf ended up eating here since we'd passed by it so often when he visits. 

I got the Yo Adrian without jalapenos. As a whole it was very delicious, HOWEVER, they did slab on a huge amount of onion which overpowered the flavor of the bowl. Everything else, especially the aoili were delicious. I do think the prices are quite high for the product, but they do give a nice amount of food. 

The only other problem I had was that one of the workers was quite bland, and less welcoming. It was off-putting.

Restaurant is nice, clean, I enjoyed eating in the nice big patio in the front."}
{"text":"I don't know why it has taken me so long to try a sushi burrito! What have I been waiting for? The concept is perfect- it's basically a giant sushi roll, stuffed with all of your favorite things and wrapped up like a burrito.

Tail and Fin was the perfect introduction to sushi burritos. The concept is kind of like Subway, you can either choose from their menu of rolls or you can build your own. You can add on additional items such as veggies, sauce, etc as you like, choose either seaweed or soy wrapping and boom, sushi burrito! A regular sized roll was $9.95 and a large was around $12. The restaurant was clean and bright, so we opted to eat in. 

I selected the Shrimp Tempest (as a newbie to sushi burritos, i thought it best to start with one from the menu). We noticed that the lettuce looked a little old/brown, and the server did too. Instead of trying to serve us wilted lettuce, he volunteered to chop some fresh lettuce in the back. That's great service! 

The server who rung us up (Sophia), was also super sweet and cheerful, so we were off to a great start. 

Now, let's see what the fuss is all about.. first bite- delicious!! I really could taste everything, the shrimp tempura, the crab, the veggies, and the sauce. The seaweed wrap was the perfect holder- at least until the end, when things get a little messy. 
The regular burrito was a good size and I felt that it was fairly priced. 

Now that I've popped my sushi burrito cherry, I'm ready for more! Thanks, Tail and Fin- I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's one of the better sushi burritos new places around town. Very friendly and helpful staff. We had the poke bowls. Made our own. You get 4 scoops of protein or for $2 extra, you can have 6 scoops. Nice choice of veggies and unlimited sauces. The price was good. The only thing I would recommend is they should mix the proteins with the sauces separately before putting them in the bowl. Tastes better if it soaks the sauce in, I think."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Come try the angry birds bowl! Delicious and clean place. Mochi pops are delicious as well."}
{"text":"This is probably my least favorite sushi burrito place. They lack customer service and the meal was very plain. I ordered a burrito but the lady ended up making me a bowl. Not sure how that happened but it makes me question who and how the food was prepped when the lady can't even get my order correct.  I had a few bites and tossed it. Not worth $11.50. Eat here if you're really only craving fish, otherwise in my opinion, you have plenty of other better options to eat in that area."}
{"text":"Customer service was really good so this review has nothing to do with the workers. They're doing a great job. Onto the food.

Pretty small portions. I guess I'm used to Sushirrito in SF. The portion size wasn't even the biggest concern to me...it was the quality of the fish. The salmon tasted SO fishy! I was burping it up later and could still taste the fishiness. It's like I had just popped 4 fish oil pills. One thing that turns me off of a sushi joint is the lack of freshness! Quality raw salmon should not be this fishy! It was gross! When the worker was scopping the salmon he was trying to get a perfect little scoop, and that's fine but he was scraping it against the canister to do so, pretty much squishing the salmon. He kept re-scooping and scraping to try to mound the perfect little salmon ball, so that might also be why the quality of the fish was subpar. IMO it's not worth it to mash up the fish just to avoid giving the the customer a little extra (and I'm talking like 2 cubes extra here lol). Raw salmon isn't like beef from Chipotle where you can just crush it and it will be fine (maybe even more tender lol). Texture of raw fish is so important! It's not even his fault though, he was obviously just trying to follow instructions given to him. He was really sweet...but that raw salmon was just plain ol' bad. But hey, I don't really see anyone else complaining so maybe I just got a bad batch. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe next time it'll be better.

I was also kind of annoyed that when I opted out of pomegranate as a topping (included in \"the crabby bastard\") and asked for masago instead (they were both premium toppings that costed $$ to add in), they still wanted to charge me for it. Even though I asked for no pomegrante already! I feel like if it's the same price point ($1.49) it should be an equal substitute."}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas to get a Poke bowl! Was able to see the freshness of the food right when walking in and it tasted even better! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was very good at a great price. We ordered delivery & it came at a pretty reasonable time. My only complaint is that my order was missing the miso soup but I'm not going to let that get a bad review bc of it. Definitely will order again in the future!"}
{"text":"I got a sushi burrito and was very happy, a friend got a poke bowl, also very good. 
High quality, tasty and easy."}
{"text":"Originally from the west coast, I feel like my sushi standards are pretty high compared to most. I stopped by this past weekend on my way out of town and got 'the crabby bastard' burrito and it did not disappoint! The crab was so fresh, and they didn't cut corners on the portions (as often happens with the most expensive ingredients), and the combination of ingredients and flavors made for the perfect, filling yet refreshing Sunday meal. This would definitely be one of my regular go-to quick dining options if there was one in Denver!"}
{"text":"It's good, but they charge for things other poke places don't normally charge for. I've left spending more than I felt it was worth. Food is good, just speaking on the price/quantity."}
{"text":"Talk about another solid Poke bowl and sushi burrito spot in Vegas. I am more of the Poke bowl guy then burrito style. So on my second visit made my own poke bowl style. I went with  tuna and spicy tuna. The portion size they go by scoops one or two scoops. Ironic cause for the most part all the Poke Bowls popping around Vegas the scoop is the universal measuring tool. LOL!! The toppings not much different from one Poke Bowl spot to another come notice. Some common items tomato, cucumbers, lettuce, edamame, avocado, seaweed salad, and can go on and on. They also are some toppings that make one place stand out from the other but it more about the sauce then the toppings separates one Poke Bowl spot from another. Tail and Fin Sushi Burrito and Poke has a nice selection. Too many that can not remember them all. I went with spicy mayo sauce for my bowl. I really liked it! It tasted more like sirachi aioli. It was the perfect compliment. The topping were all refreshing and fresh. Everything looked great when going down the line making your selections. It was very clean. The quality of the fish was solid. 

The staff is awesome. The service nothing but five stars all around. The first visit came here to my second visit. Everyone staff member was friendly, positive vibes, answered any questions I had from my first visit talking burrito to my second poke bowl, and welcoming.

No doubt if am on the other side of town. In need for Poke Bowl fix coming back try more sauces and more Poke Bowl action."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A really good sushi place by the house.  Poke/sushi whichever term you may you choose.  I got 2 build your own sushi burritos, and my girlfriend had 1, which I'm sure she'll review shortly.

I had a spicy tuna, and an ahi tuna.  The spicy tuna had spicy mayo, tempura bits, unagi sauce, and avocado.  While the ahi tuna just had avocado, unagi sauce, and tempura bits(no veggies on either, in strange and steer away from the greens) I ate half of both, then took my first breath.  The seafood is extremely fresh, the burritos were full of flavor, and quite filling. And for the price, you really can't beat it.

Everyone inside was super helpful and friendly.  Took our order to go due to the lack of nice weather today but the dining room looks very clean.  The line where they prep the food is also clean looking, I enjoy the food being prepped right in front of you as you can watch how everything is handled.

Only downside, which really isn't even a big deal, they fell apart fairly easily.  This is by NO means a negative, or poor comment to them.  Just something I noticed.  As this place rests next to my humble abode. I will return!"}
{"text":"Best poke around! Great selection of fish and toppings! And they offer it in pineapple bowls as well! Definitely a must if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I entirely knew what to expect with Sushi burritos.  I guess I had conjured up some idea of sushi wrapped in a tortilla with avocado and hot sauce. What arrived at Tail and Fin was a massive sushi roll.  Gone were the dainty slices of sushi roll that we have come to love, and nowhere in sight was anything that truly resembled a burrito.  However, when tasked with eating this enormous sushi roll one must engage their knowledge of burrito consumption in order to take it down without a mess.  This experience was different from other sushi restaurants, and pleasant in that all the flavors are delivered in each bite, and one roll is enough to satisfy.  Strong work."}
{"text":"I order a large sushi burrito name LBO (i guess) I forgot the name... it was delicious and fresh... i will come back again.... but the price just so expensive $16 more....  but i will come back for sure..."}
{"text":"Food was great as always but one of your employees (Daren/Garen) came off as very rude.  He had a \"whatever\" attitude that left my family a little a uncomfortable and asking each other \"Are you serious?\"  Anyways, food was still good and his off-behavior made for a good conversational piece."}
{"text":"Big portions, friendly staff, clean and well lit what more can you ask for? The fish is always fresh and the same goes for the sides. I have tried many sushi burrito places and none pack the burrito as full as this location. The rice I have never had a problem with which has been hard at other places I have eaten at. Overall 5 out of 5 and I will keep returning here unless something drastic changes. My favorite thing to order is the \"omega\" with some added green onions and jalapeños.. delicious!"}
{"text":"Great first impression! They do not skimp on the protein and have a good selection of gluten-free sauces. Staff was really helpful and courteous."}
{"text":"postmated the IG poke bowl. Food is really good! Lots of fish and fresh ingredients. The ONLY thing is... i didnt know the poke sauce had so much wasabi in it!!!! Thought it would be like a tangy ponzu sauce like other poke places. Regretting hard not tasting the sauce beforehand and ruining my food TT my nose is on fire and my eyes are runny lol"}
{"text":"Got the Yo Adrian, the spicy mayo went well with the cream cheese and made for a tasty sushi burrito. I added sriracha for the extra kick."}
{"text":"Walked out instead of eating here. If you have a shellfish allergy, this place is unsafe. I gave management the feedback directly a few months ago, and they adjusted for a few weeks, but I just saw the same cross-contamination habits. 

Using hands for touch the crab meat (with gloves) and then touching cucumbers with the same hand; Dropping crab meat into other dishes of fish; same knife to cut fried crab and shrimp for every single burrito. 

I don't like leaving bad reviews for otherwise decent restaurants but this place has fresh ingredients, with a decent menu, but bad management and training."}
{"text":"Eeek! I'm so so sad and disappointed. I don't know what happened from the first time around BUT the quality just wasn't there for me this time. 

I ordered the Stupid Good Tuna which comes with ahi tuna, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumbers, tempura flakes,yuzu miso sauce and unagi sauce from their signature creations. I chose the sushi rice and it was mushy. It's probably because the container they put it in is plastic and the condensation makes it mushy, so it's not fresh. The ahi and crab was ok, the veggies didn't seem as fresh and I was not digging one of the sauces. The miso wasn't too bad had a little kick to it. 


Overall, I don't think my $17 dollar meal was worth it, sadly. Quite pricey for a meal for one. What was I thinking?? Solid Pass For me."}
{"text":"Really good food- had a spicy burrito.  Thanks interior is nee/redone. Looks great and I like the real plants on the tables. 

Slow on the ordering and build process- sure it will get better as staff gets experience."}
{"text":"I'm so excited there is finally a sushi burrito place on my side of town! I've been here a few times and love it! The staff is always so welcoming and helpful. They have signature creations or you can build it yourself. You can choose to make a sushi burrito, poke bowl, or salad. Your food is made right in front of you, so you can see they have fresh and awesome quality products. I've tried all of the spicy signature creations and sometimes build my own. I love the quirky names on the menu and whoever came up with the idea of a Mochi Pop is seriously a genius. They are brand new but you can tell every aspect was well thought out and I can see them going far."}
{"text":"First off this place is amazing!!!
The customer service is A1, the quality in the food is excellent. The whole staff will welcome you and make sure your first time won't be your last. I had the OG burrito with seaweed wrap. 10/10 This will be my sushi burrito spot for now on."}
{"text":"Tried my first sushi burrito at tail & fin and fell in love with the OG. Definitely a spot to check out, great selection, friendly staff & great food! Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Build your own poke bowl?! Yes please!! Loved all the different options and super fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"My bf and arrived when they opened on a Friday and they were still setting up. Though they were slow, the staff was helpful and nice. 

The food is fresh and good. I went with the sushi burrito and my bf got the sushi tacos. The tacos are messy but he said they tasted good. The sushi burrito was good...it's just a giant sushi roll lol We didn't get the chance to try their poke bowls but you have the option to build your own bowl or choose their combinations on the menu. I wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"The amount of fish they gave was more than expected, which is a good thing. The quality of the fish was good too. There was nothing that really set them apart from other poke bowl spots. Their decor was mediocre. I guess I just expected more."}
{"text":"I got to say this is sushi burrito was fantastic. The service was great ! I'm definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"I never had poke before so I was extremely confused on what to even get when I walked in.. it was pretty slow in there so the menu was explained well enough to make my choice and I will for sure be back to Vegas very soon and will have lunch there again!! The girl Sophie working was very helpful and friendly which made it even better even though she was working alone she was killing it!! 5 star for this place!!!! :))"}
{"text":"Finally a sushi burrito place on my side of town! Also it's awesome!!! Tail and Fin sushi burrito & poke. Got the stupid good tuna burrito for my first time. The name says it allwith lots of different sauces to try I'm definitely doing a build my own next time. It's off of Maryland parkway and silverdo ranch for my fellow southsiders. The staff was very friendly and the ambiance was chill. Think I found my new favorite regular place."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We enjoyed it!!!  Sushi was fresh and the concept of this was amazing. My family and I had to buy 2nd."}
{"text":"First poke / sushi burrito spot I've had that offers soft shell crab and shrimp tempura ! They even heat it up for you.  We got A large Crabby Bastard and the regular Shrimp Tempest with extra spicy tuna and the cucumber sunomono which came out to about $28. We did it with the salad and it was actually pretty filling. They put a lot of imitation crab in the bowls and the presentation was great.  The eel sauce looked like it could have been too much but it actually turned out to be the perfect amount. Definitely worth checking this place out!"}
{"text":"High prices and poor ratio of rice to fish to toppings... I could barely tell there was any rice at all in my poke bowl every bite just felt like fish and my toppings.  The additional toppings were also expensive and I could go to a different poke place i like and get them all for free!"}
{"text":"I continue to see this amazing looking pineapple poke bowl on my feeds. I didn't realize it was from here, in Las Vegas. Looked it up, and it was not too far from me.

I'm very particular with my poke. I realized after all these poke bars that has opened up everywhere that I'm more of a traditional Hawaiian poke kind of girl. Honestly, the only poke shop I fux with in Vegas is Poke Express on Stephanie in Henderson. I mostly have had bad experience at these create your own, overly topped style poke spots. 
Tail and Fin has similar concept to those poke shops that have been trending. From poke bowls with endless topping, to sushi burritos. 

A couple distinction stands out here though. They also have sushi tacos and the pineapple bowls. The best distinction I can say about this place compared to its similar shops, the fish taste fresh. I had the salmon, ahi, and spicy tuna for my $9.95 build your own + $2 for pineapple bowl + $1.50 for masago. The fish were perfectly cubed. Not too big of cuts like other places. The pineapple bowl gives the whole bowl a refreshing level of extra freshness. 

 Although I enjoyed my meal here, it didn't quite make it my #1 poke spot. However, I will return when I'm down to my 2nd option whenever I'm craving poke."}
{"text":"I love the convenience of this place being right across the street from work. I've come here a few times already and every experience, Sophia has treated me with excellent customer service and always made great suggestions on what to order. My food is always put together well and never messy. Thanks Sophia for always making me feel welcome and fed.."}
{"text":"The quality and freshness is phenomenal. Significantly better than other poke places in town. My fave were the sushi tacos. They were fresh, healthy yet packet with flavor. They offer jalapeños for an extra kick, seaweed salad but honestly they had me at mangos and pomegranates as a topping option.
They have endless possibilities for custom bowls that even the pickiest of eaters can get a meal they enjoy with satisfaction. The line moves pretty quickly despite the fact that their bowls offer near endless customization. This is an awesome place to mix into the weekly lunch/dinner rotation. I highly recommend the spicy ponzu sauce!! The best deconstructed sushi roll in town!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to enjoy this place because I work in the area and pass it multiple times everyday...

Unfortunately, it was subpar. I enjoy sushi quite a bit and have visited a multitude of sushi bars, poke spots, and sushi burrito establishments all around town. This place is second to last on my list. 
In comparison to other sushi burrito spots... Portion size is terrible here. 
Taste/texture is nothing to rave about. 
Topping ratio is COMPLETELY off. 
I got a bowl and when asking for certain toppings, they were counted out and nowhere near what I would like (5 cucumber pieces and 2 Yama gobo spears). 
I also ordered a burrito which I believe had more seaweed salad in it than all other ingredients combined. 
Price is fairly consistent, if not slightly higher, than similar stores, but not worth it for the amount of food you get. Myself and my friend were both still hungry after our meals. 

I will say they are still fairly new, so maybe things will get better as they mature. I will give them A LOT of time to figure it out before/if I try it again though."}
{"text":"I always visit friends in Summerlin and we never can agree on a place to go eat and then Tail & Fin finally opened their new location!! I am a creature of habit so the fact that they have one here is perfect. Shrimp tempest or flaming tuna are by far the favorites."}
{"text":"The food is great. The three star waiting is just because of how ridiculously long it takes to make a burrito."}
{"text":"My go to for poke bowls.  Usually a 5 but today I was a little irritated.  I ordered a large bowl and got it in a different bowl than normal.  But watever.  Ask him to mix the fish with the sauce.  He just swishes the fish around in the sauce like really.  And he gave such little seaweed and little edamame.  Like really.  

My usual at the top and what I got this time was way smaller."}
{"text":"Up next on my quest to try all the sushi burritos in Vegas is Tail and Fin.  I got the Crabby Bastard.  I wasn't sure about the pomegranate seeds but ended up loving it.  Ingredients were fresh and worked well together.  They have much more than sushi burritos.  Like most other places you can get your burrito as a bowl or salad.  They also have those sushi tacos you see all over Instagram along with avocado bowls, ceviche and acai bowls.  They even have kids meals!  Love that."}
{"text":"Went in not knowing what on earth the restaurant was about and the two young employees were SO nice and patient answering a million questions.  I finally ordered a small salmon \"burrito\" and it was great!  So fresh and light.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So, had to come and try the sushi tacos since I see it all the time in Facebook.    You got to choose your protein and toppings you wanted for them.   The only down fall would be if you added any sauce to it, it would make the nori break apart very easily.  Maybe trying to double up on the nori would help.   Over all, the fish was fresh!"}
{"text":"The first time I went, the customer service was average. I was hesitant about visiting again, but I'm glad I did. The fish is fresh and delicious. I ordered a pineapple bowl and 2 sushi tacos. This time the customer service was much better. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin... One of the staff had her evil eye/hand bracelet dangling in the food when she was prepping the burritos (namaste more like you nasty). We ordered the crabby bastard but the soft shell crab had a funky taste to it like it wasn't fresh. My daughter has been having the runs since we ate here. She was so excited about this place but I highly doubt we'll be back unless they improve on the quality and freshness of their ingredients (and cleanliness)."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this review is not only getting reviewed based off this location, but their pop-up location in T-Mobile Arena as well.

I first discovered this establishment because of their taco shaped sushi rolls.



I bet if I ended my review after my last sentence people would still go there solely based off the fact that they have sushi in the shape of TACOS!!! Hey, I mean, I'm guilty of that. Sushi burritos are sooo 2017.

Back to what I was saying, this place is fresh to death. From their clean dinning atmosphere to their fish selection. Plus, they never get chincy with their portions and are very accommodating to changing up what you want in their signature creations. 

Chincy (definition found on Urban Dictionary):

Cheap, low quality


I work at T-Mobile Arena and go to their stand every time I work, along with all of my fellow coworkers. Originally, it was because it was the healthiest alternative so we weren't always eating candy, popcorn, pretzels or chicken tenders with fries. Don't get me wrong, I love all those things; but when sushi is an option, it is ALWAYS the answer.

The staff is honestly what makes us keep coming back for more though. The owner of Tail and Fin is always working on Golden Knights game days and is so welcoming to the line of T-Mobile staff that waits for them to draw back the curtain. For obvious reasons, on game days it's fitting to get the Golden Knights bowl, a dish you can only get at their T-Mobile stand, not at one of their brick and mortar locations. I speak on behalf of myself and everyone else, that we really appreciate how they tolerate our excessive need for extra seaweed salad, tempura flakes and eel sauce. Because it's just not the same if it's not coated in a blanket of eel sauce.

Excited to see the real MVP's at Tail and Fin again next season at the Golden Knights games. Until then, Go Knights Go!!!"}
{"text":"Tail and Fin is great at what they do. Quick efficient flavorful bowls (or burritos) of various items combined in a myriad of umami to hit the spot when you get a craving for sushi but do not want to drop $30-$50 on dining out.  The service is always accompanied with a smile and welcoming demeanor and they are priced well for the budget savvy individual.  Over the past week I've been here twice and both times were good experiences but I always feel under the gun when I get to the pass and never know if I \"chose wisely\" like I was in Indiana Jones.  There are a great deal of options to choose from so the repeat business is strong with this one. I'll just have to keep going back until I find the ultimate combination."}
{"text":"Every damn bite explodes in your mouth with a different pleasurable taste! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!!!! Food is great; what a great concept. The quality seemed to me to be as good as the expensive sushi restaurants. While there prices reasonable and there portions are on point a good size, they also are excellent quality. I would have taken a picture of my food but I just couldn't stop myself from eating it long enough to take a pic. Soooooo good!!"}
{"text":"One of he better poke/sushi burrito places in town. Quality is great, cleanliness is very good and service is ok. Place is a little messy on he inside but not bad. I recommend trying it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Food quality was great and service was even better... Even though there were plenty of different set combinations I decided to BYOB (Build your own burrito). It was my first sushi burrito experience and you can say Tail & Fin definitely set the bar high."}
{"text":"Second time here! it was good! Everything is fresh! 

ordered: the burrito and a bowl, both were very good! 

would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very unique and has a wide array of choices. If you like to eat healthy and are into poke this place is great. The price is reasonable and the place is very clean. I am definitely going to go back"}
{"text":"Finally a Sushi Burrito/Poke place in a Summerlin Neighborhood @ Trails Village!! Came to try this place out a day after it's Grand Opening of 2/9/16 and there was some opportunity for improvement BUT the food was really good. 

On the menu you have a choice to build your own Sushi Burrito or bowl or you can choice from one of their signature favorites. If you've never had a Sushi Burrito, the menu can be a little overwhelming if you're not familiar with the options but going with a signature favorite is always a good choice. I asked one of the employees for a recommendation and the response I got was \"they are all good\" so that didn't really help. They will get that question often so it would be a good idea to recommend some items or find out what the person likes. 

I decided to try \"The Shrimp Tempest\" Burrito that has shrimp tempura, crab, avocado, green onion, carrot, and unagi sauce (it's like a sweet teriyaki sauce). It was REALLY good! The Burrito's are a good size and will fill you up. I tried to make mine a combo that comes with a side, drink, and a desert for $3 more. However, they were out of miso soup and out of the cucumber salad which was disappointing as there was still a few hours before closing. 

The restaurant is really nice, trendy, and clean. There is an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. Upon entering, there were a couple people ahead of me and the workers were busy so they didn't look up and welcome me. There also wasn't a lot of smiles as the workers seemed a little overwhelmed. I'm assuming cause it's the grand opening. I would recommend to the employees to greet every person who comes in and make sure they smile, especially if you're trying to keep the excitement up of the new location. Also, I was asked if I was signed up for the reward program and I said no and they asked for my phone number but didn't give me any info on what the program was about or how it worked. 

Overall I had a good experience and will definitely be returning. So happy to have this place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is new to my block all the staff is welcoming and helpful, I love the location. A bit expensive but overall good poke!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place the Crabby Bastard and the Shrimp tempest are my favorites the OG and yo Adrian are great and I love the atmosphere. Congratulations on the expansion."}
{"text":"Definitely had a good first time experience.  Although I only got take out.  The ambiance is very casual.  My boyfriend went to get our food and the timing was pretty quick.  The menu has some good options but I chose to build my own.  I got a sushi burrito with tuna, avocado, cucumber, spicy mayo and tempora flakes.  I do like what I came up with and the ease of options. Would try something more creative next time.  I definitely recommend this so anyone wanting to feed a sushi craving.  It's a great creative option without all the hassle."}
{"text":"First time here, everything looks really fresh!! Tried the Yo Adrian. Love the decor and environment"}
{"text":"I was in the area and stumbled into what I would call the find of the century in terms of a new fantastic place to eat lunch (probably dinner also). The restaurant is called Tail & Fin . It's a combination of sushi and burrito and everything in between. You can have the meal served in a traditional burrito or in a bowl (watching my weight so that's the direction I went in)

The food was so tasty, fresh and it was the perfect sized portion.

The employees could not have been more helpful in helping me with food suggestions.

Over all a great experience. I will definitely be back and we bring my entire family."}
{"text":"Little disappointed at the \"burrito\" concept.  The ingredients were fresh, tasty but in essence, you're devouring an uncut sushi roll.  Too much filler and a little on the pricey side.  Dinner for two will run you about $50.00 (with drinks and salad).  I went during their grand opening and the \"chefs\" were still piecing together the items using cheat sheets.  I could've done that at home."}
{"text":"So soooo good!!!! So fresh and every menu item I've tried is delicious :) Staff are all super friendly and knowledgeable. Super happy to have this restaurant close to home"}
{"text":"Friendly staff willing to go along with my creation ideas! I asked for the new sushi taco and Emily was so helpful giving me ideas for sauce and toppings. It turned out great, even though I'm no sushi connoisseur. Casual clean modern atmosphere. Good price."}
{"text":"First time ever trying a sushi burrito..absolutely loved it!! Great taste and the freshest ingredients. Restaurant was very clean and staff friendly. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is good. Just like the other poke places that opened up recently in last 6 months. Sorry but they are all the same to me, those 4 or 5 places, you know. (Oh, no no. I'm not including my Poke Express. They just relocated.)
I had OG bowl. It was fresh and delicious. To me, it was more like \"chopped sashimi bowl with sauce\". If you are used to poke bowls in Hawaii, you would probably feel this way, too. Anyways, I enjoyed it very much :-) It was a perfect healthy lunch for me! As some said, I felt it's a little pricey side for the portion you get. (I'm used to Poke Express's price tho...)
The staff were very friendly and super helpful. 
I'm happy that place like this opened up close to my house (+1 star)!!
I'll be back :-)"}
{"text":"Yummy.  My husband and I have had this delivered by postmates twice now, and both times the food was fantastic!  Tons of fresh fish on a big salad with awesome sauces.  I have never been so satisfied from a salad!  Delicious."}
{"text":"Great sushi burrito for this part of town. The large is big enought for both my wife and I. We will be going back, Fair price also"}
{"text":"First time here! The menu has a lot of signature burtito/bowls/ roll. Or you can choose what you want.  I got the shrimp tempest... yummy.  I chose white rice,  shrimp tempura, crab etc. The staff were friendly and helpful.  You can dine in ir sit out on the patio. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not my favorite poke experience but still okay - I'd say 3.5 stars. I ordered a poke salad and its was just eh. I prefer the sauces to be mixed with the poke instead of just placed on top of everything. Got the ponzu and garlic aioli and that was also just okay.  The girl who served me put too much masago ... and she also did not look too happy to be there and wasn't too friendly. But maybe she was having a bad day. Would probably still eat here though since its close to work."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burrito. The restaurant is new and ambiance was nice. Staff was very friendly and service was good. 

Has everything you'd expect from a sushi burrito place. Unfortunately, the standard for me in Vegas for sushi burrito places is Soho.  So what is lacking?  The menu offerings are a little scarce comparatively. I suppose I could have made a custom burrito but I was hungry and wanted them to put one together quickly. 

The food tasted good and fresh. I was a little disappointed with the miso; where's the seaweed? I felt like I was drinking a broth packed with sliced scallions."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place while on vacation... and it lived up to my expectations! Ingredients tasted fresh and they weren't skimpy on the veggies or condimentsI wish I had one near home!"}
{"text":"If you want to go to any Tail and Fin location, go to this one.  Heaven, the manager, is amazing.  She was friendly, helpful, honest and above all heavenly.  See what I did there ;-).  But seriously, she went above and beyond what was expected of her and we will definitely be a repeat customer because of the service we received from her.  Oh, and the other employees are good as well..."}
{"text":"Got my poke bowl through post mates. My avocado was not fresh. It had black marks on it. Getting charged $1.49 for unfresh avocado.... Awesome surcharges for rotten veggies. I wanted the salad mix and my bowl was drenched in poke sauce. Can't even eat it. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"The grand opening of Tail & Fin was everything I thought it would be... and more! 

Upon parking easily right out front, we walked in and immediately jumped on line (it was understandably busy) The restaurant is in a small section of the strip mall and neighbors Teriyaki Madness, Subway, and a pizza place.

It has minimal modern decor that caters to us ridiculous social media addicts (Photo op wall, and a snapchat geo tag).

There's only about 8 tables, if that. So, I expect it to always be full. We opted to take our food to-go, instead of waiting for a seat to open. 

The food is to die for. My husband and I got two different burritos. We semi customized both. 
We ordered The Crabby Bastard- soft shell crab, surimi crab, cucumber, tomato, furikake, avocado, pomegranate, unagi sauce. We subbed the  pomegranate for spicy tuna and cilantro.

Also, The Omega- salmon, surimi crab, romaine, tomato, avocado, red onion, ponzu, honey sesame aioli. I added mango, raw jalapeño & chili garlic aioli. 
I highly recommend adding mango, it adds a nice sweetness. 

We were in and out in 10 minutes, on the grand opening day, including our wait time on line. Impressive! The staff was organized, happy and on point! 

I anticipate eating here at least once a week! 

Happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh. I had no major complaints. my inly small niggles are the portion sizes seem a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"Anyone who loves sushi knows the importance of the rice.  The rice here is a congealed mess.  Mushy and doesn't seem like it's prepared sushi rice.  The fish lacked flavor.   I should have been weary when they loaded the nori and rice in a machine and it come shooting out the bottom.   Employee's are nice and service is ok for counter service."}
{"text":"The food was on point. Fresh clean and deliciousness.  Well worth the drive, Dominick made our visit exceptional and is the man."}
{"text":"Kind of awkward closed in line for ordering service seemed rather slow, but I did get a tasty bowl after a slight wait. The menu is smaller than most but I like that. \"keep it simple stupid\" is a saying I live by. They definitely need to do some decorating in here I feel line I'm in a warehouse breakroom."}
{"text":"Best poke place ever! Fresh tasty! The place is clean and organized and staff very nice!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Bombbbbb! I ordered the shrimp tempest burrito and let me tell ya...super good! I even ordered a second to take home.  There's no shame in my game! Staff was very friendly with great customer service.  I will definitely be back...like tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with friends. We shared all our dishes so we could try each dish. Love the sushi tacos, burritos, and the poke bowl. Can't wait to come back and have lunch there again:"}
{"text":"Ooooo mmmmmm ggggggg why did I just find this place. My partner and I were in this last Tuesday night. The food was amazing and the team members we funny. Love all the ingredients wish the team members would have explained the menu would have helped us out pick our food. Other then that the food was amazing!!! Thanks you will see us again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmy! We tried the Stupid Good Tuna Burrito and it was delish, fed two of us. The Hawaiian looking girl was super friendly and gave us a laugh or two(:"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a sushi burrito and this place popped up! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! I ordered through Eat24, when I got there they were just about done making it!! Delicious sushi burrito, friendly staff, very clean! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl. The girl that made it had her hair down. Then she had gloves on but was picking each item for the bowl up with her hands instead of using the scoops. Then the other employees were talking to her so she wasn't listening while making my sloppy bowl. Then after she made the bowl she told me she could only take cash because the computer was down and she had no change. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi burrito spot. You can create you own or choose for the amazing option on the board. One of my favorites is Flaming tuna a must try. Generous portion, fresh fish, Great ambience and they offer desert too. Variety flavors of Mochi ice cream pops. Wait I forgot to mention the variety of sauces that they offer. You have to sample them all. My favorite is the chili garlic aioli. If you haven't been there yet you must go. Definitely be back again"}
{"text":"So ok my first impression trying this place was lukewarm. 
Came in around 3:45 pm on a Wednesday and it was empty. The modern, simplistic, upscale decor is definitely attempted, but it wasn't enough for it not to still feel oddly industrial, and like the space didn't fit the vision. It was just off. Especially behind the counter it all seemed very homemade so it was hard to be convincing that it was upscale modern when you look behind the counter and it looks like someone's home kitchen. 

The young girl who greeted us was very nice, explained the menu, but couldn't tell us about their most eye catching, IG famous menu item which is the Pineapple Express, served in a half pineapple. But she was very sweet and didn't charge me for adding avocado to my burrito because we had never been there before. Which I'm certainly grateful for because the amount of avocado she added to my burrito wouldn't have been worth the up-charge. 

The service was pretty slow compared to other poke places, and my friend got the half pineapple item which required someone special in the back to cut it which extended the preparation even further. My burrito which had been waiting at the register in the meantime, got handed to another customer who left and then had to be tracked down to retrieve it and it was kind of a mess for a second there. We walked out of there like \"whew we made it\". 

That all being said, the food was tasty, but it didn't rate so well in every other way. Hey, if it tastes good then maybe that doesn't matter. But it did affect my overall opinion. 
I got a burrito with brown rice and the rice was slightly hard but surely nothing that would make me stop eating it. The seaweed wrap became so soggy from the time it was made to the time I began eating it that i couldn't take a clean bite. Each bite resulted in this catastrophic avalanche of ingredients falling out all over my hands and onto the paper beneath.  lol it was a friggin mess eating that thing!! I had stuff falling out all over the place and sauce all over my hands. So it tasted good, YES. But it was messy AF to eat and simply knowing sushi burritos shouldn't be like that was something I can't ignore. I think the girl added way too much sauce and really didn't wrap it that well so it was kind of a bummer to have this good tasting meal that was a mess and falling apart. I finished my burrito with a fork so in my humble opinion, burrito skills not on point here, guys. Do it right or don't do it at all. 
Thank God they give you wet wipes in the bag because I needed one like I had just eaten a half rack of ribs. 


The price point here is good, you certainly don't feel like you've been over charged and the food tastes good if nothing else. So it's worth trying but in my opinion I'd have to have a much different experience overall for them to merit 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is really close to where I live compared to other sushi burrito/bowl places! I had the spicy tuna bowl. Great customer service and the bowl was great!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location often and have never had anything bad to say...except that they have expensive menu items. It's so good though, that I don't mind. This visit though I was very put off by the woman behind the counter. 
It was 8:30-8:45 p.m. and the sign clearly says they close at 9p.m. All of the chairs are on the tables and some of the lights were out. They are still open for customers though. Great, I can get my bowl then.
I asked for shrimp tempura and soft shelled crab. Nope! \"The fryers are turned off.\" \"Don't you close at 9?\" \"Yes, but it takes 20 minutes to cool down.\" \"Ummmmmmmmmm...again, don't you close at 9?\" \"It would take 10 minutes to heat back up\" This time with an attitude.
This woman obviously did not want to serve anyone and was in such a rush to get me out of there. I'm sorry that I asked for something on the menu.  
Do the managers know that this is the norm there around closing?"}
{"text":"Got the fruity pebble acai bowl as I was already full from eating before I have to say it was amazing . It's a regular acai bowl with fruity pebble cereal on top to give it a tropical twist."}
{"text":"I've been trying to get over to this place since it opened and finally stopped by today. I had the avocado boat starter with the yo Adrian bowl. Everything was as I expected to be, very fresh and tasteful. The atmosphere could use a little tweaking, maybe a little music? Other than that I can't complain."}
{"text":"this place is off the strip no fighting for parking and the sushi burrito is very filling they dont skimp on the portions. They have alot of traffic coming through but the staff works fast and effectively we barely waited."}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi burrito. I came here yesterday to check out some food options near my new home. It wasn't the best sushi burrito I've had but it definitely wasn't the worst. I ordered the Flaming Tuna and it was definitely flaming. But it was unfortunately a little messy and started to fall apart mid way through eating."}
{"text":"I saw this place trending as a hot spot so I jumped right on it! Went by and tried the ahi poke bowl. I asked many questions about the freshness of the ahi wondering if it came in frozen. I was told by the cashier it was fresh and freshly prepared in the restaurant. Now, the place does not \"look\" like anything \"freshly\" prepared happens here. Don't get me wrong, it's cute and it's clean. But it has the assembly line, fast food feel. But what REALLY made me curious is that I read online that Executive Chef Wedhaus of  Nobu Las Vegas and Nobu Beijing fame was behind the menu. That certainly struck my fancy. Nobu is my fave! Well, tail and fin did not disappoint, it was very good and very fresh. What I would want to add is the availability of toasted sesame oil and a dash of pink salt for those of us who choose to bypass all of the sauces. Other than adding a dash of those which I did after taking my bowl home to go....it was supurb! The service......definitely needs some polishing (speed and knowledge of sauces and food items). But again, the ahi was the bomb dot com."}
{"text":"Found this poke place on yelp. Walked in and was greeted by staff. It was nice and clean! I did a large BYOB. The fish was fresh and tasty. Portion size for the large was great for the price. The staff was super friendly and helpful. I will definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"I love the freshness of the food And how clean it is . I totally recommend tail and fin for anyone who wants healthy clean delicious choice! Poke is on point . How can u go to Vegas and not eat there its a must !"}
{"text":"I got the Omega and it was the best! They keep clean and everything is fantastic. The people are kind and it's good to keep Kosher!"}
{"text":"Not coming back again!!!!!  Rice was hard and seaweed salad was too slimy!!! Yuck!!!!!! 
I have tried a lot of places like soho and jaburritos. I'm not sure if this place gets better. I like their tacos and displays though........ Right now this location looks busy, but that's because we don't have sushi burritos places around here at all. You should try other places then you'll know the difference."}
{"text":"Great spot. I had a custom bowl with ahi tuna and tempura shrimp and it was really good. My girl had an angry birds burrito and loved it. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I have to stick with 3 stars. Not the best sushirito place but not the worst. Was very bland, lacked good flavor like most I've had. Staff was friendly though and quick, place was clean, food was fresh. I was happy a spot opened next to my home but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow. Very impressed with Tail and Fin. Ordered a build your own burrito. The salmon and toppings were very fresh. The sauce was amazing. Have to say this was the best burrito I've ever had. Awesome healthy meal and the restaurant was very clean. Customer service and meal gets an A+. I highly recommend trying this place out. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The thing I hate the most when dining out is bad customer service and slow customer service, just do your job people!! I understand with new restaurants it takes some time to work out the kinks but seriously management did you not train these people after you hired them?! There were 5 people working and no one but me and my friend in the restaurant and it still took a ridiculous amount of time for our tacos and burrito. I think the guy spent 5 minutes trying to put the rice on my tacos and watching the rice stick to his glove. We almost walked out and ate somewhere else. 
 The burritos and tacos were good but nothing better than any other sushi burrito/bowl place around town but the wrap job on the burrito definitely needs some work. 
All in all I think this place has potential but it's definitely not worth it to drive to if you don't live nearby.  I'm probably going wait 6 months and try this place out again then. Hopefully by then the employees figure out how to properly wrap the burritos and speed things up a bit.

UPDATE:
I came back before I said I would (6 months) I thought maybe if I give it a month they will be better. NOPE I was the only one in the restaurant and they still took 15 minutes to make ONE sushi burrito! HOW!??"}
{"text":"So good! Great food and great service! I love their spicy tuna and the spicy crab is good too!"}
{"text":"Been a few times to fill my poke craving . Fresh fish, yummy combos and would totally recommend for sushi burritos and bowls !"}
{"text":"I was expecting much more flavourful food but everything was quite bland. The presentation that they advertise online is nothing like what you receive in the store. The Pineapple Express is just kind of thrown together in a bowl just topped with bits of pineapple that weren't quite ripe yet. The staff was extremely slow and there wasn't another customer in the store. Their sauces are pretty good. The food seems reasonably fresh. Their chunks of fish meat are in really large chunks which makes it difficult to eat in a poke bowl because you have to pull them apart unless you want just five huge bites of fish."}
{"text":"I was greatly disappointed with my Shrimp Tempest. I had been looking forward to trying this place for weeks but I feel it was just a waste of money.

The Shrimp tempura looked plump and juicy while he was making it. When I actually ate it, there was almost no shrimp meat and it was so dry like a jerky. I wish there was more shrimp for the price you pay for the tiny wrap. There wasn't much flavor to the wrap in general. More sauce(s) would be perfect for more flavor. Lastly, the romaine lettuce was a weird texture to with the rest of the wrap. It didn't seem to be cohesive with the rest of the ingredients and it just fell out of the wrap anyways.

I want to give this place another try and try something else but the Shrimp Tempest left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I eat here 2-3x a week. Food is incredible & the staff is super friendly!!! Neighborhood favorite! Try the Stupid Good Tuna Bowl!!!"}
{"text":"I got a regular sushi burrito with tuna, spicy tuna, crab, shrimp tempura, cucumber, seaweed salad, furikake, tempura crumbs, avocado, spicy mayo, eel sauce. 

Overall it was really good. My only complaint was the placement of the protein and toppings on the burrito. It was placed so that I would get huge bites of crab, then once the crab was gone I would reach the next layer of protein. I would have preferred to have a little bit of everything in one bite."}
{"text":"This Tail and Fin in Henderson has to be the best in town!!! Although, I find myself going more often I truly fell in love with this place my first time visiting. I have visited other \"sushi burrito\" style restaurants in town but this one overall has to be the best! 
After a long day at work I didn't feel like cooking. So, I thought to myself this would be the best time to not only treat myself but to introduce sushi to my daughter:). 
While walking in we were greeted with a warm hello and a kind smile by a team member named Sophia. As stated, my daughter has never had sushi before and Sophia was kind enough to go through the menu, make suggestions and described some of her own likes and helped my daughter figure out what she should order. Needless to say my daughter was very happy with her selection.
As stated, I find myself stopping by more often to pick up lunch before I go to work. If I have the pleasure to be assisted by Sophia she asks me about my daughter and always remembers what I like to order!!
So, this place to me has to be the best in town not only because of the great food but because of terrific team members like Sophia who help keep an establishment like this running!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place! People were very patient with our order since we didnt know what to get, but the portion size is good esp for a large so much meat, and some toppings are no extra charge which i like. Cute place for pictures of your food for the 'Gram"}
{"text":"I am new to the sushi burrito concept and this place was a great first experience! Fish was very fresh and they have a great selection of add-ons. Menu is simple yet has plenty of options to choose from, including the \"build your own\" burrito/bowl. Very happy to have this healthy dining option so close to my house, I will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place. They give you plenty of options and a very good amount of fresh fish!  Delicious and worth the money!   5 stars!"}
{"text":"So....kind of awkward when you walk in and get to witness a show...a GrubHub driver upset for (unknown/unidentifiable reasons) going at it with the owner - even the employee felt awkward and apologized.  That being said, that scene could have been handled so differently so that employees and customers didn't feel awkward or have to witness it. 

Pros:
-The two male employees and once the owner got back on track were very friendly. 
-Serving portions were decent. 
-Spicy tuna was flavorful and not too overly spicy. 
-Spicy crab was really good too.
-Fish tasted fresh. 
-They bring out mocha after you're done eating so that it isn't melted if you chose the combo option and are dining in the restaurant. 

Cons:
-Both our sushi and brown rice were rock hard and cold.  (Biggest negative here)
-Fish (salmon and tuna) wasn't mixed with poke sauce; just added on top so there wasn't much flavor to it. 
-Cucumber was bland and oily tasting.
-Avocado upcharge...we got 1/4 of avocado each so kind of disappointing. 
-Salad was a little brown and wilted looking."}
{"text":"Fantastic quality. Considering you're paying $11+ for a meal, this is surely expected.  I had a make-your-own bowl with a pineapple addition.  As a tip, the pineapple is a waste.  It might be instagram-worthy, but it adds no additional flavor and the edge of the pineapple is impossible to get off and eat; so it's just a cooler looking bowl for $2.  The thing I like a bout Tail and Fin is they don't skimp on the toppings or protein.  For the base make-your-own option, you get 4 portions of any meat and all the toppings in the world.  I had a sample of 4 meats - albacore, spicy tuna, spicy crab, and salmon.  All were fresh with the spicy tuna being my favorite.  Generous portions of the protein were complimented by tons of veggies from lettuce to edamame to carrot to fish eggs.  My meal was delicious, especially topped with some spicy sauce (though definitely mild).  Another tip is to throw on some ginger and wasabi to make it more Japanese.  Though many option were fishy and more sushi-based, anyone will have the opportunity to come here and get something with chicken and veggie options offered as well.

The service was extremely slow as there was only one person up front and it's not a quick process with so many options and the unfamiliarity of the ordering process and ingredients by most patrons.  The person behind the counter was nice enough to recommend the most popular sauces and proteins, so the slow pace was really the only complaint with the meal ordering process.

Tail and Fin is worth the money for a nice fast casual, healthy, lunch every once in a while.  I think it's the best in town from what I've tried.  Though the poke and sushi burrito fad may go away, I think Tail and Fin is here to stay."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Like it fulfills the idea of a poke shop, but doesn't really stick out from the other poke shops. The choice of ingredients was very slim. The ingredients also didn't taste very fresh, and the guy just poured the sauce on to mask it. It wasn't inedible so that's somewhat of a plus. Overall, it was a very disappointing meal."}
{"text":"The portions are small, the sauces are not very tasty, the meat did not look very appealing and the cut on the meat looked butched. My ahi tuna did not hold a square shape well and was mushy and whitish. The service was below average from sushi burrito places. They were nice but not overly helpful for people who may not be new to this cuisine. I don't believe I was greeted as I walked in. Stick with sweet poke or soho."}
{"text":"Went back for another sushi burrito and they hit it out of the park again. This time I saw everyone ordering their poke bowls with crunch. I added that and wow, game changer."}
{"text":"I went here to try the sushi tacos. I think it's a great and fun idea especially for people who love to Instagram their food. However, it was harder and messier to eat. Maybe that's just me. It also doesn't fill me up as much even if I get 4 or 6 sushi tacos. 

It's better for me to just get a poke bowl. 
But if you prefer variety, then get the tacos. One of the employees suggested I try mangos as one of the toppings with one my sushi tacos -- best suggestion ever! Now I always get mangos with my poke bowl. 

Good quality overall."}
{"text":"Great place eat, especially if you like it raw. Plus there's pretty light skin girl that works there. I think she hates pickles"}
{"text":"Just moved into a house right up the street from Tail and Fin and this could be dangerous!! I absolutely love this sushi burrito shop. The restaurant is laid back and the staff is great! The signature creations burritos/bowls are so tasty (I recommend the flaming tuna... YUM!!) and are totally customizable to what you like. 

The owner was in the last time I was there... what a great guy!! It is easy to see how proud and excited he is for this restaurant... it's always nice to see an owner that is present and eager to meet the customers. 

10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. I'm a huge fan. Ordered takeout twice and I'll definitely be back for more. I created my own bowl and I love that you can add whatever you want with ease and creativity. I have so many food sensitivities that places like this make my life so much easier. 
Highly recommend the yellow tail. The first time I ordered it on the avocado for my bf and I to split as an appetizer. We were both a little sad that I didn't order more of it. lol The soft shell crab is breaded and/or deep fried or something - it's good but I forgot that's how it is prepared and accidentally ordered it a second time. it's good but not my favorite. The ingredients are fresh and plentiful. 

Last time I ordered they did forgot my togo sauce. I was super bummed when I opened my bag, but honestly the yellowtail is so delicious combined with the seaweed and it was good enough without it. But note to self - confirm order before I leave :) 

The bf does not recommend seaweed on the CYO burrito - he said it makes it so hard to eat. :)"}
{"text":"Not so bad for something near my house. There isn't really a poke place in summerlin. I did like my poke tacos and their poke sauce was bomb The only thing was the service was a bit long when it wasn't even busy. It's still new. So I'll give it a chance."}
{"text":"Really cool pineapple bowl, what a fun way to eat poke. The staff was sweet and the fish was really fresh and so was the pineapple. The portion was really great. Definitely bring a sweater it's really cold great for a hot day."}
{"text":"Honestly wanted to like this place considering how helpful the workers were and how nice the location was. Walking into the poke bar, the place has a wonderful bright ambiance with a welcoming staff. They took the time to carefully explain both the menu in addition to their secret menu. 

I came to the place from a friends' recommendation to get their pineapple bowl. As they scooped all the ingredients forward I was pretty excited since the bowl was so picturesque. While a bit on the expensive side for poke, I understood the Summerlin upcharge.

Unfortunately, the fish was beyond lackluster. The bits of tuna felt like it had a gelatinous wall surrounding it. I pretty much had a crunch with each bite. I thought the pineapple bowl had been thawed in the back, but was completely frozen. The rice they added for the dish had gone from a nice steam in their cooker to a frozen hard mess. I understand that they have to freeze the pineapple for storage, but serving it frozen completely ruined my appetite for most of the ingredients. 

All in all, it was a place I wanted to like, but ultimately bad fish in a poke place is a no go."}
{"text":"We tried this place the other day. It was pretty good. Fish was fresh. I had a build your own bowl with greens and spicy tuna. It was really good. My daughter had a california roll sushi burrito. She liked it. I enjoyed sitting out side on their patio. We will go there again."}
{"text":"Out of all of the sushi burrito places that have recently opened, I think this one is my favorite. I love their build your own option where you can get 6 (DIFFERENT) scoops of anything. This makes it way better than the others that offer like 1 or 2 options and charge for additional. I'm so happy we finally have a place like this on this side of town."}
{"text":"Wow! Food was amazing! Best sushiburritos in vegas. If you like spicy I recommend the Flaming tuna"}
{"text":"Came here and tried the sushi tacos. They were good but the seaweed was chewy wasn't able to tear into it. With all the sauce and everything it got soggy quick but overall it was good"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a fast sushi. If your craving sushi and don't have the time just grab and go! You can make your own or select from the prefix menu. This one I got was the shrimp tempura burrito."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The food is fantastic. I love every roll and bowl. The food is fresh and tasty. The staff is awesome, always a good time when ordering. The process is easy, order your food at the counter, customize it, pick it up and pay, find your seat. Nice quick way to grab some amazing sushi!!"}
{"text":"The second location of Tail & Fin opened up in the Trails Village -- a part of Summerlin mostly devoid of good eateries. They took over the space formerly occupied by Dairy Queen and they've done a great job modernizing it. The interior is beautiful with a clean, contemporary look. 

Their brand is more developed and sophisticated than other poke spots. And, they have items like poke tacos using rice and seaweed as the shells and a dish served in half of a hollowed out pineapple shell that are Instagram-worthy. But, after a couple visits I can't say that I'm a fan of their food. I've tried a \"build your own bowl\" ($9.95) and a Stupid Good Tuna bowl ($11.95 large). Both had average or below average quality proteins that seems to be recently defrosted. They seem to go heavy on the sauces to mask the low quality."}
{"text":"Love their sauces!
My favorite one is Yuzu Miso sauce!!!

I go to Tail n Fin once a week :)
Thanks for opening in this area!!"}
{"text":"I first had a sushi burrito back in 2015 in Miami.  I longed for the day when they would make their way out to Las Vegas.  While they did, they were out near the strip or on the opposite side of the valley from me.  Finally Tail & Fin opened right in my neighborhood and my sushi burrito prayers have been answered.  

They have quite a few set types that you can get or create your own in a bowl, burrito, taco, avocado, or pineapple so I'm slowly working my way through the menu.  The only complaints I have are that it can take a while to make it through the line even when it's only a couple of people ahead of you and sometimes the burritos are not quite tight enough so the wrap loosens while eating.  Review also on Trip Advisor."}
{"text":"The burrito was really good but look at your receipt before you leave, they tryed to charge me $1.49 extra for something I never got. I got some edamame but tryed to charge me for masago. I went up for a refund and they tryed to give me massgo but I ate my burrito. After a few mins of demanding my money back they finally gave it to me"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You get to pick your own custom sushi burrito! I have eaten here before and it's always good. If you have never tied a sushi burrito then you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I came all the way from New Jersey to Vegas and had a list of places I wanted to visit to eat, and this place was one of them. I was dying to try the sushi bowl in the pineapple bowl. When I arrived to the restaurant and asked for the pineapple sushi bowl they told me that they were out of pineapples and this was the beginning of my disappointment.  I ended up getting a regular sushi bowl since I was already there. The salmon and the tuna did not taste fresh and the rice has a weird texture and strange taste as well. Both my girlfriend and I were very disappointed by the food and we actually got sick by the time we got back to the hotel. I literally threw up everything I ate. If I could give this restaurant a 0 star review I would. I definitely do not recommend going here. If you want a good sushi burrito definitely recommend Jjanga."}
{"text":"I had been patiently waiting to try a sushi burrito but it seemed all the places that were \"coming soon\" never actually opened. I was super excited when a friend invited me to lunch here, and was even more excited to learn it was in my neighborhood! After a short crash course on how the menu works, I was pleasantly surprised to learn I got to choose FOUR different types of protein, so I made the most of it.  I chose a bowl with yellowtail, ahi, spicy tuna, and salmon. I moved onto the toppings, then got stuck on which sauce I wanted. Wondering out loud, the guy behind the counter said \"you can have whatever you want\".  So, I chose two - spicy ponzu and miso. The bowl was absolutely delicious. The spicy tuna didn't have that mealy consistency I've experienced at other place, and the fish was so fresh, as were all the toppings. The service was great. I have heard that the line can run out the door, but that's what you get when you have great food! Just plan to get there a bit early and enjoy! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to postmates from, absolutely love the sushi burritos and poke bowls. Everything is always fresh even when I get postmates to deliver! All the sauces are delicious, can go wrong here especially when you r choosing your favorite ingredients! 2 thumbs up (if u do get it delivered though postmates definitely ask for the sauce on the side)."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. The decor is nice and the employees were helpful. I got a custom poke bowl and it was delicious while I was eating it but a few hours after I had the worst stomachache followed by vomiting. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Wow! My first time and it's absolutely amazing . Food was unbelievable , I had the flaming tuna salad , which can be done in a burrito or a poke bowl . I love how you can build your own if you wanted to. Great spot , will be coming back . #ilikeitraw"}
{"text":"I walked into this nicely decorated restaurant with an expectation of great poke place, but this hope quickly got shut down by their overpriced menu, lack of selection, and lack of knowledge employees had about their food.
I don't remember what I ended up getting, I think it was one of their pre-selected mixed bowl, but it was not good at all. I didn't finish it - in fact, I only ate a little and threw the rest away.
Fish didn't taste fresh, and I didn't want to risk getting a stomachache."}
{"text":"The sushi burrito craze has not slowed down. This is a fast casual vibe with a chipotle-esque ordering system. We ordered both the tempest and the flaming tuna. I preferred the Tempest with spicy ponzu sauce instead of the Flaming tuna. The sushi tacos are cute and good way to try out a flavor combination without ordering a whole burrito. 

Mom Rating 5/5 
It is spacious and welcoming to young children. We had our stroller with us and did not feel like we were in anyone's space at all. The have single bathrooms however I do not recall whether or not they have changing tables."}
{"text":"Thank goodness this opened around the corner from my neighborhood.  Delicious and healthy sushi burritos and bowls at the tips of my fingers.  Their spicy tuna burrito and shrimp tempura burrito was absolutely incredible...lastly, the Mochi ice cream pop was the perfect end to the meal. Great spot!"}
{"text":"I went to the new location because I am such a fab of the brand.  Although I can in a few minutes prior to closing, they treated me as if I were family.  I never felt rushed and the food tasted as fresh as usual.  The flaming tuna is and will forever be the best dish to satisfy my sushi burrito cravingS the place puts all the others to shame.  Thank god you guys came to Summerlin."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Creative and tasty. Used to be my favorite place, but now that they've opened the other location and hired new staff, you have to wait a decent amount of time to eat. If you have time, the food is well worth waiting for, just be prepared to be there for a while even if you're the only client there."}
{"text":"I've been to half a dozen poke bowl/sushi burrito places in town and NONE of them have come close to the quality of fish that this place has. It tastes like actual fresh sushi. The staff was helpful and the restaurant is modern and clean. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"One of our favorite poke places in town.  Ingredients seem fresh and are good quality.   Ordered sliced avocado on mine once and it was very unripe though, but was the only time I was unhappy about something. Close to my house and the place always seems very clean.  Had a rude employee just once.  All the other times they have been friendly.  They seem a little frazzled when it gets busy though. Will go back."}
{"text":"My sushi burrito was awesome and customer service was fantastic! The staff was very friendly and welcoming! The hawaiian girl that works here is super awesome! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Never been to a sushi burrito place before and this was my first experience... customer service was awful, the two workers, a female and a male were so unhelpful and looked very annoyed at the questions we were asking. They did not explain the menu nor how it worked or the options we had even after asking us if we had ever been to a place like this before. Food was good but I won't be back until they hire people who actually look like they somewhat enjoy their job. Those were the most two miserable and unhelpful workers I've seen in quite a while."}
{"text":"Stopped in to this new business to try their menu.  I was impressed with the quality, cleanliness and friendly staff.  It's a comfortable place and have a good vibe.  The Flaming Tuna Burrito was stuffed with crab and tuna, a little rice, jalapeños, sweet seaweed salad and unagi sauce.  It's about the size of 2 hand rolls or 2 large 4 piece rolls for under $10.  Reasonably prices, great tasting options and a nice atmosphere will keep this place in my goto list.  Try them out and if you can't pick something,  go with the Flaming Tuna!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is subpar. My bowl was made sitting in front of me at the register and I waited 5 minutes to be checked out while two girls chatted up behind the counter. I didn't get checked out until one of the girls told the other I was ready to check out. Would've been nice to tell her that BEFORE you started having your conversation."}
{"text":"If you change your music selection, I'll came back and change the 4 star, to a 5!

Also, for $10 more, you can get, AYCE at Sushi Mon. 

Hint.....drop the price a little."}
{"text":"Great place for a midweek meal. I had The Omega poke bowl and my friend had the flaming tuna roll. The ingredients were fresh, and it was an nice combination of flavors."}
{"text":"Super cool place and the food is delicious! Menu is great and has a blend of \"signature\" options and create your own combos-- burritos, bowls, and salads. Plus, they have fresh and light sides and deserts (miso soup, mochi balls, etc.) and acai bowls. Super trendy and cute. I work nearby and expect to be here probably weekly for lunch."}
{"text":"My review is on the Vegan sushi burrito I ordered, vegan life. I have to be honest, I wanted to love it because of how close to my house this place is but unfortunately the sushi burrito place I went to yesterday was waaaay better. I was so impressed with my vegan sushi burrito at Ted's Sushi Burrito on S. Rainbow cause of the texture of the Panko tofu & the flavorful toppings that today's sushi burrito at Tail & Fin Burrito didn't satisfy. It made me crave another sushi burrito but didn't feel like driving far so I was driving past this place after we left my son's school & figured I'd give Tail & Fin Sushi Burritos & Poke bowls a try.

I didn't like the texture of my burrito. It seemed kind of soggy. The rice or something gave it a weird texture. I didn't enjoy the taste of the tempeh. Maybe it was the combination of everything in the roll. I'll have to try another sushi burrito again with a different variation. 

The employees were really nice & friendly & it looked pretty busy in there."}
{"text":"My first time here and I was greeted kindly and the service from Cheyanne & Irving. They were quick and helpful with my questions and me and my friends will be coming here more often!!! Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"The staff is great. Very patient. The food is amazing. Generous portions, and awesome sauces to put in your sushi burrito! It was our first time there, but definitely not our last! We LOVED it!"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to try this while we were in vegas. The food was very good and reasonably priced,they give you add-ons to choose from free of charge..it's a small location, but it wasn't crowded when we went. I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I came to this location to try it out, I love soho sushi burritos so much that most sushi burrito places disappoint me. This was surprisingly good. The recipes were unique and adds a new pop of flavor into sushi burritos. It's a pretty good mix of American,Mexican, and Japanese. The service was great and everyone was nice."}
{"text":"Well, my first time here and I was comparing to Poke Addiction. Here they charge extra for masago, mango, pineapple and avocado. At Poke Addiction all of these are included. So, I made a choice to keep going there. However, now that I had my poke bowl, I must say that it was very delicious. I'll be back.


I downgraded my review for customer service. Since, the first time that I was here, I come here a lot. This is my favorite poke place. All true, they charge extra for some toppings. Well, no biggie, I don't order extra. Five stars for food!!! It's amazing! Two stars for customer service. Most people who work here are super cool, except one. Every time when I see her, she looks as if she is doing you a favor for serving you. She always has a very upset face and lazy demeanor. Why bother coming to work, if it makes you so unhappy? It's important that the food we eat is not only nutritious but also filled with love. If this woman changed her attitude or a place of employment, Tail and Fin is a five star establishment!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So glad you moved in the neighborhood. Their burritos are jam packed with yumminess. My fav is the Stupid Good Tuna."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made sure to pay Tail and Fin a visit during our trip to Vegas because we saw their promotional video on Facebook and our mouths watered instantly. Well, I'm happy to report that they do indeed live up to the hype.

You can go to a food festival and easily pay $8 for ONE sushi taco because it's such a \"cute\" gimmick. At Tail and Fin, we ordered TWO sushi tacos for only $5. You pick the protein and sauce. Sure, they're a bit small -- the size of your fist. Sure, the tacos fall apart half-way through. But, for the price, it was deliciously worthwhile... Four, wonderful bites of bliss.

Their menu is quite creative otherwise. You can opt for a DIY sushi burrito (seaweed or soy wrap), salad bowl (mixed greens or romaine lettuce), or poke bowl (sushi rice or brown rice) for about $10. 

Choose from one of these proteins: Yellowtail, Tuna, Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tempura, Salmon, Imitation Crab, Tempeh, Soft Shell Crab, or Grilled Chicken. Extra scoop of protein is an additional $2.

You can then add veggies/toppings, such as edamame, cucumber, green onion, carrot, tomato, cilantro, etc. Unfortunately, \"special\" toppings like avocado, mango, masago (smelt egg), coconut and pomegranate are about $1.50 extra.

Finish off with some sauces -- such as ponzu sauce, teriyaki sauce, yuzo miso sauce, wasabi aioli or chili garlic aioli.

...OOF. In short, a much more diverse menu than I've seen at other comparable places.

If you'd prefer one of their Signature Creations -- there's a dozen of them to choose from. I opted for The OG for ~$13. 

The OG: Comes with ahi tuna, salmon, yellowtail, green onion, romaine lettuce (asked for the lettuce to be excluded), cucumber, and poke sauce. YUM YUM YUM. No need to personalize when you find an option that already includes all of your favorites!

Ample parking in a large lot."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it's so good. I ordered the shrimp tempest bowl and substituted the avocado for mango and added garlic chili aioli. My boyfriend ordered the stupid good tuna burrito and he loved it. 

When we walked in the staff welcomed us and went over the menu with us. The food is super fresh and the service is great. Give this place a try if you're looking for something fresh and good."}
{"text":"Super yummy, their prices are a little high but their service and food is great! I will keep coming back for the simple fact that ALL of the staff on duty went out of their way to help me calculate the carbohydrates of the sushi burrito I had built. AMAZING. I have type 1 diabetes and count my carbs so eating out can sometimes be a task, they were so amazing, nonjudgmental and helpful. I will continue to go back because of that service. Also their miso is very good, does not have tofu though."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place seeing the good reviews. I work at the plaza across the street and thought I'd finally have a good poke bowl place near. The service was pretty good, don't get me wrong, which is why I'm giving the star, but the food was ehh. Don't get me wrong, the staff were particularly attentive and I believe the owner was also there helping, which was awesome.

For the food, I thought it was a bit overpriced compared to other places. It might be because it's located in Summerlin, but it didn't seem like you get what you paid for. I don't know if it was this particular day, but the salmon and crab were very fishy tasting and smelling today. And it might just be me, but bits and pieces also tasted like straight up cardboard.

I've been a loyal Sweet Poke fan, so I'm probably used to them mixing the fish and sauce and having masago free, but I was so disappointed when I saw they put the fish on the bowl and then drizzle their sauce without mixing it. I think the fish would have had more flavor that way. Overall, I don't think I would come back. I'll stick to my Sweet Poke place even if is a longer drive. This place has potential though!"}
{"text":"I came here because one of those Facebook videos hyped it up. The two stars are ONLY for the food. My first time in Vegas/the first place we decided to eat after our long drive and both the girls serving were unwelcoming and not helpful. They both gave me different information (when I asked if I can do different protein for 1 order of two tacos the first girl said yes and the second girl said no). She had to throw out a whole scoop of spicy tuna because she assumed that's what I wanted on all of my tacos. I ended up with four tacos with 4 different proteins and the girl who took my order put my tacos in a bowl. Who puts tacos in a bowl?? When I took the tacos out of the bowl they were soggy because the bowl gathered the sauces into a puddle. Tasted as good as any other poke place and the concept of poke tacos seemed awesome, but this place didn't do it justice."}
{"text":"4 stars for presentation! Okay maybe not just presentation, but I would like to say that they do construct a beautiful looking poke bowl. 

I got the Pineapple Express. I wanted something different and I thought the pineapple would add a nice contrast to the bowl. Now, I didn't love the bowl but I won't blame them for that, it was probably because I didn't love the pineapple so that's my fault for the choice.

When my friends and I came they ran out of salmon. Unfortunately my friend ordered a sushi burrito with tuna and salmon. They added some extra tuna and then more salmon came out! The guy was nice enough to also add salmon because my friend really wanted it.

The service was friendly and very patient. It took us awhile to order but we didn't feel rushed by them. I'll definitely be back to try something else!"}
{"text":"I like the convenience of this place. They have a limited selection of things to choose from although, they had things to make it a burrito. I was disappointed the food lacked flavor. I found myself dumping soy sauce on my burrito after I had them put Unagi sauce on it. In fact the only thing that had flavor was the ginger. I ordered a miso soup all it contained was green onions and broth. I found it very expensive."}
{"text":"Had one of the best experiences of my sushi burrito life!! Chris helped us out with our burritos and was one of the best examples of great customer service I have ever had. He was nice, informative and rolls a bomb burrito. Please request Chris if you go!! 
Besides the great customer service, the burrito was delicious. I had the spicy tuna burrito, because everything is better when it's got a little kick in it. My gf got shrimp tempura which had a nice crunch. We added some avocado to both of ours which added a creamy texture. I highly recommend asking Chris what to add in because he really knows every great combination. We also got some strawberry and mango mochi which was like an volcano explosion of flavor with a cool finish. 
I will definitely come back!! Nothing better than great customer service and excellent food."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best sushi burrito places in town. We got the S.S. Coconuts poke bowl and the Shrimp Tempest sushi burrito. Everything looked great and tasted even better!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome in person but treats any kind of to-go order as a second class citizen. Seen it in person and had it happen to me a few times. I don't know why I try and keep ordering to go from there.

Good food, but bad if mobile ordered."}
{"text":"Sweet Poke is WAY better. Better quality, better portions, better customer service and a better price. I felt awkward ordering my food because no one knew where the soy papers were, let alone how to open the package. I'm not one to write yelp reviews, but this needed it. Sorry, maybe they'll get better"}
{"text":"Since my son wanted sushi burrito so we gave this place a try and he loved it!  He ordered The OG and he says it was delicious!  Friendly services, but it kinda pricey."}
{"text":"My favorite poke place!! They have high quality meats and fast service. It also has a very open seating area both inside and outside so it's nice to dine in."}
{"text":"Tried this place again after giving it a bad review its opening week. Not much has changed. Service was EXTREMELY slow on my 30 min lunch break... I was only behind one mother and daughter and It took almost 20 minutes just to get up to the window. Bowl was not full and fish still didn't taste fresh. This place still needs work. With all of the poke places that have opened recently, I say try one of those places instead!"}
{"text":"I've been to a handful of Poke places in the Las Vegas Area.... and I've got to hand it to Tail and Fin. They are, hands down the best in town.  I am always looking for good poke restaurants, but so far, I can honestly say that the grass (or should I say fish) is not greener (or fresher) anywhere else.  

Since discovering this gem with my brother about a month ago, I've been back at least 3-4 times a week. Not only is the food incredible, but the employees Cristina and Irving both are super friendly, accommodating and helpful. Portions are nice, prices are great for the quality and quantity of the food you get. If you like Poke bowls, give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the only place I've ever tried a poke bowl, but I don't feel the need to go anywhere else.  Kinda pricey for a bowl of food, but it's so good every time!  I have been wanting to try the burritos but I know how good the poke bowls are so I haven't tried yet.  The staff is always friendky and fast.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I'm perplexed at the \"cooking\" style of this place. They use cold rice in their bowls and burritos (white rice in a container at room temp, brown rice in the fridge). Yet I see over 200 review with average rating of 4 stars. Could it be that people actually prefer cold rice? Every other poke bowl place I've been to serves rice hot from the rice cooker. I highly doubt cold rice is how it's done in Hawaii. Looks like a couple months ago quality was on par but recently, management has been slacking and food quality is gone. Chef Karu - do you know that cold rice is being served in your restaurant???"}
{"text":"I am seriously the BIGGEST fan of this place. NO kidding.... I could eat lunch and dinner here through out the week if I could. AND they have a member program that you can rack up points on and get a free bowl!!"}
{"text":"Doesn't really knock your socks off but there really is no competition for Tail and Fin in Summerlin.  In order to really enjoy these pokebowl fad/places, I have to customize my order.

Tail and Fin has everything that I need and a delicious yuzu sauce.  I'll agree that some of the employees here have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to sushi and all they do is scoop and pour but at least some of them work quick.  

The one quirk I have is no matter how long the line is, or if they're super busy, they coach the cashier to still upsell items or sign up for crap.  Come on."}
{"text":"Went here for the famous sushi tacos and was not disappointed. They had a pretty good selection of protein and other toppings and a whole fuckload of sauces. Service was very friendly and the tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"They've been open a little over a week and I've already been here three times. At first I was skeptical but everything about this place is exactly what you want to find at a sushi restaurant. The fish and all ingredients are super fresh and you can see them. Everything is super clean which I also was happy to see. I always make a build your own and am very pleased with it. This may replace my favorite sushi place due to its low cost and the easy ordering and quick service."}
{"text":"Amazing food for at a ridiculously affordable price!  The ambiance is clean and sleek fast casual.  Get the stupid good tuna burrito with soy paper!  Go check this place out, asap!"}
{"text":"A new type of fast food in the center....finally something more interesting in Summerlin town center. I got the \"Lean and Green\" burrito. I was happy and surprise to get a Soy wrap. Full of Vegi cut in house and the rice was Sushi quality, little sweet for my personal taste, kind of fall a part when I was eaten but the burrito was good. They make a mistake with my wrap first but the Manager correct it right away and offered me for Free the burrito who was a wrong order. The entire thing was handled in a professional way. I also sign for an electronic reward.
Good experience overall,  I will be back."}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly service. Defiantly satisfied my craving! This is defiantly our new sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Single greatest sushi burrito ever!
The food was amazing and we will come here a lot more after this amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Ok guys, sure it's gonna be a bit hectic on a new place, the opening does have its bumps,...  but the food is great!!!  Please, please keep on rolling. We needed this place in summerlin for a long time.  Outstanding sushi rice and strong flavors.  This has great potential, will be back soon."}
{"text":"It seems that several \"sashimi\" meets \"a rice bowl\" meets a \"burrito wrap\" establishments have popped up in Las Vegas in the last year.  I love the concept!  I eat a lot of raw fishes and I love the ease of a burrito style food item, so a place like Tail & Fin checks many of my food like boxes right out of the gate.  

Tail & Fin is quite good.  The quality of the tuna and salmon is not great, but that is just me and my horrifically high standards of being a pescatarian and exposed to exceptional sashimi grade fish from all over the planet.  But short my disclaimer about quality, which I think I would probably say the same about any other similar sushi burriot place I might walk in, unless NOBU is opening a sushi burrito place in Vegas that I am unaware of, I really liked Tail & Fin and would absolutely return.    

The staff assembled my burrito with almost the precision of a surgeon.  Loads of colorful, protein packed goodness made it virtually impossible to consume it with my hands and required a fork.  I felt it was a good quantity of stuff inside and the taste was delicious.  I cannot remember the name, but I have the Omega one with all the fishes and then actually added another.  

Staff seemed glad I was there and were quick to answer the inquisitive questions of new patrons walking through the front door."}
{"text":"Nice place I like it 
Good stuff 
Good food 
Very recommended!
Very clean 
Great staff"}
{"text":"First time coming here I got the shrimp tempest in a pineapple bowl, the food is delicious and the staff is very friendly and a very simplistic design very laid back"}
{"text":"Ok ok I'll admit it... I'm impressed! Found this gem on yelp and am so happy about it! Opted for the OG bowl. So much flavor and such good portions! The staff is friendly and welcoming, I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"The OG was amazing.  Hands down this is the best Sushi Burrito place in town. Its better the SoHo and JaBurrito. It's was quality and fresh and the atmosphere was great.  I will be coming back and I will be a regular. Great Job TAIL&FIN? The Food is I highly recommend, if you haven't been your missing out. GO CHECK THEM OUT?"}
{"text":"Although they had a shaky start, this newest sushi burrito and poke spot in town won me over on the second visit.

Tail & Fin is the latest attempt to capitalize on the trend of poke bowls and sushi burritos. Given that it's headed by a former Nobu executive chef, I expected great things. The interior design looks the part - modern and clean, although the loud music tries a little too hard to be like the Bacchanal Buffet.

Like the other places, you can choose from a predesigned menu of dishes or build your own entree as you walk down the assembly line. Whichever the case may be, you'll be able to make the creation a sushi burrito (choice of seaweed or soy paper), poke bowl (sushi rice or brown rice), or salad (mixed greens or Romaine lettuce).

If building your own, you'll go down the line and pick your proteins (two for a regular portion, three for a large size, +$2 for additional) between ahi, spicy tuna, surimi, salmon, tempura shrimp, soft shell crab, yellowtail, grilled chicken, and tempeh. Then you get to add veggies and other toppings, including some premium options if you so desire (+$1.49). Finally, you can pick from a variety of nine sauces - more on these near the end of this review.

The first time I stopped by was in their first hour of their grand opening. I made some picks from the \"signature creations\" menu to see what was up.

Crabby Bastard sushi burrito ($11.95 for a large): soft shell crab, surimi, cucumber, tomato, furikake, pomegranate seeds, avocado, unagi sauce. It was a pretty good sushi burrito in all regards, but didn't distinguish itself in flavor or quality from other sushi burritos that I've had. No complaints about the pricing, which seems par for the course and provides a good lunch portion (let's be honest, you're not going to do AYCE lunch if it's to-go or your time is short).

The OG poke bowl ($9.95 for regular, confusing in that it says $12.95 on the menu): ahi, salmon, yellowtail, Romaine, green onion, poke sauce, cucumber. I actually skipped the Romaine this time since I figured that it wouldn't add much aside from texture. The poke sauce was awesome, and although the employee couldn't really explain the ingredients to me, it seems like sesame oil, teriyaki or some other sweet sauce, and wasabi. The fish were all tasty if not too high in quality (Soulfish had awesome cubes of ahi) and the green onion and cucumber were nice.

There was a significant issue with the sushi rice in my bowl though: most of my bites had hard grains of rice. My coworker noted the same in her order. A chef with the pedigree of Nobu should not be putting out something with flaws in a fundamental part of sushi.

Thinking that this was a fluke, I returned with friends to give them a second try. I built my own poke bowl this time. The sushi rice was better today, with no hard grains at all. The salmon and yellowtail were both good, but I still wish that they wouldn't cut up the fish so finely. I went with a majority of the toppings possible today, and the standouts were the seaweed salad, red and green onions, and furikake. These were fresh, alone with Romaine, cucumber, tomato, and cilantro. I disliked the tempura flakes because they seemed like more of a puffy cereal type of thing than what you'd find on the outside of tempura fried goodies.

As promised, a discussion of the sauces I know this goes against traditional sushi thinking, but we're talking about glorified handheld rolls anyway, so let's embrace sauces. They're the real star of Tail & Fin from what I've had. I'd already enjoyed the poke sauce, and I was able to try three more on the side today. The yuzu miso was the best, with a citrus kick that's hard to find elsewhere on the menu. The chili garlic aioli is pretty much their version of spicy mayo, and it fills the role capably. Last but not least, the honey sesame aioli is a sweet thick sauce that reminded me of what you'd get on my childhood favorite walnut shrimp dish.

That said, they've been a little stingy with the sauce in general. If you ask for multiple sauces on the side, they tend to fill the plastic sauce containers halfway at most. If they could get it to 2/3 at least and are cool with providing extra sauce for sushi burritos (my Shrimp Tempest today could've used more sauce), then I'll definitely have an enjoyable third visit and more.

Judging mainly from my meal today, Tail & Fin is a fairly successful foray into the poke bowl and sushi burrito space, with fresh toppings and excellent sauces carrying the load of a menu that's otherwise fairly indistinguishable from its competitors. I can't say yet whether it's worth driving across town without giving all of the other places a try, so stay tuned."}
{"text":"Delicious avocado boat! Their spicy mayo is delicious. Also, don't forget to try their mocha. 10/10. #ilikeitraw"}
{"text":"Ive tried a few different rolls and their always on point. They don't skimp on the fish either and it's always super fresh. If you order the yo Adrian be aware the jalepenos are spicy so if you want somewhat spicy tell them to put less on it. If you don't like spicy at all maybe sub cucumber instead. Only issue Ive had is placing an order through yelp24. I guess the staff didn't see it but they made my food right away so no big deal."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday and it was so. Good. You can do sushi burritos that just have traditional sushi ingredients, or you can get a little adventurous and throw Mexican ingredients in there too cilantro, onions, jalapeños etc). My burrito was $10. 

Pros 
-everything is super fresh
-big serving of meat (and you can combine 2 types)
- sauces are so good 
-really clean 
- wasabi is super strong
-$5 appetizers that could be their own meal (shrimp ceviche, avocado boats, sushi tacos)

Cons
-literally none"}
{"text":"Ahi tuna?! Twist my arm why dontcha! After randomly spotting Tail and Fin in my local shopping plaza, my boyfriend and I decided to try it because c'mon...sushi burrito. I've had many sushi burritos and poke bowls at many different locations and Tail and Fin did not disappoint. The cashier recommended the Stupid Good Tuna and I was on board with that - tuna is my most favorite (raw) fish. 

This sushi burrito consisted of ahi tuna, surimi crab (which is basically imitation crab), lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber, tempura flakes, yuzu miso sauce and unagi sauce. I also decided to wrap everything with seaweed however, you can also choose soy paper. Since there was no spice, I added sriracha and furikake to top it off. Let me tell you, the flavors were all there! You definitely need the unagi and yuzu miso sauce to tie everything together so make sure they don't skimp you on that. With that said, I could've done without the tomato and lettuce - it didn't really add much to the burrito for me and just took up space. The way the burrito is constructed made it very hard to eat because it was not completely wrapped, and the ingredients kept falling out but nonetheless the food was great. 

This location offers \"build-your-own\" sushi burrito and poke bowls so the options are endless! Keep that in mind if none of their signature creations sound appetizing."}
{"text":"It's my 1st time here. I tried the Krabby Bastard. It was refreshing. I'll try another kind of burrito next time though, or possibly create my own. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Best poke place ! Me and my sister always come here and everyone is really nice and doesn't mine giving us advice on what is good. The food is amazing and has so many flavors!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and decent pricing. $10 for regular size and $12 or the larger size. I took two stars off bc the place is incredibly slow making the food. Anytime I walk in and there's more than 1 other person in line I just walk out. I'd say it takes them 10 mins on average to complete an order even when I know exactly what I want."}
{"text":"Came here because of all the pictures. Service was so bad! :( and food wasn't even great. Fish tasted old pulse no sea weed for bowls. Definitely won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"Poke bowls are all the new hype. so many new poke restaurants are popping up it's hard to decide which one to go to. Tail and fin delivered with food quality, portions, and friendly customer service. the owners were at the restaurant personally ensuring a smooth opening, and took the time to talk with us and ensure we enjoyed our experience. I recommend their mochi pops for a fun sweet treat after enjoying your poke bowl."}
{"text":"Fresh find!! Love this place! Great people good food! 

I am a big sushi fan and this ranks very high in my opinion!! The fish is fresh, plenty of different options to choose from. This is the place to go when you are craving sushi or fresh lunch or dinner!!! Every time I'm visiting Vegas, this is where I will be!!"}
{"text":"This place is so addictive. I actually crave it about once every couple of weeks. The Shrimp Tempest is unbelievable but I have never had anything bad from there. Ask for extra sauce.."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, the staff and this little gem! It's very refreshing to walk in and have the manager welcome you like you are a  friend the food is delicious and everything is FRESH!!!"}
{"text":"A sushi burrito place on my side of town? oh yes! and they offer poke bowl options too? oh yes yes yes! but a second time back? no no no!

Sushi burrito to me is slowly losing it's excitement i mean I still think it's an uncut sushi roll and we've had jaburrito/soho around to establish their dominance as the sushi burrito spot, nonetheless sushi burritos are still tasty. 

Setting: Interesting how lots of sushi derivatives are forming around gyms (poke express/eos, tail&fin/24 hour). The restaurant size is normal, maybe a little bit bigger than the old soho location. Interior is clean with plenty of places to sit. 

First impressions: I noticed a lot of people who look like they worked at a night club, shaking hands with the owner, and taking selfies all over the restaurant. I asked the worker if she noticed the same thing and told me that the partner is an omnia promoter so go figure lol which coincide with a lot of positive reviews on this place but hey that's expected. 

Food: The burrito is small compared to the likes of it's predecessors. I got the crabby bastard which was nice but not mind blowing. The crispiness of the crab was good and the pomegranate seeds added a nice sweet accent. 

Overall: Convenience of course is great but I wouldn't mind driving a few extra miles for food that is more substantial and tasty. Nobu executive chef turned sushi burrito chef? hmm... doesn't make sense to me."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty. Their avocado boats are a great little snack if you're not that hungry but still want to try something. I love their spicy sauces too!"}
{"text":"Really 3.45 Stars.

The staff here is great.  Super nice, and friendly.

The quality of the ingredients is good-very good.

The downfall is twofold: sushi burrito compositions are unbalanced.  You'll get a bite of all fish, then a bite with all extras.  Kinda of a drag.

The other downfall, I'd like some more topping options.  That said, what is available is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered from Postmates from here. And now I can in. Clean and quiet. The server with the bright blue eyes was friendly and kind. The food was fresh. Be back soon."}
{"text":"Granted, I was full. But they give the least amount of food of any other sushi bowl place that I've been to. Good customer service, but didn't like not having leftovers. If I'm paying $10 like other places, I'm going to go where I get the most for my money."}
{"text":"I'm gonna have to drop a star because I came in to get my favorite thing, the OG bowl with half salad/half brown rice. I'm not sure what kind of dressing or sauce is on it this time or if they changed it but it is basically inedible. It tastes strongly of wasabi and I think I burned off all of my nose hairs in the first couple of bites. I'm a big fan of spicy and pour sriracha on everything but the horseradish fumes are too much to handle! I'm hoping this was just a mistake because I typically love it here!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and the food was great, the people who work there are super nice, will definitely go back!! The service is a little slow but I figure that's just because it's new. Overall really like this place!!"}
{"text":"Am not a fan of \"fusion\" food concepts.  If I crave Sushi, I want a restaurant that specializes in Sushi, likewise, Japanese, Poke, Seafood etc. 

On positive note, the ingredients were fresh,  diligently prepared and assembled, while you stand by and watch; cafeteria style. Ugh! 

Diners who want something light and healthy to eat will find this fare appealing.  Those wanting something more substantial should pass.  Probably good choice to place in same strip mall as a 24 Hour Fitness Center. 

Partner ordered the (unique) Crabbie Bastard Burrito and liked it.  I had opposite opinion of Chicken in a Bowl (blah).  Although, sauces were quite flavorful.

I had difficult time understanding Menu Board's main menu options and add-ons. Suggest improvements.  Also, found \"stripped down\" appearance of Tail & Fin a bit to spartan for my liking.

Will, however, try again when in mood for something healthy, and this time try the \"burrito options.\""}
{"text":"Everyone was really friendly! The menu was also really easy to navigate especially when you walk in for the first time. The good was great and everything tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"This place was really good a year ago when I first tried it. I really loved their sushi burritos and their portion sizes.
Now however, the portions are small, it's not filling.
Their rice machine that dispenses the rice onto the seaweed paper was broke and I don't blame them for that but the worker put the rice manually on the seaweed paper and began smashing the rice down. This causes the rice to become mushy and quite disgusting. Would not go again until something changes."}
{"text":"My friends raved about tail & fin. Rarely do I give 5 stars but this place went above and beyond my expectations. Food was expertly crafted. I have never had such a tasty bowl and my friend loved her sushi burrito. l look forward to many more tail & fin visits!"}
{"text":"Was hoping to get some food at 9:10, but they were unfortunately closed even though the hours say open until 10. Kind of a bummer when you have your heart set on poke!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner. I had the angry birds burrito and it was amazing. My wife had the \"yo Adrian\" with tempura shrimp. I highly recommend both. So good!!! I highly recommend this establishment! Great food, great staff."}
{"text":"I chose to make my own burrito. It was amazing. I couldn't of asked for anything more. Great service. Chris made me a great burrito. Especially since I don't eat anything raw and I like the soy paper. The shrimp tempura was great."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at a sushi burrito cafe & my BFF chose the right place! Vincent was great in explaining to us how to order & also put our poke bowl & sushi burrito together beautifully! Not only was our food put together perfectly, but it was as we say in Hawaii, Ono-licious! If you're looking for a great poke meal, I highly recommend Tail & Fin! Aloooohhhaa!"}
{"text":"Brand new sushi spot in Las Vegas and it is a must try. Not the typical sit down restaurant, more like fast food style, but definitely has places to sit. I had the build your own burrito and was very happy with my choice. I was impressed with the amount of protien given vs the price point. The fish was high quality and tasty for sure. Staff was very friendly and inviting from start to finish. I will be coming back when I want to grab a sushi burrito on the go!"}
{"text":"So good ! Tried the angry bird if you aren't a fish person which is made with chicken and also builded my own with spicy tuna and yellow tail."}
{"text":"Easily the absolute BEST poke I have ever eaten and I'm from California where poke joints have exploded. I had a build your own sushi burrito and it was absolute heaven.  Here's what makes them amazing: THEY HAVE SOFTSHELL CRAB which you can put into your sushi burrito.  It is a transformative experience.  Their variety of sauces is also fantastic.  Here's my creation: Salmon, Softshell Crab, seaweed salad, cucumber, green onion, furikake, pineapple, avocado, tempura flakes, chili garlic aioli, and poke sauce.  I'm telling you, they wrapped it so tightly that all the flavors melded together.  I am willing to drive all the way from California just so I can experience this place again. Prices were great, too and it's located on the 15 South so if you're headed back to Cali after a crazy Vegas Weekend, it's a great stop for lunch.  Trust me, it will change your life."}
{"text":"So hubby and I actually tried this place only a few hours after our first sushiburrito experience. So we couldn't help but compare. This place came in second due to to two things for me:

1. The burritos created were just a little less exciting and delicious in comparison. For example, the only non-fish options were chicken or veggies. No beef? No egg? Sad face. 

2. No side dishes I could get excited about. I'm just not interested in wasabi peas. 

However, sushiburritos are always awesome and this is a fine place to come. Especially considering that the service was super friendly and accomadating."}
{"text":"Generous portions but the crab was really strong smelling. Girls were fairly polite. They have quite a few topping choices. I do wish they had crispy wontons and spicy mayo though. Maybe it was just an off day for the crab, we will give them another shot."}
{"text":"The poke bowls were underwhelming and uninspired. And for the first time, the bowls looked so empty. The small portions were just so very disappointing. Very friendly staff, but it's just unfortunate that their bowls lack the great flavors that Pokeman near Chinatown has."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to spot for poke. The place is clean, customer service is proper, and the OG is the one to beat"}
{"text":"Even though this place has been open for three months now it still has that newly renovated smell. I feel like they should buy some air purifiers or do something to dissipate the smell. I couldn't enjoy my burrito because the smell of paint was so overpowering. I also feel like they put the sauce on the rice and not on the fish so the rice was really salty. The fish tasted very fresh though I give them that, but eating huge chunks of raw fish without enough soy sauce is quite sickening. Service was also really slow even though we were the only customers there and it took them a while to make our two burritos. These places are designed to move like assembly lines and they have more than enough people behind the counter so I don't understand the wait. When I got my burrito the outside of the inner wrapper was all sticky and the burrito was falling apart resulting in the need to use fork. I've never had anything like this happen at Soho before. Soho is way more efficient and has better wrapping skills and better ratio of ingredients overall."}
{"text":"Service was perfect! Food was awesome! Fish was cold and the rice was great! Tried sweet poke and not only were we treated horribly but the fish was room temperature and the seaweed tasted old . Tail and fun was excellent and a great place to get your sushi craving without over indulging in ayce . The two people working today were both young , male and female and I believe they both wore glasses. Very polite and extremely friendly. Can't wait to frequent this spot more often !!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I got the mini me Flaming Tuna and seaweed salad side. Both were soooo good. And reasonably priced. It tasted very fresh! Having a sushi place in the Village is definitely an awesome addition. I plan to methodically sample each and everything on the menu. The crabby bastard is next. Making me drool just thinking about it! Keep up the great work Tail and Fin!"}
{"text":"There are so many poke restaurants in town that it is hard to differentiate what makes them better. Truly the food was not bad but i was not impressed either. Average flavors, average price and average atmosphere. Like some of the other reviews mentioned, the service is fine, but the employees do not add anything to the experience they are there to serve and thats about it. 

This establishment is good for a quick and somewhat healthy meal. For your order you have the option to have your meal as a burrito, a bowl or a salad.
I ordered the omega salad which came with fresh salmon and crab. I was a bit disappointed that the lettuce did not seem very fresh. Also the dressing was not enough for the entire dish. Overall, a decent place for poke bowls."}
{"text":"First time at a sushi burrito place. The staff was friendly and the place was clean. There was also a steady line which is always a good sign. I tried the stoopid good tuna, I wasn't sure what to expect since I hadn't eat sushi burritos, it was good but definitely more burrito than sushi. I will be back to try their other ones though. You can also build your own. The prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for quite some time to give this place a try...definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I came across a video on Facebook about this place, so I was like \" why not try it while I'm still in Vegas.\" I was really excited about the pineapple boat. I don't anything that's raw but today was the day I faced one of my fears haha. I rate this place 3.5 out of 5 because this was different for me. But to all the sushi/poke lovers out there I do recommend y'all trying this place out."}
{"text":"Hands down best spot in Vegas to grab sushi bowls or burritos.. I've been to a few others that just don't quite have it down. Right when I walked in the door before even trying their food, I was turned on by the great vibe and music that was going on. There were people working on their laptops, just enjoying the environment. The staff was amazing!!! The food, fresh fish and a great menu. It's not just your basic stuff, which they have too. But, they also have unordinary choices they brought to the table. Try the Crabby bastard. Soft Shell Crab and Pomegranates. Unbelievable!!! I will definitely be going back as often as possible. Thank you Tail and Fin"}
{"text":"Yuck. Uh uh I was not feeling this place at all! The minced fish they threw in this bowl tasted like straight up expletives! Do people like this mess?? 

With love, 

EatWithReese"}
{"text":"I ordered from this establishment through eat 24. I was initially impressed when I received a phone call from one of the employees stating that one of the items was unavailable and they suggested an alternative. I proceeded to pay online and had a verified pickup time of 5:20pm. As I arrived at the scheduled pick up time of 5:20pm, the food was not ready nor were they even busy to not have my order ready. The whole point was to pick and go, because I had a scheduled appointment. They proceeded to make my burrito, which they got wrong. They forgot about what we had spoken about earlier. So I waited 15 additional minutes for them to fix the order. In addition to this, the food is mediocre at best. I had the O.G which had day old rice and no seasoning. The burrito was dry and flavorless. My wife got the shrimp tempest, the shrimp was bland and just overall blah. There are plenty of other alternatives to this sushi burrito establishment. I suggest not to waste your time, money, or sushi burrito craving on this place."}
{"text":"First time having a sushi burrito... 1 word awesome. ... I  loved it , so much went back next day had a Crabby bastard the bomb! Awesome experience.  My new must stop when in Vegas!. They will be catering my next show when I'm in town.  Scotty Noyd Comedian"}
{"text":"2 people sitting in the lobby eating their lunch. 3 different people walking in and out of the back, but only 1 person serving food on the line and ringing up. Ok there were only 3 customers in line, but still. Sauce on top of the tempura crunch? Now it's not crunchy. Make sure if you want an avocado boat you tell them that first, cuz they are never prepared for it. They take a bowl from the end pass it to the front for the fish then back to the end for the sauce. Why is the OG $13? You can build your own with the same ingredients for $10. I love how everyone is always on their phone, that's probably sanitary. Especially with raw fish. You better study before you go. They really don't know anything about the ingredients just how many scoops to do (sometimes not even that). Hope you like giant thick raw jalapeños. They should cut the vegetables a little smaller. I'm really not into biting into a half red onion and half a jalapeño(exaggeration but it feels like that) not consistent. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it seems like a new born monkey is cutting vegetables. What's with the lame nightclub music in a poké bowl place?  Used to be a fan. But they have gone downhill."}
{"text":"Tail and fin was amazing! The sauces were on point!  Make sure you go check this new spot out."}
{"text":"Service is awesome. The manager was extremely nice. And the crabby bastard was one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the food. Tried both the regular and spicy tuna sushirito and it was a tasteless mess. My dinning companion did not even finish theirs. The fake crab was tasteless and overwhelming. Sorry I spent $25 with no drinks."}
{"text":"First time not bad.  The Bowl needed more lettuce since it's a recycle bowl & it's dept.  More balance w lettuce and protein/ options.  Everything was great! Felt the shrimp tempura should of been less tempura. You couldn't really taste the shrimp. I tried the build your own bowl and will try another tomorrow . I didn't want anything heavy for dinner."}
{"text":"Really, really wanted to like Tail and Fin. Waited months to try it and was finally in the area. Right off the bat, not impressed with the building whatsoever. Smelled a little funny the second we walked into the door, and the cutting mats on the counter didn't look clean. Wasn't impressed with the restaurant itself. I tried the sushi tacos, which I actually liked, my teenage daughter got the pineapple burrito and only took one bite. She loves sushi but didn't like the burrito."}
{"text":"I came in today at ~11 am to order some lunch.  I got the Crabby Bastard Bowl for myself, and the Shrimp Tempest for my wife.  And there were just problems with both of them.

For the Crabby Bastard, I wanted brown rice.  Which they were out of.  Yet again.  You advertise that you have both sushi and brown rice, yet every single time I go in there for brown rice you are out.  Why?  How can you be out of one of the foundation staples of your menu?

For the Shrimp Tempest, I ordered as a salad with mixed greens.  I added spicy tuna and jalapenos, and had them put the sauces on the side.  I thought they would be able to handle this, but when I got the item home, my wife noticed that they forgot to put the surimi crab on it.  IT'S PART OF THE NORMAL ITEM.  How do you forget how to make the Shrimp Tempest when you've got the menu right in front of you?

I think the biggest issue is that they don't write anything down.  I'm constantly having to repeat my order to whoever is behind the counter multiple times, in addition to reminding them to add this or remove that.  It's not that hard to write down what someone orders and then make it, is it?

All told, I doubt we'll go back.  The food is good when it's right, but it's almost never right.  Either hire people who know what they're doing or at least have them write stuff down so they don't screw it up."}
{"text":"Amaazzzziinngggggg poke spot! When I saw the pineapple bowl, my heart raced and ordered it immediately! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"There were 5 workers and three more in the back and I am standing there with two others not knowing what any of the items were no one was offering suggestions. One man just left and I asked a couple of questions but maybe some great customer service would have helped. The employees can offer suggestions and explain what the ingredients are for rookies. A hair net would be nice since you are watching them prepare the food up close. The food was good and I will try it again. Much luck."}
{"text":"great simple clean spot. 

soup could use some sea weed and tofu in the miso. 

staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Did a make your own bowl with romaine. It was excellent and service was great too. If you love delicious fresh seafood this is the place!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place because of it's  very convenient location. We are regulars at Soho Sushi and JaBurrito so we are not new to sushi burritos. They don't have as many options as the other places. The portions are very small too. I'm ordered a build your own salad bowl. Very small. Didn't satisfy me. My husband ordered two burritos and wasn't satisfied. The prices were also a little higher than their competition.  They pass for good but portions were a huge disappointment.
Overall...we were disappointed. Didn't hate it, but didn't love it."}
{"text":"I'd been seeing the delicious food porn pictures via Instagram & when I saw a video of their food on Facebook...I had to go check it out myself! My boyfriend & I went in. We got 2 poke bowls, 4 sushi tacos & an avocado bowl. Everything tasted even more amazing than we expected! 

The fish here tastes so incredibly fresh. The rice is perfect. They have a variety of toppings but not an overwhelming amount, like some poke places. Their salmon was so fresh & cut well that I wish they were open 24/7 because I would go back for more. 

What I loved about this restaurant was not only the food but the atmosphere & customer service. Jared was absolutely wonderful. He was friendly, helpful & let us know about their rewards program. There were 2 other boys working & everyone was a pleasure. A family came in after us & the employees knew them immediately. You could tell they were regular customers & this is a place that deserves a regular following. 

The decor at Tail & Fin was welcoming & super cute. I love the inviting atmosphere & the warmth of the staff. We will be back & probably quite often. Tail & Fin is easily now the best poke place in town!!"}
{"text":"I love poke. I wanted to like this place because it's in my neighborhood. Ordered poke bowl with fresh salmon on two separate occasions. First time I was a little queasy but I went back a second time. Had the poke bowl with salmon a second time. Became very ill. Sorry I won't be back."}
{"text":"Clean, open, well-lit environment.  This place is like one of the open spaces home makeover looks, they do on all the TV shows. 

Staff is friendly, and helpful. 

I liked that they marked our burritos \"Mom & Daughter\" especially since it was a Mom&Daughter date for us. 

The quality of the ingredients is good, and there are lots of choices. I like that the large has so many scoops as compared to other places with just 3 proteins."}
{"text":"Place is awesome, they asked if we were new and we are and walked us through the menu and prep. Team was friendly and smiling. The place is a winner. Burritos are amazing. 

Sophia is so friendly and gives good suggestions. Keeps a very positive conversation. The guy ( tall with beard ) was not friendly. I placed a tip in jar twice and he saw me and never said thank you. When I was paying I said thank you and he said \"yup\". Rude. 
One bad apple can spoil the bunch. 

We will continue to come on a weekly basis due to team members like Sophia.  


Thanks

{"text":"We love this location and have given great reviews before. 
Tonight we had a young Caucasian with no glasses tall and earrings. He gave the most mediocre service I have ever had here. We love dining here due to the great Food and awesome service!  He wouldn't talk to us and when he wasn't helping a guest barley he was leaning against the counter while the smaller team member was cleaning and working. I only send this because we want this location to do well because we really like it. I think the boring lazy teammate could be good with a small amount of effort. Thanks for all the great sushi burritos!!!! And Good luck."}
{"text":"I love that so many poké spots are popping up! But sometimes it's just not quite right.

The atmosphere when walking in is pleasant. Everything looked clean. Simple menu board uptop when you walk in. We were greeted pretty promptly As we walked in. 

My bf and I both ordered poké bowls off the menu, we didn't add anything extra, since it was our first time we just wanted to try the food as is.

He got Stupid Good Tuna: ahi, crab, lettuce & fried flakes.
He didn't really end up liking it, the fish didn't really have any flavor, even after topping the bowl with unagi sauce. He got sushi rice with his bowl and felt like there should have been more for a \"bowl.\"

I got, Flaming Tuna: spicy tuna, crab, seaweed salas & jalapeños.
I enjoyed the spiciness element to it. I really love almost anything spiced. The salad was good, couldn't taste much of the crab and the tuna wasn't that spicy or really couldn't taste much as I ate the bowl. They serve sushi rice with the bowl which I'm not a fan of at all. 

The rice have too much vinegar and over powers the rest of the flavors in your bowl. Opt for brown rice or any other option if they have it!!!! 

You get a miso soup with your bowl; I didn't like it. It was flavorless & had no tofu bits. It was just pasty water."}
{"text":"Best sushi burrito I've had anywhere 
I had build your own with crab, tuna & spicy tuna and for a slight extra cost you can have mango chunks added!
So fresh and so delicious! This place is perfect before the movies, after a basketball game, after a workout at the gym! 
The mango mochi topped off our meal!
What a great find!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Tried the burrito today and was overwhelmed.  They got so much stuff in it!  It was huge and tasted great.  I'm now so full I am not sure I can fit my Green Tea Mochi pop. But i'm going to give it a shot. I will definitely be back.  You can't beat the prices here. No idea how they do it."}
{"text":"WOW. A coworker told me to try this place out. I have been intending to eat better lunches for a while.  But never did I expect that I could get something like this for less than a burger!  I had 4 tacos ( I know, but they were too good to only have two ) and tried to mix it up as much as I could.  Even with a double order and water I came out less than a burger value meal, and I don't feel guilty about getting a fast lunch. This will defiantly be a regular spot for me now. And maybe I will drop some of that weight."}
{"text":"The restaurant was extremely clean, the staff was fun & accommodating. Our bowls were delicious & freshly made to order."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, and the restaurant has a nice aesthetic! Would recommend to all poke lovers! Jared and Irving were very helpful and made sure I got the best the some of the best poke I've ever tried!!"}
{"text":"My first time trying a sushi burrito and the staff was very helpful. I chose the dang tasty tuna(?) I believe that was what it was called. The flavors that came together in the sushi burrito were stupid good and I loved the tang of the red onion. My only complaint is I felt the portion was rather small and I am still hungry. I guess that's why they offer the larger portion but I didn't want to spend 13$ on a burrito. Although it was small it was phenomenal and I devoured that baby. The staff was what made the experience top notch however. The girls were very friendly and talkative and even let me use a phone charger so that my phone wouldn't die and leave me stranded. They are the reason this was a 5 star review because without them I would've gone 4 stars cause of the portion size. All in all I am a happy customer and will be returning but this time for a large."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after the first couple of visits (especially since it is so close for me), but after multiple tries, I have constantly been disappointed by the lack of quality that they provide. I usually like to pair my poke with brown rice but it is always served cold and hard so I tried switching to white rice, which wasn't much better. The fish itself is alright, I have had better elsewhere, and they also charge extra for many of the other toppings. Lastly, I prefer when poke places mix the sauce with the protein so that everything is incorporated, as opposed to putting a relatively light drizzle on top of everything, which compromises the overall flavor of the bowl (of course, the burrito is a different story). There are definitely improvements that need to be made before I try going here again!"}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi fan but there are cooked items available so I tried it out.  I ordered a Crabby Bastard (posted a picture).  It was good.  The presentation is pleasant.  The crab didn't have much flavor; I expected better.  The staff were friendly and the dining area clean.  The menu selection is vast for someone who loves sushi.  It's okay.  I would go there with a coupon (if available) in order to try more menu items, but only the cooked items!"}
{"text":"Such unique choices and i love that I can have a fresh healthy meal leaving 24 hour.  The omega bowl was really satisfying.. wash it down with some non sweetened green tea and call it a day!  Can't wait to try the pineapple bowl that everyone has been raving about"}
{"text":"This was my favorite poke stop... til today.  They changed product vendors and all fish and etceteras, even edamame, arrive frozen. Yuck!!!  You've ruined your restaurant!"}
{"text":"#ILikeItRaw

Stopped in after viewing a few blogger photos via social media of a pineapple party in my mouth.

I ordered The Signature Creation \"Flaming Tuna\" in the pineapple bowl $9.95+ ($2 EXTRA for the pineapple-free pineapple) 

I opted for no rice and I probably shouldn't have because I'm still hungry although the cashier said it would fill me up W/O ordering the tacos. 

The bowl was good, the place is very clean and the ambiance is relaxing. 

I doubt I'd return unless I'm in the area.  Creating your own bowl is the best option to satisfy your hunger. #LessonLearnedTheHardWay"}
{"text":"Ok honestly I was skeptical about this whole sushi burrito and poke trend in Vegas until I tried Tail & Fin!! Where others fell short on fish quality and flavor they were by far the best!! The girl making my bowl told me that the menu was created by a Nobu chef and it for sure shows!! What can I say I'm officially obsessed! My girls and I are going to make this an after gym routine for sure! Secret tip my you can order your poke bowl inside a pineapple!!! Mind blown!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and I will be back for sure! There a few different sushi burrito places popping up in Vegas that I've been to but this place by far takes the crown. The place was busy and the customer service was great"}
{"text":"It's such a quaint little place and it's so relaxing! The staff was very kind when I ordered and the sushi burrito I ordered was delicious. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came on Monday night at around 630 pm, figured me & my family try it on since it's 4stars on yelp. They're were only 2 customers ahead of us but it took so long for 2 workers tending to their customers. 20 minutes past & I waited patiently until the customer ahead of me placed her order for the mini tacos. The worker then placed the nori & rice thru the machine which flatten it...THEN, she literally took a large cup placed it over the rice & started cutting 4 rounds circle to shape it into a taco..oh heck, sorry to say this place is so unorganized coz u had both workers going from the back & front, raw fish on sitting on top of the counter which I didn't see it sitting on top of any ice cooler..no thanks, walked out & drove to Paina Cafe to get a real poke bowl!!"}
{"text":"First time 5 stars everything perfect.This time barely any sauce dry...seems they need consistency train everyone to do it the same way or ask the customers how much sauce, I wasn't paying attention and got it to go..."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! 

I came to this place because I saw the video on buzzfeed. I ordered tacos and I try to think what topping should I put in. I saw the person who served me got irritated because I make the other customer wait for me. HEY THIS IS POKE PLACE YOU SHOULD LET CUSTOMER WAIT AND DECIDE WHICH TOPPING THEY WANT TO PUT IN. Of couse as a customer I felt very uncomfortable. They only gave you one  topping and there are more charged topping than the free topping. I understand if you charged the avocados because thats what they do in LA but everything else such as the lettuce, masago and pineapple are charged. Also the pricing is the same as LA's poke. 

I am really pissed. I m not recommending this place!"}
{"text":"I will never come back here again. I walked in and told them I've never been here I usually go to SOHO and the lady condescendingly says \"well, welcome to the tail & fin side\" and not in the voice that sounds welcoming at all. As they're helping the gentlemen and his daughter in front of me she repeatedly said \"just one?\" I don't know if he already ate or if that's just what he could afford but repeatedly saying so just one, was rude. When I got to the end I made it a combo and she didn't have any trays so she tells someone she needs trays. out came a girl holding her cellphone in one hand and dripping wet trays in another. Cell phones are dirty your trays are supposedly clean and to take the 2 minute initiative to dry them wouldn't have killed her. Just kill time off her cellphone.  When I asked what desserts are Available she said mochi pops. I said oh okay then she started to explain what it was which I knew what it was she said \"it's basically that on a stick.\" Not professional at all.


The menu is very limited and the girl didn't know the difference between masago and tamago. They should hire people who have actually had poke and sushi knowledge and pride in what they're selling.

It gets better! As I'm refilling my coke since it was the only good thing about the place the manager asked how everything was I said nicely can I be honest? Told him everything I wrote in this review. I told him I feel like most businesses they open and operate super strong with their staff on point and then staff gets complacent and just stops caring. This place didn't feel new the staff felt already like they didn't care. He literally tells me \"well that's your opinion everyone has their own opinion.\""}
{"text":"Three words; Stupid Good Tuna! And that is exactly what you will find on the menu here, everything is \"stupid good.\" I must admit I was skeptical at first (I'm not a huge fan of seaweed paper), but Tail & Fin has many options and I am now a soy paper lover for life! Bowls, burritos, and salads...affordable and fresh! I love the fact that they have salads so I can eat lighter when needed. Next time I will either build my own sushi burrito or bowl, options are endless! I can most definitely say #ilikeitraw =P"}
{"text":"I just came to Vegas from LA to visit my sister. Felt like sushi. Found this place yesterday. Had to come back again today becuase the food was the bomb! Customer service is also excellent. Bomb food and awesome service. What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nommity Nom! You give me all the burritos NOW!!!! And load on that sauce, because that ish is legit! Big ol' burritos with quality af ingredients. No mushy bs here or skimpy pickled jalapenos (gross). Nahhhh. Get out. This is fresh to death! I decided to make my own combination because i'm picky - and it came out perfect. San Diego hasn't perfected the sushi burrito game yet, so whenever I come to Vegas I NEED this in my life."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi burrito place. Sometimes the workers are a little overwhelmed because it gets busy, and it takes time to make the food. But I am sure with time that will be fine. Quality is great."}
{"text":"Loved it all! Please try this place. Its a fresh & unique approach to raw fish. Employees were all super friendly & helpful. Crabby Bastard burrito with a couple modifications for my taste made it perfectly delicious!"}
{"text":"I inadvertently came here on opening night for a private event. The owners were super cool about it and let me stay to try out the food. I must say it is some of the freshest tuna and seafood I have had here in Vegas and definitely rivals jaburrito. 

I have been looking for a sushi burrito spot near my neighborhood and I will definitely be back I am hooked! I also love that they make it as a bowl or a salad option! What a healthy spot for lunch!! 

Looking forward to returning and bringing some friends to try it out!!"}
{"text":"Learned this place from Insider. I went an hour before closing time so they already ran out of salmon. They have grilled chicken as part of their meats. Spicy tuna was so fresh. The pineapple bowl was so cute and ate it as a dessert. Finished my bowl in less than 10 minutes. I would surely drop by again when I hit Las Vegas. Servers were so nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I love this place. The ingredients are always fresh and tasty. Shrimp Tempest is my favorite with the spicy garlic aioli sauce - yummy!"}
{"text":"Really fresh ingredients, generous portions for the price and the people were very friendly. I just moved here and was anxious to try this place tucked away in a little Summerlin shopping center. I was not disappointed! Admittedly I did go Albertsons in the same shopping center to pick up their mango salsa in the produce department (which is amazing) to add to my dish."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! I just recently tried their avocado boat with the ahi tuna and wow is it delicious! Most wraps or bowls are between 8 and 12 bucks. Nothing too over the top. Service in this place is always great. The staff is always willing to help explain sauces and combinations. Each employee has a favorite that they recommend. Place is always really clean and their really isn't much of a wait time either, but then again I usually go later in the evening. Overall great place and amazing food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The food is fresh,  employee's are kind,  and everything taste amazing. Simple ordering platform. I got the crabby bastard as a roll,  and looming forward to having it in a pineapple next time! I have tried other franchises and their burritos fall apart and have too much sauce.  Love that this place is right around the corner from my house."}
{"text":"Another just OK sushi burrito / poke place. My first visit would have earned a 4 stars, but the flaws that I thought would pass were still present at my last visit. I cannot look past the ridiculous amount of time it takes to make a sushi burrito. It was forgivable the first time because they just opened, but now it is not. Please get another staff member to help with workflow. 

Items tried:
Shrimp tempest (shrimp tempura/surimi crab) burrito
Stupid good tuna (ahi tuna/surimi crab) burrito
The Omega (salmon/surimi crab) bowl

The shrimp tempest is one of the better cooked sushi burritos I've had. Overall, it's not big on flavor, which is not a bad thing for this burrito. I feel like it needed more than just unagi sauce though. I did like the sushi rice, which was done well.

I did not enjoy the stupid good tuna. The mushy ahi was flavorless. It was hard to get one bite with all components of the burrito. The way my burrito was made, I had to endure many bites of plain mushy ahi. Instead, the veggies had all the sauce. 

The Omega was tasty! I really liked the ponzu and the salmon was fresh. Having it as a bowl allowed me to make sure all the flavors get mixed together. 

A word of advice: I've seen other poke places mix the raw fish in a bowl of sauce or seasoning before adding it to the burrito. 

With so much competition out there now, it's hard to say that I'll be back until I try other places to see how they compare.

{"text":"I hate poke bowls if they are NOT made in Hawaii.  There I said it.

Rant:  Poke is the dish.  It is more than just raw fish.  Don't be throwing raw salmon and tuna in a bowl, squirting aioli and eel sauce on it , tossing fresh cucumbers and heaven forbid, avocados on it and call it poke grrrr.

That said, I'm totally digging these sushi burritos and what's served at Tail and Fin is a step above.  

The chef is from Nobu Vegas and the cut above flavors in the sauces, rice, and genius combination of ingredients shows it.  Yes, it's more expensive but definitely worth it (if you're into this \"stuff\").

Example of the creativity?  The \"Crabby Bastard\"; deep fried soft shell crab, imitation crab (stop calling it surimi another grrrrr), cucumber, tomato, avocado, kabayaki sauce and pomegranate that adds a burst of freshness and texture that cuts through the oily, richness.  The \"Shrimp Tempest\"; two large shrimp tempura, imitation crab, lettuce, green onion, avocado, kabayaki sauce and yamagobo whose earthy, vinegary taste adds complexity and clears any oily finish.

Brave enough to make your own combo roll?  Well chosen, un-daunting list of ingredients and sauces that all work together.  You don't need to worry about making a disaster.

Rolls are 90% filling, 10% rice so the flavors stand out.

Not into pressed rice and laver?  If you must get a \"poke\" bowl.

Friendly off Strip service.  You won't feel rushed if you stumble over your order as a first timer.

Simple and solid."}
{"text":"This is my second visit... and my last. I had gone before and my experience was so-so... so since I was out for lunch and had to stop at the post office... I figured why not? I also did a quick yelp search and saw they had a Vegan Life sushi burrito with Tempeh... sounded AMAZING.

I go in to order (no one is there) and the girl asks me what I'm getting. \"Just the Vegan Life please\" which is clearly prominent in the menu right above. After confirming I want the Vegan Life as a burrito... she asks the other girl on duty \"what is tee-peh?\". That's when they tell me they no longer have tempeh anymore. Hmm. Odd since it's still on the menu. Well, I'm hungry... and have to head back to work so she suggests the Garden Life. Fine. 

She dumps a whole scoop of jalapeños on my burrito after I request them. Thank goodness I love spicy. I don't think that's for everyone though.

As we head to towards the end, she goes to grab my avocado... it was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen. She was literally peeling the SKIN off the avocado. I've always used a spoon to scoop... but here she was picking the SKIN off bit by bit. Fine. Avocado is avocado. 

I get to the end and request Poke sauce. She dumps all Yuzu on it. Oops. \"Do you want me to remake it?\" No. By this point I'm just so over it and have to head back. She gives me some Poke sauce on the side and I am just so not impressed. The whole experience has been POO.

I get back to my desk and bite into my burrito. Guess what I find? Avocado skin... AND the top of the avocado! I'm soooo done. Never again. I actually couldn't even finish my sushi burrito since it was so horrendous and I am just so disappointed."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Tail and Fin since it is so close to our home and I have been back at least 15 times since their opening.  I originally made weekly visits to Poke Express on Eastern to satisfy my poke cravings since I was quite disappointed by Tail and Fin's neighboring predecessor Soulfish Poke.  I think this place really hit the nail on the head when it comes to these non traditional poke bowl restaurants. The servings are exceptionally generous which is my problem with Soulfish Poke.  Love the fresh ingredients and most importantly the quality of the fish.  The staff is always so friendly, greets you immediately upon arrival and always efficient!  Excited that they have expanded with a second location, as that indicates they are doing well.  Great food and service, I also love that they allow Postmates to deliver for a low fee."}
{"text":"It saddens me because the assistant manager seems so down to earth and really tries her best to make up for the lack of fucking attention span, enunciation, and care these workers have here. I've read the reviews regarding the customer service and how slow they were before coming here, but I wanted to give them a chance. The extra charge for the crab is ridiculous.   I think that's a \"sushi base\" and should be offered as a topping free of charge. The fish quality seems a lot better than our other sushi burrito neighbor, Yoshi Burrito, but omg the people who work here are so fucking incompetent. The chick has no personality and I don't understand how she has a job. She had the bitchiest way of asking if we we're sharing a burrito...um no, my boyfriend likes it when I help pick out the things that go in his burrito, because he's gotten into the sushi game really late and doesn't know much. She also can't hear the things we say but SHE'S the one with the softest voice with the \"I don't want to work here\" look on her face. They  are so slow to work. Had it not been for the assistant manager talking to us, it definitely would have felt like eternity. The guy literally massage the fuck out of the spicy tuna onto our burrito...um should we have paid extra for that?? He also just stood there.... We were really confused. Fire everyone or put the fear of God into these children who don't know how to handle work. They don't deserve the money if they can't put in the Hussle. Fuck."}
{"text":"I loved it soo much! It tasted soo good! Place was clean, & they greet you right when you open the door!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas over the weekend and always wanted to try a sushiritto so gave this place a try. Interior was really clean and bright. I liked that it was new. I got the shrimp tempura roll and the regular size was enough for me. What I enjoyed the most was the sauces. I thought the chili garlic aioli was good with the eel sauce. Clean set up and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Super delicious - coming from the beach the quality of sashimi is great. Very helpful staff - definitely frequent this spot."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I ordered the sushi burrito because, well, I just love the idea. But be warned it is MESSY!

I enjoy coming here and making my own poke bowl from time to time. The last time I stopped by was in the evening and the brown rice they gave me was incredibly dry and disappointing. I actually ended up eating around it...but other experiences have been positive so far. I'm a big fan of spicy salmon and tuna, and mix the poke and ponzu sauce"}
{"text":"I love this place but tonight we found long hairS in the bowl. So disgusting. I don't understand why they do not wear hair net when they serve food."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food. I had the Shrimp Tempest bowl and it was amazing. All the ingredients tasted fresh and the service was great. They asked if it was my first time and explained how all the menu items worked. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Let's talk top notch customer service: if you've read my reviews before I definitely enjoy calling out some good ole service! Can I also add cute, trendy and quality of food is amazing. I loved the SS Coconut bowl added a couple of things and OMG. every time I've walked in I've tried something new and have not been disappointed. I failed at gathering the managers name but needless to say you'll figure it out when she greets you at the door. Definitely becoming a regular to this location, size of the bowl and portions are larger than other places, I haven't quite mastered eating the entire bowl, I've also had the avocado bowl (a must for avocado lovers) you will definitely enjoy! Gotta try the Mochi in green tea my fave!"}
{"text":"Wow Sophia was so amazing and very helpful it was my second time here and she definitely made it up for the first time I came in, which wasn't a good experience. I got the crabby bastard and added a few things to it and she was patient with me and took her time not trying to rush me which was nice. Will come back more thank to her!"}
{"text":"The Staff is extremely friendly and fun. I got the Stupid Good Tuna and it was amazing. Soooo Good. Nothing like Sushi in a Burrito #ILikeItRaw"}
{"text":"Two stars. Good atmosphere. Workers were friendly. However I do wonder about prices. 

I got me THE OG, a combo of my fav sushi which is ahi, yellowtail, and salmon, which runs about $12.95. A drink added to it brought the total to $15. 

Good! However, I wasn't impressed. Left still hungry. To be honest, another $5 more and you could go across the street and get all you can eat and leave absolutely full."}
{"text":"My first time eating a sushi burrito and it was so delicious!!! All their fish and ingredients are really fresh. All their sauces are amazing too. My new favorite place to eat hands down.

Update--- I've gone to a few other sushi burrito places around town and Tail & Fin is by far the best."}
{"text":"I was surprised how fresh my salmon wasI JUST LOVED IT.  The avocado boat was so good and the taco everything was good including the service"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to this spot and had the same impression. There are alot of people working but the service is SLOW. There has to be a better expediting process. The girl in front of me was ordering a few items and the guy at that station was still checking the recipe card on the wall. The other worker was at the rice station (behind) just watching the other guy struggle to multitask. There was a girl at the sauce station and a cashier. Seems like they could organize it better so it's not just one person working while all the other stations just watch. I know this place is new but recipes should be memorized and made with confidence.  The first time I came in I  had the same experience. The staff seems nervous and unsure;lacking in efficiency for sure.

I got  the  best tuna burrito (forgot exactly whT it's called) it was just ok. The first time I came in I got the omega, which I liked much better. The food is ok and the service is slow."}
{"text":"Came to Tail & Fin with my husband. I ordered the Build-Your-Own tuna burrito and my husband ordered the Build-Your-Own salmon bowl. I noticed that one of the workers with my order as well as others in front of us were handling the foods without any gloves. She was touching the fish, rice and vegetables with her bare hands, touching other squeeze bottles then wiped her hands onto her apron! I mentioned to the girl per SNHD, all ready-to-eat foods had to be handled with gloves. When another worker heard that, she confirmed I was right and remade my burrito. She had to squeeze out a lot of the water that was in the tuna and salmon container which made my burrito a bit soggy. Flavor was decent, but not rolled correctly so it fell apart with the first bite :/"}
{"text":"I have been craving a sushi burrito from here for a while! I went around 3:45pm and they weren't busy at all! I was helped immediately. Everything looked fresh and clean. I took my order to go and when I got home, I was surprised that my sushi burrito was nicely made! It didn't fall apart on the way home!  I decided to build my own burrito, I had gotten the 4 scoop which I'm guessing is a medium? Not sure. But, I got the surimi crab and shrimp tempura with some cucumber, lettuce, unagi sauce and some garlic aioli! It didn't seem like much but it tasted amazing! My favorite sauce has got to be their garlic aioli. I also got a drink so everything came out to be $12 and they have a loyalty program that you can earn points towards some money off your order!"}
{"text":"I knew I was in for a disappointment when the server pulled out a container of brown rice from the fridge. If you know anything about cooked rice, it's that rice will be come dry and hardened if it's refrigerated. How can you be serving refrigerated rice in a poke bowl? It was very unfortunate that I had to eat this food."}
{"text":"So this business took the place of a Dairy Queen, which made me a little sad because you can't really beat having an ice cream place in this shopping center. I figured I'd give this place a try because it looked cute and I've been seeing videos of the sushi burrito all over social media. I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. The menu is pretty big, but the 3 main things here are 1) sushi burrito 2) poké bowl 3) salad and then you choose the fish, rice, and toppings. I got the ahi tuna poké bowl with white rice and all of the toppings which included onions, jalapeños, cilantro, avocado, and a few other items I can't remember. I also got tajin on it, which gave it really good flavor. The sauce they recommended was the spicy ponzu sauce which was perfect for what I got. I took the meal to go, but the inside of the restaurant is actually really cute and trendy. When I got home I tried the bowl and it was so delicious!! The rest of my family got the sushi burrito which I'll have to eventually try. This place also has vegan options which is really awesome!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff but portions are small compared to other places especially the scoops of protein, I think I got 4 cubes of tuna only per scoop."}
{"text":"Before I came in, I yelped the reviews and wanted to try it myself. They didn't provide a menu online that I could skim through. So I came in for a quick lunch. The menu wasn't very big but they have a decent variety. I ordered the Shrimp Tempest and added tuna ($2 extra) the burrito was a good size, the length was as big as my forearm. They're pretty generous with their portions. Upgraded for a combo which came with my choice of miso soup and a fountain drink. Total for lunch cost $16 

The taste was good but not great. I've had other sushi burritos that were delicious. This was pretty basic. The flavor didn't hit me like WOW like I expected. It was mediocre. Which I felt a little bummed about.

I like that the restaurant is clean and has fresh ingredients. The staff was friendly but they didn't pack me a spoon to go or napkins in my bag. Good thing I ate there, I had to help myself. Although it's a new establishment, I feel this business can thrive over time and experience. I will be coming back to try other items they have to offer."}
{"text":"Disappointing! I wouldn't call this measly meal a burrito by any means. I've had bigger hand rolls. The portions are so tiny - the \"burrito\" barely had anything in it! If you want to add avocado, it's $2 for a quarter of a whole! And they have the nerve to be so expensive? No thanks. The staff were unprepared and slow. Not to mention, the cashier dropped the tablet on my friends hand as she was paying. Hot mess!"}
{"text":"Great little spot off strip close to south point. But worth the drive! Not your typical poke/sushirrito place the chefs creations really put a spin on things.

The crabbie bastard is what I had, delicious ! Oven roasted soft shell crab with a heaping load of the crab meat salad (not heavy of the mayo which was great ) with a nice salad melody of pomegranate, romaine lettuce avocado topped with furikake and Eel sauce that wasn't too heavy. Overall would come back again.

10 for a reg
12 for a large"}
{"text":"The food here is fabulous, fresh, delish! There  was a girl behind the counter  taking your order, she could have been a little kinder. So this is a new place, customers don't know the step by step process of how it works and what goes with what. Perhaps they could take some time to educate their customers. All in all very good place to eat."}
{"text":"The key is fresh fish and Tail&Fin delivers just that and more. I built my own bowl with ahi tuna and spicy tuna. All the ingredients in my poke bowl were very fresh and tasty. The decor of the shop is simple and quite pleasing. Staff was also very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"love concept.  food quality seriously a problem with no monitoring. took poor care of sushi and mixed old with new, which isn't very hygienic and can cause serious food poisoning. chicken made a family member extremely ill and it wasn't cooked properly. needs to be a manager to help oversee food quality. hope it gets better."}
{"text":"I came to check out the new location of Tail and Fin. They added a bunch of new items onto their already amazing selection. 

I got the Pineapple Express but as sushi burrito! They never disappoint! The right amount of rice to filling ratio is on point! I will definitely be making a the trip from the Southwestern part of Vegas to the West for more yummy food!

Oh! And they also added sushi tacos and acai bowls!! WHAAAATTTT?!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service. Great quality. I love the selection of sauces and they do not skimp on anything. Really nice, will be back :)"}
{"text":"Omg this place was awesome! The fish was fresh and they give you great sized portions. The fruit is extra which isn't bad, but they charge $1.49 for a small scoop of fruit which seems a bit extreme. I really liked the food besides that, their Unagi sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"So the whole concept to me is weird. I like sushi and I like Mexican but together, no. At least that's what I though. So it actually has nothing to do with Mexican food at all. It is just high quality sushi. It is not your typical sushi bar but rather a nice little place to grab a quick delicious bite to eat. We were kinda skeptical so we ordered a regular build our own roll and for the kids a teriyaki bowl. We got a roll with soft shell crab and shrimp. Absolutely fantastic. The kids bowl was chicken teriyaki wth sushi rice. Theirs was also amazing. Bottom line is definitely worth a try. Ingredients are super fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Sooo good!!! I had the OG burrito and it was delicious. I'm excited to try everything else on their menu. I especially like that they don't fill the burrito with a ton of rice like other places I've been to. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Stuff wasn't friendly, super slow and the guy in training didn't know anything
I like that they're generous with the amount of fish on the same time I tasted  better quality before and I think that 4 scoops is in the boritto is too much 
Big like for fresh mango/ pineapple 
My borrito didn't taste too good over all and for some reason was very salty too"}
{"text":"I had a Yo Adrian poke bowl and it was really good. I enjoyed the salmon chunks and avocado mixed with the jalapeño. Those were probably my favorites. The rest was good and it was very filling which is always nice! 

The only thing I was put off by was the portion put into the pineapple bowl. My S.O ordered the crabby bastard in a pineapple bowl and it looked beautiful but the portion was smaller, you can't really eat the pineapple because it's difficult. The pineapple they take out is no given to you or anything either. You pay the $2 more which isn't a lot but it doesn't provide much aside from a gimmick. The rice tasted a little like pineapple but I rather have the pieces of pineapple or something. It's just a hollowed out pineapple and some light flavor on the rice that touched it. 

Overall I enjoyed it and I would recommend it but I would recommend not ordering the pineapple bowl and just getting a regular bowl or a burrito (burritos looked good too)."}
{"text":"My family and I went to tail and fin last night. The food was so fresh and the Service even better, Sophia and her partner made us feel at home and will bring us back with there smiles. Great work ,it is nice to see team members that value customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"First time eve entering a poke bowl place and have to say I love that they have vegan options! They were clean, food tasted good. Although definitely think it's a few bucks overpriced as I can pay the 7$ for the same bowl basically. Also, the staff members were extremely rude to one another which was sad to watch"}
{"text":"We went just for the sushi burritos and left a little disappointed. I thought the \"burritos\" would be more burrito sized but they use standard sized sushi nori. We could have made these burritos at home for much less $$$. For 2 burritos and 1 drink we spent $30. To add 1/4 of an avocado to your meal is $1.49. You could buy 3 avocados for that price at the supermarket. They keep all condiments behind the counter, which is ridiculous. I was afraid to ask for any because the answer to everything seemed to be, \"It's addition, is that okay?\" 

The food was fresh for the most part and delicious, but placement was poor and the whole thing falls apart in your hands. 

Not impressed. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yet another poke/sushi burrito place in Vegas~ I built my own bowl for $10 and had the choice of picking 3 types of meat. I chose salmon, ahi tuna, and shrimp tempura. I wouldn't recommend the shrimp though since they only gave me one! I could've gotten way more poke instead. Then you have your choice of veggie toppings and sauce. I tried the yuzu miso sauce which went pretty well with the poke! 

The hype for poke and sushi burritos has definitely died down for me with the over-saturation of the market here in Vegas after the great success of SoHo so to me, Tail and Fin was just an average experience that didn't thrill me but wasn't horrible either. Also, I wish the seating was more comfortable!"}
{"text":"When this location first opened, the food was delicious. The quality was amazing and the flavors were great. I used to come here for lunch every other Friday and was so excited to have this across the street. 

6 months to a year later and I will never go back. 

The fish quality sucks, it all has a fishy taste. 

There's a \"fruity pebble\" bowl they they NEVER have ingredients for and either have to go buy it while we wait or they tell me they don't have it. 

They also have a \"pineapple bowl\" that is supposed to be just like the other bowl. My coworker ordered it and the pineapple wasn't even cut out or cut up on the onside. Isn't is supposed to be a bowl? So we just have to cut it up with all the fish and toppings on it and try and put it together our selves? Seems like someone didn't put any thought into it or the staff just doesn't want to do it. 

Honesty it comes down to the fish quality though. It's just sad and pathetic looking, it looks soggy from being frozen and sitting in water. It's just gross. 

Service is decent, the employees are nice enough but it doesn't make up for the poor quality."}
{"text":"Today was my first time to ever try a sushi burrito and I am a HUGE fan! Not only was the food delicious but the staff was super nice and answered all the questions I had about menu items. I got the Pineapple Express burrito. It totally hit the spot! Everything looked and tasted super fresh. The place was practically spotless. 
Today was my first time but it most definitely will not be my last!"}
{"text":"Best poke this place is soooooo cold make sure you bring a sweater but super clean and great for summer that's for sure..."}
{"text":"I was so happy to hear that a poke place finally opened up in this area so I don't have to drive as far whenever I'm craving a sushi burrito.

The atmosphere is pleasant. As you walk in, everyone immediately greets you and everything looked clean. The menu board is pretty straight forward and easy to understand. I went with the OG and didn't add anything extra. 

I looked away for a few moments and saw that my burrito was drenched in sauce. Oh well.
While unwrapping the burrito, I noticed that it wasn't tightly packed. The seaweed didn't overlap and there was a big gap with fish and rice falling out. The sauce was a bit overwhelming and overpowered everything else. It even leaked into the wrapping paper making everything sticky and a big hassle to eat. Everything was also soggy so there wasn't much texture to anything.

The customer service here is great, however the food - not so much. The prices are also a bit high compared to others."}
{"text":"The flaming tuna is a game changer, it's seriously so good! I usually get it in a bowl and the portions are really filling. I make it a combo and get wasabi peas with my order. It's a much quicker and easier way to get sushi. The fish quality is better than the all you can eat fish you get at most sushi restaurants. I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"Exactly what you hope for. Excellent quality ingredients lots of excellent options very good knowledge from the staff and great pricing. I'll be back tomorrow this is my new favorite post workout meal"}
{"text":"The pineapple poke bowls were great! Love the idea! The girls that worked there were friendly and upbeat. They were excited that we ordered what we did as they don't get to make them very often. The space was roomy and clean. Enjoyed watching ESPN while enjoying a late lunch."}
{"text":"I guess I should've done my research before walking in to this place. If you love poke - this place is for you. I have never been so I wasn't sure what to expect. After looking at all the options (and the price to be honest) I decided to go safe: child's chicken teriyaki bowl. $7 which includes a drink! As much as they piled on those poke bowls, I think I was safe and expected something descent from a $7 bowl. I got probably half a boneless breast fillet which was overcooked and tough. They use the same size bowl as the poke bowl so my chicken bowl looked sad as it looked like it was missing something. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"As a poke fanatic I have looked all over town to find somewhere fresh and reasonably priced. This place has it all! Great employees, a large selection, and very friendly employees! I've become a regular!"}
{"text":"Instagram keeps showing me delicious poke served inside a scooped pineapple half (bowl.)  Well, wouldn't you know it, Tail and Fin opened up in the Summerlin community very close to where I live and I needed a poke fix.  
The place is very clean and bright inside.  Like many poke places,  Tail and Fin has the assembly line where you can custom make your bowl.   Additional toppings are a little pricey.  Food was fresh and the spicy ponzu sauce is on point.  Presentation is definitely Instagram worthy.  

I also had the avocado boat which is tuna poke inside of an avocado which was tasty."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick but delish Mother's Day meal.  Tail and Fin surpassed our expectations. Our sushi burritos where out of this world. Workers Cheyenne and Mike gave us the best customer service ever. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! I'm so happy it's I'm my neighborhood. I love living in The Trails Summerlin"}
{"text":"I got the poke bowl and was able to create my own bowl. I ordered the tuna, salmon, avocado and crabmeat with a drizzle of their sauce. It was delicious! If you want fresh sushi, tasty sauces, and a friendly staff, go to tail & fin. It's simple and very convenient. New go to spot!"}
{"text":"Nice store, good atmosphere and most importantly amazing food!  I had the shrimp tempest when I came and it was delicious!  If you like sushi, but don't want to be all dainty with chopsticks, this sushi burrito place is for you!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS AWESOME. Definitely going back soon and will be trying something new. I got the tempera temptest and it was very good and fresh. The service was quick and friendly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Such a cute little poke place out in summerlin! Everyone here was very friendly and helpful! The menu had some interesting combinations I haven't seen other places that I'll be back to try. For $2 you can opt to have your poke served in a pineapple bowl that a) looks amazing, and b) adds a little extra sweetness to the poke!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from Chris and I think his name was \"Keem\"...extremely knowledgeable and pleasant. The food was great but the service is what is getting me back in the door THANKS GUYS!!"}
{"text":"WOW!! I had the Stupid Good Tuna Buritto and it was just that, STUPID GOOD! This was my first time coming here and I was very impressed. I wanted to try something from the menu to get an idea of what they have to offer. Next time I will go back and get wild by making my own creation! Very happy with my choice

For the quality and serving size it was a great price. I even finished it off with a mochi pop! So bomb 

If they open more of these I can see myself eating here all the time. You could literally eat here everyday and not have the same thing twice !! 

I'm a Fin!! I mean a FAN"}
{"text":"Incredible Sushi Burritos !! Got the O.G. with 3 different types of fish with Sushi rice and Seaweed wrap. Delicious !"}
{"text":"Wow it was only my second poke bowl, but so delicious!!! I love that you can get it on a salad instead of rice. Also online ordering is very convenient for me--I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow this place has it all! Tip when ordering the sushi tacos make sure to ask for the scraps and have them make you a great sushi bowl with them! If not they just throw them away! Ask for the garlic chili Aoli sauce and top it off with some spicy salmon! Tail and fin is off the hook good!"}
{"text":"Shrimp tempest and flaming tuna, not bad for a sushi on the go type of thing. Feel like sushi but you need it fast and portable? Here it is!!! Solution!! Watch when they fill it my girl couldn't remember what went in it and started putting something in that didn't belong and another girl corrected her, they argued and then my girl reads the menu board and says oh. So if you're allergic to anything. They have different cutting boards for different things and my girl got corrected for putting it on the wrong board...ummm so like I was saying, if you have any allergies....watch closely. But portability mixed with taste--thumbs up! If you're thinking you're getting some good sushi...ummm no, you need to go to a sushi restaurante when you have time, buddy. This is great for on the go."}
{"text":"I've been to Tail and Fin 3 or 4 times now and it is one of my fav sushi burrito places around town!! The staff are always extremely friendly and understanding of my allergies (can't eat shellfish so they wash knives and cutting boards real quick). 

The restaurant itself is modern & trendy. It's very clean looking, which I've been to some that just don't feel that way. 

Anyway, I always build my own bowl (usually half salad, half rice) with ahi tuna and a variety of veggies. They do charge extra for avocado, mango, pineapple, etc. Sometimes I've found myself wishing they had more variety of veggie toppings, but I also don't know what else I'd want. I avoid the creamy dressings, so I can't speak to those, but the other dressings are pretty tasty! 

Overall, I love Tail and Fin! I'll definitely continue going back!"}
{"text":"My family and I went into this place. We were greeted by a very nice woman that explained the entire menu and waited till we decided what we wanted. My son ordered the chicken teriyaki for kids. I ordered after the him, the vegan wrap. The male told the lady they are out of the temeph. I informed her that I only eat plant based foods. Since they were out of the product I came there for, I informed the female that we are going somewhere else. As we were leaving, he yells across the restaurant \"do you want the chicken teriyaki bowl? Well, if I said we were going else where and walking toward the door, I probably don't want the bowl."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying three stars does not mean bad it just means average. And this place gets more like a 3.7, it's good there's just nothing that really separates it from the other sushi burrito places that have opened before it. It appears to be the exact same replica, with a little less in terms of roll selection and the prices are about the same. It's clean, the fish quality is good but one issue with the place is the small servings of protein you get with a bowl. With one bowl I had two tiny scoops of protein and maybe half to ¾ cup of rice for about $11. The quality is good to justify it, but if you're really hungry you could probably eat three bowls and at that point you may as well just go to sushi mon for that price. All in all, if you live on that side of town it is a great addition to that side instead of having to drive all the way out to the other sushi burrito spots. It will just need to step it up a little if it's to compete with the quality of those that are already established."}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced and quality is just ok. And why are their bowls $5 more than other sushi burrito places for the same amount of meat. I spent almost $14 for   just 6 mini scoops of spicy tuna and rice. The same Bowl cost me $9 at a majority of other places.  You're better off, spending the extra $10 and going across the street for all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place, so i wasnt too sure about what To order. Travis, the young man behind the counter gave me some awesome recommendations. Everything he suggested was amazing!  The fish was super fresh and everything was delicious!  It's got a nice clean atmosphere. I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Small shop that can be easy to miss but so worth going out of the way for! Had to go twice on our trip because it was THAT good.

Food was fresh, delicious, and they offered the option of going with traditional choices as well as the possibilities of new options you may want to try. I got a \"build your own\" sushi burrito and my husband got the stupid good tuna one day and the crabby bastard the other. 

Seriously so good and when you're from Hawaii, you're picky about things like poke! Great customer service + cute shop + delicious food = YASSS."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi burrito I have had. I tried The Crabby Bastard, a flavorful combination of soft shell crab, cucumber and just the right amount of crunch and sweetness with the addition of pomegranate. The quality of ingredients was great! I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Love the pineapple bowl and at the golden knights game its great having an option for food that isn't burgers and licorice. For a subway sushi place it is really fresh and the staff is awesome. 
Only negative is this location has a drainage issue that smells.. Hope they fix it I'll change to 5 stars"}
{"text":"Size wise, they beat out Jaburritos. But ...Jaburritos beats them in flavor and efficiency. I was 2nd in line and it felt like forever getting through it. The burrito was GOOD but there was def more potential for flavor. It also fell apart as it wasn't rolled right (had to grab a fork. Which defeated the purpose of the burrito), and the seaweed was hard to chew through. But it was filling and yummy none the less! And their avocado was perfectly ripe. In the words of DJ Khalid \"major key!!!\""}
{"text":"First this is not the type of place I would choose to go but I let my Grilfriend pick after picking he up. She picked sushi so I said let's try this new place. More truth is this is far from the food I like to eat. Walking in it was clean and had an industrial look. We were greeted as soon as we walked in.   

Salads, Rice Bowls ok I get that, I don't like that kind of food. So I ordered a Sushi Burrito sat down and thought her we go. Shock is best word I have after the first bite, so took another one, it tasted fantastic. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Staff super friendly and very knowledgeable... I had the Shrimp Tempest and Quincy and Jared we're so helpful and patient with us since it was our first time. I will definitely be coming back to this place! They made me want to come back over and over again! They are the definition of customer service!"}
{"text":"The perfect place,  excellent help,  nice layout,  great menu, and everything tasted wonderful. Next time I'll ask for more flavor sauce!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this place! I had ordered off of Postmates, which is a fantastic delivery service. Anyways, I decided to make my own sushi burrito.

I got the sushi burrito with Japanese sushi rice, ahi tuna, spicy tuna and salmon with cucumbers, seaweed salad and furikake. The sauces were the wasabi one and the poke sauce, both very good! 

I wish the sushi burrito was bigger, it falls apart easily as well, but it's still good. 

I also had ordered the junior meal, the chicken teriyaki with the Japanese sushi rice. It was alright...the sushi rice doesn't mix well with it though. 

Overall it's good, I will try it again though!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't to bad, I guess I had higher standards then what I got though. I came earlier in the day the other day since I work just right down the road and it was pretty busy. The young man with glasses I thought was very rude. A man in front of me was asking questions and he was giving him attitude and talking to him like he was stupid so I tired to avoid him. I didn't want to deal with him that morning. Then the other young lady with long brown hair was very good with customers, didn't have attitude or sassy or anything till there weren't any customers in line. I was sitting at my table eating and I kept over hearing her complaining she wanted to leave. That she \"had something to do.\" As someone that works everyday hours I don't like and would rather be getting home to my kids sooner I get that she wanted to leave but I stay cause I need to. If you had something to do schedule it after work or on a day off. I don't know maybe it's just me but I didn't like the vibes of the place because of them and I'd rather not come back or be around that energy on my break."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean environment, simple setup, fresh ingredients (rice, fish, veggies, and sauce), and delicious food overall! This place is a 20 minute drive from my house, but I would definitely go of my way to come here again. By far the best sushi burrito/bowl place I have been to in Vegas. I ordered the OG bowl and added red onions and seaweed. It was delicious and everything I had hoped for."}
{"text":"So good!  I've been waiting to try this place and it didn't let me down.  I've never had mango with tuna before and it's crazy good."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I've tried other burrito places before and the rice was either off or the fish was so so. This one finally had everything right. Must try!"}
{"text":"Not a huge \"Yelper\" ... I read reviews of places I want to go but have NEVER written a review. Just not my thing ... But this place?!?!?! OH MY! I'm a HUGE sushi person - could eat it daily. But the AYCE places can get expensive. I've eaten here twice already in their first week of being open. Fantastic both times! I go for the \"Stupid Good Tuna\" but add avocado and substitute the Poke Sauce for the Yuzu Miso Sauce. Love it! I will gladly spend $12 for this burrito. Gives me my sushi fix at less than half the price of AYCE. Great value ... I struggle to finish the whole burrito. As it's the first week of being open, I expected the staff to be \"figuring things out.\" But I have to say - they've got it figured out. Stupid good ... Stupid fast ... Stupid friendly ... Stupid clean ... Stupid fresh. I'm sure I'll be there tomorrow."}
{"text":"Closed 12 minutes early or even earlier. I got there at that time because stupid Apple maps took me in the wrong direction a couple times. Sad I won't come back here. Not worth it. Closing so early. Screw this place. You guys looked good."}
{"text":"Not good at all.   Fish smelled and tasted old, burrito is about $10 and not worth the price.  
The poke is a bowl of rice with fish dumped on top.  
Zero care about preparation 

Looks like they are trying to cut costs already and they've just opened.  Really let down."}
{"text":"I got a poke bowl with spicy tuna, seaweed salad, green onions and avocado. This meal was so perfect! Really fresh and clean tasting, it's always nice when you are craving something and it turns out to be completely satisfying. The restaurant was clean, the staff very helpful and willing to explain everything. It was an all around great experience. I definitely have recommended it to others and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Came to try their notorious sushi Tacos. You buy 2 for $4.95ish that includes one protein, one side and one dressing. Anything more and it's extra. They were tasty but not filling. Better off getting the bowl or burrito for more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here on my work lunch. Pretty fast once you have an idea of what you want. Its just like a Chipotle style of ordering. The ingredients are always fresh and its good every time."}
{"text":"Came here to check out the Pineapple Express burrito. Inside the store was clean, friendly staff. Overall my experience was good. I have no complaints. Burrito with a regular soft drink around $ 13.00 with tax."}
{"text":"Soooo good !!!! Didn't know exactly what to add to my burrito and the employee making it definitely helped me out and it was soo tasty !! Def recommend this place if you love sushi . also our twins loved the mochi, so good!  

Instagram- @wykes_twins"}
{"text":"Always friendly, clean, and fast. My only real issue here is that they don't have cream cheese or spicy mayo as a sauce option. Their \"Mochi Pops\" are an extremely cute touch at making this specific location stand apart from others."}
{"text":"Everything was great! From friendly staff to excellent food, it's deserving of its five stars. I got the crabby bastard and I love how they put a generous serving of crab. I will definitely come back to try more of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I must say I can't eat raw all the time. But when I saw that a sushi burrito place was opened by my house I knew I had to try. I always look at the yelp pics to see what looked appealing. I saw mangoes. I love mangoes. So I picked the \"Yo Adrian\" burrito (I like spicey) and added a bunch of veggies and mangoes with extra sauce. Just like how I would make my subway sandwich. Lol. I was a bit afraid of how the sushi will taste. If it's fishy then you know it's not fresh. I took a few bites and there was no fishy smell. Thank goodness. It also makes sense why the place is so cold. They needed to keep the freshness of the raw fish.

 Wanna know if it is good as leftovers the next day? So I kept the other half of my burrito in the fridge. Left it for about a day/24 hrs. The next day I was starving and forgot I had left it in the fridge. I decided to take the challenge and took a bite. Wow. it tasted even better?? my fridge is turned on pretty cold which made the texture a bit firmer, not soggy. So it didn't feel like raw fish. So good!

Note: I am a big rice eater. Most places have dry rice and the people/places here in Vegas don't understand how to eat/make proper rice. It needs to be moist! Dry rice is the worse thing. And I love how this place knew how to make amazing rice. I just want to order it alone and eat it. 

Had this place 3 days in a row..."}
{"text":"MAN! What can I say tail and fin is good but \"Sophia\" make it so much better ! I absolutely love her costumer service! Like 10 out of 10 HANDS DOWN THE BEST! When I walk in she remembered my name and made sure I got everything I wanted on my bowl!"}
{"text":"I came here based on Yelp's recommendation and wasn't disappointed.  The staff was friendly and made suggestions when i asked. I got the Omega roll in seaweed and it was very good except for it falling apart but that seems to be the norm for sushi rolls. I will definitely go back and try a poke bowl next time!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open and when it did, it exceeded my expectations by far! First thing you'll notice is the modern decor that immediately connects you to the sophistication of the name itself... \"Tail & Fin\". They deliver quality ingredients followed by a more than awesome staff that provides utmost customer quality experience. You have the choice of carefully crafted items on the menu to creating your own bowl or roll. I highly recommend coming here if you're ever in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place major props on the item names-Stupid Good Tuna, Crabby Bastard, The OG.  I mean who wouldn't want to get items with funny names on it right? It was funny until I actually ordered...I got myself the Stupid Good Tuna in a sushi burrito roll. I got my little girl a kids chicken teriyaki bowl. Service was excellent and very helpful. **TIP- if you're new to the place, let them know and they will walk you through it and even recommend getting the already established choices.***  For the Stupid Good Tuna, i opted out the jalapenos and subbed it for the mango. SO GOOD!!! Why oh why must you be so far away?! Food was so fresh and tasty. Honestly, this place was better than SoHo Sushi Burrito. Even my kid liked their made to order teriyaki bowl. She is such a picky eater so when she was chomping down on her chicken I knew another star needed to be added. Prices aren't bad and I think next time I'll do the poke bowl instead and see how that tastes. I could only imagine just as good or better."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Filling without feeling bloated.  You can get a meal for the price of a roll elsewhere. Friendly folks. A. It slow making the meals when busy but I'll bet they will get faster at time. 
Get the combo and add soup, appetizer or a desert."}
{"text":"I saw the Tail & Fin Sushi Taco's on Yelp, then tried it the very next day on my lunch break. Coming from the strip, this was a bit of a drive to this location, not sure Summerlin would've been any closer but it was bomb. 

They had unfortunately run out of salmon, I'm guessing this place gets busy..figured it might be a good sign. I got the little left with a spicy tuna, and ahi tuna tacos with the chili garlic aioli, wasabi aioli sauces, I also got the Avocado Boat with yellowtail and the yuzu miso sauce. It was a good ripe avocado and has lettuce and spinach which were just the right amount like a mini salad bowl. The person who took my order was super friendly, and nice enough to offer to take my tray when I was done.

I particularly like you get to choose from a variety of delicious sauces! I also like that with the smaller options this place offers, I can try more fish options. If only they were closer to me, but I could see them opening up even more locations in the future. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here because I saw they had gluten-free sauces, so I assumed they could tell me what other items/ingredients were also gluten-free. I was sadly mistaken. The employees didn't know anything about allergens. I probably could have kept it simple with unmarinated fish and rice, but I cannot risk getting sick. So my husband kept it simple and risked it, but I unfortunately could not get anything. My niece ordered an açaí bowl, only to be told a few minutes later they didn't have the ingredients. Only reason I gave two stars was because my husband said his sushi burrito was pretty good. The staff should be better trained on ingredients. They should know what is in the food they're serving."}
{"text":"This place is much better than I anticipated. They don't have as many choices or flavor options as other places, but the fish is incredibly fresh. With fish this good, you don't need extra sauces or ingredients to make the fish taste better. 

A quick look at their online menu was slightly discouraging, but everything I tried was worth the price. 

The place is clean, comfortable and spacious. The service was great, as well. 

Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Love the burritos and the avocado boats!
Great food, great taste and the staff top notch, very friendly and takes the time to explain the menu and suggests alternatives if needed!"}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients! Young man at the counter was extremely helpful and friendly. My Crabby Bastard was very good. They were out of pomegranate, which sounded like a strange thing to put in a burrito. But they asked if I wanted a different fruit component added and I chose mango. It actually works. Delicious food and an inexpensive way to get a sushi fix. Thanks all!!"}
{"text":"Sooo good, everything I hoped for! I saw this restaurant on FB and finally got in town to try, and was not disappointed!! Staff was beyond friendly & helpful and suggested a wonderful bowl the Pineapple Express with tempura shrimp! Very clean and cozy dinning area with a relaxing atmosphere. Will be back again, we can't wait!"}
