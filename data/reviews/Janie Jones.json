{"text":"The steak frites, at Janie Jones, is to die for and so is their Sunday night roast dinner.  I was thrilled to see the large selection of gins, since it's my favourite drink. The restaurant is a great addition to this section of Gerrard st!"}
{"text":"I tried to make a reservation for Sunday Roast Dinner. The restaurant has no business phone number posted anywhere (Facebook, web site etc.), apparently the owner(s) do not thing it is useful to have a business phone number for the customers. (I asked and they indicated they will NEVER have one. ) So anybody who wants to reserve a table for Thanksgiving, Sunday Roast Dinner etc. has to e-mail them. 

I waited two days to get a response. (To which their answer was \"Let us know when you are coming.\" My original e-mailed indicated this!!!???  I replied back almost immediately stating the date (again) and received no reply back.) By that time I gave up and looked elsewhere. Not impressed. 
I have never in my life, known a restaurant to not have a business phone number.  It is the most absurd way to run a business."}
{"text":"After enjoying both weekend brunch with my family, and several late-night drinks at Janie Jones, I firmly approve of the food, the drink, and the atmosphere. 

As a Brit, I'm always a bit wary of \"British-style\" stuff in North America, but the kitchen at Janie Jones is legit. While I've not yet tried the \"Full English pizza\", I will, because the roast pork sandwich I had on a recent visit was good enough to instantly convince me. It was so juicy that it has genuinely made my mouth water just thinking about it more than once in the fortnight since I ate it.

At brunch, my toddler was made to feel welcome throughout. We asked about the Weekly Waffle feature. \"It's actually french toast stuffed with dates this week\". OK! My wife ordered this, and I surprised myself by how much I swiped from her plate. Luckily, the portion size was such that she didn't mind too much. My Glaswegian breakfast was satisfying. Since my last visit, I've learned from BlogTO that Chef Dave has worked in several successful Toronto kitchens, and it shows.

Drinks are worth the money; no half measures here, and while the selection on tap isn't vast, it's varied enough that there's some genuine choice. I've had a few of the cocktails, and I'll have more next time I'm back. Sara, who co-owns the place, told me she makes her own syrups. I'd asked because one drink had a slightly overpowering lavender simple syrup component. In fairness, this was nothing which couldn't be fixed by requesting another shot of gin. Sara assured me that she was zeroing in on the perfect amount of lavender, and I believe her: every other drink I've had here did exactly what I needed it to.

The people in charge pretty clearly have a deep-seated passion for the mod scene, and despite my lack of prior engagement with most of the music and culture which goes along with that, the place never felt anything other than friendly and accessible in the several hours I've spent there. On my second visit, I was greeted by name, despite being - as far as I can tell - an unremarkable customer.

Between the welcoming atmosphere, the delicious and reasonably-priced food, and the decent drinking, this is an easy five stars. A great addition to this stretch of Gerrard."}
{"text":"Slow service, loud music, generally a poor experience. Restaurant was sold out of multiple menu items before noon."}
{"text":"Came in for Sunday roast.. Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding... Delish, home cooking!! My friend whose a vegetarian, had the Sunday roast but instead of beef, they served lentils... Also delish!! The ambiance is really comfortable and the service is friendly. Great neighborhood pub! We will be regulars!!"}
{"text":"Went by the family last week for brunch, immediately noticed that the poor girl running front of house was flying solo so I can't really slag them for slow service as she did a great job considering that that place was packed and she was running all over. It has a cottage-y vibe if that makes sense (painted table tops, rustic yet arty). Small space but they make good use of it...Now the food, it's British style grub with playful twists. My SO had the George Harrison which is base of roast potatoes topped with fried eggs, onion, mushrooms and a killer curry sauce. I had the Eggs Ibiza which was similar only it had a remesco sauce on top of eggs and a tasty bread patty with the potatoes on the side, also solid. We'll come back for sure (and hopefully they'll have sorted some decaf coffee).  I'm sure as time goes by (they've been open all of 2 weeks I think) that it will all settle into a nice groove. Curious to try them at night as the menu looks fun."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cute and retro. The drink list is superb and the food is delicious. We had dinner and we loved it. I had the pie and my friend had the steak. I'm so happy that I live in an area of the city that is going through a reboot. Lots of cool eateries and bars opening up in the near future. Leslieville and Toronto east is the place to be and I'm happy to have Janie now as a neighbor. Can't wait to experience Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"Great little addition to the growing list of great little places along this stretch of Gerrard.  
Brunch was was fantastic, good portions and very tasty.  Shared the Glasgow and the Benny Sherman, both were as advertised."}
{"text":"My friend just moved to Leslieville and is quite pregnant so we've been checking out more things on that side. I was searching for brunch options and Janie Jones came up. I liked the fact that they had an interesting menu and a few veggie options so we decided to give it a try.

We came in around 10:30am on a Saturday and it wasn't too busy. The server didn't mind that another one of us was a bit late either. Three of us ordered the house breakfast and my other friend got french toast. The house breakfast was amazing. It came with home fries, baked beans, eggs any style, buttered toast and your choice of sausage/vegan sausage or bacon. The vegan sausage looked a little bit weird I'll admit but it tasted absolutely delicious. The server said they made them in-house and mace was a key ingredient. The baked beans were also fabulous. Being Australia I really enjoy/miss the British/Aussie style tomato baked beans without the brown sugar/maple syrup they add in in North America. These were homemade and really hit the spot.

I can also comment positively on the service. Our server was always around, helpful and yet laid back. She didn't try to push us out and was happy to let us chat. Another nice thing was that we all ordered lattes and then they offered to top us up later with drip coffee and didn't charge us extra for it. That was noticed and appreciated.

If you're in Leslieville for brunch check this place out. Pretty casual, great food and not too packed (yet)."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to check out a new British style restaurant pub, that serves brunch on the weekends. We were quickly seated and the waitress was really friendly and nice. The interior decor is really nice and funky. It has a pretty good amount of seating even though it's a fairly small space. 

We had:

The House Breakfast - I had my two eggs poached and decided on their thick bacon instead of their house sausage. It comes with four pieces of toast with butter, baked beans, and home fries. The eggs were poached perfectly, the thick bacon is good generous portion, the baked beans has a nice tomato flavour, and the home fries was crispy and pillowy inside, and seasoned nicely. I packed the leftover home fries home because it's so good! 

The Glasgow - potato griddle scones with their house-made sausage, eggs and gravy, with home fries and salad. My husband really enjoyed his breakfast, and it's a heavy meal so he couldn't really finish his entire plate. 

We will definitely be back to try other brunch options and dinner. The menu definitely offers something that most restaurant don't offer!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"vegan jerk-spiced bean and mushroom based pie topped with piped Jamaican sweet potatoes, served with red onion gravy and green salad\". My friend ordered a roasted pork sandwich with fries. Our orders came out together after almost an hour. Not impressed.

My pie was not a pie, as there was no pastry crust on either the top or bottom. If there were mushrooms in it, they were cut up very small. Filling was dry. There was no side of gravy and the salad was boring. My friend said his sandwich was really good. Fries were overcooked, though. 

The atmosphere was good, food mediocre, service slow. Won't return."}
{"text":"Maybe I caught the 'chef' on an off day, but this was without a doubt one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had. Having asked for the bacon on the Eggs Jonesville to be well done, I was surprised when my breakfast arrived to see that the back bacon was almost raw, the crumpets were barely toasted and soggy by the time they reached my table, and the whites of the poached eggs were snotty and runny. And the tea they serve is Red Rose. Red Rose! Not even tea really, and certainly not what I'd expect somewhere that advertises British food and drink. The one star is for the woman who served me, who was very pleasant."}
