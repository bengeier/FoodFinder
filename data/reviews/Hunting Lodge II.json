{"text":"A very simple and delicious place. A small town restaurant with excellent food for its overall lack of variety. Its majority of the menu is burgers, subs, pasta, pizza, and salads. Its simple but with simplicity comes great food at cheap prices. I have been there numerous times to eat and have tried just about everything on their menu and have consistently been impressed by the dishes. Its a smoke free environment in the eating area with a nice bar seperate from the eating environment.  They have a fairly decent selection of drink with a few tap options. The overall look of the place is semi dated and the bar is on the darker side but its all pretty clean and put together. Its almost got a western feel to it with the tv always turned to Pittsburgh sports whenever they are on."}
{"text":"Small town place that has good food and a quiet, nice atmosphere. I will definitely go back here"}
{"text":"Good bar food Great Service inexpensive drinks small town feel Amazing Burgers and awesome homemade soup newly renovated since the last time i was here. You gotta try the fennel cake fries for dessert they are sooooo good !"}
{"text":"Our meal was horrible on Friday at lunch 9-29, it tasted old and I threw it in the trash. The  Bartender was mad about being there. Sadly you could see it on her face!! She didn't even realize I threw my lunch away!! Stop worrying about paying people out on the poker machine's and worry about your customers!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what people are talking about, but the food is excellent here and it is cheap.  A family of four and we can eat for under $30 and take food home.  Excellent wings and the best Italian Hoagies.  I have been eating here for years.  They have a restaurant side and bar side.  It's also a nice place to stop and have a beer.  Good food, great prices and a decent place.  I'm not sure what people expect on a menu, I guess a grocery store.  I'm sure you can find something you like.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed.  They have wing night, burger night and other specials."}
{"text":"Great daily specials and prices. Eaten here several times and haven't been disappointed.  It's a bar/restaurant and that's what you get. Owner very friendly and staff is personable. Wings are very good."}
{"text":"Do you find that sometimes really, really simple food should be the standard?  I had lunch yesterday and it was enjoyable.  The menu is not impressive in terms of variety or creativity.  I ordered a cheeseburger and fries...and was pleasantly surprised.  Thick juicy burger cooked exactly as ordered - medium rare.  The bun was toasted and was amazingly  fresh.  Fries were crispy on the outside, soft and warm in the middle.  Simple food prepared well.  I'll be back."}
