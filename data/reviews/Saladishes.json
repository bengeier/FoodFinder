{"text":"I am happy to have a custom salad place in the neighbourhood. There are many toppings to choose from including artichokes, heart of palm, avocado, nuts, fruit, cheeses, vine leaves, etc.  They have custom soups and wraps also."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good  The ingredients are fresh and the dressings are home made. I've had the fatoush salad quite a few times already and it's always tasty.  Would recommend highly. A little tricky to find on the side street in a previously cursed location. Wish they were open later for dinner. They accept ritual which is a plus. Would highly recommend. As a bonus they are open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Wow! Try the lentil soup! It is pur√©ed and spiced very subtly. The large build your own salad is so substantial and filling. The ingredients were fresh and mostly well-proportioned.  My usual go to is Freshii, but this beats them hands down. We ordered delivery which is free for orders over fifteen dollars through Just Eats. My latte even arrived hot during winter."}
{"text":"Lovely owners, excellent spread of salad choices. Many options to choose from.   After being offered to sample the 2 soups of the day, I chose the Mushroom soup. Really lovely flavour.  The wrap was flavourful without being too heavy.   Lovely new find in the Yonge/Eg area!"}
{"text":"I had purchased a Groupon and I live in the area, so it was just a matter of time before I found myself at Saladishes.  A quick perusal of their menu did, not surprisingly, indicate a lot of salads, but I was on the go so I instead decided to order their Meat Wrap (\"Soft beef strips, spinach, carrot, red pepper, corn, pickles, and special tahini sauce\").  It's fine. It really does taste like eating a salad in wrap form, and although it was well prepared, there was just no oomph to the dish. The ingredients worked relatively well together (although I did feel like there was too much spinach in there), but the flavors were all so basic (for lack of a better word) that I tired of eating it just a few bites in.  It is, at least, a good value for the money. ($6.99 for a rather substantial wrap is nothing to sneeze at.)"}
