{"text":"I love Hotel Gelato! Perfect place for a coffee and gelato. I like getting a capuchinno and gelato- I used to get the lemon ricotta (I don't think they make it anymore) and love the hazelnut chocolate, sponge toffee, strawberry cheescake.. and.. well... never had a flavour I didn't like. Oh and the food is great too! Love the decor, wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Cute decor,  limited but tasty menu, nice selection of delicious gelatos that  change up from time to time...this season's pumpkin is so good!"}
{"text":"These 2 stars is not necessarily for the gelato itself, the actual premises, or any of the above, but rather the service or lackthereof.
Never did I realize my visit would turn into a Mean Girls sequel, but with one Mean Dude.

As advertised on Toronto.com, Hotel Gelato offers a free medium or small sized (can't remember which one - didn't matter) cup of gelato. Great!!  
So we venture over there as we'd never been and was surprisingly served a nice dose of atttiudeeeeeeee. I told the girl it was my birthday and she took my order etc. but apparently to no avail, this was not allowed! I have no clue who this guy was (owner, manager?) but man, the cattiness was intense. He came over, smiled in the most passive aggressive way saying that - unfortunately I couldn't get my free gelato unless I had signed up for their mailing list. Seriously?!  So your going to take the gelato out of the cup and put it back into the front display?  LOL. So I said \"ok, so I will just sign up for the list now then,\" He then proceeded to say \"I couldn't do that and it would take over 2 hours for the request to process\" again LOL. So I said nevermind and was leaving then he said, 'ok this one time I could do it'  more LOLs. So he asks me what I wanted and I said I didn't know because it all looked so good :D  I asked for his opinion and his favourite and he smiled in that weird passive aggressive way saying that he didn't know. Whoa! Ok, someone works here and doesn't have a favourite gelato!  Interesting....
So finally (after all this nonsense which I was stupid to even put up with) I got my gelato.  It wasn't amazing or worth this ridiculous nonsense. My visit must have been an anomoly because everyone seemed to be happy and loving the gelato. After all, if Tom Cruise came here - I must be an anomoly! 
If you like a pretty place to sit and eat Gelato, this is the place for it. It really is like a Starbucks of Gelato joints - with little water stand and chandeliers. If you want friendly people in contact with your food or making you feel like its worth handing over your hard-earned money over for a small cup of food, then this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Try there Margherita gelato 
SOOO amazing"}
{"text":"My favourite new place to hang out with friends. Their cappuccino is fantastic"}
{"text":"Fantastic gelato.  Over priced coffee drinks, as per the hood.....even though the espresso is reasonably worthy."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch after an early morning errand on a Saturday. Small space for tables, chairs were more aesthetically pleasing than comfortable. The menu had most of the brunch items hit list. We were a group of 3 and had the salmon benedict, the asparagus benedict and the chicken and waffles.
The benedicts come on top of potato cakes rather than the traditonal english muffin (like!) which was a different texture and make them not as heavy; totally getting 'inspired' from this when I make eggs at home next. The plates they were served in, however, were a little too small for the two eggs and the side salad. Made eating the meal a little adventurous. Chicken and waffles was ok too, liked that they had the syrup on the side rather than doused on the chicken, and came with a maple butter that had just the perfect hint of sweetness. Would have preferred the chicken to be a little spicier, but nonetheless the plate was polished off.

Of course, ended with a scoop of gelato (the name says it all). Like that they combine flavors into a single scoop - considering the size of the single scoop and the fact that we had a full brunch just moments before, it was the perfect ending. I got the pistachio (amazing, had generous pieces of nuts in it) and espresso (REAL espresso, much less sweet)."}
{"text":"Hotel Gelato is a cute place. It's clean, well-decorated and has friendly service. The bathrooms are also clean - a good sign for any food place. 

I've been there several times, mostly for a coffee and pastry, or gelato. I loved that when you order a coffee, it comes in this litttle ceramic pot with a creamer, and they always come with this little chocolate cookie on the spoon. I can't really tell for sure, but it looks like the spoons are silver. It's the little details that I love because it makes the experience all the more special. 

Why 4 stars instead of 5? I've heard their dinner menu is amazing, my mom's been there and said the salmon was great, but we haven't been able to get a dinner. We've gone there a couple times now, not too late, about 7 or 8, but no dinner service. The first time we went, the waiter said they weren't serving dinner that night. The second time (last night), we sat down at a table and waited for about 15 minutes, but nobody came to serve us! The place was full of people enjoying their gelatos, but there were no waiters. We were confused because we were able to just sit down and be served many times before. What's going on here? Eventually, we just got up and headed to a restaurant down the street.

Other than that, it's a nice place and I enjoy going there for a treat. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We've gone here a number of times for gelato and it's definitely solid. My litmus test is always the hazelnut (called nocciola in most gelateria, but weirdly not the case in this trendy joint). There's is pretty good - not the best in the city, but certainly above the bar for what's worth coming back for!  
But here's the added twist:  they have awesome brunch!  We went there this past Sunday and were totally impressed. The mini-croissants are flown in from Belgium and then baked fresh each morning. The lattes - very good, fresh squeezed rocking OJ, and one of the best hot chocolates my kids (who have lived in Switzerland for a year) have ever had!  If you're very hungry or dining with teenagers, you might find the portions a bit small. But at 40-something, small potions are not a bad thing!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor - a little bit art deco. A great selection of vegan desserts - they carry baked nomnoms from LPK culinary groove and Sweets from the earth. They make a few vegetarian dishes and a couple vegan dishes (though not many, but the quinoa salad is pretty good). A bit on the pricey side, but standard for the area (Forest Hill) and pretty standard for pricing of LPK anywhere, actually. They carry vegan gelato, but I've always been too preoccupied with the vegan and gluten-free nanaimo bars to try it.

What I do really like about this place is that they are aware that people have different dietary considerations and they're open to those and knowledgeable about what's in their food - which is more than can be said for many places."}
{"text":"Fabulous Cobb salad.  Soup is sometimes watery.  Very friendly and busy place for lunch."}
{"text":"This is are favourite place to go the gelato is the best in town with speedy service good coffee and a nice clean atmosphere my favorite flavours are coconut ,hazelnut and pistachio

It's a can't miss place!"}
{"text":"Went for Saturday afternoon brunch. We tried the waffles  with banana and the eggs benedict- both were fabulous. Service was great- quick and friendly. The tea was super yummy as well. Would go back again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I liked this cozy, clean dessert and coffee shop 
I definitely will go back 
They serve one of the best Brownies that I ever had 
The coffee was good and gelato was tasty"}
{"text":"Holy cow; this is like a classic *grease* layout! Feel funky an classical :) their gelatos are off the charts! The bomb! Great for going out on a date during the summer! Can't wait to come back! Cute an organized an a great layout! The pricing is fair at most an doesn't cost too much for an average person."}
{"text":"This place is just so damn pretty. The decor is simple, classic yet very modern and elegant. Black and white with what seemed like crystal chandeliers hanging throughout, it makes you want to stay here for a long time just looking around. 

The girl who served us was really nice and patient with my complete inability to make up my mind as to what to order. I was really drawn to the Butter Pecan so I chose that as my first choice and was still having a hard time choosing my second flavour when the girl recommended the hazelnut. I didn't think this would be a good combination particularly but she insisted that they went together \"really well\" and so I listened to her and got it. 

One taste and I knew I had made the wrong choice. The two flavours were too similar to provide a nice contrast and I felt like I was eating just the one flavour instead of two. I knew I should have gone with my instincts and gotten either the caramel apple or banana. 

I begrudgingly finished my Gelato, but I was secretly jealous of my date's better choices. Booo! 

I decided to also get a chamomile tea to warm me up, and while the tea was pretty standard, it was brought to me with a little chocolate cookie thingy that had the chewy consistency of a brownie and was really good. 

I really like this place and am already planning my return visit, on which I will finally try the caramel apple and banana flavours. BTW, they have a Mojito flavour which I asked to taste out of sheer curiosity, and it was quite interesting. I don't know that I could eat a whole serving of this, but ask for a taste, its definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"First time here... Great env and decor!

Ordered the French toast, the presentation looks very nice and appetizing. The taste... Of course is within my expectation... Flavorful and the berries goes well with the maple syrup and e French toast. Also, finishing this off with the coffee makes this a perfect brunch!

Will definitely come again.."}
{"text":"It was a nice beautiful place. Fancy looking, but not that expensive. The service was not great. They were very slow. Gelato is just average."}
{"text":"This place has been receiving some amazing reviews and it has been on my to try list for a while now.
The restaurant is well appointed and tastefully decorated. The service staff were beyond attentive and helpful. They were courteous and extremely polite. To be served from your right side in a restaurant that's under $50/person is a welcomed change!
The Mac and Cheese was done well. I, myself, had the flat bread duck confi ($14) and I found it to be slightly dry. The flavour potential was there though.
Now, you can't go to a place with Gelato in the name without trying it. Smooth, creamy, perfectly balanced flavours; this is what Gelato should be like! Ice cream, you've met your match.
If you're looking for a relaxed, casual yet upscale place, look no further"}
{"text":"My 120th review and it's gotta be about gelato huh?  

Gelato selections were not as plentiful as Paloma, Gelato Gelato or Hollywood.  They were decent enough with such flavours as coconut, hazelnut, peanut butter, chocolate hazelnut and of course some sorbets.  I don't know if they switch up flavours every so often but I would imagine so just to keep some variety. I found it interesting to have a barrier to say not to touch the glass.  I've never been to an ice cream/gelato place where someone couldn't touch the glass.  J'ne sais pas. 

Tonight was variably an older crowd, resembling the area it sits in.  The decor resembles a very old hotel with the various clocks with names of international hotels, chandeliers, but very different chairs.  Benches, clear plastic and comfy faux leather making for an interesting mix.  

I hear that brunch is quite nice based on the rest of the reviewers and probably would have to re-assess at that time.  But for now, I'll leave it as A-OK."}
{"text":"The Gelato spot up on the Eglinton Way, This used to my spot for an after lunch or dinner sweet tooth.  The decore is like out of a mag, but zero soft surfaces make it an echo chamber and if a crowd of more then 8 people take up occupancy then it can become deafening.  It is pricey. It is like $3 for a butter tart the size of a silver dollar or a red velvet cupcake made for a barbie doll, which they will tell you because of the high calibre pastry chef they have. But it is in Forest Hill so guess they can charge the beamer set that for what would cost half as much somewhere else.  Tom Cruise and Suri liked it when they were in town, but then he could pay $50 for a butter tart and not bat an eye.  The Gelato is good and there is always an interesting selection, although sometimes u get stuck behind some Schnorrer who is feeding on sample spoons of every favour. Personal fav gelato, strawberry cheese cake or Mexican chocolate gelato."}
{"text":"Delicious!
Reasonable prices, very cute and classy inside, decent prices.  Good customer service.  The gelato is so flavourful.
As well, my favourite part, there are vegan options!  Sorbet and soy chocolate."}
{"text":"I am desperately in love with the dark chocolate gelato at this place. 

A friend had spotted this place pre-dinner so we decided to get dessert at this place after a fun (albeit a little blaah) dinner. Loved the decor - very trendy and decadent with a black and white color scheme. 

We chose two flavors each for the smallest size cup ($3.50) and I had the dark choc with cheesecake - YUMMY. Someone else got a raspberry gelato (?) and that was amazing too. 

I am not a big dessert person but this one's a keeper :) Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's a great brunch spot and place for gelato! Classy decor and quiet environment.
If you sign up for their newsletter, you'll get a free Gelato on your birthday!"}
{"text":"One day, after having been ENOUGH TIMES to Gelato Simply Italian, we decided to stop by Hotel Gelato....i was skeptical with such a name, hotel gelato? Interesting..anyways..SO HAPPY i came. 

This place is BEAUTIFUL. Unlike gelato simply italian, there is PLENTY of room to sit and enjoy your gelato/beverages. 
The decor is so cute, I love the chandeliers. 
Come here on a Sunday night, very relaxed vibe and you will find a place to sit for sure. 

The gelato is good, they have a lot of sorbets. My favorite is the sugar-free raspberry, definitely does not taste \"sugar free.\" 
Also, they make GREAT lattes and capuccinos. I was blown away..really? best capuccino at hotel gelato? 

If it wasn't for the great coffee/sugar free sorbets i probably wouldn't come here SOLELY just for the gelato, but it's still really good."}
{"text":"This past weekend. My friend and I were randomly were exploring the neighbourhood, when our wandering took us to Hotel Gelato.

Since I have a sweet tooth, and we wanted to check out the place we decided to pop in. The place was busy with people enjoying lunch or a coffee. I however, was immediately drawn to their gelato selection. 

The weather was chilly. Outside people were wearing winter coats and gloves. This was not really ice-cream weather, but I couldn't resist. I love pistachio gelato, and I haven't found any places in Canada that makes good postachio gelato, until now. The gelato tasted like actual pistachio. The texture of the gelato was smooth, creamy, and even has crunchy bits of pistachio in it. I also tried the strawberry cheese cake gelato. The ice-cream truly tastes like strawberry cheese cake. The sourness of the strawberry balances out the sweetness of the cheesecake. It is a nice combination with the postachio.

I'll definitely be back here to try out the rest of the flavours."}
{"text":"Really loved this little spot! Luckily it was walking distance to the place we were staying for the weekend so we ventured over for breakfast. The interior is modern and a bit glam - a nice contrast to the exterior views of other establishments on Eglinton. 

We both opted for breakfast sandwiches on bagels and an americano. The scrambled egg with spinach and Jarlsberg on sesame bagel was good but a little basic. I could have used more of that paprika mayo, maybe. His smoked salmon/cream cheese on sesame bagel was a bit too rich for his liking (though he scarfed it down quite well). The bagels themselves were light and not as dense as I was expecting. Great flavor, too. 

Our waitress was friendly and set a wonderful tone to our first day in Toronto. 

I wish it had been late enough to justify ordering gelato... Next time!"}
{"text":"Nice place for meeting up with friends

Reminds me of a hotel lobby

Great desserts,  coffee, pastries

You can also get some savory snacks

Price is not too bad

Parking is a little hard to find"}
{"text":"Decent, but not my fave.  Service was very good, gelato was also good, but not comparable to Ed's Real Scoop or Hollywood Gelato.  Seating was ample and the restaurant was clean, not busy at all so a nice place to meet for a cup of coffee and gelato if you need the peace and quiet."}
{"text":"What fantastic decor. I love the clocks all set to different times but not city labels like at an airport. Rather than making you feel rushed as clocks often do it sets up the dreamy atmosphere. Time is irrelevant when eating this icecream. I don't even eat ice cream and I felt like sitting down and enjoy the moment.

My kids said the gelato was even better than the place on Mt pleasant and the two places on Bayview. They are the experts. So I beleive them. I know they were not hungry because they had both just finished a large pasta dinner at Seven Numbers ( great meal but no ice cream). What is it with kids and ice cream!"}
{"text":"The gelato is relatively expensive ($6 small, $7 medium, $8 large) but it is the best gelato/ice cream I have ever had.  They make the gelato in house and the flavours are deep and fresh.  It is tough to get a table if going after dinner.  I hear the lines go out the door in the summer."}
{"text":"If this was a real HOTEL, I would either be too intimidated by the Haute Classy(Pricey) visuals or be thrown-out by the Doorman on to the streets where the Yellow Taxis await.  For a Medium Gelato ($4.75), I got to experience how a Euro Hotel feels like while still in my Bumgear.  The staff are friendly and the person writing the Dinner/New Gelato on the Blackboard sign even opened the door while I left.  When was the last time someone did that for me???

Pumpkin Pie/Espresso flavours were very nice where Pumpkin Pie as the server said had some Nutmeg & Cinnamon flavours.  The Espresso was pretty good as I tasted I became more awake during this late afternoon.  It was just strong enough but since Gelato does include some Milk in it, it was a Espresso/Cappuccino.

The clear plastic seats look okay as I saw a table of 4 choose those over the more comfy cushiony chairs.  I sat at the Black bench feeling like royalty underneath the chandeliers as I looked at the Blackboard behind the Gelato Counter which gives a brief history and description of Gelato & Sorbetto.  It's always fun to learn!

Btw, make sure you throw your trash in the proper bin or do what I do and wash your plastic Gelato cup and take it home as souvenir, re-use!"}
{"text":"I thought about giving them a 3 star, but I changed it to 4 when I remembered that even for their small sized gelato ($4.25? $4.50?), they allow you to choose up to two different flavors. I greatly appreciate that.

Gelato is a fairly dense dessert. When I say that, what I mean is that it doesn't take much to satisfy you. Or well, me. I don't have much of a sweet tooth though. 

Had: A small sized gelato.

Flavors:

Roasted Almond:If almonds taste almost floral, then this does not taste like almonds. It tastes almost like marshmallow fluff. Not my cup of tea.

Spicy Mayan Chocolate: Yeah. The spicy part got to me. I've had so-called spicy chocolate before, but it's never actually been spicy. This was. I sampled it before I bought it, and when I sampled it, I knew I had to buy it. It's rich and chocolatey, and not too sweet. My initial thought was that it was like all the rest. It had a slight peppery tinge, but it was just chocolate. Then the spice kicked in. It's got a spicy afterburn. It doesn't hurt, but it definitely tingles."}
{"text":"I had the chili chocolate gelato along with another flavour that I can't remember now because this was last summer. I remember the place being so pretty, the staff were just so nice, not to mention that my gelato tasted fantastic. If I were rich, I'd have one gelato a day from them hand delivered to me. Will most definitely be going back the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Hotel Gelato is one of my fav places in the city. Such a great atmosphere and a fun local place to hang out, grab a coffee, go for brunch etc. I probably come here for something at least three times a month (especially now that we're heading into prime gelato season). Best of all, they're open late for those cravings you just can't kick. 

HG serves breakfast (brunch on the weekend), lunch/\"dinner\" and dessert.

1. Breakfast Brunch
Awesome brunch. The menu is *slightly* limited, but all the options are great. The baked eggs and eggs benny are great savory options, while the lemon ricotta pancakes or french toast are great for those with a sweet tooth. The pancakes are the best I've had EVER. Super fluffy, lemony amazingness. 

Note that there are always kids here. If you're looking for a quiet place to have a coffee, this may not be the best option. 

2. Lunch/\"dinner\"
They have a menu of sandwiches, a daily soup and salads that they service throughout the day. This menu isn't worth the cash and didn't live up to my expectations set by the brunch & desert offerings. I wouldn't bother with most of these as there are better places in the area for lunch. These are the reason I'm not giving them 5 stars. 

3. Desert
Given they named this place \"Hotel Gelato\", it's safe to say desert is what they're known for. The gelato is awesome. Very fresh (you can tell) and interesting flavours that rotate with the seasons. I've tried several other options in the city and I think this one is the best. They don't have as many traditional flavours as some of the others, but the quality is better. I always think of Lemon as the comparison flavour for different places and there's is great. Other must-try flavours include: roasted almond, yogurt, mojito, pear or peanut butter banana.  For you (crazy) non-gelato eaters, they have a good selection of baked goods, and cater to those who have gluten/ vegan eating requirements. 

The owners are frequently there are and both so nice! They are passionate about the location and try whenever they can to get to know the customers. If you're in the area, or even if you aren't, you should come check this place out."}
{"text":"The restaurant was a pretty upscale-ish gelateria with many wonderful options of ice cream. It's a good place to catch up with friends, both inside or out on the patio. They have lots of yummy ice creams that you can taste before ordering. For those with dietary restrictions, they offer gluten free, sugar free, and soy options to their ice cream. Ice cream is a little expensive  - I think it cost us about $14 for 2 cups of ice cream. Parking is only available on the street, and is paid by a parking meter/machine. Come in the evenings for better parking availability."}
{"text":"Tom Cruise came here once. No joke. One day I was driving down my street (Heddington) when I saw Tom Freaking Cruise with daughter Suri and a bodyguard at the corner of Heddington and Eglinton (location of Hotel Gelato). Later I read somewhere that he visited HG on a recent trip to Toronto. Pretty cool shit.

But that's not why I'm awarding 4 stars to this cute little cafe. I've been here numerous times over the years and the gelato is truly top notch--as is their frozen yogurt (try the wild blueberry) and their sorbetto (love the mango). So damn good.

Brunch is also fantastic...I love the lemon ricotta pancakes and I'm also a fan of the eggs benny served on a potato croquette. Also the MAPLE GLAZED BACON IS LITERALLY CRACK. I usually get two orders of maple bacon with my breakfast so go ahead and judge me. And bonus: brunch is served weekends till 4pm!

But from time to time I do question the value of their offerings. I once bought a takeout salad for lunch and it was like $16 for not-a-huge salad. But the salad was delicious. So I'm conflicted :)"}
{"text":"Typical Gelato (have you ever had Gelato you didn't enjoy?), but can't get past the service. Seriously stop freaking out about kids pointing at the glass. It's not enjoyable to go to an ice cream shop where they're bugging at you. Relax. Ice cream should be fun."}
{"text":"My wife took me here after an early morning visit to the dentist. Wasn't sure why we had to have gelato! Was surprised to see they have a great breakfast selection. Baked eggs was hot, fresh and tasty. Scones good too. Cafe Americano good, not great. I will go again."}
{"text":"Great experience, beautiful neighbourhood spot. The baked eggs were delicious (use the bread that comes with it to dip like a fondue). Also try the lemon ricotta pancakes - heavenly!"}
{"text":"Best gelato in Toronto, comfortable seating, great service!  Very good number of choices for the flavours,love the tiramisu and mango the most.  I should also mention their coffee, very good coffee! Must try!!  I strongly recommend this gelato place to everyone in Toronto, they are the same as the top ones in Italy!"}
{"text":"I love their gelato - fave gelato spot in Toronto. I've also had brunch there a few times and always left super satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Best gelato I've ever had in Toronto. It's a cute place in forest hill, nice space. Great place to meet up with friends. Service has always been great. Over all I'm a happy camper about this place."}
{"text":"WARNING: Eating breakfast here will ruin all other breakfasts for you. This is some seriously good food!"}
{"text":"Amazing gelato. Great atmosphere. Feels very upscale. I tried their peach, salted caramel, and vanilla sponge toffee. The salted caramel was absolutely amazing. I've never had gelato this unique. They've done well and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! 

I was there last week. We found it by chance, but it's a lovely place. Small and the seating isn't the most comfortable, but the food is fantastic. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and fresh grapefruit juice mimosa. One of the best brunch places I've been to.

They also have homemade gelato and sorbet. I didn't have any but my friends did and they seemed happy with their choice. 

When we went, it was the weekend so the place was busy. I didn't feel that the servers were as \"on it\" as they should have been. We needed to ask for water, utensils, and for their attention to order. It might have been due to them being overwhelmed by customers, but when we did get their attention, they were polite.."}
{"text":"A great breakfast and brunch spot for the artsy/classy type. The average crowd here is a little overdone for my taste but the food, service and decor is amazing. - also wish it was bigger and had more seating!!"}
{"text":"The place is great. Welcoming and smiling staff, who also happen to know a thing or two about the difference between gelatos and sorbets. I tried a few but the best ones were the chocolate mint gelato and mango sorbet. They are pretty much made in house and you can tell  by the taste not like the packaged crap you get at grocery stores. Oh and Tom Cruise was spotted their a few weeks ago as well.

Yup as the review says - I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and it's open late. Wifi is pretty fast.

The water has strawberry and mint. I love it when coffee shops add exciting things to the water!

They sell tea from Vancouver company T. I loved that place in Vancouver so it made me smile.

Their baked goods are a bit on the pricey side, and many of them are vegan. The non-vegan mini apricot croissant was only ok. They had little shortbread cookies for something between $2-$3.

They also have wine! I didn't try it but it's a rare treat that a place that offers wifi also offers alcohol.

The peach gelato was made with ripe Ontario peaches--impressive! It was pretty good. To be honest, I'm pretty vanilla when it comes to my frozen dairy and am more of a vanilla bean ice cream kinda gal than exciting fruity gelato. They had lots of different gelato flavours, including sugar-free options.

Service is friendly, wifi is fast, the tea is awesome, they have alcohol and baked goods and high quality gelato, AND they're open until 11pm! This place is a solid hang out and getting-work-done spot.

They apparently have real food items too and not just desserts. I will try these next! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome atmosphere, friendly staff and a great product. I really enjoy the watermelon gelato, it's very smooth and has a gentle taste to it. The caramel is also to die for. It's a great place to sit back and relax for an hour."}
{"text":"What a discovery! In my opinion one of the best gelato in Toronto!
We tried mango, strawberry, roasted almond, key lime pie- all amazing!"}
{"text":"I happen to be driving on Eglinton this week when I noticed a new Gelato joint,  I didn't had much time to stop by that day so I decided to come back later on this week and check it out.  

From the moment I stepped in, I liked that place! The atmosphere is very welcoming, the staff is very friendly, the prices are reasonable and the Gelato is ammzing! 

I tried about 6 out of their 26 flavours(some are even sugar free) and pretty much loved them all, The ones I recommend the most are the Strawberry and \"Donatella\" (which I think is a mix of Chocolate, Nutella and hazelnuts). They've got some other baked goods which I didn't try this time but looked really tasty. 

Their coffee is really good, the washrooms were clean (handicap accessible) and I really liked the fact that they accept credit cards and debit.. 

Will definitely will be going there again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful gelato, great drink menu (didn't try but decent prices and thoughtful drinks - ie: no appletini), cute decor and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love the decoration of Hotel Gelato.. so European and classy... the padded sofa seats which I ran to so fast to sit down while my lovely date got all confused with what flavour of gelato to pick!

We decided to order 2 small ($3.50) each so we have 4 flavours to really tried out. I made my decision really fast.. (pumpkin/roasted almond) and while my date still wants to order every single flavours they offers! 

The small gelato is really small... I love my choice a lot but my date just did not like hers (Butter Pecan/Hazelnut) and almost want to make me finish hers so she can order something else! :) 

Love the fresh fruit infused iced water dispenser they have, which you can help yourself with.(+0.5star) Hey this is a Hotel.. and we have certain standard. I went to places they frown on you when you ask for a glass of water... 

The server here so nice and patient with a great smile! I will definitely be back again and pretend I am in a Parisian hotel cafe......"}
{"text":"They have the best gelato that I have had around the city. Amazing flavours and a great selection to choose from."}
