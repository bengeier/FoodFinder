{"text":"Really fun place. I live 2 minutes from 16-Bit and that place is anything but entertaining on the weekends. Good luck getting to play a game when the place has 30 people for every arcade cabinet inside.

Enter Superelectric Pinball Parlor. They don't serve alcohol here which makes it a much more enjoyable place to spend an evening. I like drinking and all but I really like the fact that if you are here, you're here for no other reason than to play pinball.

The game selection has been different each time I've been which is cool and keeps things interesting. It's not expensive here at all which is awesome for me because I don't have a lot of money to spend on having fun right now. But I can get about an hours worth of fun and an Old City Soda for about $8.

Superelectric Pinball Parlor is a really cool addition to an area that already had some pretty cool stuff to begin with."}
{"text":"Superelectric pinball is like a cross between a bar, arcade, living museum, and showroom. If you like pinball, it is a must visit. They have some great and historic tables, and because you can buy them, what they have on the floor is apt to change from week to week, which is all the incentive you should need to make a regular pilgrimage."}
{"text":"I actually went here because my mom and brother were here visiting from Chicago and they are obsessed with pinball.  I'm not really into pinball but this place was pretty awesome!  They have a great variety of pinball machines because they buy, restore and sell the machines.  Because they buy/sell machines all the time there will most likely be new pinball games to play next time you visit :) 
If your a pinball wizard like my brother I recommend purchasing the yelp deal $30 for $50 of tokens.  It's a great deal and if you don't use all your tokens you can just come back another day!
I think this place would benefit if they had a bar and sold alcohol, but other then that I wouldn't change a thing!  I'll definitely be returning to get my pinball game on and not just when my mom and brother are in town :)"}
{"text":"Superelectric is, quite simply, a whole lot of fun. It's an eclectic little spot that is such a perfect addition to the Gordon Square neighbor. Regardless if you are a pinball wizard, or just looking to make it rain quarters (and if you're like me, you'll do so at an alarmingly fast rate) you'll have fun here.

For being a pretty small location, they pack a lot of games into the parlor. The game selection alao changes pretty frequently- since the pinball games are available for sale- which definitely keeps the options interesting. But it also can be a little bummer if you've grown particularly attached to a game... Ghostbusters, I'm talking to you!
 
Although I usually feel like these types of places can only benefit from adding a bar, I actually think the family-friendly nature of Superelectric is a nice change of pace. Besides, there's plenty of options around to toss back a few before you stop in, so there really isn't much need for them to change. Do a little bar-crawl around Gordon Square, and then be sure to stop in for some pinball!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool. The guys that own it are all hunks and treat everyone like gold. All the machines are extremely well taken care of and you get a real sense that these guys take a lot of pride in what they do. No detail is left unattended to at Superelectric. Super chill vibes. Great spot for a first date. Although you might end up bailing on the date for one of the owners."}
{"text":"In a digital world, it's great to have nostalgic and analog relics of the past. There is about 20 pinball machines and some other games. You buy tokens at the counter towards the back. You can spend a couple bucks for a few plays or spend hours trying to beat a high score. It's a great place to kill some time while in Cleveland's Gordon Square."}
{"text":"Pretty great little place.  Priced really well, tokens are $.25 each and the games are either one or two tokens.  Everyone in our party had fun.  The neighborhood has a lot of other great businesses and restaurants.  There was free parking behind the building.  We will definitely be back to visit."}
{"text":"In a heavily digital world, this Pinball Parlor seems like a relief, a place where my analog self can run free! The machines themselves are in great condition. As I took one of them for a whirl, I immediately appreciated how these things might actually need to belong to a museum. I immediately wondered who in the world still has the set of skills to repair these things? Where do the spare parts come from? I was fascinated.

This parlor is a nostalgic slice of historic America. As I left, I realized I truly was in a living museum. This visit was worth it!"}
{"text":"Step back in time and lose yourself in electromechanical heaven for two hours!! Or three or four!!! Wow, this place opened in December and is pinball heaven on earth!! I play a lot of pinball, but these machines are rare treats in an LED world. Buzzers, bingos, bumpers, drop targets, flags and double bonus points are music to the ears, but the vinyl 45 jukebox kicking out everything from mod rock to classic county made for an unforgettable soundtrack!!

Street parking. Cool t-shirts. Good sodas. Token play. Friendly people. Neat murals. Cool cool cool......"}
{"text":"I-LOVE-PINBALL!!!!!!!!!!
Ever since I was a kid Friends and I would search out pinball machines in our hometown and literally spend HOURS trying to beat then finally do any game we found,
Enter 2016  and I happen upon this place and suddenly I am 13 years old again with a pocket full of quarters!!!!! Played a bunch of games and won NONE!!!!!!   Guess I better brush up on my double flip skills cause I got my butt kicked...They have a ton of analog games that I am QUITE SURE I played when I was a kid! 
The only thing is it is SO FREAKEN LOUD!!!!  They played GREAT music tho...Everything from Dick Dale to the Clash but next time I go....
Earplugs!!!!!  LOL!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is cool if you're in the area and want to kill some time doing something different! Superelectric Pinball Parlor has a bunch of old pinball machines that you can play. For me it was a blast from the past seeing some old familiar games. For the 12 year old boys I took it was an education on how things used to be before xbox and ipads. 
I cashed in $20 and got some tokens. It seemed to last us a while to go through the tokens. The machines average 2 per play, some of the newer ones take 3 tokens. They have a variety of pinball machines to play and if you like them you can buy them. The guys that own the place travel the country, buy, restore and sell the machines. so if you keep going back there are always new machines in the rotation. 
Kids and adults will love spending it time here. And from what I understand they may be getting a liquor license, which would make the place even better! LOL"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome and affordable. However, there aren't any drinks to buy to enjoy while playing the games. Here's hoping they get a liquor license soon."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes. Superelectric brings soooo much energy to Gordon Square. Run, don't walk, to check out this haven of awesome. It's alarmingly genuine.

Superelectic makes me feel like a retro, old school pinball wizard. This parlor has purchased and restored over 80 antique games and keeps the floor games changing. If you've got the dough, you can even purchase these vintage machines! From everything from Murder Mystery to Indiana Jones pinball, the opportunities are endless. This place sucks you in without even trying. Even if you're not a pinball aficionado, it'll still get you...because the visual feast will strike your curiosity endlessly!

As someone who is into little details, this place just gets me. Retro Cleveland Indians lineups and other kitschy art lines the walls, and little dinosaur figurines are inconspicuously placed in hilarious places around the parlor. There's also a fantastic vintage jukebox that plays both local tunes and old school jams. Turn me on some Blondie, and I'm a happy camper.

This parlor has the absolute nicest people at its helm. The entire staff is super helpful and non-judgmental on teaching you to play some of their retro games. When you enter, you purchase your cup of tokens and can embark right away on your playtime. So grab an Old City Soda from their counter and go nuts on some old-fashioned family fun!"}
{"text":"Belinda Carlisle sang, \"Ooh, heaven is a place on earth.\" I'm guessing she was talking about this place, which is as close to heaven as my meager mind can allow. It's a showroom for pinball machines which also doubles as a pinball machine parlor. Your inner 10-year-old will blossom while you play games you haven't seen in 20 years or so. A buddy of mine who comes here all the time says that there's a crazy turnover of machines, so it's best to come here frequently. Also, the place is decorated like your cool uncle's basement, so that's definitely a plus. If you don't like this place, then I don't like you."}
{"text":"Really cool concept but really lacking in the pinball games. There were maybe three quality games,  the rest were older beaters"}
{"text":"A heavenly haven for pinball lovers. I might be a little biased since my husband is such a big pinball fan that he supported Superelectric's Kickstarter, but this is just a cool place. It's run by really nice people. It's an entertainment bargain, and the lovingly restored machines are always changing because they are always buying and selling. I've also been to a couple of private parties at both the new location and the original art studio spot, and I can recommend Superelectric for a unique party without hesitation."}
{"text":"Amazing stop after a movie at the Capitol theatre. Bring your ticket stubs for a dollar in tokens!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I am a long time collector of pinball machines and was very happy to see a place with a large number of maintained, working pinball machines. The machines were in great shape - snappy with fresh rubber and clean. The machines could be played and also are available for purchase. If I had one wish, is was that there would be more late model Williams machines (WPC vintage for the pinheads), but I assume their stock rotates as things sell.

We were there on a Sunday evening and a tournament was going on, so it was busy. Even so, we had a very good time!"}
{"text":"Excellent location in a revitalized part of Cleveland. Love the pin ball machine games. My ten year old son and I, along with a friend and his 3 young boys enjoyed our time there.The decor is really retro and inviting. Also, they have nice and knowledgeable staff. Come for the nostalgia, stay for the fun."}
{"text":"I love Superelectric, don't get me wrong, but I feel its potential has yet to be reached and for that, I cannot fully enjoy it. Back when they were in the studios, I remember attending a party they had to test out some ideas for the new space. Word was they would be offering small bites and beers, but those have yet to come to fruition. On top of that, I feel like some of the machines are always broken. I love vintage pinball and pinball in general, but if a machine isn't working it doesn't do anyone any good. I have faith they will pick up steam though and this place will be rockin' before the end of summer."}
{"text":"So, when I moved to Cleveland.... My amazing coworkers bought me 2 books..... One was about serial killers (could have done without that one, guys) and things to do in Cleveland.... I remember the pinball parlors seemed cool and unique.   This place is just that.   There is old school pinball machines and newer 80-fabulous machines.    I prefer the old school ones.     I also discovered I suck at pinball.    They also have some other vintage games (slapshot was a favorite).    The staff was super nice and the atmosphere pulls you into a time of tube socks, roller skating, and bowling.   I do wish it was bigger, but from what I understand there is a rotation of machines.    Will be back."}
{"text":"I was nervous to bring the niece and nephews here, as Brooklyn is not even 4 and doesn't sit still for 2 minutes.  My nephews had a great time and loved all the cool pinball machines.  Kept them occupied for a while. I took advantage of the Yelp deal (which, although a great deal, probably more than I needed to spend on tokens for pinball) and my dollars stretched pretty far. Most machines were only 2 tokens and at an exchange rate of quarter=token we played a lot. 

I love the nostalgia and simplicity of the parlor. The decorations were so fun and I loved how classic the games were. Just like when we were kids- I didn't need a menu or snack bar or even booze. (that was needed AFTER my day spent with the littles).  

When Brooklyn got bored, there was plenty to look at and keep her occupied. She may have re-decorated the dinosaur display and for that, Superelectric Pinball Parlor folks, I apologize. I'll be back. 

I really appreciate the revitalization of these great Cleveland neighborhoods, so please show your support for the funky and fabulous. Get out to Gordon Square and have yourself a throwback good time."}
{"text":"Ohhh boy what a sensory overload.  We attended for a Yelp event and it was probably the best one so far."}
{"text":"To all you parents out there.  Please rear your kids with some grace.  When they ask to go out to an arcade and play some games, avoid the overgrown mouse house.  Save yourself a headache from the crazy atmosphere, and the lure of ticket dispensers (which inevitably turns into a plead to attain a certain level, to procure a certain cheap toy, that will be forgotten about in less than 24 hours. Guaranteed.)

We celebrated my 40th birthday here.  Rented the place out for my friends and their families.  It was an amazingly good time for everyone.  The adults AND kids -- every age -- having a blast.

The staff is tremendous!  Friendly, helpful, and you can tell they love what they are doing here.  They helped get the food and drinks we brought with us all setup.  Don't want to bring your own?  They partner with certain local restaurants and can have food delivered, just ask for options.

The staff know the games inside and out and they're happy to see them being enjoyed by others!  These guys are genuine in their love for pinball.

The value for the private rental was very good.  There's places nearby to grab dessert afterwards.  Parking is good, whether on the street or in the lot in back.

Overall: this place is a GEM for Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great place for a date or bring the family among. Fun for everyone! They have league action for the competitive folks, or just come for the great music and casual play. Word has it they are working on offering food and adult beverages in the near term. Looking to buy an awesome antique pinball machine? Most of the games are for sale! Talk to Nate, Ben, or David for details."}
{"text":"Very flexible hours, and the pinball machines are always rotating in and out to keep things interesting. A reasonable price for the amount of games they have. Family friendly and there is parking nearby."}
{"text":"Okay so I found this place from going to the Black Market up the street conversing with the lady working there, she recommended it, and I dont regret it. 

It's located on the corner of Detroit Ave and W 65th street. 

Inside there's probably about 25 pinball machines, all in working order, except during a few games, the paddles stopped working on me, but considering their age I didnt care. It's a quarter-fifty cents per game. 

The inner decor is awesome, retro paintings of pinball themes on the walls, a velvet picture of Elvis, Betty Boop light up sign, etc.

There's a soda bar with in house soda creations but I didnt get any, owner told me they're working on getting their liquor license soon which should be fun. 

The nostalgia is real here if you went to arcades as a kid, which are pretty much dying out like video rental places, so it gives me hope that places like this still exist."}
