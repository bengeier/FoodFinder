{"text":"This place is the absolute best. No other meat market compares!! Great staff and fast service. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"OK meat market, but let's not get carried away here ,many better (less fatty) sausages available locally and even heinens has just as good and in my opinion better quality beef ,pork and chicken. And really the smokies aren't what they used to be !!the casings are almost plastic now. Yes it is spotlessly clean but then so are most mcdonalds !! Iff you want duck blood I guess this is your place ...kielbasa good but too much fat for me .I'll take the sausage shoppe on Memphis over this place for quality and cholesterol control all day long !!"}
{"text":"My Polish half stirs with joy upon entering this place. A Slavic Village original, just a couple blocks from Grandma's, finally hit the burbs a few years ago like all the other Pollocks, and incredibly, landed right down the street from my Polish mom's. So I guess we've been neighbors for almost a century.  Do you like duck blood? In soup? We do. We call it czarnina. It is the finest delicacy in the Polish menu, so rare it is a Christmas only meal for us. You used to have to order the entire muscove duck to get the blood, and we need three ducks for our batch, so you'd end up with ducks in the freezer. Which is awesome! But costly. Jaworski lets us just buy the blood. Because if you're ordering blood from a duck and don't need the duck, you're certifiably Cleveland Polish, you're part family, and damnit, you deserve it.  Sausages are incredible, diverse, and made on site. Order one for lunch with saurkraut. We get both the smoked and the non-smoked for Easter. The shelves are filled with Polish awesomeness of every kind. And of course, they're Browns fans - place is festooned with brown and orange, almost as much as the Polish white and red.  Nothing more Cleveland than Jaworskis. A museum piece, a step back in time, but fully alive, thriving, and likely to continue for another 80 years. Go Browns!"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything here is great. Pierogis are better than anywhere else. Good prices and friendly staff. My only complaint (and I mean only) is their corned beef. It isn't your typical cb. It more like ham flavored corned beef. Not my fav, but I really like everything else."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was down on Fleet Ave. A favorite of my Polish father and his buddies from Krak√≥w. This place is the \"real deal\" as far as Eastern European cuisine."}
{"text":"Wish I lived in their neighborhood.  The kielbasa is outstanding.  The pierogi is great.  The dumplings are a time saver (and as good as my mom's.)  Their meats are trimmed beautifully.  Their soups are fabulous.  My only complaint.  I live in Orlando and wish they could ship - much like Omaha Steaks.  I have loved this place since the old neighborhood."}
{"text":"we've gone a few times to Jaworski's to get some meats. Danielle likes their chicken breasts and i've had no complaints at all with the ground beef we've purchased.  Saturday we got chicken and ground beef again but we also got some stew meat i plan to put to use at some point this week as well as some steak burgers she's cooking right now.  most impressive to me, though, were the sandwiches we got for a late lunch. she had the turkey reuben and liked it though could have used more 1,000 island dressing. i had the Overstuffed Polish sub (Polish ham, kielbasa loaf, praski, Swiss cheese, homemade horsey sauce on a sub roll). i had lettuce, tomato and banana peppers on mine. without question this is the best sub sandwich i've ever had in my life. there was a ton of meat on it but it wasn't so much that i couldn't taste the rest. the horsey sauce was so good i wouldn't have hated the idea of a little more. but the key, for me, was that little kick of tangy banana pepper at the end of each bite. and it was fairly cheap - $4.75. i can't even tell you how much i want another one. i'm sad we'll be out of town next Saturday and won't be able to get another for a couple weeks (unless someone reads this and goes to get me one)."}
{"text":"Best butcher and sandwiches in Greater Cleveland  Huge italian sub, 3 smokies and a jar of pickled Hungarian peppers for $13.00!!! Great \"smiling\" staff!  Awesome value ... Outstanding quality ... Fantastic service !"}
{"text":"Get to this place and buy everything.  This is the kind of place everyone needs to go to and support.  Meat prices are just as good, if not better, than supermarkets.  It's nice to have a person that clearly cares make you a real sandwich.  Why buy this stuff anywhere else?  You don't have a good reason, now go buy some kielbasa."}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches, a large selection of meats, cheeses , spreads and more ! I found Hungarian nut roll too!"}
{"text":"This review is based on one thing and one thing only: their Corned Beef Sandwich with Melted Swiss on Rye toasted in their oven. Yum. Delicious. And you get enough beef to make a sammie the next day at home. So it's like a Buy One Get One Free, sort of. $7. Worth it!"}
{"text":"So I really wanted to smoke some babyback ribs yesterday but had none.  I wanted to try something other than supermarket \"previously frozen\" ribs and looked up a local meat market on Warren, but their Daisyfield ribs on \"special\" were $5.49/lb; not horrible, but I thought I'd see if I could do better.  I found Jaworski's and gave them a call.  Score!  Daisyfield babyback's were on special there for $3.59.  The store looks good, it's nice and clean, and had a big friendly staff to handle the relatively large number of customers there.  I bought two very good looking slabs along with some fresh Kielbasa to try.    Long story short, the ribs went in the smoker for 5 hours and were absolutely fantastic.  They seem to have a very good selection of items (check their website) and their prices seem to be a little lower than the west side market.  Definitely worth my while when I need something special and don't want to go all the way to W 25th and Lorain for just one or two things."}
{"text":"Local, fresh better than grocery or mega store.  Awesome smoked pork chops, they are about 6-7 oz a piece.   They have really fresh ground beef. An excellent selection of polish and European meats.  Don't forget the home made smokies. There is right different types, try them all.  They do have lunch menu for sandwiches and soup."}
{"text":"New to the area. My husband.and I.love going.to butcher shops to get our meat. These guys are great. Good cuts of meat and good prices. They have great ham salad and good cold cuta turkey. I highly reccomend going here for your meats."}
{"text":"Being fairly new to Cleveland, it was hard to find a good Polish goods store on the eastside much less anywhere in the city. I have been told That a lot of them closed down that were once in the Slavic Village area. the other challenge is that there more Hungarians here than any city in the US and the Slovenian population is also very sizeable. But there are some good places left if you keep looking.  Jaworski's was recommended by a colleague. Its a solid Polish meat shop with lots to choose from. Steaks, chops galore. They also feature different types of pastries and refrigerated and shelf items. We bought 1/2 dozen pierogies, a lamb butter, and 1 pound of fresh kielbasa, which is not sold by the link or half link but rather by the pound so you'll have to re-knot it on both ends when you get it home if you are roasting it. The sell several types of Kolaczki (Jelly Rolls) and Chrusciki (Angel Wings). Love the selection of imported goods. I'm not sure where the baked goods are from but you can get full loaves of chalka (egg bread) too. Clean and conveniently located off of I-71 in Middleburg Hts and plenty of parking. Open til 5 on Saturday. Dzi?kuj? Ci"}
{"text":"My favorite kielbasa in the area. I get the fresh, unsmoked kind. Your mileage will vary. Sorry to those folks who have no sausage options near them aside from filler-ridden homogenized tubed meat. We have long winters, cursed sports teams, good beer, Lake Erie, and sausage. That's 3 of 5. All in all, we'll take it.   Good full butcher shop whose folks will cut stuff to order (eg pork roast). Pro tip: when the butcher asks you how many people and not how many pounds you want, that's a very good thing.    Added bonus of delicious homemade pierogi - try the cabbage ones, not just potato... Though do buy the potato, cheddar and bacon pierogi. You'll be glad you did.   Good, delicious, and large sandwiches available too. Close to 71, so not too afield. Give them a try. Closed Sunday and Monday."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years.   1.  Sandwiches are absolutely delicious. The Roast beef melts in your mouth.  2.  The meats are great. My favorite is the black nugget marinated London Broil.  People rave about it and it is so easy to grill. I just made it for my wife's birthday party and people loved it."}
{"text":"Stopped here yestesy and got boneless chicken thighs Steak and hamburgers along with some other stuff for $27. Suprise to see how big the chicken thighs were. I will be stopping here from. Now on."}
{"text":"hi everbody i went to this place in middleburgh  height s  ,pass the sunny side car dealer ,across from jet pizza  ,anyway the place is fanstanic,the meat is so fresh  and the aroma is outstanding the smoikies garlic one  have a nice paper  like  ,lining  which you can easliy remove the casting (with out wasting any product ) theirHOMEMADe SOUP ARE awsome ,but they have a lunnmeat hpmemade  GYARO LOAF,and HOMOMADE KEIASIBA LOAF IT THE BEST MEAT YOU"}
{"text":"Hey. Those racks that are 'in the way' have some good stuff on them! Open your eyes and take a look-see! Super cool old-world cookbooks, home made noodles, awesome fresh veggies sometimes, Tony Packos pickles and peppers and hot dog sauce, other awesome mustards and sauces. Those shelves are stocked full of awesome goodness.   My favorites at Jaworski's are: soups (especially the pickle, paparikas, chicken noodle, Italian wedding - yum, yum). Fish - perch, walleye, salmon. Unusual meats - some I'm afraid to try, but I might some day. Have tried the bison and elk. Home made Sauerkraut. Fresh sausage. Smoked sausage. Pierogis. Gyro loaf, Tzazhiki  sauce, roast beef lunch meat (a home made they roast they make daily and cut into lunch meat ---- yuuuu huuuummm), cabbage rolls (none better - those things are a PIA to make yourself), smokies (love the bold and tangy, mild, gyro, buffalo chicken and mango habanaro. Steaks. Oh my, the steaks. Anything marinated in that black nugget marinade. TRIPLE PIG (pork roast stuffed with sausage and wrapped in bacon). When your budget is tight, the meatloaf mix and bacon ends and pieces are awesome. You can do so much with those!   Beyond that, the staff are so friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. My kids love going there - my youngest considers Mark Jaworski one of her favorite people.   You just can not possibly go wrong here, my friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!  The food is delicious! Their homemade soups are fantastic! Plus the sandwiches are loaded is meat! It is awesome!  The staff is very fun and welcoming!  Sometimes there is even a polka band playing! It is so much fun!  It can take a while sometimes because they get really busy. But that's just because they are awesome.  I recommend them for al your meat needs.   Ps. The smokies are amazing for a quick snack to hold you over."}
{"text":"You know a deli truly knows it's customer base when they have sandwiches naned after them. (The Stepanovich, Freddies Favorite and the Big John)  Once you step foot in to Jaworski's you know Cleveland's Polish community is alive and well.  My purchases  are usually smoked kielbasa and hand made sauerkraut to cook at home, smokies, these awesome fried mini pies or The Stepanovich if I'm getting a sandwich.   The Stepanovich-Pastrami, Corned Beef, Garlic Cheddar, Gnar Gnar Kraut, Montana Girl Mustard *Named after #76 Alex Stepanovich from The Ohio State University 2002 National Champions"}
{"text":"Just started working in the area and have been twice so far. Awesome sandwiches and great, homemade soups. My favorite is the Rueben. It's big enough where I can eat half for lunch and save the rest for dinner, and only around $8. I've been eyeing their smokies and different cuts of meat to take home one night, they all look amazing. Each time I've been there the employees have been very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Real old fashion butcher shop. Everything we have gotten there has been very good. If in the area, give it a try!"}
{"text":"You cannot beat Jaworski's for first class meat. As their slogan says \"Meating your needs since 1935\". (gotta love a cute slogan!) they truly have the finest quality meat. We will not buy meat at the grocery store after shopping here and neither will you. Their prices are sometimes lower than the grocery store which makes it even better. (bone in ribeyes and strip steaks are $12.99  today.  Whole beef tenderloins are $16.99 a pound)  Their chicken breasts are huge - 2 of them are the size of a dinner plate! The staff are friendly and super helpful. They will cut anything to order for you. They also make sandwiches which are fabulous. Again made to order. They have a sandwich called the big chew (sopressata, prosciutto, salami and provalone) which has won awards for being so good.  I've never had it myself but lots of people order it when we're there."}
{"text":"What a joke. We read reviews and we got so excited to go here. We thought we would stop in and pick up some things to put on the grill for dinner. But that didn't happen. I understand the store was closing at 5pm today but we arrived at 4:30 and they had already removed ALL of the meat from the cases. Exactly how am I supposed to buy anything if A) I don't know what you have B) I can't see it?  This certainly isn't a way to get customers to come back. When a store carries their main products in display cases and empties those out before closing, it's definitely not beneficial to anyone who came in looking to buy. I'd rather travel farther to a store that caters to their customers than attempt to come back."}
{"text":"Great place! They have full deli service and will make you a sandwich, hot or cold, on the spot. Soups are also available. They also have a full butcher shop with quality steaks and chops. They are always packed at lunchtime by people getting a sandwich for lunch but the service is fast and friendly. A bit pricey but worth it, they make a great sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the only place I buy my meat.  It is always fresh and delicious!  The owner is very kind, he always says hello and asks how I am doing, and he always special orders for me when I request.  I frequently get there just before closing (sometimes a little after) and they always serve me, even opening the door for me after it is locked and they have put all of the meat away.  This establishment is family owned and operated and they all are very happy to help me and ask how I am doing.  I highly recommend you come in and make them your go-to place for meat!  Best chicken, best steak, best ribs, and their Jaworski Bayou Bam meat seasoning is AMAZING!  It's a delicious cajun seasoning and I go through a giant jar every few months because I put it on everything!  I call ahead and order sandwiches for my boyfriend and lot and he LOVES them all!  He says they are so delicious and have a lot of meat on them!  Thank you all for your great service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sandwiches and greatest people anywhere!  Why would you eat at a fast-food chain when you can get the personal attention and delicious sandwiches this family provides. Get a great value and support a hard-working local business!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great meat. Great people. Great for lunch. Cream of pickle soup. Sounds gross but is awesome."}
{"text":"Great selection, fast and friendly service. Especially love their gyro meat and breakfast sausage. The party platters make a great lunch option for a group. I always grab a smokie for myself on the way out, especially love the buffalo chicken. I appreciate their commitment to remain local and support other local businesses as well."}
{"text":"Pretty great place.  The lunch options in that area are very very limited.  But Jaworski's does a good job at raising the bar with some great options.  When you first walk in you will have navigate some obnoxious shelves full of old picked items and random packaged items.  That have probably been there since the shop first opened. These should just be removed to make room so you can actually see the true beauty of the shop.  Which is the butcher area all the action behind the counter.  Sandwiches are made to order.  They come in all kinds of shapes and sizes.  All kinds of goodness to be had any way you like it.  The staff is able to accommodate all your picky eating habits.  Just be prepared to shout across the room and have someone shout back from behind the counter.  They way any good deli should be in my opinion.    Oh.. and grab a number up front!!!!  Its organized chaos in there during the busy hours.  Those pesky racks!  No place to sit so its order and go.  If your working in one of the many offices nearby call in your orders around 10:30 or so and send over the grunt to pick them up.    The hell with Arbys.  Jaworski's HAS THE MEATS!  From 71 north just get off at 234 (Pear Road) and stay right past the car dealer and gas station.  About half a mile the right in the middle of a shopping center."}
