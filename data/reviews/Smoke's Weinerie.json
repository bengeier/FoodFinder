{"text":"Was studying downtown at U of T when we were pleasantly surprised to see that they had a Smoke's close by.   We frequent the Oshawa location and have always had great service and food.  We decided to get a poutine hot dog and snack size traditional poutine. While the staff were friendly and the poutine was ok, the hot dog was horrible. The hot dog tasted stale and there was barely any cheese on the hot dog. Not sure if it was an off order or not, but our experience with the food was poor.   Hopefully they fix the problem soon."}
{"text":"The food is great like any smoke's poutinerie! However, if you don't like your order being messed up, id suggest you take your business else where. I ordered the veggie nacho poutine under the vegetarian menu for my vegetarian girlfriend and I. To our surprise there was MEAT chilli on it, what a weird vegetarian topping!"}
{"text":"Their specialty does not come in snack size. WHY. I can't finish a regular.   I never really liked their poutine, their fries are really really soggy and I'm not even talking about when I get to the end (which has never been done by myself) but right when they serve it, my fries aren't crispy.   I also paid $10.15 for a regular size poutine... that tasted like cardboard. Soggy cardboard.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is much better at 4:00a (according to some locals). However, as a tourist visiting the Toronto area, the fact that \"poutineries\" is even a thing is amazing. I thought this place was really good. Definitely not a healthy choice, but delicious! Love the 80's rock theme too."}
{"text":"If you know me (or have at least looked at my Yelp profile) you'll know that my love of poutines borders on obsession, so I was excited when this place opened up near my work.  First the good: the place is big and clean - with plenty of seating - and the staff are warm, welcoming and friendly. So I really wanted to like this location.  But. This was my third time here since they opened and I don't know. I feel like they're pretty cheap with the gravy and the cheese - I mean, it's a poutine people - that's the whole point! And today, after taking my poutine away there was no gravy at all. After spending an embarrassingly long time googling whether my Perogy Poutine was supposed to have gravy (even though I know that's the way it comes at the other locations!) I'm not sure if I'll go back here. Time to let my poutine obsession take me elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place since I love smokes, however it was a disappointing visit to say the least.  The restaurant was dirty, no tables were clean so one of my friends asked for some cleaner and went and cleaned a table up.  My husband and I shared a regular poutine, and each got a premium hotdog, mine being a pulled pork. Our poutine was ready in mInutes but then they workers decided to make everyone elses order before making our dogs....  So 10 minutes later our dogs were done.  My hotdog was delicious, all beef with pulled pork, my poutine was also quite good, my husband was happy as well with his food. Unfortunately my friends not so much, One got the steamies, to which one was undercooked, one was false advertised. She was pretty upset and demanded a refund.  Lackluster service, dirty store, I probably won't be back.  1 1/2 out of 5"}
{"text":"Without question the worst poutine I've ever had. I tried the \"montreal\" which was poutine with smoked meat, mustard and a pickle.   My poutine was smothered in at least a half cup of mustard. It was so overpowering that I couldn't even taste what little gravy they gave me. The portion of smoked meat was also disappointing. No more than the shavings from a couple small thin pieces of flavorless smoked meat - like the scraps left on your plate after eating a smoked meat sandwich from Caplansky's. The fries were overcooked and very dry too.   The entire dish was so off putting that I actually tossed it in the trash after only a few bites.   All this magic in one box for a ridiculous $12 including a can of soda.   1 star for the quick service and the pickle which was pretty good once I stripped it of its mustard coating. the interior was clean and spacious too (and not surprisingly....empty).    Someone please, please tell me how this franchise keeps expanding let alone stay in business? Especially this location given all of the far superior options in the area."}
{"text":"After a horrible initial experience during their first week of operation, I finally decided to give them another chance 6 or so months later, but unfortunately, nothing much has changed. The food was edible enough (it's kinda hard to screw up steamed hot dogs), but the blatantly ridiculous part of the operation is a complete lack of employee training. During both visits, it seemed like the guys behind the counter were ripped directly from the customer line-up, with zero knowledge of the menu, or how to serve and prepare the steamies being offered. They seem to have greatly reduced the steamed hotdog options since opening, which is not surprising, since the guys dolling out the tube meat on my first visit had no clue what I ordered was even on their menu, leading to confused faces between the two gents before they checked every nook and cranny of their stations before finally putting two and two together. My second order was also a bit weird, with the guy at the cash being perplexed that I'd pay for a $3.75 order with a $10 bill, as if he had never made change before (\"you know it's only $3.75, right?\"). This was followed by his obviously freshly hired underling asking him how to properly fold the foil wrappers of the hotdogs when preparing my order, something one would assume would be covered in the first three minutes of training. He got neither of the two wrappers right btw, despite instructions being printed on them. Considering how perpetually empty the location is, I'm surprised it's lasted this long. Perhaps the other Smoke's locations are keeping it afloat? The visible increase of poutine on their menu (it now takes up 3/4 of the menu screens, as opposed to less than half at opening) indicates that they're smartly moving away from the clearly failing \"Weinerie\" concept. Maybe if they would have spent even 5 minutes training their staff, it wouldn't have been this sad."}
{"text":"by far the worst smokes location ive been to,  this place doubles as a smokes poutinerie and the weinerie in one grouping.  i had to clean the table today, so me and my friends could sit at a clean setting.  my s.o.'s steamies were lackluster, with one being falsely advertised, and the other being under-cooked. when we went back for a refund, we were met with an agressive attitude, to the point where the cashier slammed BOTH fists down on the counter, did a major sigh and requested her co-worker to come give the refund. to further the point, i emailed the franchise to let them know about this, and the manager called me a \"ms\"  unlike other smokes poutinerie, this location doesn't have a blackboard...which is a staple with other franchised outlets I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT AT THIS LOCATION AGAIN. if i could put negative stars, i would."}
