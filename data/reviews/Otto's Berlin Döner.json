{"text":"Had the chicken Doner and Currywurst. The Doner was packed with delicious toppings and the sauces tasted very fresh. Currywurst is a must try if you're not going to Germany soon."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that there was going to be a Berlin Doner shop in Toronto having spent my university years in Berlin, and becoming an addict of these at one point, that I had to try and relive those happy days in a way only good food can. 

I had the Lamb/Veal Doner, and enjoyed it! The ambiance and wall art was very cool as well, doner's and people watching are popular in Berlin too....however the price is steep. Doner's or Currywurst alone don't cost $9 CDN (after tax). The doner was good, but not any different (or better) than actual Berlin doner's that cost 2 to 4 ($3 to $6 CDN) at street vendors/fast food.

If you've never had currywurst or a doner, you should go and I hope you like it...but wait till pay day :)"}
{"text":"I had a small veal and lamb teller with house salad and garlic sauce, and a Spaten (beer). The portion is good enough for me. It's really simple but tastes great."}
{"text":"Great service and prices are reasonable.

Doners are authentic. 

They have a few German beers on tap."}
{"text":"Be sure to get the teller boxes - well presented, tasty sauces, excellent flavours."}
{"text":"This is not like a doner place you would find in Berlin, at all! I lived there all my life and had my fair share of doners, so here is how it goes: You walk into a place and the have all the ingredients and condiments at the front behind a glass pane. They toast the bread and ask you what you want inside. You look at the selection and then they stuff it with meat or feta cheese, lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, onions, red cabbage and if you're really lucky sometimes they have fried potatoes too. And then your out within minutes.
I have never seen a doner shop that is different. Except for this one. So they get one star for trying and if it was called \"Toronto style doner\" maybe I would have given another star or two. But their name is just a blatant lie and ruins the experience."}
{"text":"So 3 co-workers and I ordered Otto's on Grabb (new food ordering app) so that we could redeem a sweet $5 first order coupon and not have to wait in the usual lunch time rush line. We had 3 orders of half chicken+half halloumi and 1 order of half lamb/veal+half halloumi. 9 minutes later, we walked through Otto's door, our food was hot and ready and we were off on our way with no wait and no fuss. Upon our return to the office, we were very sad to see that 3 of the 4 orders did not contain the halloumie (that we paid the extra few dollars for and had been craving for oh... 3 weeks?). So we called the good people at Otto, they apologized profusely and asked where we were. The owner then PERSONALLY drove 3 orders of halloumie to our office. If that isn't customer service, then nothing is. Great food and even better service. Will definitely be added as a permanent fixture on our Friday lunch roster!"}
{"text":"The place is small but nice. I had doner almost everyday when I was in Europe last summer and have been trying to find a place that has great doner. It is not same as Europe but still good. I ordered the chicken doner with beer and it was satisfying. Price is reasonable and service was great!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best patio in Kensington! Yes it's sometimes busy, yes you'll have to wait a bit longer than your standard Shawarma joint, but the food is phenomenal and they have a great selection of beers to tide you over. Food is delicious, service is friendly, prices are reasonable and it has a great location, who would have thought you'd find such a place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"DELISH!  A friend Recommended this place to me saying its a MUST try. I was very impressed.  I recommend checking this place out to eat.  I got the Veal & Lamb Doner and a house salad.  YUM!"}
{"text":"its so crowded and so noisy. i literaly got headache yesterday night. they should warn people who yells(yeah people yelling inside)
one stars and thats for delicious food.
oh also stuff is not so friendly. just take the food for go. btw washroom is so dirty"}
{"text":"Pricing is decent and the Chicken Doner amongst other options are served in flat square shaped bread with great tasting garlic and tahini sauce. A great place to eat at Kensington market ."}
{"text":"Great donair authentic Turkish sold as German one. Small selection of german Beers. Paulaner is the best for me. You gotta go downstairs and use the washroom. You'll get back with a smile in your face for sure."}
{"text":"I really like the veal doner, but the price is too much. You could have two meals elsewhere for the same price of one sandwich here. Clearly overpriced for the quantity."}
{"text":"Update. Otto's apologized and reached out. They also fully credited my order! Updated my star rating to reflect this good service. I will try them again.


Not impressed. We ordered 2 boxes and both came without any sauce or feta (paid extra as well!). I get it that sh@t happens, but on both? To top it off I forwarded my Foodora receipt along with pics of what we got to Otto's email and never even got a response."}
{"text":"First time for me to try a German restaurant and I was not disappointed! 
The food is tasty, good portion, I ordered the veal and beef small teller. 
Friendly guys and the place is usually full."}
{"text":"A really great, cheap/moderately priced place to grab a bite to eat. I had the large chicken doner teller with fries and was suitably impressed. The sauces were fantastic and complemented the chicken and fries. Portion sizes were good and the atmosphere was great (kind of a hipster vibe, but a bit rougher around the edges). I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken doner and the halloumi teller. Both were so delicious and fresh. The meat was good quality as well as the veg/salad. Amazing food."}
{"text":"This is the best new place in Kensington Market by far! I've eaten there four times now and have nothing but good things to say about it. The currywurst is yummy, but my favourites are the doners. You get a large, triangular (no, it works, really) sandwich on delicious flatbread, packed with meat and the freshest salad ever. They have a veal & lamb variety which is so good, but if you're not in a meat mood you MUST try the halloumi doner. Perfectly grilled slightly salty & chewy halloumi, I could literally eat it every day it's that good. The service is fast and friendly, and they have a great selection of German beers on tap. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Well priced and very delicious donner!  I've been to Berlin and would definitely say these guys get it right! The place itself is pretty small. However we've never had a hard time finding a seat since most people eat and leave so by the time your food is ready you'll find a spot. Be advised its a fast food style restaurant."}
{"text":"I am turkish and this food is supposed to be turkish, and its a very successful version of our food I loved the taste too! The turkish bread is actually almost like the real one, I liked it very much."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I had the doner box and my goodness, it was so tasty. Was not expecting it to come in a box when I first ordered but I am glad it did because it is like a doner poutine. Absolute must try."}
{"text":"Went to Otto's today and although I wasn't 100% sold (hence my rating), there is a lot of potential for this place to be a 4/5 star rating.

The good things:
- the place is conveniently situated on one of the main streets in Kensington market
- clean and quirky restaurant with a nicely streamlined menu
- friendly service
- great-tasting chicken doner - the aoli sauce makes for a fantastic doner

The 'could be better' things:
- the place is small - you will be hard pressed getting a spot to sit on weekends and eating this doner 'on-the-go' is not ideal as they are big in size
- the amount of meat in our doner didn't do the $10 that we paid justice (more meat please!)

That said, because the taste was so good, we will be back to try it again.  :)"}
{"text":"After the comment I posted here the management got in touch right away asking for more details, and I felt I should elaborate on my original review, just to be fair.  So, here is why in my last visit with my husband I was very unhappy with the experience:
1) the table we managed to get was not clean. 
2) we received the order in take-away package, even though we had said we'd dine in. We reminded them again and were told that they had ran out of service plates. The staff member we talked to was quite unfriendly and seemed bothered by our question.
3) I ordered the chicken teller box. The box had the couscous and the chicken, but the salad was missing (differently from what shown in their website). The couscous was just too watery and did not taste good. The chicken, however, was ok.

Overall, I felt the food and service was not decent value for the price charged. I left hungry and disappointed, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Not very similar to what I've had in Germany but delicious. Fantastic Belgian beers. Great atmosphere, very minimalist and easy going.  Great music. Friendly staff. Recommend."}
{"text":"EDIT: the owner reached out personally to rectify the situation. much respect to him for doing so. 

Had the Teller box tonight for the second time. Honestly - the food is quite good. Problem was that there was some black plastic bits strewn throughout the salad making it essentially inedible. I called the restaurant to inform them but received some weird nonchalant response that did not satisfy the gravity of the complaint. I can't help but feel that some reparation should have been offered or at least some kind of apology. No dice. 
Feeling like maybe this place needs to raise their standards in food safety and customer service."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood.

We got a Doner (Veal and Lamb) and a Small Currywurst with fries. 
My friend had the Chicken Teller also. 

I thought the Chicken was a better flavour than the Veal/Lamb but both were good.
Currywurst won the day - it was so good!
All were large portions and really tasty. 

Service was quick even though it was quiet busy. 
Looking forward to warmer weather and eating on the patio!"}
{"text":"So, we had a great meal at Ottos Berlin Döner. It was very delicious and the ingredients were fresh and top notch. I had the veggie Döner and I enjoyed it a lot. All of that being said, it's not what I expected. I am German and was looking for an authentic Döner (I have been craving some of my favourite German foods), and this wasn't quite it. It was delicious and the place was great, but it was a Canadian döner."}
{"text":"Yeah these guys have just about nailed the Turkish/German doner that I have had wayy too many times when I lived in Germany.
Not the best Ive had but a nice addition to the city."}
{"text":"My first visit was disappointing---see below for my description of the dirt meat. I stand by that account, but it is possible that the kitchen has ironed out the kinks, or that I was there on an off night. 

It seems appropriate to mention that the owner of the business got in touch with me and he seemed genuinely concerned with ensuring the quality of their food. He offered to comp a return visit, which I declined, though I appreciated the gesture. 

This time the meat was juicy as heck, and while it didn't reach the heights of the best I've had in Berlin, this was both an excellent sandwich (in its own right) and a real berlin doner. I'll be back to try the currywurst. Thoughtful selection of beer and presence of prime mate a plus."}
{"text":"Enough can't be said how good this stuff is, I've travelled Europe and this Is THE definition of European street meat done classy. You can't go wrong any time of day with a kebab. Grab a beer and have your taste buds be treated!"}
{"text":"Cute place, good food, large portions, and decent prices. What more do you need?

The donair is great - similar to Greek gyro in terms of content (shredded meat, yogurt based sauce, fries, and some shredded veggie wrapped in a flat bread) but a unique taste. It's messy, so maybe don't make it your first date, but delicious!

The donair box is great for sharing or if you're on the go - a bed of fries topped with donair meat and a bit of shredded veggies (onions and cabbage). I personally would have like a bit more of the veg, but it's a meat lover paradise. 

Service is fairly fast, but seating is minimal, especially if you're going in colder weather - probably need to consider doing takeout instead once patio season is over."}
{"text":"Amazing delicious doner. Even their vegetarian one is full of flavour, which is my go to. Definitely go for that haloumi cheese, and cheese fries too! Love this place and their food. 

(Bonus Tip: Press the button on the wall in their bathrooms downstairs for a solo party)"}
{"text":"Great look and solid concept - which inevitably makes the food taste better. Not much has to be said. The doner box is what you must take. I made the mistake of ordering fries the first time (which made it unnecessarily heavy to digest - too much oil). Take the salad instead, with a mix of their 3 sauces. 

Hmm. Washroom downstairs. Push the button for a sexy time."}
{"text":"At Otto's you get a very tasty snack for very tasty price and you can dance off the additional weight in bathroom (just press the button when in there). 

They could stay open till later, but it is okay anyway. And big plus for authentic german and belgium beers!

{"text":"For Canadian standards its okay, but for German Standards it's not good. Please don't compare your Doner and Currywurst to Germany!"}
{"text":"*** This is a rating for 2.5 stars ***

I had the lamb and veal döner while my fiancé had the chicken. We originally wanted one combo between the two of us, but at prime dinner time (6:30pm) they had NO FRIES and had no idea how long it would take to make a few batch. I understand that it's still in the opening week, but still... really? The overall taste of my döner was there, I had gotten 2/3 sauces (garlic and yogurt) and thought it was quite tasty. My fiancé felt like both his bread and chicken were overdone as it was chewy and rubbery. (He had gotten the hot sauce and garlic sauce which added a nice flavour.) Pricing was alright, perhaps a bit steep, but it's not enough food for dinner. Overall, the service was very slow since they're still getting the hang of things. I personally wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"A döner. 
A techno washroom
A tasty yoghurt
A chewy lamb
A curated beer selection

Ist est gut

I am giving 4 stars just because the veal lamb döner was chewy and cold. However the rest of the meal was fantastic. I am coming back for sure. More places like this in Toronto please."}
{"text":"Small but really nice atmosphere. Big portions and delicious food. I'd highly recommend getting the haloumi sticks! Staff were quite nice as well.

I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! The chicken sandwiches are absolutely amazing!!

Do yourself a favor and try it!"}
{"text":"If you're ever in the Kensington Market area of Toronto and looking for a place to eat, I recommend checking out Otto's Berlin Doner. It's a small German-owned restaurant that serves delicious Doner Wraps and Doner Teller Plates. This place is amazing! The staff are very friendly too!

The Doner Wraps are $8.95+tax which comes with choice of Meat, Filling, and Sauce. Meat choices include: Chicken; Veal & Lamb; Halloumi (Cheese); Gemuse (Vegetables); Chicken & Gemuse; Chicken & Halloumi; Gemuse & Halloumi; Veal, Lamb & Chicken; Veal, Lamb & Halloumi; and Veal, Lamb & Gemuse. You can fill your wrap with Feta and Fries for $0.50 each. Choice of Sauces are: Garlic Aoli, Yogurt Herb, and Hot Sauce.

The Doner Teller Plates are $6.95+tax (Small) and $9.95+tax (Large). You can choose Meat, 2 Sides, and Sauce. The Meat options are the same as the Doner Wraps. The Side options are: Fries, House Salad, and Couscous Salad (extra $1 for Couscous Salad). Sauce options are the same as the Doner Wraps.

I personally ordered a Large Doner Teller Plate with Chicken, Fries, and Couscous Salad. It was delicious! The quantity of each item in the take-out container box was balanced. 

This restaurant is one of those rare gems you stumble upon while exploring the Kensington Market area of Toronto. I plan to return to this place since it's now one of my top favourite restaurants in Toronto! I highly recommend trying this place if you haven't yet.

Otto's Berlin Doner is also in collaboration with Grabb so if you ever want to order take-out from your phone, don't hesitate to use the Grabb App!"}
{"text":"Fantastic eatery in a great neighborhood. This place is a gem in the Kensington market (which has a reputation of having lots of amazing places; makes a perfect destination for a food crawl). There is nothing I don't love about Otto's. 
Great food; great beer selection to wash it all down; fresh ingredients; very reasonable prices. Sign me up.

I had a Chicken Doner. It was sumptuous, tasty and fresh. The have a patio too to do some people watching while you enjoy what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today. Place is really really chill. Lovin the mellow tunes they play in the background for the patrons. Ordered the chicken doner with garlic aoili. For me it was a little on the salty side which is weird because I do like my salt. It was pretty good though other then that. Best way to describe this doner is like if you put together MeVaMe ingredients into a panini. Would def come here before I go to MeVaMe me though. Chill vibes."}
{"text":"I have never tried a Doner before, but boy was it good. The bread was not to thin and had the perfect crunch with a softer inside. The fries were a great addition to the vegetables in the inside, and the sauce was really good. For a first time experiencing this, my mouth still waters thinking about the dish, and I will definitely visit again next time I have the chance."}
{"text":"Nice place to come and sit on a sunny autumn afternoon. And the food...the food was so tasty. I had the chicken in a box with salad and fries, hot sauce, yogurt and feta. Sounds like one big mess. And it was. But it was a delcious mess. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here because I've missed döner ever since I moved back from Europe. 

1) They are O.K. Nowhere near as good as what I had access to in any number of European cities. Somewhat underwhelming. If you REALLY want a döner, it seems to be your only option in Toronto... but otherwise, take a pass.
2)They are overpriced. It's typical Toronto-trendy-inflation, but when I'm paying 60%+ more than what I paid in Europe (accounting for exchange), and it's a lower quality, I just can't convince myself it makes sense."}
{"text":"Solid. Love the decor, German heavy beer list, and high quality food. Only thing that kept this from being 5 stars was the service. A bit slow and forgetful but friendly when you got attention. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"GET THE HALLOUMI TELLER BOX. 
Yes this is a döner joint, but the best thing here BY FAR is the halloumi (fried cheese).

Get it on half couscous, half fries. Their fries are incredible - they taste like curly fries and soak up the sauces perfectly. The couscous is great and makes you feel less bad about eating fries and fried cheese. Every forkful of fries smothered in couscous and sauce with a bite of halloumi is AMAZING. 

I've had this three times this week and I can't stop.

The döner is good too but seriously tho the halloumi"}
{"text":"We had the currywurst and the lamb veal box with a side bread. It was alright I guess, but nothing spectacular. The currywurst is a sausage on a bed of fries (or salad, or or couscous) with curry on top. The fries were kinda soggy, really thin cut. The donner bread was good but the meat was mediocre. Kinda oily and didn't taste like much (I could only taste the rosemary).

The bill came to $30 after tax and tip. It was a \"meh\" experience, and we probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Great food, great beer, and a party in the bathroom... Perfect night out!

I've gone 4 times in the first two months of this unique joint and can't wait for #5. 

The Doners are flavorful with great spices and a nice thick bread. Beats a shawarma any day of the week!

The beer is the perfect compliment to the german style meal and experience. Love how I can get a quick bite and brew in a fantastic neighbourhood at any time of day. 

Oh... If you need a pick me up - check out the bathroom. Hit the button!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very good! We got a döner and a döner teller with chicken and a couple of beers. Everything was really good and just the right amount of spicy. Definitely would love to come back here again. 

Make sure you make a trip to the restrooms as well and don't be afraid to push the big button ;)"}
{"text":"Beef Doner - Greasy, didn't feel fresh. Smelt like burnt leftovers.

Fries - Thin, burnt, were served with BARE hands. That's B.A.R.E. hands. 

Fehlen!"}
{"text":"I have been craving German street food doners for awhile and have finally found a place to get it!

The chicken doner with all the toppings and sauces was delicious and very filling! There was plenty of perfectly seasoned chicken. It was kind of difficult to eat however so get the Teller box if you're looking for something less messy.

Minimalist design inside the restaurant. Order at the till and seat yourself. Will come back and pair the food with some of their numerous German beers!"}
{"text":"The chemistry is perfect here. Stuck in a sketchy location in Kensington on Augusta Ave. up near College, Otto's has a unique take on the classic middle eastern sandwich. Couple that with some serious German-style efficiency and organization, and BEER, now any doubts about their competency disappears as you walk through the doorway.
Teutonic perfection demonstrated here is clearly the balance of ingredients in the sandwich and how it is plated. The relationship between the veggies, the meat, and the bread is what I like, and to wash down that with a tasty Belgian beer on TAP yet, well this is what turns my crank! I'll be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overseasoned gristle. Avoid. Plus their bread has no Sesame seeds and is more of a messy wrap than a sandwich. 

I've lived in Europe and know real doners. This is not one. 

Much better Shawarma in the city. As far as doners go, this was very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Most authentic tasting Döner Kebab I tasted so far in Canada :) The currywrust was delicious too but not made with the same kind of sausage as in Berlin. 

-And they ran out of fries o.O who runs out of fries in the middle of the afternoon????"}
{"text":"Bomb kebab and currywurst - everything tasted better than authentic street style.  The meat was delicious and the fillings fresh. Great selection of drinks too, fine German beers and Club Mate. Don't forget to use the WC before you go, zat's vhere ze pawty's at, ja! Prost!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for a quick bite, and it's definitely one of the best restaurants I've tried in Kensington. The service was friendly and staff were quick. More importantly, the food was delicious! I tried the chicken doner ($9.50 + tax) and was blown away at how fresh and savory it tasted. The chicken was grilled to absolute perfection, and the sauces provided just the right amount of flavor. For a health conscious person like myself, this was a great cheat meal because it's essentially a salad with three sauces in a bread. My friend ate most of the bread and said she has never had that kind of bread before. The portion size was great and very filling - I ate it around 4:30 PM and haven't needed an evening snack."}
{"text":"Great food. Definitely recommended! Loved the lamb currywurst sausage and the fries...the doner teller boxes are also pretty good...!"}
{"text":"I work right by Kensington and decided to venture to Otto's after a few co-workers gave me food envy the day before.  Ordered the Chicken Teller Box with salad, fries and a combo of all the sauces.  Flavorful, fresh and indulgent.  You could probably go healthier without the fries but it was a lovely addition. Would definitely go back, maybe on a less humid day."}
{"text":"Pretty similar quality to what you'd get in Berlin (imo), although at a higher price. 

Ordered the lamb/ veal doner teller (on fries). I really liked the combo of flavors. The meat and fries were both tasty. Thought  it was fairly good value too, as the portion size is quite filling. I would've preferred to pay a little more to get more meat... need to check if thats an option next time. 

Also tried my wife's doner sandwich, which was tasty as well. 

They sell the matte drink thats pretty popular in the clubs in Berlin. 

I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"This place has wicked fries. 
I've gotten the döner delivered before and that was a BAD idea because the bread was as hard as a rock by the time it arrived, yet soggy in all the wrong places. 
I've gotten the teller a couple of times too. 
Most recently was last night. I ordered two large with two sides of fries. The boxes each weighed maybe 6lbs each- and contained no veg except for onion. No veg. None. That was disappointing. And the sides of fries for almost $4 each was half a cup of fries. Yummy yummy fries. The containers were only half full. They even put the garlic aioli I'd ordered extra in the cup of fries and it still wasn't full. 
I feel a little scammed about the fries, and super sad about the no veg. 
I know I could love this place, but I don't feel like I've had equal experiences to other people's. I feel a little jealous I wasn't more satisfied. 
I might be back, I might look for something more consistent."}
{"text":"Really tasty. We got the chicken/veal/lamb teller and chicken shawarma and both were great. I think we preferred the chicken over the other meats tho.

Fries were really nice too and I liked the bread they used for the shawarma."}
{"text":"This place is great. came on a lovely day and was able to sit on the patio facing kensington market. It's a great place to come for a pint and sausage of any kind. They  offer veal and other meats for sausage items. It includes sides of salad or fries or both. It's a great deal and I'll definitely be back! They have limited beer choices on tap but it ranges from light to medium brews."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is delightful. It was quite busy in this small restaurant on Wednesday night. Ordered their chicken box (teller) with salad... which was refreshing. I'd come back to try their currywurst. That looked pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm horrified by the \"expertise\" on Döner a few commentators are sharing here. Especially Melissa F. (1/17/2016). No offense but what you described is actually a nightmare of a Döner.

Yes, you're absolutely right about the bread.
Yes, it is too expensive.
No, vegetables in a Kebab should NEVER be pickled. There's not a single top Kebab stall in Berlin putting pickled stuff into the bread. Some of them sometimes use salt or a special spice blend as a finish on top of the Döner but that's it.
No, a Döner shouldn't be drenched in sauce. That's like ordering an expensive steak and drowning it in ketchup. The sauce is meant to supplement the taste of the meat and vegetables and to improve the overall texture. It should only be a thin but noticable layer of sauce directly on the bread. Too much sauce is always an indicator that the taste and quality of the Kebab is not very good.  
No, a good Döner doesn't necessarily have plenty of meat. Actually, too much meat is just as bad as too much sauce. The secret of a good Kebab is the balance between all its ingredients. 50% meat is the absolute maximum. Otherwise the taste of the usually strongly seasoned meat becomes way too dominant.

Of course, everyone has a different taste and if you like your Döner the way you described it then that can't be changed. But pls never ever tell anyone again that this is how an authentic Döner should be like. It's just not true and I'd even say it's an insult to everyone in Berlin who's really committed to deliver the best possible Döner experience on a daily basis. Otto's Berlin Döner is way closer to that. Four stars (three if it was in Berlin)."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try this place. Order the doner, half chicken and half halloumi. It's literally of of the tastiest and freshest sandwiches I've ever had.  One time they had no bread, so I had the box meal. It is good, but I really prefer the pita style doner."}
{"text":"Hallo. 

I'm here to chat about Otto's after experiencing ze CURRYWURST last week. The new spot in Kensington offers amped up German fast food and beverages. (And by the way, did you know that there's an actual Currywurst museum in Berlin?) 
 
I appreciate that they use quality Olliffe butcher meat for their sausages. I ordered the bratwurst and fries. The house-made sauces were voll tasty: a not too thick garlic sauce and a more viscous tomato curry sauce. I liked the added onion and cabbage garnish and it made me want to do half-salad, half fries (or couscous) for next time. I got takeaway and my eats were thoughtfully packaged. Super sweet owners too.

I could live on the PRIME MATE that they sell (they also have the bigger and more well-known Club Mate). This is a Montreal-based carbonated yerba mate drink that I knew about when it was a Kickstarter campaign, but hadn't actually tried until Otto's. It's close to perfect. Refreshing, not too sweet, plus it's not bad for you either. My dear coconut water should be very, very afraid. I had heard that everyone in Uruguay walks around with Yerba Mate in thermoses. I get it now.

As a bonus, the Prime Mate packaging is pretty and blends in well with Otto's cute 'n clean design touches. Speaking of which, does the Simpsons yellow theme and rounded figures remind you of a particular Ottoman(n)?

I'm going back to try the D'oh!-ners and beers on the patio. I also need to experience a SOLO DANCE PARTY in the bathrooms. I don't recall this kind of buzz about a bathroom since L'Avenue or Mozza in Montreal. 

Their summer hours are laid back as hell. You can grab a quick lunch; spend a lingering afternoon with some drinks; get dinner; snack and drink something pre-party or post-work; or enjoy some late night eats. 

*:??*I Want To Thank You *:??*

Update: went back for those beers and bathrooms. Excellent. As for the doners, they were fresh tasting and loved that speciality bread. A bit more meat and more evenly distributed sauce would be ideal (last few bites were the best ones), but overall this spot is fun!"}
{"text":"Small, but packs a punch!! It's a German styled street food restaurant specializing is sandwiches and beer. 

The Doner is like a Greek Gyro, it contains think, juicy slices of spit-roasted, chicken, veal or lamb. You can order them on a pita or in a box. The meat is tossed with fresh tomato, crunchy iceberg lettuce and red cabbage, then doused with a spicy, garlicky yogurt sauce. If you like spicy foods, ask for the hot sauce. It's a slow burning, I believe cumin based. 

They also have a halloumi Doner, which is a fried salty cheese w/ feta in a pita or box, and their currywurst and fries. 

On tap or bottles, you can find nine German brews, including a Schwarzbier. 

It's a great cheap eat in Kensington!"}
{"text":"I came here a few minutes before closing, though it was more than half full. Most of the menu items were unavailable, so I ordered the chicken doner.

Very good flavours in it, and a nice bread, but I found the way it was wrapped and the extra work involved took away from it a bit. The way in which it's wrapped is similar to the east coast doner, where the bread barely even makes it around, so you have to carefully peel the wrapper back on each bite. Even then, you're doing a non-stop balancing act and food still falls out and you may resort using a fork. I think food fell on my shirt in spite of my best efforts.

I'm sure it's probably tradition and not a fault of the preparation, but it's just not my preference. I'd still be happy to come back however as the taste was there, but hopefully a platter is available next time.

Good beer on tap."}
{"text":"Situated in Kensington market it's a prime place to be especially in the summer. I went last week for dinner with some friends surprised how pricey it is. I understand it's downtown but for the portion and the taste certainly found it a bit overpriced. 

Otto has a self serve system where you pay and wait for your order. Seats are limited but they do open up the patio. I got the chicken bowl doner. Its pretty typical sauce salad chicken. Honestly not much to write home about it was 12 for a small bowl. I was disappointed but the food did taste good again not very unique you can get this type of food for bigger portion elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a tough one- it's definitely not authentic to the Donair kebab (developed in Berlin by Turkish migrants who tweaked the donair recipe to suit German tastes). But it's definitely a more healthy version and some would argue a better version because it's more healthy.

Differences:
-The triangular bread is the right shape but not the right consistency. It's had more of a thin crust pizza dough kind of thing going on instead of a flatbread type consistency. Again, it's not the same but it's not a terrible version.
-The veggies are plentiful and there isn't particularly any seasoning on them. I believe most donair kebabs will have pickled veggies and/or sumac. This lack of this kind of \"sour\" taste really changes this into a more mediocre mainstreamed flavour.
-The sauces are ok, but certainly not enough. A donair kebab should be almost drenched in fatty delicious sauce. Or the free-option to do so must exist.
-The meat was dry, and not enough. Donair kebabs should have PLENTY of meat throughout, not just a thin spread of dry chicken and then a ton of unseasoned vegetables on top.
-$10 is STEEP for something that is a couple euro on the streets of Berlin. It's a unique offering for toronto, but not $10 unique.  These should be priced at 7-8$ tax included.
-They are a lot bigger than the regular donair kebabs but it's less food because there's just so much air space, spaces for lettuce veg. The real donair kebabs are piles of meat with some veggies drowning in the meat sauce.

Notes of the \"meh\" variety:
-The beer selection seems to be very German. But I don't like german beers (too light, not enough malt for me) so I didn't order any.
-Club Mate-check.
-Music was too loud and too much pop. 
-I see a lot of people have reviewed the service. Meh. this, if anything is more German than anything here. They aren't rude but they certainly aren't North-American eager.
-Some reviewers are commenting how the owner is German. The owners are NOT german. Just fans of the party scene.

The good:
I like the layout and vibe of the space and, of course, the bathrooms are fun.

Final verdict? 
It's not a bad place IF you have no idea what the original donair kebab/kebap tastes like and you want an idea. And it's also not a bad place if you have Berlin nostalgia but you want a healthier version of the food. But it IS a place that's not quite good enough/worth it if you are looking for a replica of the delicious, fatty, saucy fusion food you ate a couple times a day in between parties in Berlin.
I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"I was wondering why my brother and his gf were so insistent that I not buy pub food where we were having drinks and wait till after to get a doner at Otto's. I got a Chicken and Halloumi (mixed) doner. Both the chicken and Halloumi were good, I couldn't say which was better, I'm glad they let me put both into one. It's yummy. 
Be sure to go to the washroom and press the button! What a treat (I won't spoil the surprise for you, though!)"}
{"text":"The doner sandwiches here are very tasty and they provide a filling and balanced meal. They are stacked with your choice of meat, plenty of vegetables and the sauces of your choice. Their sauces are really good, the yogurt sauce is mild and creamy and the garlic aioli sauce is rich and spicy. I usually do without the garlic aioli sauce because I find it a bit too hot for my taste. I've never had a bad meal in here."}
{"text":"I had the Lamb and Beef Döner it is actually pretty amazing really flavourful just make you have a bunch of napkins because it can get messy. Finally a great Döner spot in the city if you haven't tried it I would pop in and get the lamb and beef Döner $10.25 super tasty. Beers are around $7.25 if you want a quick drink."}
{"text":"Solo bathroom dance parties. Say whaaaat? Definitely check out the bathroom while you're here. So amusing. Except the music only lasts a few seconds. I'd be just getting into my dance moves, and then the music would stop and I'd have to press that big red button again!

Anyways, onto the food. Be prepared to wait a bit for your food. I think I waited 10-15 minutes after I ordered. But, when I did get my food, it was yums! I got the veal and lamb doner, with yogurt and garlic sauce, and the hot sauce and curry ketchup on the side. I enjoyed the crunchy pita, and liked how the doner didn't taste overly salty. Only thing was that it had so much sauce. Next time I'll probably ask for yogurt and hot sauce (light spread), and the garlic sauce seperately. 

Enjoyed my experience here overall! Came out to about $10 for the doner (incl tax and tip), and it was pretty filling."}
{"text":"Tasty döner and good value for price. The place is small; more of a lunch spot or place to grab takeout from. Staff are friendly!"}
{"text":"Really good donors. The donor is served in a box which I did not like. The food is high quality but really oily. I chose fries as the side, it is actually your choice of donor over a bed of home made style fries. I have tried chicken sandwich which is exactly the same as the donor but as a sandwich, they put the fries in the sandwich that was not appealing. The space is a bit small in winter, it has a patio in sumer which makes it bigger. Small chairs and tables, nice for two people not a crowd of friends. Overall it is recommended."}
{"text":"It tastes as good as in Germany pretty much, but we all know that it's actually Turkish food. It takes a while to get your order prepared, but that's okay. I think that'd be great to serve ayran with the food as well."}
{"text":"Delicious döner - even my non bread loving friend was loving it. There are a few options for sauce: spicy, yogurt, and garlic (?). You can ask for all three! The spicy sauce is on the really spicy side, not for the occasional spicy fan. But if you are indeed a spicy lover, you're in for a treat.

Also got the weisswurst currywurst, the sauce is currilicious! It comes with a choice of salad or fries, and again, you can ask for half of each. The salad was fresh and well seasoned, and the fries were skinny and on point. The currywurst sauce is divine. It goes surprising well with the meal. Overall it's the winner of the night.

There are beer on tap as well and it comes in a big mug. 

One big downer is that the portion is on the small side, I was still hungry after and so was my friend. But guess what - you are in kensington, there're a few places for desert (millie crepe) and or a beer after. Make it a kensington day, my friend!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and well priced, plus huge portions. The staff was friendly. The place has a trendy ambiance. And if you go, make sure to check out the bathroom (definitely an odd thing to say, but you probably won't be disappointed)."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest, ever since I lived in Germany years ago, to find true doner kebap.  Without going back to Germany that is. Otto's Berlin doner is as close as I've gotten. And it's absolutely delicious. 

But it's still not my perfect doner. 

Here's what they get right: First, the meat. The chicken has the right flavor and texture. It has crispy edges and moist interior. Second, the sauces. It has both the requisite white and red sauce, which is often where other attempts flounder and fail. 

The biggest problem for me is that the raw veggies lack any seasoning. The best doner I had in Germany always had more pickled veggies. That type added an extra kick of flavor that plain raw veggies lack. 

Finally, the bread. It's hard for me to opine on this. It was tasty and worked really well. But it was different than my personal ideal doner. Then again, I ate my doner in a different part of Germany, and I expect that regional variation accounts for the difference. 

If you've been craving doner, otto's will help you get your fix. And if you've heard people rave about doner for years after return from a visit to Germany, you'll start to understand finally what all of the fuss is about."}
{"text":"This place is oozing contemporary charm. It's got the neon lighting and the clean gray and white and wood throughout the establishment. The staff are super friendly and helpful. The patio is small but inviting and the interior is equally as relaxing, especially with the window opened up.

We popped by for a quick snack. As we were looking for something small, we got the Chicken Teller to share. It's like a German Poutine? We got half fries and half garden salad, as well as all the sauces (youghurt, hot sauce and x).

I found the food to be a bit too salty for my liking, but I can see the appeal, especially paired with after work drinks.
I would go back to try more of the food out.

One more thing to check out: the washrooms! They've got disco washrooms, definitely a fun perk!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the great reviews that this place has. It's another place that Yelpers speak highly of but my experience doesn't reflect that.
I came, with my daughter, for lunch today. I've missed eating any type of doner, since moving to Canada. Doner meat to me, is juicy and well seasoned. The meats here are dry, under seasoned and cut into tiny bits. We ordered the small chicken teller and the veal/beef teller too. We ordered them both with salad and all the sauces. The reason why you need all the sauces is because the meats are tasteless. The serving size is also laughable, it's a side salad size but at a main salad price. Meat was very skimpy. We also got a small Currywurst with fries. The fries are crunchy, in small bits and  salty. The bratwurst was quite good but again, it had so much sauce on it, you couldn't really taste the sausage itself.
I'd return for the Currywurst but with less sauce but I wouldn't recommend the teller boxes. For the price, quality and size, they aren't worth it. My quest for good doner meat, in Toronto, continues."}
{"text":"Good ingredients, hipster scene, etc. but not close to Berlin authentic. Too much bread. Why no pita pocket?"}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC, I had only 3 days in Toronto and heard Kensington Market was the place to be to look for a variety of foods. What drew me to Otto's was its excellent beer selection but its halloumi doner is my reason to go back.

The deep fried halloumi doner was AMAZING. It was extremely filling and priced very well. The seasoning was perfect and paired with beer = heavenly. Make sure you find a table out on the patio! Before you leave, stop by the bathroom and push the button on the wall for a surprise!!"}
{"text":"Taste great while fresh. Don't let the fries sit too long. Small, but tables always available."}
{"text":"This sandwiche bar is amazing! The set-up is beautiful. Service is fast and friendly. The patio is clean and has an open concept where you can see into the restaurant. With limited space they've managed to really open it up! Forget how this place looks! THE FOOODDDDD. Omg!

I thoroughly enjoyed my doner served with a side of fries and a good ol' pub style beer. 

I visited during a weekend afternoon but they are open pretty late some nights!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for awhile and since I was in the Kensington area, today was the day.
Ordered the chicken teller (9.50 for a small) fries, with all three sauces on top! 
I would give this place a 3.5/5. The meal was overall good. But I feel like I would definitely need to try more options on the menu to give a better overall rating of this establishment. 
The atmosphere was awesome, and the decor makes the place very hip. It was pretty busy but we managed to get a table. It's small in size but pretty good use of space especially with the patio open."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try them, so decided to order delivery with doordash. After almost 2 hours of wait and no for or updates from the restaurant I contacted doordash's support only to find out that the restaurant didn't make the order because they were out of sausages. Being out of something is fine, but what's not fine is caring so little about customers and not let them so they do not wait for hours."}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars- the food was decent, but nothing extraordinary, though I would say the spicy sausage is worth getting on the side."}
{"text":"This place is worthy of a five star only if the meat tasted a tad bit better. So yesterday it's a beautiful afternoon in Toronto where we had a perfectly cloudy day with little bit of drizzle here and there.

It was my day at the Kensington market and I wanted to eat and explore. I had also promised that I would try some new places apart  from my regular joints  and Otto's had been on my list for a very long time.

So basically this is middle eastern food which is Canadian-zed wonderfully.This place is tucked in the adventurous street Augusta.The decor is minimalistic with a great patio at the entrance.A visit to their bathrooms are a must-DON'T FORGET TO PRESS THE BUTTON IN THEM.

So coming down the food.I loved loved their idea of serving donars on this thin split open bread which kind of reminds me of an Afghan sangak unlike in a plain old pita.I chose the veal and lamb donar, for me the sandwich was just perfect with all its generous toppings and sauces but I felt the meat lacked flavor and was too thinly sliced.Maybe next time I shall try another meat.The highlight to my meal were their fries, almost tasted like homemade fries-they weren't overly crispy but were very flavorful.

They have a decent selection of alcoholic beverages as well as non alcoholic.I like the option of free water.

The service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on opening night.  Had a nice patio spot with our dog on the outside.  The owner came out to speak with us. Also got us a cup of water for our dog.

We got the Chicken and the Veal/Lamb doner.  Both were good.  However, I would say that they could increase the amount of meat/ingredients on the inside.  There were definitely more bites of bread.  I'd also recommend adding a bit more sauce.

Definitely check out both bathrooms (in the basement).  The one was still under a bit of construction, but press the button down there.  Interesting experience for sure!"}
{"text":"Negative stars to this establishment of that were possible. First, wait time is 40 minutes for a basic chicken doner. Second, there is no orderly process for serving customers - i.e. Just because you arrive before someone (or 15 people in the case of some of the customers that were waiting with us), you can be served after them despite the fact that there is no complexity to anything on the menu that should cause this. It's chicken, raw vegetables and pre-made doner sauce in a pita. Third, staff are extremely rude. One male member of the crew began passive aggressively asking customers to please \"own up\" to leaving trash on the tables...which was impossible since none of the remaining customers in the location had been served any of our food...? A suggestion to the staff - when you are overwhelmed (or, we suspect they were under the influence of drinks and/or drugs and therefore compromised in their ability to serve anyone), be nice to customers and manage their expectations. Please do not take your anger out on us. Finally, the doner was highly underwhelming. Dry chicken, little to no sauce and 'blah' flavor. $7.45 better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Perhaps I just don't know what a good doner is. We came about 3:30pm/4:00pm yesterday, and they were out of bread. We ended up getting a veal/lamb teller and a side of halloumi sticks/fries. We also got the salad option with our teller. Did we order wrong? I don't know what traditional doner is supposed to be done with. I don't know whether it was poor mixing or whatnot, but the bites I had were mostly salad, and not much meat. It was good salad, but I didn't pay for salad. The halloumi was also really salty.

Highlight of this place was that we were seated at one of the four people tables closest to the ordering counter and under the bench along the wall, there was a heater. It felt like the seat warmer in cars. It was lovely on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"Based on the good Yelp reviews, I went to Otto's Berlin Döner in Kensington Market this past weekend. The restaurant is fairly small, a half-dozen tables with stools, and a small counter near the back. There is a mural on one wall; not sure what it represents, but there was a building with palatial gates in front and a pair of hands and geometrical shapes around it? There was music playing, and most tables were occupied with people talking, so it was a bit loud for such a small space. There is no wait service, instead there is an order counter at the back with the menu on screens above.

The food choices are a doner (sandwich), doner teller (meal in a box), or currywurst (sausage with curry ketchup). I ordered a small veal and lamb teller with couscous as my side, which was $1 extra over fries or salad. At first, I thought the box seemed a bit small for the price, but it was packed full, and the meal was fairly filling. The bottom half was couscous with pieces of red pepper, then the shredded meat with cabbage and onions, then 3 sauces on top - garlic, hot, yogurt. The only drawback was that the couscous was not hot, but otherwise every thing was delicious and just a little spicy with the sauces. They also serve some beer and wine, so I had a Brickworks Cider. My total came to $21; the doners and small boxes are $9-10, add $3 for the large boxes. Overall, a nice treat if you're looking for this specific meal. I will probably return at least to try the currywurst."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great simple eats for reasonable prices, you have to try Otto's Berlin Doner. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. 

The menu is simple: choose between doner (sandwich), teller (box), or wurst (sausage). For doner or teller,  have a choice between chicken, lamb and beef, halloumi cheese, or another vegetarian option. You can get teller and wurst options on your choice of fries, salad, or couscous ($1 extra). Then you choose which sauces you like - garlic aioli, yogurt sauce, and hot sauce (or all 3), and can even ask for sauce on the side. 

I have tasted the lamb and beef, the chicken and halloumi and all were amazing. The meats have this satisfying juiciness yet also have a great crust on the meat that adds a nice contrast of texture and flavour. I love the teller box because it gives me a gluten-reduced option, and the red wine vinegar dressing on the  salad has such brightness of flavour that I often have cravings for it. The bread that comes with the doner has nice grill marks on it but a fluffy soft interior. Many people enjoy the sandwich option but be warned that it can be quite messy!

They have a liquor license and a nice patio outside. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic doners and great beers on tap. A welcome addition to Kensington market! The curry wurst is damn tasty too!"}
{"text":"My favorite place during my Canada trip! (I tried a bunch of fancy places too). I just happened to have watched an episode of Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown the night before where he went with the chef of a fancy place to get street food. Currywurst to be exact and he said 'it was the best thing ever' to get it. So like a sheep I did and he was right!!

 I tried the original and my friend ordered the daily special currywurst which was italian sausage. She also ordered something that she had no idea what is was and did not ask (my kinda girl) I think it was called Halloumi sticks. When they called her we were all quite excited that her \"mystery\" item was FRIED CHEESE *swoon* OMG that was the best thing ever next to the yummy currywurst. It was pretty rich, definitely something to share.

The german beer was perfect with it. It was very inexpensive too, so just another added bonus. It is not a fancy place, but very clean with great food. It is a fast food type place with non fast food. My friends that live there had never ventured into Otto's being creatures of habit, but now vow to become regulars!"}
{"text":"The first time I went I got a small teller box with halloumi, veal and a side of couscous. It was delicious! The food was pretty quick and it was not that busy. 

However, when I went a week later and took my siblings it was a bit disappointing, the halloumi slices we had were broken and it seemed like the same amount of halloumi given which is weird considering I bought a large. 

Also, the first time around there were lots of veg with the couscous and it just overall looked more impressive. The last time I went the couscous didn't have that much veg on top which was disappointing.

This place lacks consistency-which to me is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"First time here.  Heard rave reviews.  The Veal and Lamb box with fries and feta was good.  Not great or fantastic.  The sauces were a good combination and tasty.  I'm not sure if I'd ever have a craving for this or come back regularly.  But it was good."}
{"text":"Got the doner teller, very yum, you get the option of couscous, salad, fries or a two with meat etc, and they can totally make it dairy free so yeye, nice sit down environment, not really date-ish but bring a friend or get some work done, and oh yeah- Free WIFI!"}
{"text":"Really good sandwich. Lot's of toppings and a pretty healthy meal. The sandwich also looks pretty cool when they serve it to you."}
{"text":"Love this place. At the moment it's my fav lunch spot in the market. Different from your average doner/shawarma. Loaded pitas that will fill you up and more. Try it loaded with fries and feta it adds a more unique and delicious flavour compared to a traditional doner/shawarma. 5/5*"}
{"text":"Wanna try some German Food?! Don't miss a Döner and do yourself a favor - try this one! Sure, its not exactly the same but for a more authentic experience you have to come to Germany. Since I left Germany nearly 2 years ago, this is what I missed most and what I always need to have when I come back. 
Sounds pathetic? Well, maybe but ask your friends who had one in Germany: Döner is just great! So, please don't think its just another sandwich - you can make many mistakes with a Döner (wrong spices, wrong sauces, wrong balance of meat/ salad..) but the one you get here is great. 
We had the veal/lamb version with all sauces (its a must!) and Feta and as said before, it was pretty good. Sauces were great (the Garlic one was a bomb!), also the balance of greens and meat and the bread was very authentic. Don't expect to stay clean while having a Döner, thats impossible but it is worth every stain on your shirt"}
{"text":"Well... what can I say. We give this place 3 stars because we like the idea and it's brand new - but we were a bit disappointed.

The food itself was alright. Just not really what we expected. In my opinion you're not offering the right kind of sausage for the Currywurst. (I was somewhat horrified by the idea of having a Weißwurst, so I took the Bratwurst) Also, Currywurst is really all about the sauce and it just wasn't spectacular. And there needs to be plenty of sauce!

We also tried a Dönerteller and a Döner. It was fine but not enough food for what you pay.
The beer selection is nice but somewhat random. I highly doubt that guys in Berlin wash down their sausages with a Paulaner. 

It was nice sitting outside in the sun with a cold drink, so if you're just looking for a quick bite and a beer, you'll probably like it!"}
{"text":"If you're in Kensington Market and need a washroom break, you must stop by Otto's Berlin Doner. They have two single toilet washrooms that sport speakers, a disco ball and strobe lights. The party starts when you push the large colored button on the wall. After you do your business, take a minute and get your boogie on. TIP: each bathroom has a different set up and each time you push the  button a different song plays. Yes I visited both bathrooms and pushed the button a couple of times LOL!

Now don't forget to purchase something for the use of their washroom, remember they don't have to allow you to use it if you're not a customer. I would recommend their Halloumi sticks. Halloumi is a \"semi-hard, unripened, brined cheese made from a mixture of goat's and sheep's milk.\" It comes with a scrumptious garlic aioli that's made in house."}
{"text":"Pros: filling, fresh, affordable, delicious, quick, casual atmosphere & perfect location (kensington market).
Cons: none. 
I had the chicken teller with fries ($9) - the garlic aioli and yogurt sauce were to die for - I've got to copy that recipe! Everything is topped with some fresh and tasty onions, cabbage and herb mix. Next time I'll be getting the chicken with half fries and half salad - I could not finish the box by myself.  
Will most definitely return."}
{"text":"A nice döner place in the heart of Kensington Market. I had the chicken teller and my partner had the chicken döner, we took bites from each of our meals which were both very good. The price is typical hipster gentrified pricing and I've noticed from the yelp pics that they've seem to have increase the prices over the months despite keeping the sizes the same - $4 for a side order of fries; really? Some other diners were drinking beers which made it all very German. One thing I am upset about is that the square inside of me decided not to press the big red button in the bathroom and coming on yelp now to see the mini disco party ignited by it is making me want to go back. I commend the cuisine as I haven't heard of a German street food place prior in Toronto and would return (to press the button and get a doner)!"}
{"text":"I went there a while back. The donair is what drew my attention.  I was born and raised in Germany, which has plenty of great Turkish donair/kebab places. It's one of my most favorite snacks over there! 
There was this expectation that this place would try to copy some of those over here...but while I think an attempt to copy has been made, it failed the mark miserably. This one was soaked in fat. Sorry Otto...but I won't come back. Good luck tho..."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Had the veal and lamb doner teller with fries and curry ketchup. 
 
Its a must try and repeat if you like. Guaranteed, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Very yummy food, great spot for lunch. Haloumi teller is my favorite. They also have vegan/gfree options."}
{"text":"This place has amazing flavors that are fresh and vibrant. The imported beer has a light and airy touch to it. To top it off, there's a hidden restaurant feature. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"German street food at its finest. This place is amazing with food like it's straight from Berlin. Everything on the menu is awesome. My favourite is the lamb doner but half halloumi and half chicken is a close second. Currywurst is also dynamite and has a rich, flavourful sauce. Decent beer selection too."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the experience.
Not sure if they had lots of delivery orders..? It took forever, only 6 inside, sloooowwwww.
About $12 for the doner (chicken).
Very cool restrooms, 2 rooms, 2 light shows..."}
{"text":"The greatest, and I mean greatest doner's I've ever had in my life were in Berlin. So, my expectations were a bit higher than most for Otto's Berlin Doner. And though it doesn't quite remind me of what I had in Berlin, I was very happy with the Chicken Doner I got. the portion was surprisingly large, which I was glad to see, since the price is definitely higher than your usual schwarma, or kebab ($10). The meat was well seasoned, the sauces had lots of flavour, it had a lot of veggies, and the pita was for lack of a better description, kinda like a pizza hut pizza dough? which was better than the usual store bought pitas you get from most places. All in all, I was happy with it, and will be back to try the currywurst."}
{"text":"Solid food, comparable prices to other nearby eateries. Had the Lamb and Veal doner all dressed with fries - would definitely order again, very filling and perfectly seasoned. All the sauces were delicious. Make sure to grab extra napkins, they can be messy.

Edit: make sure to visit the washroom and press the mysterious button on the wall."}
{"text":"As first-gen German, when I heard there was a Berlin-style Doner shop opening in Toronto, I knew I had to get there stat, so I was pumped to finally get to try it last night.

I tried the Halloumi Teller (i.e. plate), the Donair Teller and the Chicken Doner sandwich between friends. All were amazing. The fries were perfect, the halloumi to die for, and the meat perfectly spiced. The Teller is HUGE, so come hungry. The sandwiches come with more vegetables so they are a healthier choice. Didn't try to the Currywurst so will have to come back for that.

Great vibe, friendly service and a bonus bathroom secret that I don't want to spoil for you if you haven't been."}
{"text":"I've never really been to a döner place before, but I'm liking what I'm getting here. Price is roughly $8 and up an d you would seat yourself, which I personally like when I'm grabbing a quick bite (kind of like wurst to name a few places).  Vegetarian Teller Box - actually really great with crispy sweet potato. But damn with all sauces, GET THE OTHER BOXES. I know I will when I come back. 

Chicken Döner - The boyfriend got this and I am so glad he did. I had multiple (probably more) bites as it was absolutely delicious. The bread was soft and a bit crispy. 

Really like this place, even going to the washroom is pretty cool. Nice patio facing Kensington is key for this little token. Location is fantastic to walk off your food babies. 

Couple of small things for me - there seemed something off with the people working there. Not exactly rude, but definitely not friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! Huge portions. Homemade fries were excellent. I've been here twice this week and had the veal and lamb döner. Super fast service to boot.   Definitely worth the almost 2 hour drive!!"}
{"text":"In all honesty I don't quite know how to classify this stuff. It's like a middle-eastern take on a Canadian classic. Poutine with a kick, fries with a pow! Regardless of what it may be or should be, the only it is to me is...it's absolutely delicious!

There are no soggy fries here, a goopy mess or careless flavours. Fries are hand cut, crispy with the skin on (double fried). The assortment of spices and herbs you get from the gravy is ridiculous! I tasted curry, paprika, chili powder, coriander, lots of garlic and an assortment of other spices I can't decipher. It's a palette over-loading experience but in a nice way. The flavours are powerful but also used sparingly and therefore cohesive. Everything from the portion size to the various condiments, sauces, herbs and spices are well thought out. Be forewarned, this stuff does have a kick (mildly medium) to it so if you can't handle spicy foods at all then this isn't the place for you. The soup of the day was corn and it too was packed with flavour! Smokey, sweet, spicy and a bit of curry doesn't hurt either.

I haven't even gotten to try their wraps yet but I will definitely be back for more. This place has very little seating but whatever they have is warm, inviting and very cozy. Quite a gem!"}
{"text":"Good food, very filling!
Wish the garlic sauce had more garlic flavour to it.

Loved the washroom. Very food.
Das is gut!"}
{"text":"Had the beef/lamb mix in a large size on half fries and half salad.  The lab and beef taste great and with the 3 sauces, this meal has the right spice to it.  The salt content takes a bit of a spike though once feta is added.   Large is quite the meal - it hit the spot!  I'll be back to try it on couscous.  And maybe have a beer, or 5."}
{"text":"It's not every day that I can say, 'holy bananas! why have i not been here before?'
For the longest time, if I heard anything involving German style food, I can't say I was jumping up for joy. However, this has given me a totally fresh appreciation of German Street Food. For some reason the concept of street food in germany was beyond me. I am completely wrong - and happily so!

The only reason it's not a 5 star rated spot is the customer service. Otherwise, everything else was spot on. They have a simple and straight forward menu which I appreciate. I chose the chicken doner. My mind kept drifting gyros but I knew it would not be quite like that.

What I ended up instead with was this amazing chicken sensation in a crisp, warm flatbread thingy (yup, I said thingy).  I can only say I am not proud at the speed I inhaled this. It was so good, so flavourful and filling. It is messy to eat though. It is the price you pay for the good stuff.

Speaking of price. It is more expensive than your average donair or gyro or whatever concoction like that. $9 dollars with tax but if you aren't eating this everyday - splurge a little for something really good."}
{"text":"Having just come back from vacation in Berlin, this will definitely be my foolproof döner spot in Toronto. The portions are reasonable for the price and the flavours are amazing. Very authentic compared to the döner I had in Berlin. Apparently if you press a button in the bathroom it turns it into a rave but I forgot to try it out. 
Would highly recommend this place to anyone with tastebuds"}
{"text":"Had the chicken box, small. Was a bit smaller than I expected and for the price seemed like I should've gotten more. The sauces mix really well with the fries and salad: yogurt and garlic aioli. Good quick, cheap meal."}
{"text":"Many spoonfuls were dry and hard and I felt like I only received the skin bits and barely any meat. I'm not sure if it's just because it's a German variation of donair, but I've had Turkish style donair before and have had much more meat."}
{"text":"Geez. If you can get past a much longer than necessary wait for food, and find a seat at one of the low, uncomfortable stools, you might strike gold.

The sandwiches here are delicious. A nice take on a gyro (or a sausage on a bun if you prefer), the sandwiches (chicken, lamb, etc.) have a great flavour. Take fries or a side salad for a nice meal.

The staff here are great and the beer is cold."}
{"text":"Who knew German comfort food would be so good in Toronto?

After a long day of travel, my friend and I were looking for something delicious quick and nearby and stumbled upon Otto's Berlin Doner. With a high rating and less than .1 mile away, we knew in this moment Otto's was our DESTINY.

They have casual tables and stools if you want to dine in, but we decided to grab our food to go and were on our way, meals in hand in less than 5 minutes.

I ordered the Chicken Teller Box with all the sauces (the sauce trio is amazing), cous cous, and house salad. Washed it down with a cold can of Sprite and BOOM, great meal.

I wish I was staying here longer than a week so I could make this place a regular dining destination."}
{"text":"A delicious meal, ingredients are fresh. They let you do half-fries and half-salad for the doner teller, if you're indecisive between being healthy and carbs.. Their sauces really make the meal!!

There's a good patio out front, but small. It's really nice if you manage to grab a seat. The entire front window does open though so sitting inside is almost like sitting outside without the sun. They also serve reasonably priced beer, that's a plus.

Surprisingly, the bathroom is worth a visit (don't forget to press the button!)."}
{"text":"One of my favourite cheap eats in Toronto. Otto Berlin Doner is always a good excuse for me to go to Kensington Market. Their haloumi cheese is the best thing in this world. Their fries with that garlic sauce are also oh so delicious. Before heading out, make sure to visit their bathroom and hit that button!"}
{"text":"The food, beer, and location are all fantastic!  Some of the best food I've had in some time.  I had the veal and lamb box and it was absolutely delicious. I would recovered asking for sauce on the side though as they add a lot.   Also had the Schneider Weiss Aventius and it's a delicious and crisp dark Weiss.  Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"The food is fine but the employee I dealt with... well either he was having a difficult day, or he hates his job, or he just had an overall attitude problem, he was very rude. Wouldn't look at me when I asked questions/made my order and treated me with disdain. For management, this is a young average looking man with light coloured hair and beard. Definitely won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Yaaaaas! Chicken Doner Teller with fries and salad and all of the sauces. Great combination of flavours. Perfect lunch and quickly becoming my go-to place for fresh, fast, and delicious grub.  I'll echo a previous reviewer-- more places like this in Toronto please!"}
{"text":"One of my fav spots. Amazing and consistent! Good fit snakes? and a hefty meal. Be sure hit those buttons in the washroom."}
{"text":"Was our first time being here and I had their Doner chicken Teller. It was pretty good with all the sauces and the hot sauce balanced well with the garlic and yogurt sauces. My bf really liked the fact they had rarely sold German beer on tap and in cans since he can't find them in many places here in Toronto. Defs want to go back for the Halloumi and the fries. FYI tho, washrooms are gross. Would've given 4 stars but had to take off one for the washrooms."}
{"text":"I've never had a Doner or a donair before. So I don't know anything about the authenticity of the food here. But all that matters to me is if it's good, and the food here is good!

I had the doner with chicken and halloumi. Both were the same price, and so they said I can get it with half chicken and half halloumi. Having never had halloumi, I said \"SURE!\" Halloumi is a cheese. It's firm in consistency. I think the outside was fried a little. I asked for all the fillings and all the sauces. The result was awesome deliciousness. The hot sauce wasn't overly hot (actually not hot at all, to be honest). But along with the garlic and yogurt, it was an interesting combination. 

There's a small number of seatings (3 or 4 bench tables and two smaller tables)  inside and some outside tables too. It was too cold to sit outside and there wasn't enough space for a large group to sit together.  Also made it awkward for a large group to stand and wait for their food together as well. That's the only thing I'd note about coming here: maybe come early to get tables (to avoid the lunch time crowd). 

Oh and maybe add fries to the oner as well. i didn't get that and watched in envy as people devoured theirs with fries...though mine was really good without fries."}
{"text":"Our hostel was a stones throw from kensington market and one night we just did not want to venture far or wait in line anywhere so we ended up here. I found it a bit expensive but still very delicious. Not a super big place so you have to be a bit cutthroat for a seat unless you take it to go, and it's pretty fully portable so that wouldn't be too difficult!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the service was a bit on the slower side for a fast food joint but it was probably because of the long lineup of people. 

I had the chicken doner, the spices and sauces were super savory and a nice contrast with the fresh veggies on top. Loved the bread, definitely better option to the regular pita you get at most places."}
{"text":"Price is great, service is great, food is great. 
One thing I can wish for was more seats for seating but it was definitely worth the wait!

The kind server let us try out all of the sauces (garlic, yoghurt (?) and spicy) on the side which was an exceptionally nice touch. The Doner came out perfect and the mixture of greens and chicken was on the spot along with the perfectly toasted  wrap on the outside. I cannot express how happy my stomach was for this meal!

The Doner Teller box tasted delightful and it was a reasonable portion for a small size. 
Keep up the great work and I'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the stuff at the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was very oversalted, service was not friendly and had limited seating. Would not come back here."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, just as good as the real stuff in Berlin!  Only complaint is that UberEats delivery is always sooo slow. The food always leaves over an hour after I have made the order."}
{"text":"Check this place put on a whim while puttering around Kensington. I love it when you stumble upon good things like this. Since it was our first time, our server suggested we try the chicken and haloumi mixed donair and it was a good call. It was a big portion, you won't go away hungry. Plus it was quite tasty.... well worth a stop in if you happen to find yourself around Kensington..."}
{"text":"Love the veal and lamb doner teller, its my go-to when I come here. As someone who likes spicy and savoury meals, this option hits the spot. The reason for the lost star is because they have hiked up their prices significantly (large size doner teller now costs almost $3 more than it used to) which I find quite disheartening. I'm really having trouble justifying $12 regularly, but it is really tasty so I'm willing to pay extra when I feel like treating myself every now and then."}
{"text":"Love having this place close by!  They're accommodating for changes you want to make to what they offer, and it's a great way to get an interesting combo of flavours and textures.  Nothing like it nearby either.  I find their service is a little bit lackluster - the last time I went in, the two employees at the counter were in the middle of a conversation and managed to serve me without even looking me in the eye or addressing me at all in person, but I'll go back because food is delicious."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. Berlin style Turkish food. Bring my kids here and they love it. Fantastically delicious teller boxes I'm addicted to this place. All of the sources are savoury deliciousness.Solid selection of beer quaint little patio always busy consistently delicious.  Is this quick stop eating."}
{"text":"My friend and I were exploring Toronto and decided to grab a bite at Kensington Market. Most of the restaurants here were cash only... until we stumbled upon this gem. I had ordered a chicken döner and it was a pretty good size! It definitely left me satisfied for the afternoon, but not overly stuffed where I couldnt make room for churros after :D Overall it was really tasty. My friend ordered the teller and that was a decent size as well. Service was good and the employees were really kind. For anyone who does not carry cash, I would definitely recommend this place! And to end my review, I'd like to say...

CHECK OUT THE BATHROOM!!! [press the button] You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"3.5. Gigantic doner sandwich. Doner was a tad dry. Sandwich was a beast. Near impossible to pick up and it did fall apart. Nice little patio to enjoy a beer."}
{"text":"The chicken doner and the veal and lamb doner are amazing! I am definitely going to be eating here every week. The place is very trendy and cozy."}
{"text":"The currywurst is actually the currybest. The fries are super flavourful and crispy. The doner is delish but hard to eat because of the square shaped pita? But otherwise the teller (box) is just as yum and easier to eat. 

The place has a fun vibe and every last detail of the design has been thought out. 

Can't wait to try their spiked slushies once the weather gets warmer!"}
{"text":"Perfect Balance of what you want in a meal.

Crispy fries, refreshing salad, a good amount of veal and lamb and the right amount of sauce. This place has the right balance of flavours. I enjoyed every bite. The curry ketchup was a great touch as well. This place just offered something different and it is just what I needed!"}
{"text":"Checked out this spot for lunch on a weekday. We came around 1pm and it was relatively quiet without any lines, which was lovely. I ordered the vegan Gemuse Donner Teller with half salad and couscous, and really liked that there was a dairy-free alternative of the yogourt sauce on hand.

Despite being veggie-only, the donner teller was super rich, tasty and filling. A fantastic healthy option to the traditional meat version. For $10 I was happy & full, and this girl can't ask for much more than that. Also dug that despite sticking around for an hour or so after finishing our meal, no one hassled us about moving our butts. 

Nifty Note: There are German beer options for those who might want a brew with their lunch as well."}
{"text":"Sandwich goûteux mais un peu juste en quantité. Ne pas attendre d'avoir très faim pour s'y rendre."}
{"text":"Used to like this joint but today I ordered a lamb and veal sandwich and the bread was at least a day old. If you want to charge almost $12 for a sandwich then have the courtesy to use fresh bread. Totally lame.

Konrad, the owner was good enough to respond and offer a replacement sandwich. Going to take him up on it but will need some time and consistent quality before I give more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place, but I don't love the lingering garlic breathe I get after eating here. The food is delicious and I am a big fan of the fried squeaky cheese (halloumi). The half couscous and half fries in my doner teller box is the best combo. Highly recommend. 

Two knocks on this place: (1) the meat is a bit dry and (2) on the occasions I've ordered via apps, they forget items and neither the app nor Otto's takes any responsibility over it. Very annoying to have to call both Otto's and the app to get it rectify. It never got resolved."}
{"text":"Ach Gott wo fang'ich an...

A horrible experience. Einfach unbedingt furchtbar. Started with a clusterfuck at ordering because the people behind the counter couldn't figure out the point of sale. I finally get to order, at least five minutes in a tiny lineup. I get the EASIEST German street food to pull off, a Currywurst with fries. If you've been anywhere in Germany you know that this is fast almost beyond belief: Take a sausage, run it through this device that slices it into many bite-sized pieces, douse with ketchup-curry sauce, done. If there are fries ordered then that might extend your wait by a minute or so because they're always decent but not artisanal, get-the-job-done frozen fries but are also routinely delicious. I've had COUNTLESS Currywurst with and without fries and this is a one or two minute thing to pull together that requires zero culinary skill.

Not at Otto's. Here it took 26 minutes for me to get my order. Right away this looks wrong- thin fries? Have the owners never done reconnaissance in Germany? That said, the fries were good. The sausage was sickening, revolting. It had an off barnyard smell- like shit. The sausage smelled like shit and the taste comprised a mouth-filling, nauseating shit taste. No other way to put it, like it was spoiled or contaminated. I didn't say anything because I left with the kitchen- which like the whole place was overstaffed, at least three at front and three in kitchen so NO excuse for the slowness- still in the weeds and there were maybe eight in the lineup. I'd already done what I'm sure they saw as causing a scene by complaining about slowness and was already \"that guy,\" so here we are, complaining on Yelp.

I could punch myself for even giving this place a chance. The employees can't even pronounce Döner and with zero competition you know that idiotic Toronto hipsters are flocking to this place as if it's anything remotely close to what you'll find in Berlin (or Hamburg, etc etc) because there is in fact almost nothing in Canada to compare it to. With so many GREAT and great value places in Toronto I should have seen this coming. Avoid."}
{"text":"Otto's you are so sooo good! You make my taste buds and stomach so incredibly happy and satisfied each and every time I visit. I remember when you first opened and I made the trek to try you out very late in the night. Then you changed your hours, so I hope that is working better for you. Although, I wish you were open an extra hour... Since you have opened your beef and veal Teller with half fries and half salad with feta and extra garlic and yogurt is one of my favourite meals in the city.

Side note.. the bathrooms are awesome and buzz worthy ++++. Most importantly, thank you for being a consistently tasty go-to. See you soon!!"}
{"text":"Good ol' filling comfort food. I had the chicken doner teller, with halloumi, and it was pretty good. There was flavour from the different elements, but I felt like there were too many flavours fighting for prominence. Regardless, this place was good enough that I'd give it another try one day."}
{"text":"Ducking into Otto's on a rainy Thursday was a treat. 

We had the chicken döner, the veal & lamb teller box with fries, and the currywurst on salad. Service was fast and the portions were filling. The fries were my favourite - a super crispy and addicting base for flavourful döner meat and sauces. Their curry is sweet and mild enough for spice-adverse peeps. 

Otto's space is bright and cozy, with indoor seating for about 20 people max. They also have a patio out front that seems like prime real estate for Kensington people watching when the weather is better. 

Definitely worth a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb and veal döner, my friend got the chicken teller and we shared the halloumi sticks. The halloumi sticks definitely stole the show!!! Such a great idea!! It's like a deep fried cheese curd yum!! The döner was also good, lots of meat, huge portion, highly recommend putting all 3 sauces! Definitely have some gum handy! You will end up with garlic and onion breath"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Teller\" bowl, veal & lamb. Great taste but the 3 small bites of meat I received was a ridiculously small portion for the $14.50 (before tax) it cost me for my meal. Lots of fries. Lots of salad. Quite literally 1 oz of meat. Unfortunately, not worth the price."}
{"text":"When in Canada, eat a poutine!! Poutines are a Québécois dish made of fries, cheese curds, some brown gravy and whatever additional topping you want to make it extra, extra special!! Poutines are popular in all over of Canada. This is considered the \"fast food\" of Canada. 

Bless us for accidentally running into a local hot spot in the tourist-filled Kensington Market!! If you want a delicious donor (sandwich) or teller (box), come to Otto's Berlin Donor. It's a cute and little restaurant right in the heart of Kensington Market. Many locals come here to quickly eat a donor or teller. For me, teller please! 

We ordered the half veal and lamb and half halloumi (Mediterranean cheese). It included homemade garlic aioli, yogurt herb and hot sauce!! 

Mix it all up! Delicious, delicious! Fries were crispy and packed with the awesome fry-ness. The pieces of cheese were lightly fried and stringy cheesy inside. The lamb and veal was savory and tender!!! And now dribble some of the sauces? Perfect poutine ever! 

Pros:
-very yummy poutines! you can't go wrong with ordering ANYTHING here!
-friendly and attentive service
-indoor and outdoor seating
-hipster decor
-self-serve free iced water
-restroom located downstairs
-free wifi
-funny unique restaurant name

Cons:
-parking can be difficult. street meter parking!! 

Tip: lunch time on the weekdays is a lot less packed!"}
{"text":"THE FOOD - Yurrp, the Döner was pretty good! Chicken was flavorful and moist, a touch fatty for my liking, but it was such a yummy experience that I was able to overlook it. They really hit you hard with the sauces, I got 2, but only remember one...which was the curry sauce - disclaimer - holy butts watch out cause their curry sauce is HOT HOT HOT, and I'm generally not a big baby with hot sauces, but their curry sauce challenged my palette. The fresh ingredients were crisp and fresh and the pita was hot and soft. I got their house salad as a side which was perfect, it was a tart salad with a fair amount of lemon juice and vinegar which was perfect for cutting through the hotness of their curry sauce. Lurrrrvvveedddd their house salad and I recommend it to anyone that likes weird little salads! I ended up getting their black tea slushie after my meal to cool down my BURNING MOUTH and it was a fabulous cold and sweet treat - tasted like genuine sweetened ice tea! 


THE CAN - If you have lamented never doing cocaine off an Ingénue's tight buttock at Studio 54 in it's hey-day, Otto's bathroom facilities might provide you a mildly similar experience, because boy oh boy, using the restroom at Otto's is a particularly glamorous experience (hint - it involves a magic button and a disco ball)"}
{"text":"Pretty tough to impress me when it comes to meat cooked on a spit, I've been eating at some of the best Middle-Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants in the GTA for some time but I was very pleased with Otto's. The box option with couscous is a nice alternative to the sandwich, and the lamb was delicious. What really made it all sing was the in-house yogurt topping and hot sauce."}
{"text":"Some of the best fries I've ever had! Small, crispy, dark, and salty - maybe also seasoned with some other things? I couldn't put my finger on it. 

The Gemüse Teller I ordered was mostly fries, with a small portion of (delicious) grilled vegetables on top. I didn't realize I could get half salad, which I might do next time. I wish there had been more vegetables. 

My partner's Gemüse Döner was tasty, especially with garlic aioli and feta added. It didn't seem terribly authentic, but it's also been a while since we've had actual Turkish Döner in Germany. :) Good bread, garlicky sauce, and lots of veggies. 

The place was crowded on Friday night, with a big takeout rush right before closing. Our order took less than ten minutes though. We ate at the bar and it was fine. I made sure to check out the washroom, based on other reviews, and I'm very glad I did!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with German food. This is a bit odd cause I love Germans and almost anything about Germany. 
A German friend recommended this place saying that it is almost the same food I can find in Berlin! One day later I was here and I can tell you I enjoyed every thing about the place. 
The food quality was awesome! I believe the prices were okay given the quality. It is lovely place especially that is located in the heart of Kensington market. Nice artwork and athmospjere inside and professional and organized staff, something I would expect from Germans!"}
{"text":"Well, because this is Toronto, naturally this place has only been open for a week and already everyone is raving about it.... there are lineups even in the middle of the afternoon. Of course there are. Something new comes along and everybody goes nuts falling over themselves to hype it up. 

Well, sorry to be a debbie downer, but after coming in with high expectations and ready to LOVE it, the kebab I had today was...just ok. Fine, but not great. I'll admit I don't know how \"authentic\" this \"German doner kebab\" is (although IMO playing the authenticity game with food is a fool's errand - the important thing is how good the dish is, not whether it resembles the one you had when you were drinking your way around Europe seven years ago). 

So, while I loved the freshness and quality of the salad/veggies on the sandwich, that couldn't disguise the fact that the meat (I had the lamb/veal) was dry; in fact the whole thing was pretty dry, despite the fact that I got all three sauces on it. (The sauces were tasty - there just was not enough of them where it mattered. They mostly acted as dressing for the salad on top.) Structurally, this sandwich has serious design issues. Its triangle shape means that all the meat gets stuffed in at the bottom while the salad and sauces are on the top, meaning you have to eat your way through all the salad/sauce first, and are then left to chew through a mound of dry meat and bread (with no sauce). I also felt like it really needed some kind of pickle (like pickled chilli or turnip) - maybe that's not traditional, but it would have really improved the sandwich. They could even offer it as a optional topping for 50 cents, I'd be ok with that. I got feta on mine (50 cents extra), but the feta was a measly dandruff sprinkling, not the snowy avalanche you see in all of the glossy promo photos that have been doing the rounds of the internet. It also isn't a whole lot of food, for an $8 price tag (mine in fact came to almost $10 with tax and tip.) I was expecting to be full after eating one of these sandwiches, but I actually came home and had a snack after (and I'm not a big eater).

Pros: the space is great, the staff seemed friendly, though busy; I love that they serve beer and wine. (Soooo European! ;) The patio is cute but tiny (three or four tables), so good luck ever getting a seat. Upshot is I will definitely try it again once all the hype has died down, and maybe I'll try the chicken next time in hopes of juicier meat. I definitely want to try that currywurst too! But given that for almost half the price, I can get a huge, delicious, juicy kebab at Ghazale up on College (or Falafel Queen down on Queen),* I'm not going to be rushing back.

* I know I know! They are not the same thing (Middle Eastern and wrapped in pita versus Turkish-German and wrapped in flatbread). But I maintain the comparison is valid!"}
{"text":"I've had crummy doner's at festivals, And never liked them. But this place blew my mind. It's the thick chewy and dense bread. Quaint environment. But gets busy at lunch!  I had the veal and lamb.....  like I said. Blew my mind.  I guess it's filling?  But I could have eaten two I suppose."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, and so fast. Try the haloumi or veal/lamb and yes, get all the sauces on it."}
{"text":"This place is cool. The vibe is totally Berlin. Although quick, the food is still hearty and delicious: THIS is the way fast food should be. I ordered the chicken doner. The bread was fresh and perfectly toasty. The flavors of the yogurt and hot sauces were amazing and complimented the chicken's seasoning very well. Add feta and make sure to grab a glass of Paulaner Weisse too! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm here often, absolutely great. Waited for months for this place to open. I drive about an hour for school here and this is my go to spot after class!"}
{"text":"Apart from the bread and red cabbage, it's not an authentic Döner you would find in Berlin, accordining to the Berliner I brought with me. To my Canadian taste buds, it was very tasty! The meat is tasty and the sauces flavorful not overpowering. I would recommend this to someone interested in trying Berlin food, but like getting a poutine outside of Canada you can't expect it to be exactly the same."}
{"text":"I just love this place! Coming from europe I was missing the real Doners in Toronto. Impossible to find but the food at this place is legit so good. I could come here every week. Great patio."}
{"text":"Decent Turkish-German street food albeit at hipster prices. The branding and interiors of the shop are on point with the budget-cool theme but a recent catering experience reminded me that the food itself is good but not the best value. 

The Chicken Teller Box - Large ($13) is good, fried comfort food. It was really filling and rich so a small size is enough for the average person. There weren't as many ingredients compared to an in-store order which made it mostly a box of fries and couscous - not a good price for what it was. For a lot of us, the cute sticker on the box would rip the top flap when we tried to peel it off, making it impossible to reseal it

Overall, It's good but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Tip: It's possible to get half fries half salad!"}
{"text":"We get dinner here once a week and whenever we're feeling down. We switched it up and now we exclusively order the haloumi and gemuse. No decline in quality or service :)

I think they're on Just Eat now too!"}
{"text":"This is how D?ner is done! Crispy bread, fresh vegetables, tasty meat and garlic sauce (5 out of 5). I'll soon be back to try the Bratwurst and German beer!"}
{"text":"5 's!! Excellent food. Healthy. Vegan and dairy free sauce options. Decor was beautiful, with fast and positive service. Will def be back."}
{"text":"We came for group lunch on Friday - from the initial pics - it looked like the place was mostly a take-out place so we had planned to do take-out. However it was a pleasant surprise to see a nice little patio out front with several tables inside. 

We ordered a variety of the lamb+veal and chicken doners along with two of the currywurst boxes to try. Unfortunately, they were out of the traditional bratwurst so we had the summer sausage which was equally good!

Having never had a doner - I wasn't sure what to expect as they looked like wraps but they tasted amazing! The lamb+veal was great - bread was nicely toasted and filled with fresh salad, lamb and veal topped with the trio of sauces! The currywurst brought back memories of being at the train station in Frankfurt. Loved the food. If there is one critque - it is probably the fries which were too salty and a bit soggy. Not a big deal for me as we came for the doner and sausauges but crisp fries would have make this a 5 star.

Will be back to try the other boxes :)"}
{"text":"Otto's Berlin Döner is tucked away on the busy strip of shops along Augusta Ave in Kensington Market. I'm fairly certain that this purveyor of German street food is the first of its kind in the city, or at least the newest and most popular. For those not familiar, Döner is quite similar to Gyros, except that it's served on flatbread as opposed to a pita.

Must-try items:
Veal & Lamb Teller
Fries & Salad (Side)

The atmosphere here is quite laid back, with limited seating available inside and a few more tables on the front patio outside. Drink offerings include sodas, beer, and cocktails, which you'll need to wash down your delicious meal with. Staff members are polite and friendly and their chosen selection of music (techno) pulsates through the air, setting a relaxed mood throughout the space.

Otto's is a combination of fast food convenience with a lounge-like atmosphere. I'm a huge fan of this place and after a long while between visits, I'll be back to try more, especially the currywurst which is one of their specialties."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place in Kensington market to meet up with a friend for a delicious simple meal and some tasty beverages. I met a friend here at about 8 PM on Wednesday night and we had a nice seat by the front window. They were doing a good business but there are still seats available for us to be comfortable.

We both ordered the chicken teller box with halloumi, half fries, half salad, and a mixture of all the sauces. They had a can of cider which went really well with the spices in the sauces. The refreshing cider balanced out the medium-level spice. It was the perfect level of spice for me. They also have a very nice large selection of unique beers. The small box option was more than enough food for myself, though my friend chose the large box option.

If you're in the area you should definitely do yourself a favour and stop by for some tasty eats."}
{"text":"We fell for the cool cartoony artwork. I've got to say that their branding is really on point! The food wasn't anything special, prices were steep for what you get, and service was slow. I can't speak on the authenticity but if this is the authentic stuff, I'd rather stick to Ghazale."}
{"text":"This brings back memories of my favourite shawarma joint in Waterloo (Mozy's Shawarma). I've yet to find a dinner plate/box or wrap as good, until ... today!

Drizzled with hot sauce, garlic sauce and yogurt herb (optional), this box of fries/salad and meat will satisfy your appetite. Opt for the large box if you're sharing or feeling hungover, and ask for extra sauce (extra $) to ensure that every piece of carb is covered in flavour. Indulge in every bite.

Try veal and lamb for something different, but chicken is definitely the safer, and more popular choice.

Four stars for value, taste explosion and comfortable atmosphere in the patio."}
{"text":"We fell in love with this place yesterday and ordered in again today! 

Ordered the chicken teller with half salad and half fries along with garlic and yogurt

The husband had the veal and chicken with the same as above along with hot sauce!

Can't wait to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Had the veal and lamb döner box. It was spot-on. I can only imagine how much better it would be to cap a late night out instead of at 11:45am.

Only recommendation: the thin-cut fries get too soggy under the mounds of sauce and meat. Thicker straight-cut fries would be more resilient and also more authentic -- at least compared to my own Berlin currywurst and döner experiences."}
{"text":"Solid option for \"cheap & fast food\" in Kengiston area (of Toronto in general). Come here if you are craving crunchy, salty fries. 

The Döner Tellers are tasty (recommend the chicken with garlic sauce) & range from 8.95-13.50 (+ tax). Cheaper and less formal than Otto's Bierhalle but serves the same delicious fries. There is also free refillable tap water on site. 

Appearance wise the place is clean, new & well designed. Motifs of Berlin are visible on the wall, the food is served on a metal tray with a cute yellow accent paper & the bathroom has a red button I recommend pressing more than once!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Just Eat. I ordered the currywurst, it was all mashed together in the same small box with fries and salad(worst part) and covered in curry sauce. It basically looked like someone already ate it and barfed it back into a box for me to pay 25 bucks for it. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I have 3 words for the owner of this place: Stay Like That ! 

You will know the whole menu is a winner as soon as you take your first bite out of anything. These guys know what they are doing, and they are doing it right. The common traps of the shawarma-gyro-döner business are skillfully tackled: meat tenderness, flavor, portion size, and hygiene... it's a process control system on fire ! 

Cooking lamb can be tricky. Order home delivery, and you will understand the obvious: Otto and rancid are tireless enemies. Even a nutritionist will agree that their döner box covers your daily veggie-starch-protein reqs (just don't mention the fries), and the price-to-portion quotient is well justified. In a nutshell, this is value you will not grab anywhere between Dufferin & Jarvis.

It's not a hofbrauhaus, but the beverage menu should make any weissbier fan smile. 

Well run. Bravo."}
{"text":"Otto's Berlin Döner puts German style food on the map in Toronto. A döner ranges from $6.95 to 7.95, the Döner Teller ranges from $7.95 to 9.95. As other reviewers had mentioned, be prepare to wait for 10-15 minutes for your food. My colleagues and I had waited for a solid 15 minutes after the order was placed. 

The food was delicious. The only fault was the slightly dried chicken. It seems juiciness of the chicken was sacrificed for a crispy exterior. This was luckily compensated by the garlic yogurt sauce and hot sauce. It is only detectable when eating the content of the döner separately and likely undetectable when eaten as a whole. My colleague was kind enough to let me try the veal and lamb döner he had ordered. Between the two, I would order the latter in the future. 

Overall, Otto's Berlin Döner is great for after-party or coma food. It's filling and definitely warms your belly and puts you to sleep!"}
{"text":"Otto's sells Turkish German fusion in Kensington Market. You can get kebobs, curry-wurst, and a German beer here. Prices are a decent as beer comes in a half liter and portions are generous. Would come back if I was in the area.

The venue is pretty small, with some indoor and out door seating. The COOLEST thing is the bathroom. If you end up using the WC, go and hit the buttons on the way for a good time ;)... it's music and disco you sickos!

Ordered:
Currywurst - plenty of fries, one large banger and seasoning on it. Fairly tasty, good amount of curry
Munich Gold - very light, crisp. Step up from coors."}
{"text":"Otto's Berlin Doner was a great addition to the German community for great eats! I stumbled upon this restaurant while walking through Kensington Market. I ordered the Currywurst which was a bratwurst covered in a curry sauce. Although growing up with Bratwurst from a German family I have yet to try a curry sauce with my brat, needless to say I was impressed. The staff was very helpful and eager to help customers. As for the decor of the place they hit it right on the head  with a quirky mix of fun and german. My only regret was not drinking more German beer while I was there!"}
{"text":"There's something about Otto's that I can't quite put my finger on.
Otto, if you're reading this, you should start selling your curry ketchup in bottles. 
The fries are amazing as well, as they're small, salty, and very tasty.
I've had both the Doner tellers, and the Currywurst. and they're extremely good portions for $11 (for a large) and $8 respectively.

Seriously, you have to try the curry ketchup (no, it's not just ketchup with curry power mixed on.)"}
{"text":"Food: Happy to see a vegetarian option at a German place! I had the vegetarian gemues doner teller with half couscous, half salad. It seemed light on the roasted veggies and heavy on the couscous, but the sauces were flavourful with just the right amount of kick.

Atmosphere: More of a fast food, quick serve vibe, but good for a casual quick bite with some bright and cheery decor."}
{"text":"The place looks really nice, bright and airy. The food was ok. We had the curry wurst with couscous and fries. It was good size for the price. My favorite was the side of couscous. The beer on tap is nice as well."}
{"text":"It's a small and simple restaurant that makes great food. The staff seemed knowledgable and were able to recommend some options. The small doner teller box was the perfect portion for lunch. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I will not call this place as a döner house cause döner is not that they are serving to you....Anyway the owner or chief made a successful combined with veal,lamb  and bread.I will go there again for delicious sandwich....!"}
{"text":"Great Kebab. The meat is great and you can close it and eat it like a sandwich which, let's face it, is the point of bread with filling. But most kebabs just can't close. So great. I nearly didn't get a seat. Glad I did cause it's raining. I had the veal/lamb. Great medium sized, manageable menu. Great place to nip into on a rainy day for a hearty lamb sandwich. Rock out."}
{"text":"Place was full at dinnertime so we sat outside in the patio area. I can imagine this place to be an amazing destination in the summer when it's warmer out. 

Split a curry bratwurst, which was highly recommended by my coworker and it was fantastic. Good amount of curry and crispy fries. Also ordered a shandy to go with the fries. They have a decent selection of German beer here as well. 

Order and pay at the front. Grab the food once it's ready."}
{"text":"Loved it! 

Atmosphere: relaxing. Nice comfy patio. Relaxed fun atmosphere.

Service: more of a fastfood format. Minimal smile. We tipped 15 not 20% type of place.

Food: delicious! I dont even like doner and I loved this one. Fresh veggies. Perfect sauces. A bit spicy. Grilled bread with a perfect level of crunchiness. The currywurst was so good too. Fries were okay. I would pass on the couscous next time though. Also need more slushies flavors. Spicy ginger is just meh. You gotta try out their doner!

Price: pretty cheap for Toronto standard. 

Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a good while now, i first saw the review on the 31st of July when the Blogto(plug) newsletter hit my email. from the photos in the article on the food place, i was quite hooked on wanting to come here. a good friend of mine who has been to Germany said that this place is an Awesome representation of how Germany does the kebab\doner. so i arranged a time to meet up with my friend to catch up and try out this restaurant. the location is in the north end of Kensington market, away from all of the action that Kensington market is known for, having said that, this restaurant has lots of room to sit and eat during the warmer months, the patio doubles the room for eating. i let my friend order first, as i looked at the menu on the wall(no dessert options?), trying to grasp what they had and what i wanted to order(fun fact: i never look at menus online) i couldn't help but overhear my friend try to order a \"stein\" of beer, and the cashier asked him if a \"tall glass\" was fine, to which he motioned over to the steins and said \"that glass\" to which the cashier said OK, got it. my turn, i was a bit confused by the lamb and veal combination, so i asked if i could get just a serving of lamb separately, i was told no, so i went with chicken doner, when i was selecting the toppings i asked what onions they used, red, purple, Spanish or other? the cashier had to ask the cooks and the cooks responded with yellow. so i asked for everything but onions, including the feta and fries option( 75 cents for each option, a bit steep, but all good). i was also intrigued by the punch that they had to offer, which was guava, something something...im laughing as i write this cause i cant remember the other two fruits, and cannot find the info online, they have two batches of the drink, spiked or virgin, so i asked for a large serving of non-alcohol. my bill was under 30 bucks for two doners and a large drink, tip included(at the bottom of the receipt has a tip guide which i had a good laugh over) the price of my meal was awesome! Me and my friend sat down to catch up a bit. within five minutes we both had our drinks and our food. now, i would consider myself to be a schwarma fiend, when the doner came to our table i was a bit...surprised, it looks like a taco...but its not! i couldn't help noticing that without even picking up the food, i could smell all of the intricate flavors and melody hit my nose. to be honest, this was the first meal of the day for me, and i was nervous when they brought the food over that i wouldn't be able to finish it, once the smells hit my nose, my mind went into game over and i CREAMED through both servings. the chicken doner was an absolute dream to eat, as i am writing this my mouth is salivating with the flavors and how every ingredient complimented each other beautifully, like a high five in the mouth, even the flavor of the chicken was amazing when i got down to the bottom. i do have one tiny complaint about the doner i had, which was the bread, it was a bit harder then i expect and even rough\sharp in my mouth, a little bit of a weird pairing but still very enjoyable. so far as my drink goes, i was very happy with the flavor of the drink, but to order a large, and get a plastic cup resembling the same size of a small iced cappuccino(tim hortons) i was not impressed with this, resembling an ice capp\slushie as well i was a bit annoyed with the fact of the consistency of the drink, although it tasted completely amazing, drinking it almost became a struggle at the bottom with the last remains of the drink becoming a block of frozen ice with all the flavor sucked out. i left this restaurant a fan, but tiny little details leave me giving this a strong four out of five, when i come back in the future i defiantly want to try out the curry wurst. it was a great outing with a good friend before he left on his trip to Europe. 

The cashier is not very knowledgeable with the menu/ordering options. 
this place has a fair bit of seating on the inside and outside, but gets busy pretty quickly, which leads to people hovering over the table/seat you sit at. 
the restaurant is very clean, and laid out very well. 
the bathrooms downstairs are a bit odd, they have a button that seems to be hooked up to some strobe lights or something, i didn't dare push it, maybe it was for the disco\techno ambience. 
the service is super quick and the food is super delicious, no dessert options though, which is a sticking point with me. 
some street parking is available, and the restaurant is a quick walk from either the 506/510. 
very happy and i wish i came here sooner!"}
{"text":"About freaking time I tried Ottos!!!! (I've tried the bierhalle, totally different food and vibe)

It was sooooo good!!! I've never had a döner but I've had many similar foods like shawarma and whatnot. But this was next level good!!! The bread was the bomb.com and their creamy garlic sauce was on point. I got the chicken! The portion was a great size but it was so yummy I could have had 2 LOL!

Just like the bierhalle the bathrooms are also a party which is a fun bonus!! 

The location is tiny in Kensington tucked away on Augusta but if you're lucky you can score a table or better yet, a patio spot!!

Service was also really friendly. Can't wait to introduce my bf to this one!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! 2/10 for authenticity though. They do sell club-mate - this might be the only place in Toronto that does...but for the steep price of $4.50. They also have some good german beers on tap, but sell only one kind of radler - an atrocious grapefruit one - yuck! I would love for them to offer authentic radlers, or Augustiner, or even Berlinerkindl.. The drinks I miss while in Canada! I had the Halloumi Doner.. And it was so tasty!! They are a little difficult to eat due to their shape, so make sure to have lots of napkins on hand. The veggies were super fresh and tasty. I agree with below reviewer that it is nowhere near authentic due to the lack of pickles veggies - but none the less, delectable. My only complaint would be the hotsauce - it could be better. It had very little flavor. Also had the fries... Some of the best fries I have ever had! The place has a great atmosphere, but I'd always busy so there is often no space to sit. Staff was nice and knowledgeable about ingredients and allergies. Authentic? Not at all. Delicious... You bet! Nomnom"}
