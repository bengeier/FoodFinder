{"text":"Our first evening g meal here at Miga and it was great! Prices are reasonable considering the creativity and consideration in the dishes. Cocktails are good but need some smoothing out. For me they are a little on the sweet side but the Hana cocktail was really well balanced!   Won a gift card from a Yelp event at The Art Theatre so definitely attend those and you could get as lucky as me!"}
{"text":"This place was incredible! From the way the food was presented to its absolutely amazing taste the whole evening was awesome! Me and my boyfriend came here for my birthday dinner and we started with the Miga sashimi garden salad and it was amazing, so fresh and the flavors blended perfectly. We both got the Buddhism Bi Bim Bop with beef and that was divine as well. Overall great experience! They also have old black and white movies projected on to the wall! No obnoxious flat screens strung up along every single wall! Total plus  check it out for sure!"}
{"text":"Miga disappointed me last night...  The meal started off really well with on-the-house appetizers - the fried dumplings were crisp and not too greasy. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there.  Despite making reservations a day in advance, the restaurant was understaffed to handle our party of 20. Our waiter was a nice guy, but as far as waiters go, he was definitely mortal and I don't envy his job last night having to take care of our tables as well as others. More over, four people in our party got their meals when the others were almost done because of chef issues. A big issue (to me) was with the order in which the courses/sides were served: the Banchan came out first, then the salad, then the meat that we all began to grill and consume, a little later the bowls of rice were passed out, followed by the soup.  Also, I've seen a much better spread of Banchan than the three tiny portions that each of us were served along with shared (insufficient) bowls of kimchi, shredded daikon, and what seemed like a corn+mayo salad :P  The meat was good - not exceptional by any means, but I'm assuming when you order the \"combo\" with different types of beef, chicken and pork, you won't really get their best cuts. That was my mistake. One thing I did appreciate were their newfangled grills with the built-in exhaust system. Various holes above the grill plate sucked in the air so the restaurant was noticeably clear of smoke and odors.  It's rare to have your clothes be wearable the day after you visit a Korean BBQ place, so props to them for investing in the right infrastructure. The street has too many good restaurants for me to make another trip back to Miga. Maybe if I'm with a smaller party and feel like caring about the ambience, but that's not most days."}
{"text":"We have been to Miga 3 times, always for brunch. NEVER disappoints! My favorite dishes: lemon chicken salad & omelet bowl. Their eggs Benedict was also delicious, however I'm not a huge eggs Benedict person in the first place. The Blood Orange Paloma drink is awesome too! Highly recommended; brunch prices are affordable."}
{"text":"Hard to rate this place, actually.  The space itself is elegant and some of the food was excellent.  Nothing was bad, certainly.  But the one weird flaw we experienced was that they did not season the fancy proteins that their entrees were built around.  We had tuna and scallops and they both had the same problem: fresh seafood, tasty well-seasoned other things on the plate, but underwhelming tuna and scallops just from lack of seasoning.  I loved the rice and sauce that the tuna sat on, but I could have done without the tuna itself (which I usually love) because it was so bland.  That should be a pretty easy flaw to address, and maybe they just had some miscommunication in the kitchen.  I only mention it here because it was true of both entrees, so seemed like more than a one-time accident.  We will probably go back at some point, just because there are not that many high-end options in Champaign and sometimes that's what is wanted."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but the food is amazing. It was my first time trying Bi Bim Bap and there was so much food and it was all amazing! Went for a friend's birthday and will be back (when I can afford it!)"}
{"text":"I made a special occasion reservation for Miga about two weeks in advance of the date and noted on my request that I had a gluten allergy. When my companion and I arrived, we were seated and waited about 5 minutes for the server.   When the server visited the table for the first time, I told him I would need some assistance with the menu as I had a gluten allergy. The server, a bit hostilely, told me that the the chef and the restaurant would not serve anyone with celiac disease and if I had a problem with that he would have the manager come speak with me. I let him know that I had made my allergy clearly known on the reservation request and that I was unclear why the restaurant had not notified me.   My companion and I left, feeling angry and embarrassed. We walked past the hostess station where he was conferring with the hostess and manager. None of them spoke to us as we walked through the door.   There is nothing on Miga's website to indicate this limitation. If there were, I would not have chosen to dine there."}
{"text":"We had the bi bim bap with tofu that was yummy..  But the bold noodle and miga stake were just okay .. Drinks were all very good .. Desserts were good too .. But overall very expensive .. Good ambiance but not sure I will frequent that place"}
{"text":"I just went out to dinner here with my fiance and Miga has to be my favorite place in Champaign so far.  As Asian fusion goes, this was remarkably well done.  Every course exceeded expectations, the restaurant itself is beautiful with indoor seating and both outdoor seating and a semi-outdoor covered deck, and the prices were not absurd.  They have an unique cocktail menu that is worth exploring.  Service was prompt and attentive.  Zero qualifiers or complaints.  This is a great place for a date."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sashimi salad, the Garden Steak and the Buddhist Bi Bim Bap, all were delicious. Interesting fusion of flavors and great presentation."}
{"text":"I decided to try out this restaurant for my friend's last day in town. I personally love foods at Sakanaya and also I have heard many great things about this restaurant so I thought it would be worth to check out the restaurant.  First of all, I would say this restaurant has a nice atmosphere. The host was nice and also the waitress. However, that is probably the only good thing I found at this restaurant.  I don't know if it is about the restaurant only has one chef but it took about almost 30 mins for the food to come and there were only 3 other people sitting in when we were there. My friends and I thought it was quite a long time to wait for the foods to come.  The foods really fell short for my expectation. I got the Galbi Rib-Eye Steak and my friend for the Sea Scallops for dinner. We both agree that the foods were too \"heavy\". The steak came with a small portion of kimchi fried rice that was cooked with butter which does not really compliment the taste of kimchi. I, too, prefer to substitute butter for oil in some dish but I found that using butter for kimchi fried rice just makes dish overall imbalanced. And there is also some fried kimchi on top of the steak which was very oily. I couldn't even eat pass two scoops of the fried rice and 1/3 of the steak because it felt so greasy after few bites. My friend's dish tastes a bit bland for our preference but too creamy. They added one piece of fried fat pork next to each scallop and make the dish tastes so \"heavy\" overall. Both of us couldn't finish our dinner because we feel so bloated from the greasiness.  For the food's price we have to pay, I feel like the chef could have made the seasoning stronger and cut out on the fattening ingredients that were used in the dishes. But again, according to many people, I am a picky eater. I don't think I will come back to this restaurant again because I feel like gaining 10 lbs from eating the foods....."}
{"text":"Extremely high quality ingredients flavorfully prepared and artfully presented-truly memorable, fine dining epitomizes the Miga experience. Excellently thorough but not overly invasive service and an upscale modern chic but still welcoming decor also contribute to Miga's success as a place where happy patrons like to gather. The very fine, well-made cocktails don't hurt either;). While quite a splurge financially for many of us, Miga is definitely worth it and a must-try that distinguishes itself amongst its peers in CU."}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and thought it was pretty darn good.  I recently went again, and it was definitely not as good as I remembered.  The room was still very clean, spotless actually, and very bright.  The staff were very friendly.  But the food just wasn't as good.  It seemed all too \"precooked and refrigerated\".  I was a bit sad, given how I had remembered it from the previous visit."}
{"text":"I've been living on this corner of St Denis for five years now, and only just tried Miga. It is fantastic, and by far the best deal for your money anywhere near this part of the city. I've been continually disappointed by the other restaurants along the St Denis corridor, so it's been wonderful to find this gem. I'm currently sitting here writing this review after coming for the second time in three days. Try it. Be happy. Get the Dolsot Bibimbab special."}
{"text":"I wish I had found this lovely place sooner- great service, wonderfully kind owners and awesome food. One of the best (if not the best) cheap eats in Montreal. And bring your own wine! If you're in the plateau area, stop here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My cousin take me to this place. The vibe there is great , there's a old school film showing in the hall...and we seated near the window. I ordered 'zen style ceviche' for starter, it was good!!! And 'soy cream pasta' for main food..ummm I don't quite like it. It's creamy and a little spicy..it's good when u start eating it but I feel oily when I have the third,fourth bite...so I didn't finish it. My cousin ordered salmon bibimbap..it was a big plate but the food in the container is very small...I have to mention the rice..as my cousin told the waitress the rice is so little that she can't even feel full..then waitress give her extra rice and it turn out to a little rice in a pudding sized bowl...so......lol..."}
{"text":"We made a reservation here a month before arriving in Champaign. Once at the restaurant the hostesses seated us at a long table over by the bar away from the front of the restaurant by the windows--  which is where I had originally requested to be seated. The long table appears to be meant for large parties or to be shared with other couples or smaller groups. It was dark in this area and my husband had to face the back wall which just wasn't the ambiance we were hoping for.  We were placed at one end of the long table and another couple sat at the opposite end. This couple was arguing so it wasn't the most pleasant experience.  For privacy and because I had made a reservation so far in advance I asked if we could be seated at a regular table (most sat 4 people) of our own near the windows. I was summarily told that \"all tables were being held for people with reservations.\"  I explained that I, too, had a reservation which was made almost a month earlier! In response the hostess, now in a rather curt tone, said that we couldn't move because \"the people at the tables were probably waiting for others in their party to join them.\" By the time we finished our meal we saw only one table of two people having other people in their party join them later. There was really no good reason why we couldn't have been accommodated.   I've never experienced hostesses going so far out of their way to NOT make customers happy like these hostesses did. This is sad because the waiter was fantastic and the food was quite good. Because of this experience we will not be going back nor will we be recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"4 stars for environment, 3 stars for food (I would say no surprise), 3 stars for cocktail. Environment is definitely great in Cham-bana area. However, the food taste more like average. Still, Chashu Bun is a great starter!"}
{"text":"Fantastic samosas, great service, across from a quaint park, will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but not as good as I thought. The bun with fried chicken was too dry, and the sauce's flavor was too strong to taste with plain bun. And the beef was not juicy as I expected either. However, I would highly recommend the rice ( forgot its name) the sauce was very delicious with the vegetables and beef."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and the food was a very odd combination of American and Korean food. I like Korean food and the combination was not good. The meat was very low quality and tasted subpar to what I expected from this restaurant. The only saving grace was our waiter was fantastic and knowledgable and the atmosphere and decor was fantastic. I don't recommend this place once so ever to anyone who doesn't already liked this type of food."}
{"text":"It's as bad as the Mississauga location.  It's a below average meal with a high cost.  The decoration is nice and all, but they forget, food matters more for restaurant."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place for a long time but finally gave it a try and loved it.   Appetizer: beef saam & wasabi Caesar salad Beef Saam was good. The beef actually tasted like slices of galbi (short ribs) which is great. It came with a side of sticky rice, kimchi slaw and a peanut sauce. It was pretty filling!   Caesar salad: the dressing was pretty amazing. It also has a huge slab of pork belly and some crunchy sweet myulchi (tiny anchovies) sprinkled. It was also really good and very filling.   Entree: sea scallops & halibut  Sea scallops: this dish was AMAZING. Scallops were like butter and the rice it came with was soooo good. It was worth every penny.   Halibut: my fish came dry (reason for the four stars and not five) which was too bad bc everything else about this dish was also AMAZING. The dashi broth (flavorful and a bit spicy), clams, bokchoy, sun dried tomatoes and the sea weed tapenade were all really delicious together. I asked for a spoon and ate everything together. So so good.   Dessert: apple pie  It's small but just the right way to end the meal. The ice cream was tart and the crispy wafer added the right crunch.   Overall, I was surprised at the portion size. I expected tiny serving sizes but they were generous and filling. Every dish was flavorful and not disappointing. I'm Korean so I stayed away from traditional Korean meals on purpose and I'm glad I did. The less Korean dishes had the perfect amount of Asian inspired flavor profiles to fit my palette but American enough that I didn't feel like I could have just gone to a Korean restaurant for a cheaper but just as tasty version of the same dish."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the quality of food you are getting. Com'on, a beef stone pot for 15? You will find lots of other options in Korean town at much cheaper price (and probably better taste)."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday night and I made a reservation, but I don't think it was necessary. I ordered the Yuzu seafood dish for appetizer. It was pretty good. The taste and the quality of the seafood was perfect that you could tell the difference between them even only by your tongue. My main dish was the scallops (I'm a seafood lover). They were fat, juicy and delicious. The rice?(not sure with the grain) was mixed with vegetable and spice. I think it was a smart choice because you won't want something that has a strong taste when you are enjoying those scallops. For a dinner of three, we spent around 150 dollars. (Including tax, no desserts nor drinks) I think it was reasonable considering the quality of the food and service. The atmosphere and interior design is great for dating and family events. I will recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"We visited MIGA at 7 PM on a Friday evening. We found a seat immediately... very lucky for us (it is still a hidden gem and not many people are aware yet). The interior had clean lines, an industrial element, and modern. The staff was attentive and pleasant. The bar manager Nick visited every table and chatted with diners. he was very cordial. Our waitress Morgan was helpful.  For appetizer, we shared the Wasabi Caesar Salad $9. It was likely the best Caesar salad I've ever had...crisp and fresh with excellent taste (a bit spicy but very yummy). For the entree, I had the Chef's Garden Steak $38, an extremely tender tenderloin with potato puree, caper salsa, garlic chip, and caper cream. My wife's entree was the Soy Cream Louisiana Chicken Pasta $15: rich and spicy. Topping it off with Fried Apple Pie for dessert $6, which was fried apple pie with sour cream ice cream and miso butterscotch. My suggestion is to ask for your miso butterscotch on the side (most would not think it is a dessert sauce).  Note that the owners also own the Sakanaya Restaurant on Green Street in Campustown, a highly-rated spot.  Excellent meal, high quality, pleasant service. Really enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Miga 3 times now, and each time it has been equally delicious. I absolutely love the garden steak and salmon- the flavors are incredible and presentation is beautiful. I also really enjoy the soy cream chicken pasta however the portion is very large and filling(just a heads up). In addition to entrees I've tried both the wasabi caesar salad and the sashimi salad, both delicious as well. As for service, it has always been good, and the interior design of the place is very nice as well. In my opinion, this is absolutely the best restaurant in Champaign. Possibly the only one that can compete with the caliber of restaurants in Chicago."}
{"text":"I would have given it 5 stars but i gave it 4 because the mochi ice cream was literally a single mochi piece. And it was pretty expensive for that single mochi piece. No, Miga. Just no. MORE MOCHI.  Otherwise I REALLY liked this place. Definitely trying to be a trendy place. Definitely trying hard to look like it belongs in Chicago, but so what?! It's pretty good. The decor is great and the drinks are 1) really good and 2) really strong and 3) reasonably priced. So super A plus for that. It is really similar to a different place called Sakanaya on the U of I campus (Green St.) but...assuming you aren't in the mood for sushi...Miga's food is better.  In terms of food, when I went I had some sort of soy pasta type of thing. For meat eaters like myself, I tend to stay away from anything soy, tofu-y or that is attempting to replace my lovely meat. This thing was awesome though and didn't taste all weird and vegan-y. My friend had the galbi steak which was EQUALLY as delicious.  Bathrooms were clean. Restaurant was clean. The service was kind of working out the kinks (we went on a soft opening night) but everyone was super friendly and really nice. I enjoyed myself.  Fix your dessert game and I'll up it to five stars."}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times and tried half of the menu. I would say this is one of the best restaurants in champaign. Food is tasty, environment is elegant, reservation is easy through OpenTable."}
{"text":"AMAZING meal! I never expected such an fantastic meal in Champaign. I had the Butter Fish that melted in my mouth. The Scallop, yes singular, appetizer was cooked perfectly and the presentation of all the dishes was a feast for the eyes. The meal was never rushed and the elegant atmosphere and moderate noise level made for a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Miga blew me away! I had a group of 9 to celebrate my graduation.  Let's talk about the atmosphere of this place first. It's very industrial mod. Some exposed concrete balanced by beautiful wood accents, high ceilings, birch wood decor, and black and white classics being projected onto the back wall. An open air patio that allows inside diners to feel that they're eating al fresco with no fear of sun or rain or the darkness of nightfall. Even the table settings are artistic, the knives standing on their blade and woven placemats inlaid with the table.  I already knew Miga was beautifully designed, but I came to put their food and service to the test.  The waitress was knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive. She  navigated our table with expertise and the help of a second waiter, each explaining the details of each dish as they were delivered. I can't have alcohol so she offered to make one of their signature green tea mojitos virgin for me.  We ordered the wasabi Caesar salad, house salad, and the sashimi salad, as well as the chasu buns and Mandu dumplings for starters.   The salad greens are very delicate and light and taste fresh as anything, as if they were picked from the restaurants own rooftop garden. They're topped with beautiful edible flowers and Parmesan. The sashimi one is served with two pieces of tuna and two of salmon, both top quality. They had that certain je ne sais pas quoi flavor that is pleasant  but can't put your finger on. Chasu buns were delicious as well, with cucumber and a creamy sauce w the delicate pork inside. Mandu were very delicate yet crisp, a flavorful oil brushing but nothing greasy. Tender meat inside that was lightly seasoned and a dab of soy-balsamic reduction to go along with each one.  I had the orange glazed salmon for a main course. I do recommend against having it medium rare as it's written on the menu. The waitress even attested to this, recommending it be cooked medium. I did this and actually probably would have gone for medium well/well done. It seems that they were going for a seared tuna effect/half cooked half sushi style but it doesn't work well with salmon in my opinion unless it's straight cold sushi. Nevertheless that didn't stop me from loving this dish. It's served with a trio of colorful sauces, which work best in my opinion when blended together on each bite of fish. The orange mango sauce didn't have a lot of flavor on its own bit worked particularly well with the citrus beurre blanc. The fish is served atop a small pillow of roasted fingerling potato over a bed of mashed potatoes, as well as a scattering of fresh vegetables around the plate. There are roasted apricots and oven dried tomatoes which accent the fish in an unexpected but delicious way. Finally there is a bit of crispy not at all chewy bacon which is the best bacon I've ever had.   I give Miga 5 stars for impeccable service, a thoughtful and beautiful design concept from floor to ceiling to table, and creative, modern artistic food that doesn't sacrifice taste or portion for its visuals."}
{"text":"From the 3 times I have been there I can't say I'm happy.   I went when they first opened and they had great staff, a wonderful bartender and my food was good. I had a chicken pasta with red pepper. It was well priced and tasted great. Our wine was well selected by our waiter and the bartender came over to check that we were happy. He had a very extensive knowledge of wine! Very impressive. After this good experience, I actually recommend Miga to friends and shared it on my Facebook.  The second time, I wanted to alter my order a little because of a food allergies. I guess this pissed the chef off and he said some pretty nasty things to our waiter. The manager was rude and snobby to us. Everything turned out fine, but there was a lot of tension going around and it ruined the night. You could hear the anger coming from the kitchen. Management problems are going to kill this place. They had none of the same staff when I went back and I asked about the waiter I had before and was told he no longer worker there, same for the bar tender. Wow. Only open a few month and can't hold staff.    I tried one more time. And won't be back. My food was cold, I waited forever for drinks and honestly, my steak was way over priced for what I got. Unless you order pasta, plan on leaving broke and hungry. I love food and this was far from impressive. Champaign/Urbana has a lot to offer for a foodie... Miga is not a good example.     The manager and and owners need to figure  out how to run a restaurant like this and get a new chef. Otherwise... I think Miga will be short lived."}
{"text":"I ate at Miga a few weeks ago with a friend. Our server he was incredibly friendly but seemed at times nervous when approaching our table, no biggie tho. We both ordered the same entree the Soy cream chicken pasta. My friend thought the dish was over salted...me I thought it tasted great I would def order it again. I've dined at Miga a few times and as far as I can tell they've never changed the menu. I'd love to see some new choices."}
{"text":"Today a group of 7 couples traveled to Miga's for Brunch to celebrate our August Anniversaries.  We wanted to visit because of the wonderful reviews we read about dinner.  The Sunday Brunch has only been available for less than a month and at first glance, the food choices might startle you, but don't let that stop you.  With a party of 14, we tried 6 of their 10 choices and there was not one person who was disappointed!  I ordered the most expensive item on the menu--the NY Strip Steak & eggs and it was prepared superbly.  It was cooked in sweet rice wine and topped with bacon kimchi cabbage and kimchi salsa with sunny side up eggs for $21 and I ate all of it.  It went well with the mimosa prepared with pineapple and my husband's was prepared with cranberry juice.  The presentation was excellent and this was a great choice for such a celebration.  My husband had the Lemon Chicken Salad as well as the Omelet Bowl and was able to devour them both and he is not a salad eater! The shaved Parmesan Cheese on top just added to the presentation.  Those in the party who ordered the Galbi Burrito could not say enough about it.  When you add to that the accommodating staff--especially our patient waiter, Jeremiah, this turned out to be the perfect choice for such a celebration.  We brought a cake to the restaurant on Saturday, along with some flowers, and they were very accommodating.  I felt that the prices were very reasonable for something so special.  One of the couples in our party is already planning on returning next Sunday to try something new!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best restaurant in Champaign-Urbana and in our top 5 in the world. The wasabi Caesar and butterfish entree are unbeatable."}
{"text":"Had a terrible meal. Waitress did not check back after delivering food. When we advised that we were disappointed they blamed us for not liking their food and did not offer anything to remedy."}
{"text":"Let's just start off by saying that Miga is hands down the best restaurant in the C-U area. The food is elegant with a bold taste. The white butter fish entree is the best seafood entree I have ever tasted. All of the cocktails are well prepared and creative. The Hana cocktail is vodka with freshly muddled strawberries and cucumbers, a wonderful drink that goes well with everything. The servers were all professional and extremely friendly. They made us feel welcome and explained the menu thoroughly. There was also a beautiful black and white movie playing on the wall during service which was a lovely touch to the sophisticated vibe of the restaurant. I recommend that everyone check out this amazing restaurant!!"}
{"text":"superb, food was exceptional. I had buns and scallops, both were truly amazing."}
{"text":"We were a party of 7 to trying Miga for the first time.  We love to get out every couple weeks and frequent similar establishments such as V. Picasso, Nando, and Bacaro for reference.  We very much liked the atmosphere/decor of Miga as well as the overall quality of the food.  However, the service and attention to detail fell way short of our expectations.  Service was very inconsistent and less than hospitable.  I didn't get the opportunity to order a salad or soup before the entree.  Others at our table were able to order soup, and I waited for our server to ask me (she never did) - I didn't know I had to get her attention and order something unprompted to be part of that round.  Also, I (and one other person in our party) ordered hot tea for our beverage - the water was just luke-warm and the tea bag cold barely steep in it.  I worked on getting that one finished (drank) so I could get another (hopefully) hot cup (I'd rather not complain to places that are making my food). After having an empty tea cup for about 30 minutes I asked the server and she produced two new cups of even cooler water for us.  I didn't even try to drink the second one as it was cooler than what you can get from a kitchen faucet.  Three of us in our party (of seven) ordered 3 flights of sushi to share (3 rolls per flight, so 9 specialty rolls total).  The first three rolls came out in a reasonable amount of time (maybe 15-20 minutes).  The second flight came out after about an hour - everyone else in our party had well finished eating their entrees.  We didn't want to be there for 3 hours and eat in front of the other 4 people for another hour+, so we canceled the third flight when the second was delivered.  The server said ok (like this was an unexpected request to make almost 90 minutes after we ordered our food) - then came back after a few minutes and said they have made two of the 3rd flight rolls already.  She offered that they can be boxed to-go (this wasn't the purpose of our dinner out with friends, but seemed to be logical to her).  Being nice, I said we would eat them if they could bring them out with the ones that were just delivered.  About 10 minutes later, the server showed up with two plastic containers of sushi and said there was a mix-up in communication with the kitchen, and they made them to-go anyway (something we never requested).  She dropped them on our table and scurried off, offering no further explanation or apology.  We started at each other in silence for several seconds after she left.  We went ahead and opened one (plastic container) on our table to try the sushi that we were hoping to enjoy as part of our meal.  Maybe a couple minutes later, our server literally dropped the check on our table and told us she'd take it when we were ready.  We hadn't asked for the check, and were not offered options for coffee, dessert, etc.  Just wow - our server was an unexpected focus and control of our usually fun evening out.  To no surprise, there were some other small details that were overlooked as well (we ran out of soy sauce for example).  If you are the type of customer that loves great service, I would recommend other nearby options.  I've never had a meal in this price range (we spent about $50/pp) and be so disappointed in service and detail.  We will happily keep to our regular rotation of other downtown dining establishments.  If you do flights of sushi with friends, KoFusion is hard to beat.  If you like upscale fine dining, try V. Picasso.  We love the casual fine dining and people at Nando Milano.  All three have outstanding food quality with great people that genuinely lift your eating experience through excellent service.  Miga is lacking here - at least for us on this particular experience."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my girlfriend and based on the decor and prices, I was expecting a solid meal. I left disappointed.  We started the evening with the seafood salad and it was clearly a dish that had not had much thought put into it. Some lettuce with calamari, shrimp and (crappy) mussels do not really make a salad. Plus, the decision to serve it on a square wooden plate was odd, to say the least.   The stone bowls with rice and beef (or in my girlfriend's case, shrimp and vegetables) were our chosen entrees. While everything looked good visually, there was just no real flavour in either of them. If you are serving a beef and rice dish, the beef better be seasoned appropriately and in this case, it wasn't. Adding insane amounts of hot sauce improved the dish but not nearly to the level it could have reached had spice been added during the cooking process.  Overall, with two beers and two glasses of wine, the meal came to $80 with tax and tip - about $20 too much for the food we ate."}
{"text":"Of the dozens of restaurants in Koreatown, new arrival Miga is on the pricier side. Positives: nice decor and atmosphere, very friendly service. Negatives: food. Beef and vegetables in stone pot was underflavoured. Braised short ribs in broth had nice texture, but the whole thing was too sweet, with no real zing. Plus, they're unusually stingy with the sides and kim chi refills."}
{"text":"Wine list had a nice selection and was reasonably priced. The sea scallops were wonderful and a great appetizer. Dumplings were flavorful and worth a try. Entrees that were tried: pork porterhouse (tender and amazing), salmon (fresh and flakey), and the smoked duck. The duck had a nice flavor but was slightly overcooked. We didn't need a dessert but our waiter told us anyways and they just had two flavored of ice cream... I am guessing they weren't expecting such a busy night, but that is an issue they will need to fix."}
{"text":"I went to Miga for the first time last night with a group of friends for my roommate's birthday. It was, hands down, the best restaurant experience I have ever had in Champaign-Urbana. First off, the atmosphere is an easy 10/10. The inside of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and and top-notch. The service was also amazing. Our waitress was super friendly, answered any questions we had regarding the menu, and checked in with us enough to ensure that we were doing okay and had our refills. It did not feel like she was checking in on us because it was her job; she really made us feel like she enjoyed making sure we were enjoying our meal. Even the general manager stopped at our table to see how we were doing. The food itself was also quite impressive. For such an expensive restaurant, we were expecting small portions, but all of our dishes were huge and had gorgeous presentation. Most importantly, the food was delicious. At some point during our visit, we informed the waitress that it was my roommate's birthday and she was more than happy to take photos for us. The icing on the cake was that she brought my roommate a birthday card signed by the staff as we prepared to leave the restaurant. Miga exceeded every single expectation I had for the night. Not only did my roommate enjoy his birthday dinner, but every one of us who attended enjoyed the experience and we all had a great time. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a higher end place to do dinner and drinks. This place can hold its own with the best in Chicago. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant in the Champaign - Urbana area!  We chose to dine here to celebrate our son't graduation from U of I.  We couldn't have been more pleased with our choice.   Hard to say exactly what cuisine they are but whatever it is, it works  for me!  First of all, their plating is exquisite!  And don't you eat first with your eyes?  I began my meal with the wasabi Ceasar salad.  It was excellent with large strips of bacon and the right amount of horseradish ceasar dressing.  It was spicy but in all the right ways and not at all overpowering.  It's pretty large so you can easily split it with a friend.  For my main course I had the soy milk pasta and chicken.  It was delicious.  Fair warning it is pretty rich.  We took half of it home.  It was almost as good the second day except that the chicken didn't have the same wonderful crispy crust that was there when fresh out of the kitchen.  Then since we were celebrating we decided to split some desserts.  I had a doughnut with honey milk dipping glaze.  They came out of the kitchen hot and fresh.  Might have been my best doughnut experience ever!  Service was good but could have been just a tad more attentive.  There were long periods of time when we would be waiting to ask for something and couldn't find our waiter."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. Absolutely LOVED the atmosphere, the ambience, really everything. The waiter was also amazing and I loved his humor! Why I'm giving this place such a low rating is because of their food. I had very high expectations but what I ordered was kind of a rip off. I ordered the MIGA Rice Cake Gnocchi but what I got was basically ddeokboki. Ddeokboki is a pretty well known street food of Korea and this gnocchi was anything but \"fusion.\" I was in disbelief that I was paying $17 for something I could make at home easily and they just renamed it to sound very fancy. I ordered the buns as appetizers and those were much more better than the actual entrée. Definitely would come back for those buns."}
{"text":"The place and the dishes has even an artistic feeling. Love the seared salmon steak. It's just that they haven't had any update to the menu since last year."}
{"text":"Really great food, very friendly and well traveled chef. The servers are good too. The Bulgolgi was really tasty, as was the chop cha noodles!"}
{"text":"Delicious, huge portions. Tried the gnocchi and the bibimbap. Great atmosphere. Very classy, but no dress code, so whatevs. Drinks were on the strong side, even the lychee martini and berry delux, which I expected to be a bit more on the sweeter side.   That said, I don't think it was worth $30/person. If I can get close to the same thing for cheaper on campus, probably don't want to spend the extra $10-$15 a person for the ambience."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning :((( which is unfortunate because my food was super good...I had the steak. My dad got the scallops and not so good...very fishy. Also there isn't much choice in what you get and I didn't really like it. Even if I hadn't gotten sick I prolly would not return. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Supreme Asian fusion restaurant. Price a little bit higher in range, but you won't regret it.   They used to have Sunday brunch before, but I don't know why they canceled it. Hey Miga, if you can see this, just wanna tell you that I really miss the brunch!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a date night it was absolutely amazing! Our appetizer was so fresh ! He had the halibut it was ridiculous! Very flavorful! I had the ribeye which was so different from anything I've had it was the best meat dish I've had in life! Desserts were life changing. Go eat here asap. !!"}
{"text":"Just found this place. Great atmosphere french/ Japanese fusion. Nice wine list. It is right next to disthl and right across the street from the Hyatt. Signage isn't great so hard to find. Food is all awesome."}
{"text":"Miga gave me food borne again! Last time was the garden salad, the sashimi was not fresh, and this time was the chicken pasta. I'm not sure if the chicken was cured with lemon or spoiled, but it was slightly sour and the fried layer was not crispy a whatsoever. In addition, we got an unpleasant time being served slow (wait for 45min for the entree), and the server did not say sorry when he spilled a lot of water on the table. Tip was also mandatory with over six people but we all had Bad experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go about once a month.  The food is consistently super delicious! Everyone I take there loves it.  Decor is kind of lacking but I don't mind. I love that that atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable and that the restaurant is quiet and byob. The servers are always friendly and I never feel rushed to pay the bill and leave.  **EDIT: The restaurant was sold and menu changed completely. I did not enjoy the food I had there after the ownership changed.**"}
{"text":"Delicious, very pricey but for good reason. Not once has our group had a bad experience with the food or service. The steak is something I always get and enjoy very much, they did have a changed of chefs and the change in flavor and cooking style was noticeable but it still came out with excellent taste."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and parents for my birthday...  Everything we ordered was spicy...super spicy...  The Cesar salad was huge and the wasabi flavor was very pronounced.  My dad and husband had the steak which was good but with the sauce and side was super spicy hot and hardly edible.  I had the butterfish which was super dry and not yummy.  Our server was very nice and attentive however the other server was extremely rude when we asked for appetizer plates when he delivered our food....in which he never returned so I had to get up and go to the bar to ask for plates for our table."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Probably one of the best sushis Ive eaten in my life. They recently hired a new sushi chef and he has been really living up to his name. Food entres are also magnificent, teied the stead Bibimbap and loved it. The steak was cooked medium rare to PERFECTION."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and a nice change to your normal Champaign restaurant."}
{"text":"It seems the restaurant is closed. We were here on Tuesday 6pm, door is locked and no one answer the phone. In face the phone is a fax # now. We waited for 15 minutes and called twice, no answer. Very disappointed. If the business has closed, or just for Tuesday, at least they should update the information."}
{"text":"Miga is extremely pretentious, incredibly overpriced, and not worth your time or effort.  I've been to Miga many times in the past couple years and while the service is usually top notch, the actual food and pricing is ridiculous in many situations. Today was the last straw. I came in with a group of friends to celebrate graduation and since I was hungry I decided to order a sushi roll in addition to an entree so I could box up some stuff to take home to eat the next day. I got a roll that I'd tried before and it was pretty good. The entree was called \"Rice Gnocchi\" and it was an absolute disgrace. There's a Korean dish called \"Dukbokki\" which is essentially rice cakes covered in kimchi and gochujan sauce. My entree was the exact same thing but it had some cream in the sauce along with some chopped up tofu. It was so unpalatable that I tried a couple bites, and then pawned it off to my friends. Everyone at the table agreed that it was ridiculous. It's not Gnocchi, they only called it that to make it seem like something it wasn't. The dish costs about $5 basically anywhere else and also tastes better elsewhere. This place shouldn't focus some much on being pretentious but rather try harder to make good food. The gimmicks don't mean anything if the food sucks. It's expensive, it should be high quality. Another friend ordered the lamb and while it apparently tasted great, the plate made no sense for the dish. It had super high walls even though the dish required a fork and knife to eat. Again, pretentious and not good for the dining experience.  The server was extremely nice and she was great. I did feel she was a little confused (there's a yelp check in offer and she didn't seem to know what it was) but in general she was super helpful and had great recommendations.  The food came out in a slightly weird order-- the sushi came out with the appetizers while the people who got entrees had to wait.  If you come in, definitely stick with the sushi and stay away from the weird, pretentious, bad entrees this place is cooking up. The apps are also pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, small menu (which I like). Love the tofu bi bim bap, but make sure you ask for it to be vegetarian if you are veg. One of the more upscale places in town -- perfect for a date, or if you have city friends visiting from out of town. Also love their drink menu, and their brunch menu is wonderfully unique! I'd happily give 5 stars if there were more vegetarian-friendly menu items."}
{"text":"first time here and it was a very nice experience. Place is quiet and well organized. Food was  delicious, service was great too. I'll definitely come again and recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Came to Miga with a friend to check out the upscale reputation of the restaurant, and left with the impression that its reputation is only due to its decor rather than its food.  Pros: atmosphere  Cons: The appetizer I ordered was the kung pow broccoli. Why they named it kung pow broccoli when it was just deep fried breaded broccoli that had some terrible paste mouthfeel due to the breading? I don't know, because \"kung pow\" taken from Chinese influenced cooking style requires an extremely hot wok and well cooked vegetables, not deep fried doughy mess. The flavors were lackluster, but the quantity was fair.  I ordered the main scallops entree and regretted it before it even got to my table. The table next to ours also ordered the scallops and I could smell the amine/formaldehyde odor from the scallops, this is a red flag indicator that the scallops used were not fresh and should not be used- any half decent chef should be able to detect this in their seafood if it was off as the smell is intense.  When my scallops arrived, thankfully there was not the same level of ammonia/formaldehyde that I smelled from the neighboring table. The overall flavoring of the dish was overly sweet which completely eclipsed the natural sweetness and the delicate flavors of the scallops. Scallops should never be cooked with so much sugar or whatever sweet sauce they used. There were 3 scallops and 1 of the 3 had a very strong ammonia flavor due to it not being fresh, but thankfully the other 2 were ok.  The dish also came with rice balls that were seared/fried on one side - which had an extremely tough texture of the seared side.  I wouldn't be as harsh if it weren't for the pricing of the dishes, but this is absolutely over the top for the poor quality of food serviced.  If you're looking for a satisfying meal, definitely look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the communal seating. No tables for 2 in the entire place.  Aside from that, charging $15 for one scallop gave me the impression this place takes itself a little too seriously.  Food tasted good and service was fine too.  Drinks were also very good."}
{"text":"A great place to go for upscale deconstructed Korean Food.  Here are my thoughts:  the best and i mean the BEST! miso ramen I have had in champaign, better than Sakanaya. I would go back just to eat that.  The Ceviche was the worst I have had! The shrimp was spoiled and the concept did not work for me.  Galbi rib-eye looked good, in fact everything looked pleasing to the eye.  I just thought there was too much effort to add fried kimchi on the main entree.  The young chef needs to figure this out a little more.  Otherwise it is still a well run restaurant, young and hip, and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I ordered Buddhism Bi Bim Bap for my dinner. It was delicious with a great decoration. The starter sashimi garden salad was also good too. Definitely come back with my friends :) good food for the price :)"}
{"text":"Never have a chance to go there in person.  The reason is: We reserved a reservation, but Miga just cancel on us after 5 days. Overbooked? like UA? Bad customer service..."}
{"text":"We have been to Miga for dinner, brunch, and drinks.   When it comes to drinks the Hana is absolutely amazing.  I do not like sweet drinks and this one does a really good job of not being too harsh but not too sweet as well.  It is an amazing drink, but watch out it will catch up to you!  My husband loves the Old fashions there.  They are probably the best we've ever had.  We go in sometimes just to get a drink at the bar because we know it will be amazing.  For our dinner, we definitely went all out.  We shared the wasabi Caesar and the scallop as an appetizer.  The salad was sooooo unique and delicious.  The scallop came with bacon foam on top and this amazing thick cut bacon around it.  Even though it was only 1 scallop it was enough to share between two people for an appetizer.  For dinner I had the beef bi bim bap and my husband the tuna.   The tuna was awesome though I've had just as good other places.  The bi bim bap was quite large and also delicious.  I am new the Korean food so I have nothing to compare it to but I absolutely loved it!  The beef was marinated well and very tender.  The bowl was full of so many flavors and I actually had to take some home it was so big.    We did end with dessert as well which was Korean ice cream.  Also very very yummy!   Overall our experience at Miga was the best dinner we've ever had in the CU area.    Today we had brunch.  The Bloody Mary was awesome.  I got the the wasabi Caesar salmon salad which was amazing and my husband got the chashu bun Benedict was very good as well.  It's not a cheap place, but definitely worth the money for a special occasion and more affordable but still just as delicious at brunch.   Update: We went to brunch again yesterday for my dad's birthday.  My parents aren't as adventurous with food but we insisted they would enjoy it and they absolutely loved it.  I loved the new Christmas tree they put up and Christmas music they were playing.   It felt very festive and cool in there. My mom and I got the galbi burrito and it was amazing. Husband got the omelette bowl and it was great as well.  My dad loved the wasabi Caesar salad of course.  Yet another solid and memorable trip to Miga.  I will continue to support this place as often as we can afford!  Hoping it sticks around for a long time!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place in downtown Champaign. The food and service are always amazing. I made a reservation for a friends birthday and were so excited to find out we were given a private room! It was beautiful. I had the beef tartare and it was seriously the best tartare I have ever had in my life. Sometimes the food can be a little spicy for me but they can tone it down if you ask.  The chef stopped in to say hello as well as the the manager. It was a beautiful birthday celebration for my friend. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Really REALLY not impressed. The food was all of the microwave variety and had no taste. I don't even cook Asian food, but I'm pretty sure if I just followed a recipe for bibimbap, let's say, it would turn out significantly better than what you get at Miga. The owner even admitted a while back on another site that their focus is making food for \"non-Koreans\", which I don't think is a good thing! No flavor, not fresh, and pretty embarassing to even serve stuff like that and call it Korean food."}
{"text":"My group of 12 had a fantastic experience at Miga! Stellar cocktails are served, with plenty of other choices available (note: there is room to expand the beer selections though). I missed on the sake but that leaves something to come back for. Sushi was excellent (highly recommend the Mexican roll), and of course the entrees did not miss. Sprinkle in the setting, ambience and service and, we'll, that equals a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance, but that's pretty much it.  Update: their beef slices were always barely cooked in the center, which is fine as long as they can guarantee sanitation, which they couldn't. Had stomach flu soon after dining here."}
{"text":"OK...so if you are going to look fancy and be pretentious....you need to back it up with great service and delicious food.  Miga, fails to deliver.  A group of 5 of us came in here after a work event while travelling.  We saw the pictures of the dishes online and it definitely stuck us as creative and delicious food.  I will say, that the eye appeal of everything during this experience was great.  The atmosphere of the restaurant, the glassware, the silverware and even the wine decanters  were beautiful.  The dishes that came out, were also designed beautifully.  If this were an art show, I'd have given a higher rating but unfortunately good looks from your restaurant and food only get you so far in my book...you need your food to be on point.  Since we got many dishes, I won't go over them in too many details but will point at the standouts/fails.   The Bibimbop for example was a MEGA fail.  Presentation wise it was great as I mentioned above, but the beef was a pure let down.  If anyone has ever had bibimbop, you'd know that beef in it is Bulgogi which is a thin cut sauteed beef in a korean type sauce.  They basically grilled some steak and put it in there.  Ugh.  The Katshu dish, was breaded pork belly and it was so badly over cooked that my colleague who ordered it didn't even finish the dish.  He let me try a slice and it was awful.  I had the pork belly stuffed ravioli.  While the sauce they used was really good and the raviolis were cooked well...the \"pork belly\" stuffing was ground up pork...it lost all flavor whatsoever....it could have been any type of meat for all I knew.  Very disappointing.  For an appetizer, I had their \"steak tartar\", and it was tartar spread over what seemed to be wonder bread....the tartar could have been good for all I know..but it was nearly impossible to tell with the overwhelming white bread that drew away from the thin layer of tartar.  HUGE miss here.  I did enjoy one of their appetizers however.  The pork belly Bao was good.  It actually had a well cooked pork belly slice in a nice soft chewy bao.   I would honestly never come here again...it was a huge miss for being so expensive and pretentious."}
{"text":"Exceptional food, clean clear flavors with nigiri that was super fresh. Desert didnt disappoint  either wow excellent  service, excellent  food I would definitely recommend. I will  definitely  be back."}
{"text":"Korean, Japanese and American fusion restaurant. First time to visit and I like here.  Quality: 5 stars. I guess they are care about each ingredient. All of foods were delicious and fine. They are also picky about plates and utensils.  Volume: 4 stars. Not enough but not small. For us, it was just right.  Price: 4 stars. Not too cheap, but not expensive taking their quality of dishes and atmosphere into consideration.  Staff: 5 stars. Our server was perfect. He politely took care of us. Friendly, quick and having professional attitude.  Atmosphere: 5 stars. Clean, new and moody. You can bring your precious one and business partners.  I strongly recommend you to visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow, the expectations for this place were nothing considering it was our first visit, but we were absolutely blown away!  The miso ramen soup was perfect.  The most flavorful broth and noodles I've ever tasted!  The star of the show was the wasabi caeser salad.  Never before tasted anything that unique/great on a salad.  If you don't get this, you are doing yourself a disservice!"}
{"text":"Came for some sushi after hearing they had a newly opened sushi bar. We've been disappointed in most of the sushi in town. The rolls we ordered were all delicious. The fish was high quality, along with the additional ingredient in and on each roll. The rolls were beautiful and just melted in my mouth with so much flavor. This was my first experience at Miga, but we'll definitely be coming back.   That being said, we did order some cocktails which were a bit too expensive and not quite my taste, but they were nice and creative despite. Perhaps someone else's cup of alcohol in this case.   Wait staff were attentive and very helpful, and the atmosphere was great!   Pictured are our rolls - poke, spider (a bit too full but still very tasty), the hungry (my favorite), and the black dragon (my boyfriend's favorite)."}
{"text":"The plating of the food and overall decor of the restaurant is outstanding. Great place for formal and fancier occasions. The fusion of Korean and French food is very interesting. I wanted the orange glazed salmon steak, but they ran out so I got the angus galbi rib-eye steak. The steak itself was pretty good, but wasn't a fan of the kimchi fried rice it came with. My boyfriend got the white butter fish which he enjoyed. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time celebrating at Miga last night. We had a group of 11 and the restaurant has lovely intimate private rooms for groups to reserve. The service was attentive and friendly. The plates are beautifully presented and delicious.  This was a special occasion and the restaurant and staff helped add to the great memories made last night. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"What happened?  I had been to Miga on many occasions since the restaurant opened.  The dishes were creative, spicy and delicious. Having been gone the last year, I had not visited in a while and I was very much looking forward to a great dinner.   My disappointment began from the moment I opened the menu.  Gone were most of the inventive dishes that used to be featured on the menu, replaced with ordinary seeming dishes, with unimaginative ingredients. But, I noticed that a new sushi bar had been added (which our server failed to mention, unlike the other better server who was attending to the rest of the tables). So, I decided to give it a try and ordered the Yellowtail Crudo.  Well, if traditionally sushi chefs apprentice for many years before ever touching fish, then this sushi chef had spent approximately 5 minutes watching a YouTube video before massacring my Yellowtail.  The slices were all of varying thickness, size and composition.  On top of that, the seasoning was desperately bland, which did not help the fact that the fish tasted freezer burned. UGH. What a letdown!  Last but not least, I thought the Bibimbap would save the day. I remember in times past it arriving in a beautiful presentation. Today I received a bunch of sad ingredients in a tragic looking bowl. The beef was barely seared, lacking seasoning and the salad looked like the sad remnants of the bottom of a bag.  Had this restaurant never been good, I wouldn't be so upset. But this used to be a great restaurant. I still remember the spicy noodle dish with the bonito flakes fondly.  I will say that the drinks were quite good. The Yuzu mule was delicious and the beer recommendation was spot on. But that's the only good thing I'll say about service.  The worst part of dinner was that our server seemed annoyed at the fact that my dinner companion only ordered sparkling water, and the server repeatedly pressured him to order something else.  That is not ok, for so many reasons."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for an impromptu dinner, without reservations, which forced us to sit at the bar. This turned out to be the best spot in the house! The bartender, while learning the trade, was friendly and super fun to watch! My husband and I ordered several dishes to share, so we could try several things without overeating. We ordered mandu, beef Korean soup, and salmon bi bim bop - all dishes were beautifully presented and delicious. Dessert fell a little flat, as we ordered mochi (store bought, but plated beautifully) and a soufflé (which was actually frozen mousse), and a cappuccino made from a Keurig (I could not believe my eyes). I understand the cost benefits of having a Keurig, but for a high end restaurant, at this price point, and with the variety available at their bar with such house crafted drinks, one would expect - at least - a small Spaziale or a Gaggia espresso machine, which are easy to run and will satisfy the picky coffee aficionado, or even the everyday Americano drinker. Or, even better, offer Korean instant coffees - many great ones to choose from and would make more sense than low-quality Gevalia. Overall, it was an excellent experience and I would go again, but would go somewhere else for coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"Food: delicious. Service: fair sliding to poor.  Our family of 6 celebrated with an early Sunday dinner after U of I graduation.  The service was a bit slow initially, but we chalked it up to a busy night due to the university graduation crowd.  We ordered cocktails and entrees - no starters. After about a 30 minute wait for our meals, 5 of our party received their dinners from other wait staff. Being raised right we didn't want to eat until all of us had been served. We waited another 5 minutes or longer and finally caught our server to inquire about the 6th missing entree. The server apologized, went to the kitchen and promptly delivered the last entree to the table. That tells me the meals were all ready at the same time but the servers didn't pay attention to the order. Fail 1.  After finishing our meals (yummy inventive Asian flavors), the table was cleared and we waited for the dessert menu. Instead, the server brought the check. We said we wanted to hear about desserts, and the reply was that the manager had instructed staff to turn tables over in 1.5 hours. Basically, pay and get out. Fail 2.   In 40+ years of fine dining we have never before encountered such a situation. The chef and kitchen team have their act together, but the management/service team seems completely disjointed. This restaurant won't last if they don't treat customers better. It's too bad because we really liked the food and would otherwise return."}
{"text":"If I could give this 10 stars just for the wonderful hostess and service I would. And then the food really really impressed me, especially for a place like Chambana... it was probably the best meal I've ever had in my 4 years at UIUC. I highly recommend Miga to anyone who wants a memorable, well serviced meal. It's honestly worth the price. We came around May 2015 because my boyfriend was treating me and my 2 roommates to celebrate our graduation and I really wish I hadn't waited so long to try this place! The next time I come back to visit campus, this is definitely on the top of my list to revisit.   We made a reservation and even got a call a day earlier to remind/confirm. When we got there, something was wrong with our table (the party was being awfully rude and refused to leave) and our hostess was so extremely apologetic. For some reason she felt personally liable (when it wasn't her fault at all) and told us to order anything we wanted from the bar on her tab. So right off the bat, I fell in love with Miga's service. I got the $11 Hana (loved the strawberry and cucumber hints) and it was delicious, and my roommate's Green Tea Mojito was pretty unique as well. My bf got the $15 MIGA Old Fashioned (Bulleit rye, muddled cherry, orange, sugar cube, bitters) and it came with those cool sphere ice cubes.  When our table was ready (it was only maybe a 20 min wait, our hostess seriously was being so overly accommodating and sweet... gah I really wish I remembered her name. Kelly?). We started with the $16 Beef SSAM (wrap-it-yourself korean style marinated beef that you wrap with lettuce, rice, this delicious sauce and kimchi salsa). It's super fun since it comes on top of a small grill and it's perfect size to share with a table of 4.   I got the $18 Salmon Bibimbap and the serving was enormous. The salmon comes on another cute personal grill and the bibimbap rice & veggies (sauteed bean sprouts, pickled cucumber, carrots, perfectly cooked giant slices of shiitake mushroom, crisp lettuce, all topped with a perfect sunny side up egg) comes a very, very large wooden bowl. I barely finished 1/3 of it even though it was so delicious; all the flavors and textures complimented each other so well. The chilli pepper sauce is perfect; make sure to indulge in it (don't worry it's not too spicy)!   My roommates shared a Bibimbap and they didn't even finish theirs either. The bae got the $28 Galbi Rib-Eye Steak on top of kimchi cabbage, and it came with this extremely tasty side dish of kimchi bacon pilaf kind of fried rice topped with cute micro greens."}
{"text":"Some of the best Sushi I've ever had! I live in Denver but come to Champaign a few times a year for business and I always have dinner at Miga. This time I happened to stumble in on their second night to offer a full sushi menu. I'm not gonna lie...at first I was bummed because I was really looking forward to the sea bass which is no longer on the menu.  I decided to stay because the owner had already come by to greet me and brag about the new sushi menu. I was skeptical (and so sad I wasn't getting miso sea bass!) but all that went away when I tasted my first dish, the yellowtail crudo. OMG it was truley amazing and so so fresh. From there I had the Mexican Roll (tuna, cilantro, I can't remember what else), then the maguro nigiri. I really can't say enough as to how amazing it all was. I loooove sushi and love to put my fancy sushi dinners on the boss' credit card all over the country. I can't say how pleasantly surprised I was to find such an amazing place, especially in Champaign. Miga will still be my go to place when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Environment is awesome. Service is off. As previous review mentioned, chashu bun is a must try. Fried apply pie is special. However, the waitress is not prompt, who won't come to check if water is needed for the entire dinner."}
{"text":"Nice environment and atmosphere for dating but the food taste may not match. We ordered Beef SSAM, Zen Style Ceviche, Mandu, and Chashu Bun for appetizer. They all have delicate plates but with my highest expectation, ceviche did not reach what I thought, tuna not fresh, no soy sauce and wasabi for the fish. Chashu Bun was also far below my expectation, at least that's not as the traditional Chinese bun as it should be. We all agreed that the dishes with beef would be the greatest, no matter the appetizer or the entree Bi Bim Bap with beef. Anyway I don't think it deserved the high price."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants for fine dining in Champaign. Located right in the heart of downtown, Miga is a modern fusion of Asian and American food. Their fish and sushi dishes are super tasty. Each and every dish on the menu is thoughtfully prepared and the presentation is top-notch. They have a really nice private room which you can reserve for a large party. The service is very friendly and environment is upscale. Miga is a perfect place for a date or professional meeting. I'm proud to have taken many of my good friends here."}
{"text":"Great food & service! Nicely decorated! Our waiter was attentive & we ordered a salad & entree that we shared! Delicious!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Food was great and the presentation was beautiful. Jamie our waiter took such good care of us. He was such a good sport! Can't say enough wonderful things about this place! I'll be definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came by for a solo dinner here, and loved every minute of it. What I thought was going to be a simple dinner turned out to be a spontaneous treat for myself. Nick took really good care of me even while he was busy running around helping other tables. He recommended a Spanish Blanc to start off the meal. Light, dry, well-balanced with plenty of depth.  I had the Soy Cream Louisiana Chicken Pasta paired with a Riesling (can't remember the name). The dish was all-around fantastic. The sauce was moderately thick with plenty of heat, bow-tie pasta was cooked to perfection, and the chicken was so crispy on the outside, I almost enjoyed slicing into the meat as much as I enjoyed the meal itself, ha. The Riesling was mildly sweet enough to match the heat from the pasta. Simple and spectacular. I loved it.  Overall, I felt like I got what I paid for, and then some. I'd love to come back for a full coursed dinner (eyes on that garden steak). Well done, Miga!"}
{"text":"We ordered our favorite. White rice with soy sauce. The food was great. The atmosphere was great. The staff was great. Especially the cook with the scruffy facial hair and faux hawk. I think his name was Seth. He was really knowledgeable and added the perfect amount of soy sauce to our rice. Will definitely come back the next time were in town!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We made reservation at 7 pm, we waited for 40 minutes. They said whoever finishes will give us the table. So what is the benefit of making a reservation. We have 7 people, they arranged us to seat in front of the entrance because they overbooked. Price is $$$ but service is terrible !"}
{"text":"Ambitious yet incomplete.  We had total 4 dishes: Angus Galbi Rib-eye steak, Soy Cream Chicken pasta, Sea scallop, and Spot prawn cocktail. I was quite satisfied with the sea scallops. But I do believe that other three dishes, which were conceptually 'well-designed', could be improved in delivery.  I loved the marination and the doneness of the Angus Galbi Rib-eye steak. However, I question if the sautéed Kimchi and Bacon and Kimchi pilaf were going well with the steak. Theoretically, I do think that fresh-sour flavors of Kimchi would help balance the taste of the dish as a whole. But instead, I found both sautéed Kimchi and pilaf being too fatty. Considering the fattiness of the steak itself, I came to believe that one should select a different type of Kimchi, and/or reduce the amount of fat used in the sides.  For the Soy Cream Chicken pasta, I think the cutlet was a bit too hot when it was served to our table. I must say that I loved everything else of the dish, especially the sauce.  Spot prawn cocktail was very beautiful in its presentation, but I needed to spend a bit of time peeling the prawn to start eating. After peeling, the prawn (without its humongous head) looked so small compared to the amount of seaweed served. Well, it's midwest and I cannot really complain too much about the amount of fresh seafood I am served of.  About the service- it was truly fantastic. The lady at our table was super-responsive and kind."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Champaign. I've eaten here probably a dozen times and it never disappoints. Really cool ambiance, and an ever changing Korean fusion menu that has never disappointed. Great brunch menu as well. Service is consistently strong, which is tough to find at an upscale restaurant in Champaign-Urbana. We've had one waiter in particular, William, who has been consistently excellent. My one minor criticism is that I don't always think the bar matches the kitchen. While they are also creative, they are sometimes slow, and I don't think the cocktails consistently match the excellence of the kitchen."}
{"text":"We dined here last month when we were passing through town and it was one of the best experiences we have ever had!!  It really felt more like the experiences we have in downtown Chicago than what you would expect from downtown Champaign.  Our waiter provided the most impeccable service  - from explaining the drink menu and offering suggestions of his favorites, providing us with small sampling of a desert wine, giving amazing details on his favorite dishes and offering helpful suggestions and overall being very attentive despite the fact that he had two very large tables in addition to our two top.  And the food, oh the food, thoughtfully presented FRESH fish with interesting and delicious components.  The scallops, the dumplings and the Shashimi Garden Salad were all to die for.  Kudos to the chef and the amazing wait staff!  We are actually going back next week as we pass through town again.  Miga is a must try!"}
{"text":"Miga - Korean BBQ is the latest addition to Koreatown, a second location from their original Mississauga spot.  Stopped in after seeing the grand opening sign and the new mod-looking front space. Inside is huge.   Lunch specials including a number of stone pots (rice, beef, veggies, etc,) in a hot stone bowl that warms and cooks.   They start you off with a few tasting dishes, bean spouts, soy yams and kim chi - nice touch.  Tried the beef, eggs, veggies, solid. Ingredients well-balanced and the stone pot left behind a nice charred, chewy rice crust.  The soft-tofu stew, spicy, really was lacking in quality broth. Tofu was large chunks with little flavour.   Overall, a nice space to grab a quick stone pot lunch. Not sure about the BBQ side so I'll have to hold off final judgment but I'd likely head to Buk Chang Dong first, tastier and cheaper."}
{"text":"Went for a girls' night here. The food is fabulous. Champaign Urbana...you have to discover this place. The chef's garden steak was discovered by the owner in Korea and he loved the entree  so much he said: come work for me in Champaign,Ill. The food was exquisitely displayed and flavored perfectly. I ordered the Bi Bim Bop...loved the combined heartiness of rice, greens and beautifully grllled steak. Ladies will love the darling individual grill served w/ the entree. Every dish was delicious. The server Jamie was tons of fun and provided wonderful friendly service."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've dined here, most recently for my birthday party. We had a reservation for 8 at 8:45 on a Saturday night on 2/20.   MIGA is probably the best place in the CU for a fancier date or gathering. The ambience of the interior is really beautiful. Modern with spot lighting, but not too dark so that you can't see your food or your companions. The noise level was perfect; just enough background chatter to be lively but quiet enough to easily hold conversations. The black and white films on back wall add a nice touch. The dishes and plating were sleek, not superfluous. The chairs were super comfortable and there was plenty of space between tables; you don't feel cramped at all. The bathrooms are also really nice; extremely clean and sleek. Check it out! They even have Q-tips and cotton puffs if you need them.  I ordered a Korean style gnocchi dish; it was flavorful and satisfying (the fish cake was really tasty too), yet the flavor of the sauce could have been ~slightly more complex and layered. I think it was the perfect amount of heat and spice, but some of my friends tried it and thought it was way too spicy (so, if you can't handle the two peppers near the title of the dish, don't say I didn't tell you!). The Buddhism Bi Bim Bap was a huge hit, whether with beef, salmon, or tofu. Everyone who ordered it had more than enough to eat, and it seemed like an endless abyss of food in the large wooden bowls it was served in. The only minor complaint is that one of my friends who ordered the beef thought it was a bit too rare, but it depends on what you like (the Tuna Steak was rare, and my boyfriend didn't have a problem, so ask the waiter if you can have it served medium well; I'm sure you can).  My boyfriend ordered the MIGA Crunch Fries and Tuna Steak, both which he thought were good. I tried the Crunch Fries, and for fries they were refreshingly light and fluffy. I also sampled the MIGA Sashimi Garden Salad, and the sashimi was fresh and flavorful. The greens were dressed appropriately and the presentation was very appealing with edible flowers. Another one of my friends ordered the Sea Scallops-- I did notice, however that there weren't many scallops for the price tag. The same goes for White Butter Fish, but both of my friends thought their dishes were delicious. The portions for Noodle and Rice dishes were very large in comparison to the main courses, and less expensive.  For drinks, I ordered the It's Seoul Good. I didn't like it at my first sip. I passed it around the table to see if anyone would. 8 people tried it, and no one liked it for different reasons. I thought it was too harsh, my boyfriend and his friend thought the taste was strange and weak. It tasted of neither vodka, soju or cranberry. It sat on the table until the end of the night, when my boyfriend gulped in down to get rid of it. According to our waiter, the Hana is supposed to be good, but I didn't find out. Another person ordered a mule and thought it was done well. My boyfriend ordered the Stiegl radler and it was about 3 dollars cheaper than Barrelhouse 34, where we ended up later in night. So. I have a feeling the cocktails may be hit or miss.  Our server was attentive and, up until a mishap where he knocked over a water glass onto the White Butter Fish, everything was good. He did have it replated, but it seemed to take a bit too long. In general, the food was a bit slow coming, but the White Butter Fish replating was excessive. The server could have been a bit more positive about his job, but he was entertaining and genuine. There could possibly be more training to avoid accidents.  Overall, it was a great experience and I highly recommend you try it. Update: Sashimi salad is now my standby- it's always good.  P.S.  MIGA, You should start having a sushi menu... pretty please???  tl;dr  ambiance 5/5  service 3.5-4/5  food 3.5-4/5  overall price to quantity & quality 3/5 (depends on dish) total experience: 4/5 Would I come back? Sure"}
{"text":"OLD: Pity I gave this place 3 stars, but my friend and I both found our food salty to the point that we could  not enjoy the other flavours. Why else would you order a burrito and eggs benedict at an Asian fusion restaurant? That said, the menu is good, the portions are solid, meat is marinated and cooked to perfection, the decor is an eclectic mix of textures on a mild colour palette. Their version of pico de gallo with my burrito was amazing. I loved the black sesame and fresh mustard! So as long as there's no heavy hand on the salt, your entire dining experience would be good. I plan to come back and update this review when I do!  UPDATE: Did the dinner menu this time. Loved the smoothness of the tequila-based cocktail. Chomped down the dumplings, and smoked duck with brussel sprouts and sticky rice, scallops with truffle and lentils, fried donuts, and espresso mochi... ahh #foodgasm  MORE UPDATES: This is our go-to place every odd month coz we grabbed their Instagift coupons so the prices go down easier! Their cocktails are so great we buy the ingredients and try them out ourselves. The tuna steak is a regular in our order- I like EVERYTHING in that dish. EVERYTHING. Gnocchi is only good if you eat it fresh, the porterhouse pork has simple flavours but the tenderness is uneven, and we'll be trying the ribeye and salmon calamari next."}
{"text":"Good food, but at \"big city\" prices. Frustratingly slow/inattentive service at our visit.  We had diner for six during a busy University weekend (graduation). Our table was ready at the time of our 8:15 reservation and we were seated right away. However, it seemed like they booked three large tables in the same section at the same time, and our table was the loser. We should have figured it out when we'd been sitting for 10+ minutes before the waitress even appeared.   It's really frustrating when you want to spend more money at a place, but you cannot get the attention of anyone to bring you another drink, or get a second round of sushi ordered. After being there for an hour and a half, we gave up and left wishing we'd been able to spend more money at Miga.   Gracious service from what seemed to be an experienced waitress when we did see her.   I might give this place another chance as the food was good, but I'd look at sitting at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Delicious for brunch or dinner. Love the \"gnocci\" and the braised pork belly. Worth the $$$"}
{"text":"Third trip to Miga. More impressed with the food.   Still feel like the no hot sake policy is short-sighted. Trying a little too hard.  Waitress was friendly, but must have interrupted us ten times during dinner.  Still the sexiest restaurant space in town. The black and white movies are an awesome touch."}
{"text":"I had the best dinner tonight at Miga. The wine list, ceviche, sushi, steak, and dessert all exceeded my expectations and we had tons of food and wine for a very reasonable price. When I made that reservation for dinner I never imagined I'd be so blown away by that entire meal. The service was very good. Best dinner I've had in a while."}
{"text":"I think Miga is one of the most expensive restaurants in town but it's worth the money!  We went with friends and families but never disappointed us with the quality of food and the setting is wonderful.  It is definitely not the place you can visit every week to eat with friends or coworkers because of the price.  It's worth to visit on special occasions with your loved ones, best friends, and family members.  They serve in a very nice plate, well decorated, and the quality of the food is well done.  The staffs were extremely friendly and kind and explained all the food in details.  Overall, good experience and will come back again :)"}
{"text":"I was fairly conflicted about how many stars to give this restaurant. I've visited 4 times now, always for dinner and this review would be a combination of all. The best part about this place is the location. It's in the heart of downtown Champaign. Theres plenty of parking around here from the flat lot across the street to the garage in the back. The ambiance and decor are good too.  Now as far as the food goes that's where there's a lot of room for improvement. Like a lot! For starters it is not at all vegan, vegetarian or pescatarian friendly. Even the salmon that comes with the bi bim bap had something to do with beef broth, tofu for vegetarians isn't free from contamination via oil. Soups and salad all have meat minus the house salad. Why would a restaurant at this level leave such groups of eaters out is beyond me. Next is desserts there's no dessert menu mochi in different flavors is available & some times there'd be mediocre tasting apple pie with ice-cream. The presentation of food however has always been excellent.  As far as service goes, I've had two subpar experiences. Once our food got served to the couple at the table next to us and it was sitting there for 4-5 mins while those people complained that that's not their order then they realized and just picked it up and served it to us. On another visit I specifically asked for plain rice instead of the pork rice which comes with ahi tuna steak, got served the pork rice anyways and the rest of my table was almost done by the time the corrected order came. Now at a mid level restaurant these experiences wouldn't have been as big a deal to me, but considering the level of restaurant Miga is aiming to be and the prices they charge for the food. They should really try and do better."}
{"text":"The ambience is quite excellent! There was a bit of a wait for our food, but it ended up being worth it.  We ordered the mandu appetizer which wasn't really remarkable. One of us ordered the soy cream chicken pasta which was very reasonable on the portion size. Everything was cooked well (the chicken was nicely breaded). Watch out for the heat though! The other person ordered the orange glazed salmon. It was a little small for the price, but the taste was good. When they say medium rare on the menu, they meant it!   I recommend giving this place a try if you're looking for a more up-scale place for a date!"}
{"text":"I ordered sashimi salad and chashu bun. They are all great. The sauce for salad is tasty and special. I have to say it is the best salad I had in town. It is not something you can find in most restaurants. If salad could be tasty like this, I do not mind eating it every day. Chashu is great too. If you want to try decent food, this is definitely the one"}
{"text":"I've been to Miga around 10 times in the last 2 years. It's always been tasty but also on the pricey side for what you get. With that in mind, the atmosphere and elegance are considered when I pay the bill. Last night I think it was definitely worth every penny. I had the best experience. The bill was $85 including tip. I got the spider sushi roll, 3 beers, miso soup, and a steam bun. The wife got 2 beers, big beef udon noodle dish, and miso soup, as well. We also split a weird ice cream desert.   The new menu and sushi options are fantastic. The chashu bun with the new fried chicken for $4 is the best deal in town! I can't explain what made last night so good, other than the food was on point, interesting, the service was speedy and relaxing, and the beer was cold. I'd highly recommend trying the new menu and the sushi. I'm ready to go back!"}
{"text":"Mom's weekend dinner at the U of I and I was so pleasantly surprised with this amazing meal. It is Asian fusion  and so incredibly flavorful. We started off with the Dumplings which were to die for. We also had the scallop appetizer which was good, a little underwhelming as it was only 1 scallop but still good. For the entree we had the beef SSAM, which was absolutely amazing. It was like deconstructed lettuce cups and I could eat it all day. My mom had the sticky rice gnocchi which she said was very good and spicy. Everything was very similar to how my traditional Korean grandmother makes food. We had David as our waiter/bartender and he was fantastic. Such great service from him. Overall such a great experience and I will definitely be back. Well done Miga."}
{"text":"Meal was wonderful.   Staff was attentive.   Then we are relaxing and paying bills and lights go to surgical strength!  Reallly!?  Sorry, says manager,  \"staff meeting \"  excuse me, I just popped $500+ and it's Spanish inquisition?  Lose lose.  Sorry Miga,  need to focus on customer service!  Not sure if I'd come back Ps. Staff busy setting up drinks for themselves for \"meeting\" .  Really!?  We are paying for u being there!  Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Miga has great fresh food, from the (new) sushi bar to the steaks. The dream roll, volcano roll, and Mexican rolls were all great. But the nigiri were probably their best asset as they were incredibly fresh and juicy (tried several from the sushi deluxe). The tuna rolls and bi bim bap were excellent as well. But my personal favorite was the Hwe Dup Bop, which is a bowl of sashimi, vegetables, and rice mixed together. Not a huge fan of the doughnut holes or the mochi ice cream balls (though I'm not a fan of mochi in general) so I probably won't be ordering dessert there again, which is fine because everything else really fills you up.   The ambiance is pretty trendy and upscale for champaign, which may be good or bad depending on what you prefer. If you do go, make sure to come with money. But I'd say it's absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"While visiting C-U, my boyfriend and I came here for lunch with my aunt and her husband. I didn't expect much but I was pleasantly surprised by this place! Miga's decor was very modern and somewhat fancy... fancy for Champaign that is. My boyfriend and I are from San Francisco, so when we saw the prices on the menu here, we were shocked at how cheap everything was! My favorite item was the Wasabi Caesar Salad. The salads here come in GIANT bamboo bowls which was interesting... but the wasabi Caesar dressing was amazing! The salad was well dressed and had the perfect amount of kick from the wasabi. The entrees also had great presentation which I really liked and portions were pretty big. Overall, great food!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews for restaurants, but when I do it's either really good or really bad. Miga is phenomenal. Great restaurant with a genuine warm welcome, palatable food and love this...they are pet-friendly! Find my cute toy poodle in their photos :)  I'm in the restaurant industry as well and there are certain performances I expect for customer satisfaction. Miga's staff showed great hospitality and made us feel comfortable.   Good food is essential when eating out especially at a fine dining restaurant. It's not just the Kimchi Fries (by the way, it's orgasmic..HA!) or the Tako Carpaccio (a kick of heat from the wasabi) or the exquisite Spicy Tuna Cocktail that I always crave but it's the staff's manner of greeting you which is why I return every time I visit Champaign. The food is delivered in a timely manner which is very important to me.   Don't judge a restaurant for being pretentious or incredibly overpriced. There are plenty of other restaurants that hike up their menus. If you're upset with the service, bring it up to the management so they are aware of what can be established for a better environment for the up-coming guests who dine in at Miga.  I just love it. It's definitely worth a visit and worth your budget."}
{"text":"Everything about the meal was tasty and beautifully presented. Definitely an experience. My girlfriend and I came here to celebrate and it served that function perfectly.  Although the food was very good, for the price the bar is just extremely high. Hence the four stars. I think the portions could stand to be a tad larger. For example, we ordered the scallop for appetizer. It was an incredible scallop to be clear, but a single scallop for 10 bucks seems a bit steep to me. Then again, the restaurant is beautiful and the waiters were very professional. Absolutely worth a visit, though I don't know how often I will be back."}
{"text":"On Mom's weekend this year my family and I dined at MIGA. We have heard great things about MIGA and I was excited to enjoy my birthday dinner at supposedly, one of the most upscale and best restaurants in Champaign. Unfortunately, our experience from booking the reservation, to leaving the restaurant left my family and I disappointed.   The weekend of my reservation was Mom's weekend, so I completely understand that it may have been a busy or stressful weekend for your management and servers. However, as a restaurant that brands itself to be upscale, this should not have been an issue that should have been reflected in your customer service. During the time of my reservation I noted that it was someones birthday and we would prefer a table near the back. When we showed up, our table was right by the door and we experienced rude and inattentive service throughout the night   The absolute worst part of our experience was the actual serving of the food. When ordering our dishes, we made a brief note that instead of each party having their own entrée, we would be splitting a few different entrees \"family style\". This is a concept that should be very familiar for any upscale restaurant, as the majority of new and existing upscale restaurants in the city follow this concept. We had ordered a few \"starter\" dishes that were cold, \"noodle/rice\" dishes, and then the entrees. In any sensible resutrant, the food arrives at a scheduled pace so that the table is not crowded and so that the diners do not feel rushed. However, 20 minutes after ordering, our hot entrees arrive and then immediately followed by our cold starter dishes and noodle dishes. Our entire table was crowded with different orders and we were obviously not happy. We addressed the issue to the server about the pace of the food and how this is not what should happen. Instead of taking the hot entrees and noodle dishes back to the kitchen, he simply replied \"sorry all the food is out now\". He did not seem competent enough to understand that all of the food should not have come out at once.   Due to the pacing of the food, our meal was incredibly rushed. By the time we had started eating the entrees, they were cold. This would not have happened, if the food was taken back to the kitchen and brought out at a proper pace. By this point, my birthday that was supposed be a flawless, easy, and enjoyable experience was ruined. The food lacked proper seasoning, umami that is found in Asian cuisine, and was underwhelming for the price.  Sticky Spicy Gnocchi:  This is not Gnocchi, it is made with a Chinese rice cake. Traditionally, I love this sort of rice cake, but MIGA over-cooked it severely and added a heavy, overly sweet one note sauce on top of these severely overcooked rice patties. To make it worse, they coated the entire dish in partially melted parmesan cheese. You're joking right? 1) Don't call it Gnocchi if it's not Gnocchi. 2) Excessive amounts of parmesan cheese have no place in Asian fusion cooking. 3) This dish is just not well thought out or executed, not sure why you have this on your menu.  Zen Style Ceviche:  Once again, don't call a dish something that it's not. This is not ceviche, it was sashimi. There were pieces of extremely sub-par (not fresh) of fish put on a plate. If I wanted sashimi I would have ordered the sashimi garden salad. Please figure out what ceviche traditionally is and your menu item should at least remotely resemble that. Or our server should have said something. But clearly he has a certain level of incompetence.   Wasabi Caesar Salad:  Nothing special, barley a single hint of Wasabi and I think I got one cherry tomato. Half the ingredients listed in the description were either absent or I couldn't even taste. Had an equal level caesar salad at panera.   Sea Scallop:  Overpriced, once again, flavor profiles of actual dish didn't match up to the dish itself. 0 hint of truffle. Sea Scallop slightly overcooked.   White Butter Fish:  Only redeeming aspect of this ENTIRE meal. Fish was well cooked, seasoned, and had a balanced flavor profile.   Bottom line:  Do not try to make your menu sound eclectic and falsely name dishes for the sake of the menu looking \"upscale\". If you're going to say your dish has x amount of ingredients and flavor profiles,  I want to taste them. I am paying for them.   As an individual who has dined at countless restaurants across Champaign, Chicago, and the United States I can say for certainty that MIGA failed to meet many basic standards that diners have. I can definitely appreciate the effort that MIGA wants to compete with Chicago restaurants and bring upscale dining to Champaign, IL. However, if the current level of customer service continues, it is quite honestly impossible for them to ever be on remotely the same page. My party of three left MIGA spending over $180 for a meal that was lackluster, mediocre, and highly disappointing in service."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Miga this week for an early Valentine's Day dinner with my girlfriend. The wine bottle list in $30-50 range wasn't extensive, but it all more or less was designed to pair with the food and covered all the bases. We settled on a good pinot blanc and didn't regret it.  The French fry appetizer and some miso soup to start. Both hit the mark. The sushi arrived next, included a very well-presented spider roll. Sushi can often be a low-value experience for many people, but the rolls were large, the fish was excellent, and you'd be hard-pressed to find something this good in town outside of Miga's sister restaurant Sakanaya. We had mochi for desert and it was also great.   The most important part of the experience was the service. My server Dane was really on top of things. The staff as a whole seems up to the challenge of potentially being the best restaurant in town."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner to celebrate a birthday with my friend and the food and service blew us away after sampling 4 dishes and mochi ice cream dessert.  We booked our seats through OpenTable for a Wednesday night and were able to get seated right away when we walked in with literally no wait at all, even after changing our reservation time last minute. The interior is quite dark, but it's very intimate and open. They even had a projector playing Roman Holiday onto one of the walls (which my companion very much enjoyed). Great atmosphere!  Because we're college students and still a little new to the foodie scene, we naturally had a lot of questions for our waiter (I think his name was William). He was great at giving recommendations and was super responsive to everything we asked. If he was annoyed, he didn't let it show at all, which I greatly appreciate :)  We started with two drinks: the Lychee-tini and a red wine that I forget the name of. I'm not an alcohol fan, but I can say the Lychee-tini tasted just okay? Did not enjoy the wine at all, but my friend said she liked it!  Our appetizers were the Chasu buns and the MIGA Sashimi Garden Salad. Personally, I thought the Chasu buns had great flavor and were a little salty. Definitely worth a taste and I think reasonably priced at $4 each. But the salad, OH MY LORD THE SALAD WAS AMAZING!!! I could have literally eaten an entire meal of just the greens (although the sashimi was great as well). Whatever the chef put in the dressing was the most perfect combination of flavors I have ever tasted. I would definitely recommend this appetizer to share.   For the entrees, I got the White Butter Fish and my friend got the Smoked Duck. My dish was very delicious and I enjoyed how the richness of the fish was paired with the bitterness of the bok choy.  Overall, the flavors were very good, but I don't think the portion size was worth $27? Would probably want to try something else next time. My friend's Smoked Duck honestly tasted like ham to me. The flavor mixed really well with the cauliflower rice mix, but (probably because I'm Chinese and have eaten many an Asian cuisine featuring duck) I expected a slightly more Asian twist on the smokiness. Nevertheless, the portion size for the duck was generous and definitely worth a try in my opinion because it did taste very very good.  PROTIP: go check out the bathroom, it's positively lovely! I am always thankful when an establishment provides hand lotion, so kudos to Miga.  TLDR: prices are on the higher end, for 2 appetizers and 2 entrees (all split with 1 other person) I spent about $50-ish with tip. My friend ended up paying for the 2 drinks which added about $20 to her bill. The food was all very delicious (get the Sashimi Garden Salad for sure), and the Asian/American twist was evident in the flavors. All the options seemed super unique, so if you're looking for an adventurous dining experience, I would totally recommend! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to love Miga due to the close proximity of our downtown condo.  Our final attempt happened last night.   The restaurant was 1/3 full and the hostess and server had horrible attitudes.   We asked to sit at a few empty tables and were told that they were reserved.   The hostess sat us at the community table, even though there were numerous other options available.  After sitting at our table for 10 minutes and bring completely ignored, we left.   Three strikes = last time we try it."}
{"text":"We will keep coming back!  The space is beautiful, and not at all loud.  Conversations can be had over dinner.  The parmesan fries were perfect; thin, crispy and flavorful.  One order is enough for 4 people, but the two of us were able to finish them off!  I had ribeye which was perfectly seasoned and prepared.  My niece had the salmon, and she loved it!  The portions were very generous.  We ordered the fried doughnuts, a perfect way to end the meal.  We ordered wine with the help of our server, William, and it was the perfect choice.  He was very helpful with explaining the menu as well.  For 2 with wine, appetizer, and dessert about 50$ per   person."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends for a birthday dinner. The birthday girl wanted to try out this new place. One friend was a bit reserved because she had previously tried to dine here and left because no one came to their table for a long time. So we didn't know what to expect this time.  When you walk into the restaurant, it is absolutely beautiful. The ambiance is wonderful (candles, low lighting, modern). The tables were all preset with place mats, silverware, and with centerpieces (oil burners).   The menu is simple. Starters, main dishes, sides. Drink menu is extensive. Everyone ordered cocktails/beer. We enjoyed them all. The drinks were strong.  We had a variety of starters: Mandu (potstickers with a reduction), chasu bun, sea scallop (came with slices of pork belly). The starters were on point. My sea scallop melted in my mouth and the pork belly was a nice chaser.   Then our meals came out: Bi Bim Bap, MIGA noodles, Salmon dishes...The portions for some of my friends looked small while others looks overwhelming (bi bim bap comes in a huge wooden bowl). My noodles were too spicy. We asked if the spice could be toned down but we were informed that the sauce was made in the morning and it could not be reduced. My lips were on fire and were numb the rest of the evening before dessert.  There isn't a dessert menu, but our server shared with us a list from off the top of his head: Apple Pie with a Sour Cream Ice Cream and Miso sauce (amazing), Red bean Mochi Ice Cream, and Expresso Mochi Ice Cream. All of the desserts were great.  Everyone enjoyed their meal (taste-wise). I liked my dish, but it was too spicy for me. If you get a starter, a drink and a main entree..it all adds up. One of my friends didn't get a starter and she still paid $50 (food and drink). I had a drink entree, and got one of each dessert to share and ended up paying $54 (included gratuity). So it just depends on what you get.  Parties of 6+ have an automatic 18% gratuity...fyi.   Overall, I liked my experience. Will I be going back? Not sure. Maybe for a special occasion. For me, it's a once every 6-8 months kind of place..."}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous restaurant and a wonderful experience. I genuinely think that their sushi is better than Sakanaya's. Would say it is reasonably priced given the quality and aesthetic of the food."}
{"text":"This is an upscale Asian fusion restaurant in CU. After a long time I had the chance of dining at Miga and I must admit I had an amazing experience. I had made a reservation for 3 through Open table and hence on arrival we were immediately seated and greeted by our waitress named Ilina. The ambience of the place is very chic and upscale. They also have a projector where they constantly play movies- a different yet cool atmosphere.   I had heard rave reviews about their Chashu bun and so had to try it. Along with it we also ordered Miga fries and Beef Tartare as our appetizers. The Chashu bun was really very flavorful and tasty- it was quiet filling and very cheap. The beef tartare was very delicious. The fries were not ordinary fries, very thin fries with Parmesan cheese and sweet & sour ketchup which had some good kicks. For the main course, Ilina recommended to try their spicy Tuna steak and I LOVED it so much. The tuna was mildly cooked with perfect amount of spices, and wasabi Mayo did wonders. This dish was really very filling and mouthwateringly tasty. I also enjoyed their cava and Pinot Blanc with my meals.   The server - Ilina was very attentive and knowledgeable. She made some really good suggestions and thanks to her, we had wonderful time. Since we had checked in, we got 15% discount on our meal which made the entire dining experience extra fabulous. In short, this is an upscale restaurant and perfect for some celebratory meals or dating. A great addition to CU foodie standard."}
{"text":"Thank you Miga for making my birthday dinner extra special! I signed up for Miga's reward program earlier this year and received a text before my birthday for a free dessert and champagne toast. We have been to Miga a few times before and have always enjoyed the food so we went back to celebrate my birthday. While the menu is limited and probably not the best choice for picky eaters, it is exquisitely plated and delicious. The servers are attentive, the courses are well timed, and the servers are very knowledgable about the menu as well as the ingredients in the dishes. The inside of the restaurant is gorgeous and they have a communal table as well as outdoor seating and a private room in the back. We enjoyed the sashimi garden salad (not pictured) and it was beyond amazing with the freshest shashimi I have had in C-U. I had the smoked duck entree and dessert was an apple pie with lime iceceam and a miso caramel with sesame brittle. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Miga is the newest addition to the ever growing Koreatown here in Toronto. So, let's get to it! The price point at Miga is slightly higher than most of the restaurants in Koreatown. So, if you are looking for cheap eats in Koreatown, I'll point you to either Ka-Chi or my favourite family-run restaurant Thumbs-Up. However, there is a reason behind the higher price point, the decor and atmosphere is definitely worth it. Miga has a contemporary twist on the Zen theme, it is filled with old clay pots, paper lanterns and replicas of Korea's Yi dynasty furniture. Whoever did the interior designing on this project hit it right on.  While going through the menu, I realized Miga must be really known for 2 things - stone pot rice and table cooking. 75% of their menu consisted of these 2 items. Stone pot rice is often called dolsot bibimbop, this popular Korean dish consist of rice topped off with vegetables, beef, a whole egg and kochujang (a Korean chilli pepper paste). Kochujang is usually served on the side so customers could control and obtain the level of spiciness. Table cooking, on the other hand, consist of cooking marinated meats and seafood at the dining table.  Miga had an impressive selection of stone pot rice dishes, a total of 12. I ordered the Stone Pot Rice mixed with Beef and Kimchi () while my friend ordered the Seafood Udong (). Our meal also came with the traditional kimchi side dish and to my surprise individual side-dishes (Cucumbers, bean sprouts & seaweed). The service was quick, the manager was hands on and our food arrived within a 15 minute time-span.  There is reason why Miga specializes in the stone pot rice dishes; it was probably the best I've ever had! The rice was perfectly cooked and thankfully, the beef was not overcooked. The side dishes complimented my dish, giving me a refreshing break of the spiciness of the dolsot bibimbop. All in all, I enjoyed this place; I think mainly for its decor and professional wait staff. For those who love bibimbop, Miga is a pretty good choice because of its wide array of selection. However, for other Korean dishes, I believe you could find better deals somewhere else. Our bill came up to $34.00 dollars with tax & tip.  Last Words: I realized a lot of restaurant reviews online never really discuss the restaurants washrooms. I am a clean freak and even if the restaurant has amazing food, a trip to a dirty washroom ruins it for me. Thankfully, Miga has one of the cleanest bathrooms in Koreatown - bonus points from me."}
{"text":"The nice ambiance and great location make Miga perfect for a fancy (for Champaign) dinner moment..   Drinks are really good and I enjoy some of the wines I've had here. I've gotten the chasu bun a couple of times and it's pretty okay, to be honest - a bit on the bland side.  The Bi bim bap, however is delicious! The presentation is also great as it comes in a large wooden bowl with a burner on the side with the beef/salmon/tofu. All of the ingredients and flavors mix really well!  The service was also really good and I enjoyed the ambiance. However, I think because of the prices, Miga tends to draw out an older, stuffier crowd, which I don't enjoy so much. Will definitely come again though!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with Miga. I have always had an extremely memorable and positive dining experience here. I also had a birthday Private party here with over 80 guests. Not many restaurants could have executed a flawless event like the staff at Miga did. The manager, Jen, was awesome to work with and very flexible with all of my crazy ideas and requests. The party went off without a hitch, and every other time I've dined here, it's always been perfect."}
{"text":"Miga est un petit resto coréen sur Rachel. La cuisine est de type maison, on imagine la maman coréenne en arrière en train de préparer le kimchi!   Suis venue ici un jeudi soir tard avec ma douce moitié. On commençait à avoir faim, mais pas envie d'une grosse bouffe lourde, style fast--food. Nous avons essayé le bebimbap et le kimchibap.   Le premier consiste en un bon bol de riz sur lequel sont déposés des légumes légèrement cuits (ici, carotte, chou, fèves germées, laitue) et boeuf mariné avec un oeuf au miroir au centre. Tout était délicieux, avec une bonne sauce piquante sur le riz, c'était parfait pour moi ce soir--là.   Le kimchibap est un riz frit au kimchi (chou mariné piquant) au boeuf. C'était rassasiant, pas si piquant que cela et la portion était idéale.   Mon seul bémol: le thé était tiède (était--ce parce que nous sommes arrivés tard en soirée?) Je préfère mon thé bien chaud! Sinon le service était gentil, bien fait et en français! Bravo au serveur pour son effort! Les prix sont fort raisonnables, surtout pour un repas le soir!"}
{"text":"We have been to Miga a few times before.  First few times it was great, food was delicious.   Then the menu changed, some salads went away which is fine.  However when I ordered the same dish - bibimbap - it was a pathetic resemblance of the previous creation.  The service was ok, I used to be impressed by it, now it was just mediocre.   The place itself is beautiful but at this point not good enough for us to come back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after watching a great film at the art theater.  We arrived around 9pm on a Saturday and there were plenty of diners and the atmosphere was nice. We decided to sit at the bar since we were only going to have some light food and a drink. We sat and sat and sat for about 15 minutes at the bar where staff was coming and going constantly before anyone said anything to us.   After we were finally acknowledged the staff person was nice and gave us menus. Then our actual waitress came to take our orders and give recommendations.  I had a cocktail called It's Seoul Good. The cocktail was tasty similar to a cosmo with soju.  We decided to share the Migu noodles which was very pretty and flavorful but VERY spicy. Even my boyfriend who loves spicy food thought this was a bit over the top. Admittedly they mentioned it was spicy but this still seemed a bit on the extreme side and I'm no wimp.    We finished our meal and as we finished our drinks I pulled out a credit card to pay and then the waiting began again. Another 15 minutes before anyone said anything or came to give us the check while the waitress stood less than 5 feet away chatting up someone the entire time.   It's one thing to be super busy and the service be slow but there was plenty of staff that just were totally ignoring us or so busy chatting up one customer they couldn't be bothered to check if we needed anything.  A quick bite that should have taken at most 45 minutes took closer to an hour and a half.   The food and drink were ok but still fairly pedestrian. I may give this place one more try but I'm not itching to get back for anything we experienced."}
{"text":"The best restaurant I've been to! If you're in town you MUST go! It's worth visiting champaign just for this restaurant! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Fresh sashimi and excellent technique from all chefs make it so delicious. It's very worthy with excellent service."}
{"text":"Miga is that special Champaign kind of restaurant that it trying to do something fancy, and looking just silly. They served me something in a basket poised over a candle for some strange reason I still can't figure out. The decor might seem upscale to some, but to me it seemed excessively cold, and the space feels cramped."}
{"text":"Amazing food that looked absolutely beautiful! There was a problem with one of our orders and the staff was very helpful. The food got to our table super fast and they even gave us free dessert for the trouble! Everything was delicious. Great restaurant for a date."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a treasure in Champaign.  We had their chicken pasta dish that was very tasty.  Also the beef tartare is infused with a Asian style seasoning that was the best we ever had.      The restaurant itself has a nice calm decor, and it very fresh and clean.  ."}
{"text":"Une autre jolie petite surprise dans une partie du plateau qui n'en réserve pas beaucoup.  Drôle de petit endroit que ce restaurant coréen!  D'abord, il faut remarquer que c'est ancien comptoir à hot-dog et patates frites, comme en font foi le comptoir et les banquettes fixées au sol (donc que des tables pour 2 ou 4 personnes, vraiment pas l'endroit idéal pour des groupes).  Décor minimaliste, un peu déphasé.  Service uniquement en anglais (ou en coréen...), mais sympathique et courtois.  Les plats sont plus ou moins nombreux, mais souvent surprenants (en tous cas, pour quelqu'un qui n'est pas habitué à la bouffe coréenne).  Nous avons pris un plat pour 2 (à 25$): dans un sauce juste assez parfumée et relevée nageaient des bout de crêpes de poissons (où le poisson est semble-t-il broyé et mélangé à la farine avant la cuisson), des rouleaux (évoquant des udon géants) faits à base de patates sucrées (mais blanches?!?), du choux mariné et épicé (étonnament bon et digeste), en somme beaucoup de saveurs et de textures insolites qui mijotaient sur un réchaud au milieu de notre table.  Une autre personne avait pris un plat plus humble à base de pâtes de patates sucrées, de boeuf et de chou, et c'était très bon aussi (mais moins exotique).  Les plats coûtent entre 8$ et 15$, ce qui n'est vraiment pas cher pour la qualité (et la quantité) de ce que l'on nous a servi.  Et comme c'est un \"apportez votre vin\", ce restaurant m'apparaît comme une fort intéressante alternative aux éternels restaurants de pâtes et de grillades de la rue Duluth, un peu plus bas.  En sans ligne d'attente en plus!"}
{"text":"They got a new chef and the food is 10 times better. Great steak and sushi, everyone needs to check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Definitely one of the best restaurants in CU. Higher end, and higher price points but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Beautiful space with high ceilings and kind of zen decoration. Super friendly waiter guided us through the menu. I had the ceviche which was amazing, and my daughter had the scallop and bacon. The Bi Bim Bop was very different but delicious."}
{"text":"Food = good. Would waste my money on the $17 4-lettuce wrap appetizer. Fries are a good app and cheap. Had the soy-noodle chicken pasta. See photos from previous poster. Really good flavor. Butter fish and the grilled tuna were awesome as well. If you can't tolerate spicy, be sure to get some help with the menu. Service was polite, but the ol' drink glass set empty at times."}
{"text":"My favorite fancy dinner place so far. Will definitely come back here. If you want to bring your partner or your family to a nice restaurant definitely try this."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and interesting menu. To start, we had the crunchy fries with Parmesan, ceviche, the chashu bun, the house salad, and Caesar salad. The fries were delicious. Very crunchy as advertised, and the homemade ketchup was unique and tasty. The Parmesan wasn't really necessary though. The ceviche was delicious, really enjoyed that. Great variety of fish/seafood too. The chashu bun was also yummy, and one bun is definitely big enough to split in half. The Caesar salad was a tad overdressed, but the house salad dressing was very good. For my entree, I ordered the Kalbi ribeye steak. The steak was very tender and flavorful, all around a good piece of meat. There was a pile of very mild kimchi on top which was good, even though I'm not a huge kimchi fan. The rice pilaf that came with was also good. I tried the butter fish entree, which two people at my table ordered. One was slightly overcooked and one was perfect. Both were very tasty nonetheless, and thankfully butterfish is very forgiving and the overcooked-ness didn't completely ruin the dish. The scallops were good, although the portion was a little small and one scallop was on the rare side. After entrees, we decided to pass on dessert, though they sounded interesting. Only a few technical errors stopped this from being a solid 4 star meal, but it's a new restaurant and they should tighten things up in the future. Service was also extremely friendly. I definitely wouldn't hesitate to give them another try!"}
{"text":"Went for my Mom's birthday, and they did not disappoint.  The atmosphere is great modern/industrial.  Though cozy at the same time.  An open dinning area with a long bar towards the back. I really like the set up, with old black and white movies projected on one of the walls...this night it was Rebecca, the 1940's film noir with Laurence Olivier.  My Mom could have narrated the entire movie for everyone if the restaurant would let her :)  This is Asian/Korean fusion from the people that brought you Sakanaya.  They are true locals within the Chambana community.  The menu here is a bit more streamlined, unique, and at times more pricy.  While certain things you scratch your head at, like a scallop appetizer with only one scallop, though you cannot help but be in aw of how enjoyable it is.  Which comes with amazingly tender and flavorful pork belly as well.  Then there is the Wasabi Caesar Salad, which my thought is they just put a Caesar Salad on the menu just because.  Then you realize that everything is so well integrated and amazing.  The oven dried cherry tomatoes, the great salty anchovies, and the spicy wasabi salad dressing.  It all works perfectly.  The dumplings are really good as well, even though I did not find anything particularly special about them, They were very enjoyable.  The mains included the Soy Cream Chicken Pasta, which my Mom and Dad both swear by.  Then my Miga Bold Noodle Pasta, which is amazeballs.  A spicy stir fry with bell peppers, bonito flakes, and chili pepper mixed with other veggies, chicken, and shrimp.  Yeah, this made me sweat a little, in the best way.  There is shaved flakes on top, which is so hot they literally vibrate, a really unique presentation (don't ask me to explain, just get it and enjoy). The noodles are incredibly tasty by the way. Both dishes are around $15, and they are more than enough to make your stomach pop.    They have more expensive entrees, which may or may not be worth the cost.  It is hard to tell which appetizers are worth the price.  Some, like the scallops are not worth it (though very tasty) others like the salads can feed an army.  With the dumplings being in the middle, which is well made and what you would expect for a starter.    Drinks are enjoyable as well.  Some well made cocktails, with a Migroni that is what you would expect for this spin and on point.  Also plenty of wine, and even a well thought out beer selection in bottles.  La Fin Du Monde pairs perfectly with any spicy dish they put out.  Service was impeccable.  The waiter new the menu, with recommendations, and was Johnny on the spot with any needs.  Overall, this is a really well thought out restaurant, everything is fresh a tasty with the right amount innovation along with traditional tastes thrown in for good measure.  While not 100% perfect, another really good option in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant with great drinks and good service. It is not vegetarian friendly. There is only one entree on the menu that can be made vegetarian, the Bi Bim Bap, and it felt like an afterthought. The vegetarian version subs tofu for the protein and removes the sauce. The individual ingredients were good, but without the sauce the dish was not cohesive. It was disappointing that such a well-regarded local eatery does not offer a more flexible menu."}
{"text":"It seems like every time I'm really craving Miga, the restaurant is closed. But on those few occasions where it's actually been open, I've never been let down.   Very casual vibe with the happiest and most delightful staff in the world. Seriously, I don't think I've never seen them without a smile, and the mood is infectious.   The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. Personal favourite is the bibimbap, which is pretty much perfect at any time of day.  If you're looking for quick and tasty Korean food, this is where you need to be."}
{"text":"Miga is beautiful inside. The food is typically above average into great. My issues are: 1) closing by 8:30PM which means you have to have your food ordered by about 8:10PM which is WAY too early for a restaurant. 2) You can order the same meal two weeks apart and depending on who cooked it you can barely have any food or a lot. But when I brought up the issue, the hostess apologized and comped the meal. 3) Service is inconsistent. Same problem with other downtown Champaign restuarants. The restaurant is trying to be upscale but relying on college aged kids who get sidetracked with less-than professional demeanor and chatter.  We need some good service skills from the wait staff and that would make a difference."}
{"text":"The first time I went here with a friend, it was a great experience! But I've been back twice with my husband, and both times were very disappointing. This is an upscale restaurant with upscale prices -- the service needs to match the prices. The last time we were here, our server must have forgotten about us or was purposely avoiding us. We couldn't tell her our food wasn't right. We couldn't tell her we wanted another drink. We couldn't tell her we wanted to order dessert. So we just asked for our bill and went elsewhere to finish our meal.   The food IS pretty good, and while some flavor combinations are just not for me, I like trying new things. I love the scallops and pork belly. The Miga Crunch Fries are the BEST thing on the menu! The salad with sashimi was pretty good, although the chunks of tuna were really big  - which isn't always a great thing, especially for raw fish.   The atmosphere is pretty nice. I like the old movies that are projected onto the wall.   But all in all, I can't justify a $120 dinner for two people here. The place isn't that big, and the servers can't possibly be so busy that they ignore their guests."}
{"text":"Fish was good quality. But they messed up our order three time by serving the wrong things and never gave us soup like advertised for sushi deluxe or whatever. Also, how do you serve undercooked rice? I'm Asian. I know undercooked rice. Other than that they had nice service. Maybe it was an off day?"}
{"text":"Buddy and I dropped in for a beer and ordered scallops under the appetizer. Started eating the 3 scallops 1/3cup of rice and onion. Apparently this was the meal so I paid 31 dollars for it and 7 for the beer. The food tasted good but not 31 dollar good unfortunately. Scallops were over salted and not enough of it for the price. The third star is for how well the scallops were cooked however and 2 stars for having to sit at the bar or share a table with other couples. The Japanese barley beer was terrible and reminiscent of a dark apple cider ale. The first star goes to the extremely hot and very tall waitress that looked Asian that worked there. The other star if anyone is curious also hoes to the hot tall Asian waitress. The eye candy was better than the candied scallops."}
{"text":"Started with the sashimi garden salad and scallop.  We both decided on steak and I got the garden fillet and the wife got the ribeye.  Both were superb but the ribeye was definitely the favorite.  Finished with the red bean Moche ice cream.  Service was excellent, I can't find anything to criticize so definitely 5 star."}
{"text":"4 stars to the atmosphere and our cute waitress Rose. 3 star to the food. 2 to the cocktail Miga75.  We had the Golbi Rib-eye, nice flavor and texture and large portion. But no surprise there. The Buddism Bibimbap was just mediocre. The Miga75 was a plain mix of Gin, Soju and lemonade (with pulp). And one big plus is the serving team was really on it, nice, pleasant and helpful. Good place for a date night."}
{"text":"Was looking for a fancy place downtown to dress up and celebrate our 1 year anniversary and definitely came to the right place. The ambience is relaxing and perfect for a romantic date night.  Prices are up there but was to be expected for a nice place. We ordered the scallops and sword fish  and a roll to start. Plating was nicely done and loved the unique dish designs. However the food was not something to remember. We went and got ourselves a large dessert to fill up afterwards."}
{"text":"I came by with a co-worker a couple of weeks back and had a pretty amazing experience. After reading the reviews, I got the impression that this place was super expensive. I would like to dispel that myth! Sure, it's a nice place and I wouldn't come here expecting a cheap meal but each of our entrees were under $20. I ordered the noodle bowl and it was about $15 which is only a couple dollars more than a pasta dish at Olive Garden. My co-worker ordered the bibimbop which was close to $20 but huge! In fact, both of our entrees could have been split amongst 3 people....each! So, if you want to save a few bucks, I highly recommend sharing! We ordered the bao buns as appetizers which were $4 a piece and VERY delicious. I was slightly disappointed to see that these weren't stuffed like traditional bao buns. They were more like sandwiches but I guess its fusion so they can get away with it. I will also say that while I really enjoyed the noodle dish, I could see why some folks might not like it. It was labelled with 3 pepper symbols so I was expecting spicy. But, instead of spicy, I would more accurately use the word peppery. It tasted heavily of black pepper. I LOVE the taste of black pepper but I also know that I tend to put way too much in my cooking so, I know that if I am made aware of the peppery taste, that there's a possibility that it's too peppery for most people.  I will also add that I wish that they had lunch hours or at least were open for longer hours. I came by with my mom today and I noticed they have very limited hours and weren't open at the time. I feel like if they're only going to be open for dinner then they should have longer dinner hours available."}
{"text":"Stopped by Miga on a Friday Evening for a early valentines day dinner. The ambiance was great, and much bigger than I expected just from the outdoor appearance. We were guided to our table by the hostess and promptly had a waiter come to our table to ask if we wanted anything to drink or if we had any questions.   We ordered the chashu buns for the appetizer which were twice as big as I expected, so I was starting to feel the fullness before the first entree came out.   Then we ordered the soy cream chicken pasta and the angus galbi rib-eye steak. The soy cream chicken pasta was good, but nothing special. And the chicken that came on top was very tough. But the Galbi Rib-eye steak was GOOD! It came with a kimchi bacon pilaf which was pretty decently sized in itself.    TL;DR the ambiance 5/5! service 5/5! food 3/5!"}
{"text":"Wow. Absolutely amazing food! The service is good, the place is nice (you can bring your own wine), and the chef really honestly cares about your dining experience.  I ordered the jap chae which was the best jap chae I've had.  I can't say enough good things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Miga, we've had the same server twice and he's amazing! I forgot his name but he's super friendly and I love the atmosphere. The food has always been excellent. Will be coming often!"}
{"text":"Great food with an interesting menu! Asian flare but the Garden steak is really good."}
{"text":"food is good. However, the waiters have a great skill dodging eye contact. Therefore we have to deduce one star from that. I have to go to the front desk to get my waiter's attention. And the check takes 10 min to come"}
{"text":"Miga is very nice. It's a great place for a celebratory dinner or date night. Very fancy. The food is amazing. I highly recommend it. The Chashu bun is amazing. So is the ribeye!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality. Great food and cocktails. I loved that our server told us every detail and every method to enjoy our food best. The ceviche was amazing as well as our other dishes. Our server was hospitable and knowledgeable. MIGA is truly a work of art. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. The menu has just changed this month August 2017, so the menu on here is different. But we still were not disappointed. I had the Ravioli Pork dish. Sorry can't spell the exact name. It was in an amazing broth type sauce. You just have to try it!! The pork belly dish is huge and could serve two easily. My husband has had the ribeye and the filet and different visits and love both. Also a must is the crunchy chicken appetizer!!"}
{"text":"Miga is a more upscale Asian fusion restaurant in the Chambana area.  It's usually never too busy on the weekend evenings when I went for dinner.  The food is pretty good but fairly overpriced in my honest opinion.  I've had the spicy rice gnocchi (which is just tteokbokki), mandu, beef ssam, fries, beef tartare, angus kalbi steak, bibimbap, chashu bun, and miso ramen soup.  In terms of standouts, I would say the bibimbap, chashu bun, and miso ramen soup are good.  The bibimbap is honestly the best value item on the entire list since it comes with mixed rice with veggies and sliced grilled protein (salmon, beef, or tofu).  The chashu buns are really good depending on when you get them. Try going earlier so they're not too braised and salty.  The miso ramen is a small serving but tastes great and fills you up enough until the main entree. The other food I've tried was all right.  The mandu tasted like it came from frozen when i went in November 2016.  The angus kalbi steak had a kimchi slaw that was unpleasantly sour and the rice that came with it had an odd flavor to me. I liked the beef tartare, but it was a bit overwhelmingly garlicky.  Overall, I would give Miga a 3.5 if I could, but it's definitely not a 4.  It's a great place for dates and if you want to get out of the campus area, but it's definitely pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Do you remember those 90s soft core porn movies Emmanuel in...? That's what the music is here. It's so fun, especially since no one else here is old enough to know what it is. It reminds me of back when the gas station next to the Dairy Queen in chenoa used to rent movies and there was no real porn, so you rented the next best things which was Emmanuel in Bangkok, and wound up watching silvie crystal being banged by 10 thai boys."}
{"text":"Hmmm, Miga Miga. What a nice addition to the downtown Champaign area. The interior is beautiful and the ambience is very elegant and chic.   The service was great -- everyone seemed very nice. They've got such a nice team!  The food is beautifully presented. Tried the chasu bun (I love pork buns), and this had braised pork, asian dipping sauce, mayo, mixed greens, sliced onions and cucumber. The flavors for this mixed in really well (I would probably not opt in for the mixed greens). Everyone had gotten the Bi bim bap which was really nicely presented in a large wooden bowl with a side burner that had the salmon/steak. Heard no complaints there!   I got the orange glazed salmon steak. It was interestingly presented. Colorful dish. It has a medium rare salmon steak, roast herb bacon, fingerling potato, orange mango reduction, citrus beurre blanc, preserved apricots and oven dried tomato. On to the taste...I realllly wanted to fall in love with the dish but it wasn't hitting the spot. The textures and flavors weren't really super memorable for me (it didn't make me go \"wow!\"). The salmon tasted pretty ordinary so I was hoping the sauces would make it pop some more. It didn't. I'm going to try other dishes but don't think I'd get this one again. I don't think the potato goes well with it. I'd probably introduce a grain that has more texture (farro/quinoa?/wheat berries?).   Overall, I liked my experience here (I'd give it a 3.5..). The drinks are pretty strong...get the It's Seoul Good. I want to try some other dishes (maybe the Bi Bim Bap) and see if it changes my mind a bit more."}
{"text":"Miga is literally the best for elegant dining in chamapign. The service was super nice. The food was tasty and the presentation of the food is very appealing. You pay for food and their service. I have been there once. I will go back for another very special occasion."}
{"text":"We had never eaten at this restaurant, so decided to finally give it a try.  Pros: Beautiful atmosphere and first rate service. Cons: I had the brisket udon, which was supposed to be served with a jus over it. The brisket and the jus were both completely flavorless. What I expected - a skillfully reduced jus with concentrated flavors of beef and vegetables. What I got - lukewarm meat water. My friend had the scallops. Three small scallops with a few tablespoons of rice and greens under them for $28. They were well cooked, but please, this was an appetizer portion at best. We were still hungry, so ordered dessert. Mine - chocolate donut holes. Dry, not enough sauce, basically hot balls of chocolate dough. Hers - a lime ice with coconut and oats. Sadly, this was the high point of the meal. Will not go back. Chicago prices for sub-par food."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in Urbana/ champaign.  Incredible taste, artistic presentation & friendly staff.  Doesn't get much better than this.  A little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Restaurant review update: DINERS BE AWARE! So the old chef from Miga has left (per the wait staff he got married and moved on and took his menu) and pretty much all of his creations are gone. The Miga sashimi salad, Angus Galbi Rib-eye Steak, butter fish, garden steak (long gone), beef SSAM, and Miga fries ALL GONE. So basically 95% of the photos do not reflect any of the items you can obtain from the menu. I was here last month for a business dinner and you can clearly see that a new chef has put in place his menu. Items tried: 1. Asparagus appetizer- it was so over powered with a green onion flavor it was almost unbearable 2. Bo SSAM- this is nothing like the beef SSAM which was slices of beef over a decorative candle. Somehow this concoction represents a pulled pork mixture that you can wrap in lettuce leaves. The flavors are completely different and the texture reminds me of a spicy baby food that you wrap in lettuce 3. Chicken wings- I wish I had pictures of this, gigantic wings on a plate. I did not try this but the presentation was simply ridiculous 4. Ribeye steak- this is hands down a terrible iteration of the angus galbi rib-eye. Somehow whatever the onion or garlic flavors that were in the asparagus also somehow showed up in this dish as well. Numerous people at the table were trying to figure out what that flavor it was that was detracting from this dish 5. The dessert donut- I got to try one because everyone at the table ordered for carryout and the waiter had the wrong head count on how many to pack up. Again I wish I had a picture of this. It is very difficult to describe but it was a dark ball of fried dough with a black powder coating it that had a burnt taste to it. There was also some sort of jelly to dip it in as well. Makes me long for the days of the mochi ice cream or the apple pie tart a la mode  ALSO an important note as I learned from their sister restaurant (Sakanaya), even if you have kids and none of the menu items are appropriate, you cannot bring your own food in which makes this a lot less family friendly. With this above experience, I cannot recommend coming here at this time due to there family unfriendly policy and with the drastic overhaul of the menu. Even though I have recommended numerous coworkers, candidate interview dinners, and company presentations to have there meal here, I can no longer vouch for my dinner experience here."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. Presentation was perfect and food was exceptional. Even the wine offerings were above par. We had the Ssam for a starter. It was presented on a little grill with a candle flame and had the flavor of meet cooked at a Korean barbecue but without us getting all smoky. They served it with lettuce and condiments like a sanchu wrap. Our entrees consisted of the scallops and the ribeye both cooked to perfection. The kimchi salsa and pilaf was especially tasty and the perfect amount of spice. Service was attentive and the atmosphere is very relaxing. Next time I am in Champaign I will be back!"}
{"text":"Expensive food but excellent eating environment. Good for date nights, but don't get your hopes up if you have a big appetite like I do."}
{"text":"I am been eating at this restaurant religiously since the first day they opened. Always a great atmosphere, drink and food. In my opinion the starters are the best thing on the menu. Has an amazing private room that anyone can book."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Champaign hands down. Creative Asian inspired entrees. Atmosphere is urban cool. We never leave without the \"apple pie.\". It is a party in your mouth. Small apple tartlette with line sour cream ice cream, a salted butterscotch schmear  and seasame seed crisp."}
{"text":"Okay. I don't know why I didn't start with 5 stars here. I'm consistently impressed with Miga every time I've gone since I first reviewed it. Their new menu we tried last night was amazing and the atmosphere and service were on point. Miga has officially become my favorite spot for a special occasion dinner!"}
{"text":"Talk about an incredible place to eat.   This place left me comatose.   Well worth the money.   Gnocchi never tasted so good. Cold ramen noodle is a dish of the goddesses.    Even in our rags, this place treated us like royalty.   No one was left standing by the door. Everyone was immediately greeted.    If you wanna impress anyone and everyone, go here!  High end with humility."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our anniversary last night.  We came for my birthday back in April and since it was SO wonderful we had to come back and try more.   The service the second time around wasn't as stellar as our first go.  Thank goodness the hostess noticed no one had approached our table after 20 minutes.  I appreciated her being observant and informing her colleagues.  The service for the remainder of the evening was great.  We had the Beef SAMM and the Casear Wasabi Salad.  I could probably eat both those items as a meal.  the Beef SAMM is like a lettuce wrap with a delicious peanut sauce, sticky rice and I think it was kimchi. The salad is out of this world...I would lick the bowl if that wasn't frowned upon.  I enjoyed the Salmon Calamari Steak and my husband had the Smoked Duck.  Last time we came he had the Scallop dish and I had the Bi Bim Bamp. All of those dishes are out of this world and absolutely delicious.  The servings are ample and filled me up."}
{"text":"Incredible. Buddhism Bi Bam Bap was off the charts. Pork buns were the best i ever had! Nice atmosphere. We are from Peoria and will totally drive 1.5 hours to eat here again."}
{"text":"I believe the same owner of this restaurant owns Sakanaya, which explains the similar date vibe and decor. I was surprised at how much each entree cost in comparison to the other restaurants around downtown (~$18-$40, with wine bottles up to $120). Explains the largely older crowd!  The restaurant is dimly lit, each tabletop has its own set of candles and each person their own placemat. The hostess sat us down at what others have referred to as a \"community table\", where they seat you at the ends of a 6-person table, across from one another. I could barely hear my partner as we competed against the other couple's conversation at our table. It felt intuitive to look over at people sharing your table, except they were utter strangers. This isn't a big city where you have to fight for space; this is small town Champaign-Urbana. The choice to seat us with another couple while there were many empty tables throughout our meal was distracting and felt inconsiderate.  I ordered the gnocchi, which was a plateful of rice cakes drowned in sauce with a handful of sliced egg, seaweed flakes, mushrooms, and hot peppers. The flavors were strong: sweet (is this the American-fusion part?), very salty, and largely spicy. It left an unpleasant salty feeling in my mouth even after I left the restaurant."}
