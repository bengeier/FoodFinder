{"text":"Just common HK milk tea, not good not bad!! I don't like the take out cup for milk tea! I just think I'm in Tim Horton ! Food only 1 star, my mother did better than here! Service = No Service = Tim Horton = Mc Donald = Burger King = ....... When we ate, there were some guys to fix the waste pipe! So disgusting smell!"}
{"text":"I love the black tea here. It is one of the best place to get a black tea in Toronto. Actually it is the best as far as I know. The service there is very nice and waiters are polite. The setting there is good and the food is ok. As a cafe, it is very great"}
{"text":"If you come here, the HK style milk tea is a must order.  Some people said their quality went down, I believe it's still match some of the best I tasted in HK. With the satay beef noodle and egg sandwich, it makes the perfect lunch combo.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My sister took me here since it's infamous for it's Hong Kong style milk tea.  It's in an unassuming plaza so it wouldn't have caught my eye if I wasn't looking for it.  There are plenty of seats so if don't have to worry about taking it to go, even though they serve their tea in paper cups regardless if you're staying or leaving.   When you go to the back to order, you specify the amount of sugar you want.  I'd opt for one and then adjust as needed since sugar is provided at all the tables.   I thought one was enough for a small milk tea.  The tea strong and flavourful so it has my approval.   The service is quick and to the point as you'd expect from a Chinese place."}
{"text":"You really should only come to Marathon for their beverages (specifically milk tea) because the food quality is quite questionable. We made the mistake of coming here for lunch because we needed a quick bite and Marathon was convenient to us.   We ordered:  - Pork chop sandwich on pineapple bun: Super disappointing. The pork chop was small, dry and flavourless - no amount of mayo could rescue it. It was a weird combo with the pineapple bun because the sweetness overpowered everything else.  - Satay beef noodle: This was okay... they put enough satay sauce but I ended up being super thirsty for the rest of the afternoon.   Lesson here is if you need to have realistic expectations about the food here because it's definitely cheap for a reason."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Unclean. Unorganized. Never received my order so I got a refund for it. Thanks for the milk tea though.... at least you got one thing right."}
{"text":"Good for a quick bite and if you want a really really strong cup of hk style tea!...actually, it's strong for any type of tea!     The tea tasted great, but I must be sensitive to it because I didn't feel well at all with the buzz...  Will need to resist the tea next time,  though am fine to eat here if i want a quick bite."}
{"text":"Came here to try their HK milk tea after reading so many good thing about it. Since I am already in love with the milk tea at Lucullus, I couldn't help but compare this place to them. I was hoping that the milk tea would be even better here, considering all the hype, but I'm disappointed to say that it wasn't...   Was happy to see that they had several sizes to choose from. I ordered a large and it came out to $3. Marathon's large is the same size as Lucullus' medium, and also more expensive! Which would be fine if they were better.  The tea itself was okay from what I could tell, but it was hard to judge because it was just was wayyy way too milky. I basically couldn't finish it for that reason. Womp womp. Maybe someone was a little distracted when they were holding the can of milk over my cup...   The place itself is like your typical HK style cafe. Didn't order any food but it looked like they had some good specials/combos available. I would maybe come back to try their HK-style breakfast if I was craving it, and to give their milk tea another try since so many people seem to love it."}
{"text":"It is a good HK fast food restaurant. You walked up to the counter to order and find a seat yourself. Food are tasty though a little bit on the salty side. Patrons mainly come for the HK milk tea which is famous throughout GTA. I ordered a mix steak with rice today. Was tasty but gravy was heavy and too much pepper. Otherwise. Everything was good."}
{"text":"Like everyone else, love their milk tea! It's definitely a must try. Their service concept is a little different compared to other HK style cafes. You order and pay upfront first and they will bring the food to you. It is quite a popular resto, so it may take a couple minutes to line up and order depending what time of day you go.  The food portions are a little smaller in comparison to other HK style cafes that I been to, but it is a slightly cheaper, so guess you get what you pay for. The food is very tasty and of course the HK milk tea sealed the deal! Tea itself is very flavourful and smooth, if you don't like to much sweetness do ask them for little/ no sugar or less condensed milk."}
{"text":"Never go again! The food is not fresh and the pork chop is hard like rock."}
{"text":"Came to try the HK style milk tea and milk tea/coffee as recommended by a friend.  They also won an award for the milk/tea coffee.  In my opinion, they are both just average and nothing special.  Purchased medium cups for both and about a third of the cup is filled with evvaporated milk.  But the drink itself did not taste very creamy.  Also, the tea taste was not very strong. $7.50 for both cups.  Plenty of other places in TO for a good HK style milk tea in my opinion."}
{"text":"One good thing about this place is that it open really early, and the food not bad and prices are reasonable. I enjoy it"}
{"text":"If winning an award with the tea is a promotional item, serve people that tea.    Went in to ONLY get the tea (at 1030am); only to see it get poured out of a thermos.  I paid for it, but I promptly dumped it in the trash.  I went in to buy the tea that won them the award, not some crap that was pre-made; and nowhere in my travels in cafes in Hong Kong did I see anyone pour tea out of a thermos that is PRE-MADE.    Almost felt like a bait-and-switch."}
{"text":"I usually refrain from writing anything negative about local businesses, but the food served at this location is unacceptable. The lunch that we had today was honestly the WORST thing I ever ate in my life! I had a terrible stomach ache and was also vomiting shortly after. It doesn't even deserve a 1 star.  We ordered the Tuesday special - pork chop with black bean sauce, rice and vegetables. We got instead a plate of MICROWAVE-cooked food! Let's start with the pork chops - the fat and the actual meat were amalgamated, you cannot even tell where the separation is between them. They were covered in this brown gloopy sauce (black bean sauce) that looked like like poo... \"Veggies\" were 1 teaspoon of microwaved frozen peas/carrots that had absolutely no taste to it. Thank goodness they had a working rice cooker - the rice was the only thing that was edible! We ate a few bites and had to throw the rest away.  The \"famous milk tea\" left a powderly milky film on the back of my tongue and throat.. it does not taste like the milk tea in the Scarborough location.  It wasn't that cheap either - $20 for 2 Tuesday specials with an additional $1 to make it into a cold drink. For $5 more, I suggest going across the street to Congee Queen for some lobster.  I cannot believe people actually eat anything cooked from here - DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU WANT TO AVOID FOOD POISONING!"}
{"text":"My friend told me this is by far the best HK milk tea place she has tried. The owner won awards for making the best milk tea. It was a \"fast food\" type restaurant. You find your own seat, go up to the front to order your food and they will bring the food to you. It was afternoon tea time so we just got some light snacks. Our main thing was to see how great the tea was.  The milk tea was good but not great. It was strong enough and with good tea flavour. But I wonder if it is because they served it in a paper cup instead of a mug, it was just not the best. I have tried other milk tea at other HK style cafe in Toronto that was as comparable. The food was not that great. We ordered the 4 flavour toast - with butter, strawberry jam, peanut butter and condensed milk. I expected something a bit more classier. This was just 2 piece of toast with the 4 things spread on the bread. They could have at least cut it into 4 pieces to distinguish the 4 flavours. Seriously, I could have made it better myself at home. Then the pineapple bun with butter - the bun was probably shipped from other bakery, the pineapple crust part was mushy, not crispy at all.  We also got the ??? combo - it was just toasted hamburger bun with condensed milk - how is this ????? Failed.  Overall, the food was really plain, could have made it better at home. Maybe the rice / noodle dishes are better then the afternoon tea specials - but definitely a disappointment walking out."}
{"text":"My friends love this place and brought me here to try it out.  Decor leaves a bit to be desired but I guess it's catered to patrons who eat and run.    I'm not too familiar with HK milk tea so I can't say that it's amazing and the best ever had, but it is pretty good.  Very creamy and definitely hit the spot for a cold rainy day."}
{"text":"I used to go to this store often for milk tea, until they recently hired a new (male) employee who completely ignores my request for no sugar (health reasons).  I always order tea with \"no sugar\", but he still adds sugar to my drink.  I stopped him on many occasions to prevent him from screwing up my order.  This time, I was in a hurry and forgot to check and guess what?  He screwed up my order when I'm not watching.  Not sure if he's doing this on purpose or he's trying to screw the store over.  I'll tell the owner next time I see him..."}
{"text":"Great milk tea! They have awards for it as well! Not for the faint of heart as it is quite strong. food isn't the greatest but the run of the mill breakfast (eggs and toast) is okay! The Beef Satay noodles are also good! (I tried the other soup noodles and were disappointed) but the milk tea makes up for it"}
{"text":"Should have listened to the other reviews. Came here for dinner and thought how bad could the food be? Answer: it's bad. I gave it 2 stars because the tea is good."}
{"text":"Although the decor could use a bit of touch up, Marathon Cafe maintains the cosy, quaint and rustic atmosphere of your traditional HK cafe. If you are looking for a solid Milk Tea, this is the place to go to get your fix. The staff are quite friendly and the service is prompt. What can I say, good tea good time."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly but cutlery was greasy. Food was just ok. But hygiene level... definitely needs improvement."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out the infamous, award-winning HK milk tea at Marathon!   This location can be tough to spot as it is tucked away in a little plaza. The interior is dark and you'll need to order up at the counter, take a number and seat yourself.   According to my friends from Hong Kong, this is how it is back at home. The grungy atmosphere with TVs playing old drama and elderly folks reading the newspaper.   I ordered wontons with instant noodles with an additional order of egg sandwiches ($1.50 extra). This combo came with the milk tea for a total of $6.75 plus tax.   The milk tea is rich and creamy - I can definitely taste the award winning feature of this drink. I will be trying the iced version next time!   As for the food, it's your standard HK cafe style dishes. You can't really go wrong with instant noodles and wonton. Needless to say, I will be back to try out more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the milk tea. I heard they got an award for the best milk tea in North America. I only come here for the milk tea, I never tried the foods."}
{"text":"Always got their HK Style Milk Tea - I find that their Scarborough location is better than Richmond Hill. Better taste, and less milky."}
{"text":"The Milk Tea is very smooth and creamy! No wonder it is awarded! Need to come and get a second cup.  This restaurant also offers a good variety of HKStyle breakfasts. It also has a tv  playing TV programs un Hong Kong and offers free wifi but the wifi never works.  I ordered a typical Hong Kong style breakfast, 1 sausage, 2 slices of ham, a few  bacons,  2 eggs,  fries, and two slices of  bread. There are a little bit of everything on the plate. The quality of the breakfast is not super good and it's a bit pricey to its quality but the tea is amazing.   I will come back for the tea but don't recommend the food there."}
{"text":"The milk tea is the best, hands down. Came for a quick breakfast because it was along the highway, before heading north.  Your usual Hong Kong diner fanfare. Can't go wrong with most items. Follow your senses. Ordered a tomato omelette because it's not as carb heavy. Delicious and tummy warming"}
{"text":"After Dim Sum at Dragon , I discovered this little gem and stopped in for a cup of iced HK style milk tea and coffee/tea mixed. Both excellent. Milk tea was silky smooth. Wonderful. Don't mind a cup every morning.  The stars are milk tea and Hk style toasted bun.  Everything else is a-ok!"}
{"text":"A big thank you goes to my yelper friend Jennifer K for bringing me along to this hidden little cafe located off of East Beaver Creek in Richmond Hill.   It's fairly unassuming when you walk in, set up like basic cafe, with a front order desk and several flat screens tuned to Chinese Television (TVB to be exact). As I'm told it's the most popular Hong Kong television station  - my yelpers teach me so much!  Nothing beats Free Wifi and an award winning H.K style milk tea (a black tea base). Looking at the menu the prices are extremely reasonable (the medium milk tea was $2.25 taxes in - however my friends informed me this was a tad expensive).   Would I have ever walked into this place on my own? Not likely, not for anything I wouldn't have known any different. Will I return to sit, have an extremely strong milk tea (seriously I'm buzzing right now) and do some work using their free (unlocked) wifi - heck yes!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in the Toronto area, I just have to go to Marathon Cafe. They are my hands-down favorite cha chaan teng outside of Hong Kong. The milk tea is an A+ in my book (rich and strong), and the food is your standard Hong Kong diner food. I love the butter and condensed milk toast, the egg sandwiches, and the soup noodle dishes. It tastes just like you're in HK!  The diner itself is usually clean but not amazingly decorated or anything, and the service is pretty standard. It's essentially a fast food diner, providing very quick and tasty meals and drinks."}
{"text":"Marathon Cafe Milk tea won many awards as I first tried this couple years ago at their Scarborough location.  The newest addition is in Richmond Hill so I stop by to have a look.  Place is in one of the strip plaza that is usually deserted so it was good to see this place bring people in.  So I walked in and notice you have to seat yourself and order at the counter like Timmies.  They even have a sizing chart for your milk tea like Timmies.  Overall, I got to say I am really disappointed with the whole experience even the good milk tea can't save this place with food that lousy.  You can this a sandwich when you have 1 tiny piece of meat and 1 lettuce.  And you didn't even toast it for me.  You going to charge me $5+ for this junk. Wow. just wow.  I will only come back to get the milk tea for take out next time and go elsewhere for food.  Going to give them 2 stars since the milk tea was pretty good so extra point there.  Rating:  Service: 2/5 Food Quality: 1/5 Comfort 2/5 Decor  2/5 Value: 1/5 Parking: 4/5"}
{"text":"Food is so bad. Would only ever come here for milk tea in future. Ordered pork chop bun and there was no pork chop to be found basically just bun and a ton of mayo and a piece of lettuce."}
{"text":"The menu is definitely overpriced! A combo of satay noodles, egg sandwich and mike tea costs $10 compares $7 in a sit down HK style restaurant! This place is a food court style but the price is like a  sit down restaurant! I don't feel anything special in their milk tea ! I would not go back at all !"}
{"text":"Best milk tea in the city. It is best when you see a man taking care of things behind the counter and in the kitchen, he's the one who makes the award winning milk tea. It's always good even without him, but when he's there he makes the tea at a whole new level.  I've eaten here a few times and the food was bad both times (chicken wings and a sandwich). Their donuts are good (albeit small), though."}
{"text":"marathon cafe has the best hong kong milk tea in toronto yet. this restaurant is officially my go-to restaurant for breakfast. they give amazing customer service, food orders are quick especially in the morning when im always in a rush heading to work (most of the time). amazing food options. it is a #musttry!    i can definately say that this awarded milktea are better than some restaurants that are situated in hong kong"}
{"text":"The club sandwich review continues!   My husband has a unwavering and constant craving for club sandwiches and HK milk tea.   We stopped at Marathon because they still have the strongest HK milk tea in the GTA and we were desperate for caffeine.  I ordered an instant noodle with pieces of corn beef in a scrambled fried egg, nothing spectacular to rave about.   The club sandwich today was subpar.   They ran out of their usual club sandwich meat by 1pm so we ordered the pork club sandwich.   For some unknown reason, the sandwich seems more meager than their usual club.   It only contained a slice of ham and a small piece of fried pork.   Definitely not worthy of $8.50 (including a small tea).      3.5 stars / 5 - mainly because of their HK milk tea."}
{"text":"Don't come here! Someone told me this place was pretty good so I went with some friends expecting it to be a good hong kong style cafe...  I ordered the satay beef rice noodle soup but it was arguably the worst i've ever had lol. The noodles were stuck together in my bowl and a little too undercooked, as if they didnt even take the time to fully bring them to a boil. My soup wasnt hot ((there wasn't even much soup to even cover all the noodles anyway)), and although most restaurants use a satay paste for their beef sauce, in my bowl the paste was clumped under folds of meat and it was too salty!!! It was cheap though, like $5.75 before tax, but you get what you pay for...  Not to mention you have to wait in a to order your food, as the waiters dont take your order. Which makes it really inefficient and crowded in the tiny restaurant. It's basically a sketch food court restaurant. And it's not clean inside.. It's small but the tables have residue from previous customers and the washrooms are just disgusting.   So dont worry, I gotchu fam -- do yourself a favour and spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"A newish place for good HK style milk tea, free wifi, and chill.  Nothing foo foo here, you order at the counter, grab your teas to-go or find a table to sit at, very efficient service, if not overly warm.  Milk teas come in several sizes, with sample size cups clearly displayed by the cash register.  Like!  Parking is usually available.  Overall, same quality as the original Marathon Cafe at Finch-Midland, more spacious and easier access."}
{"text":"Their milk tea is award winning! Their original location is in Scarborough on midland. Love their milk teas - im addicted (: havent tried their food however as it doesnt look that appetizing"}
{"text":"Marathon Cafe is a decent cafe, serving Hong Kong style breakfast and also a variety of noodle/soup dishes. While food is not the best here, the Hong Kong style milk tea is a winner, especially the cold version."}
{"text":"Came for a cheap dinner with my brother and sister in-law. It wasn't hard to find, but all the higher end restaurants across the street overshadow this small cafe (Keg, Alice fazooli's, etc). I ordered the Tuesday special, which was the ??? (pork chop rice). On the menu, it looked very appetizing with a lot of colours (veggies). We were ready to place our orders, so we waited at the table.. Not knowing we had to go up to order. We got a little agitated and I walked up to the counter. I realized a medium sized sign that read \"Order Here\". So that kind of diffused my anger after I realized we had made the mistake.  They didn't take long to make our food. I'd say about 6-8 minutes and they had our food ready. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I was expecting. After seeing the menu photo and the actual dish that was in front of me, I quickly regret choosing this place to eat. I had a choice between The Keg and this, but I decided this.. And I was SO WRONG. My pork chop rice wasn't very appetizing after all.. And all the veggies in the menu photo.. LIES! I didn't have a single green on my plate. Not even frozen veggies for goodness sake. Utterly disappointed.. Fortunately, their saving grace arrived in the form of a HK milk tea. It was gold.. I'd buy 5 more and fill my stomach with that than the pork chop.  1 star for price and 1 for milk tea  PS: if you are deciding between two restaurants and one of them is this, I'd recommend you choose the other.. Lol"}
{"text":"Came here to try the food once more. Thought that last time was a one off but no. I have now tried 6 dishes from here and the food is absolute crap.   Today I ordered the special. Black pepper sauce pork chop on rice. It wasn't cheap at $7.50. The pork chops were thin, fatty and tasteless. The black pepper sauce was the thickest, dollop of sauce ever. It didn't taste too bad but the consistency was dreadful. In the middle of the rice was a hard ball of rice crust.(faan jeew). My kids got preserved veg & pork vermicelli. It was really greasy but was a decent sized bowl and tasted ok.   I will not be returning here ever again. The food is dreadful. Somebody else mentioned that they had the special today, and they have stomach ache. I have an iron stomach, thank God.  You can get much tastier food from food courts. Even the food at Kitchen M is ten times better than here."}
{"text":"Pros:  Their milk tea is really good and they didn't win an award for nothing! It's not too sweet and very smooth and silky. Ive only had it cold so not sure about the hot version  Cons:  The place looks really run down and dirty, not a place j want to stick around and hang out. The food is so so. I think they would do well with a renovation.  Come here for the milk tea but get food somewhere else."}
{"text":"I only tried its award winning hk styled milk tea. It is very smooth and won't give you any bitter or sour after-taste.  can't comment on other dishes though."}
{"text":"Some people are giving a pretty harsh review... I'll be up front about this - you're not going to get 5 star restaurant quality food here. You need to be realistic about your expectations when you come.   The whole point of HK style cafes is to be quick and cheap. Maybe I was lucky and my food came out pretty good? Maybe people are just unreasonable and expect a $25 entree for half the price.   I got one of the special combos for $11, which included a fried egg sandwich (none of this nasty cold egg salad nonsense), satay beef and instant noodles, and a iced milk tea.   First sip of the milk tea - phenomenal. I am usually not that sensitive to caffeine but I had mine, and most of my girlfriends and I couldn't sleep. They make their tea nice and strong. Love it.   Egg sandwich came on asian style white bread (love it. no wonderbread garbage) with the crust cut off for you so it's super soft. Hot and fresh.   Beef and noodles were ok. There was a decent amount of beef. Filled me up enough.   My girlfriend got the satay fried chicken wings in ho fun. The chicken wings are really big, and they fry them right after you order so you won't get nasty cold chicken wings.   Overall I had a pretty decent experience. There isn't much service here, but as long as I get my food, whatever. You pay at the counter and that's it. Will come again!"}
{"text":"I was looking for hk style Cafe breakfast this morning and this was one of the top reviewed cafes in the area. After reading all the reviews I wasn't impressed at all. I don't know why everyone is giving this place five stars. I did see a lot of people praising the milk tea but in my opinion it wasn't award winning good. The food is really small portioned and not impressive at all. My husband and I ordered the sausage omelette, luncheon meat and egg instant noodles, ham and egg sandwich and pork chop thousand Island bun (yes, we eat a lot lol) . The bread, fries and hashbrown taste like supermarket bought   I also find the restaurant dirty. I sat at one table and had to move immediately cause I could smell the toilet from the table. They are very under staffed where there was 3 tables that were not cleaned and I had to tell the waiter to pick up the previous customers dirty dishes so I could use the table.   Don't think I'll be coming back here even though the selection of dishes are a lot of my hk style fav dishes."}
{"text":"Okay, this place definitely does not deserve 1-2 stars, guys. I'm reading these reviews \"too expensive\", \"not good quality\" .. I just want to facepalm because well, have you ever been to a HK style cafe???  I came here because it's known for it's milk tea. I don't even drink milk tea ever, because dairy does not sit well with my stomach. (nor does it sit well in anyone's stomach, let's be honest achem achem we weren't meant to drink cow milk). The boyfriend loves milk tea though so we had to venture here, at some point. We didn't even know they had food!  Came in here, it was completely empty and literally zero service. Woman didn't glance at me even when I walked up to her. So pretty much you order and then eat. I'm coo' with that. Most people here take out but we sat in. We got two combos - one being $11 with an egg sandwich (made with quality asian bread!!!), a bowl of satay beef instant noodles and a cold hk milk tea. The other one was my satay chicken wing noodles + a cold hk milk tea for around $7-8. That's why I am genuinely confused when I read reviews saying this is not 'worth it' ... DON'T BE SO CHEAP!   It was actually a lot of food. The wait was a bit long, but that's because they were making it fresh - my chicken was hot, hot, hot! Good ratio of meat to noodle and egg to bread. The satay chicken wings were HUUUUGEEE and had a lot of sauce. The ho fun I ordered with it tasted higher quality than those cheap little bags you can get at foody mart. And let's not forget the milk tea. I only drank a few sips before I had to run my ass to the washroom. I'm sorry you had to read that but if you're lactose intolerant in the slightest, do not get this because it is so rich in cream? milk? at the same time as it is rich in the caffeine and 'tea' taste. Quality milk tea, if I do say so myself. My boyfriend loved it though and I ended up getting him 1L of milk tea (pls pray for him that he will not drink it all in one sitting) ..you can also get 2L for $15. DIABEEEETUS.  Overall, service isn't there but who cares? Food is quality for what you get and please, it's a HK cafe not the keg. Beggars can't be choosers. Don't complain when you get a whole meal for under $10. I'd definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cold HK milk tea and condensed milk and butter bun for $4.25. The bun was actually a burger bun which was kind of unusual. The salty buttery taste and sweet condensed milk was nice. The cold HK milk tea was okay. It had a slight bitter aftertaste and grittiness as expected.  The cafe is small with a lot of seating. Menus and specials  posters are all over the walls. The lighting is not ideal for pictures. The place is quite busy for a small cafe in a business area on a Saturday afternoon.  It's not service intensive but it's okay. You order at the back counter and then take your seat. The servers bring your order to your table and eventually take away plates.  There is free wifi! Pw: hkmilktea Not many other benefits here compared to other cafes."}
{"text":"For a place that is known for their milk tea, I decided to give the food a try too, with the assumption that it would at least taste decent.  Turns out I was wrong about the food. Super disappointing, we ordered baked chicken with tomato sauce on rice. The rice wasn't cooked so it was hard. Who would've thought that such a simple ingredient could turn out so horrible. The dish was also tasteless, even though I added a bunch of sat to it, it still tasted terrible. We also ordered teriyaki sauce with diced up beef. The rice was from the same batch so it was also uncooked. For this dish the teriyaki sauce was too salty. Finally, we had satay beef instant noodles, and that was bad too... definitely could have made it better at home.   Now onto the service, I complained about the uncooked rice and tasteless baked rice to one of the servers, she asked me if I wanted to switch to spaghetti. Of course I didn't want to because the dish was tasteless to begin with. I chose a different something else, and when they brought it to the table, she literally put it down and walked away. Not even a sorry or anything that 2/3 of our dishes had raw rice in it.   Definitely would never ever come back again, worst cafe ever."}
{"text":"Milk tea is sometimes good.  Sometimes not.  When one of the bosses are on location (or one of the waiter that actually smiles and shows care for the tea) the milk tea is at another level.  When none of them are there, the milk tea better than average, but not by much.  Both me and my relatives can't stomach the cold milk tea.  There's just something about it that makes us nauseous after drinking a few sips.  This ONLY APPLIES FOR R.HILL location.  Scarborough location is much more consistent.  If you are planning on taking a friend to try it out for the first time, go to the scarb location OR wait till weekend and go to R.Hill."}
{"text":"I really wish they stick with milk tea only, because if they only serve milk tea, this place would be 5 of 5 easily!  But i guess since they wanna earn more money and make use of the large area, they started serving hot food here too.  Hot food is relatively cheap, but the quality is pretty darn bad.  My 3 stars rating is due to their great milk tea but terrible food! You want top quality milk tea in Markham, this is the place to be!  Very strong tea flavour and tastes great!  I highly recommend trying the milk tea cold/iced but make sure you pass on the food completely."}
{"text":"A fellow Yelper introduced me to the Hong Kong style milk tea, now I haven't gone anywhere except Marathon to get these because they win awards for this tea. Once you taste it espically if you haven't tried it before there will be a good chance you will be hooked like myself. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Didn't know about this place until one of my Asian coworkers took us there after lunch to experience HK milk tea (after all, I'd just taken them for east coast donairs, so it was time to repay the experience).  So how was it?  Location/ambience: - Good.  Lots of parking, located in a strip plaza with lots of other restaurants and businesses.  Bright, clean, pretty busy for 2pm on a Friday (maybe 1/3rd full still).  It was a bit of menu overload since they have prices and products listed in multiple areas around the cash register, where you go to order/pay before you get your order. And as with most places in the area, you need to go with someone who knows what's what, or know what you want, to avoid looking like a noob or a tourist :)  Score: 3.5/5  Food/Price: - We came for the HK milk tea, which I agree is phenomenal.  Some minor gripes:  1) If you get it cold, you can only get the large or extra large 2) You pay a dollar extra for cold vs hot, though I was told this is normal at places that do this drink 3) I wasn't asked if I wanted sugar - they just made it with sugar automatically.  Not sure if this is maybe standard for the cold version - my coworker thought they'd ask.  Anyways, no harm done - I usually take tea without sugar, but this is kind of like a tea version of an Iced Cap, and you probably wouldn't want one of those without sugar either. The tea is really quite good - very unique, and I think I'm hooked.  The tea itself is a 5/5, though the pricing was confusing and bizarre so 3/5 for that.  Service: - Good, fast service.  As with most non-western establishments, don't expect a lot of big fake smiles and chit-chat, just pleasant people taking your order, and giving you what you paid for.  It's refreshing in a way, as I tend to get tired sometimes of the overly chipper wait staff in mainstream western restaurants.  Score: 5/5.  Overall, loving the tea - the menus could use some streamlining - like I said, way too many places to look, so if you're a little less adventurous or don't like asking questions, bring someone who's been here before on your first visit."}
{"text":"Word on the street is that this place has won some sort of big bubble tea award in Hong Kong. Fortuitously, hot summer days and bubble tea go together like peanut butter & jelly, so I didn't have to think twice before giving this place a try.  I wasn't disappointed at all. The biggest gripe I have with most bubble tea places is that all of their drinks are, by default, too sweet. I frequently forget to ask for \"half-sweet\" and end up suffering for it dearly. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that this was not the case for Marathon. The milk tea that I had, aside from having the perfect level of sweetness, had a very smooth, unique after-taste. Were it not so far from where I lived, I would be a regular customer here for sure.  Haven't tried any of the food here yet, but reading some of the other reviews on Yelp, I won't be jumping through any hoops to change that in the near future."}
{"text":"Got real indoor quality issue, especially when staff mop while you eat."}
{"text":"I noticed this place while driving to dim sum. Marathon sounded familiar and then I realized this was the place for the famous, award winning HK milk tea. While we waited for our table at the super busy dim sum place, I was tempted so I stopped by for some take out tea. OMGEE I am glad I did...this cup of milk tea is bomb!! Soooo smooth, so good. I'm already thinking if my next cup while finishing my first cup...!!  Side note: this place seems to be good for HK style food. From what I can see on the menu, you get all the good stuff- all day breakfast, baked rice/pasta, sizzling plates, sandwiches, instant noodles etc. When I visited, the place was quite busy as well.  Can't wait till I come back for the ohh so smooth tea and food!"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good here. The milk tea is a must-try, however, I think the location at midland and finch serves better (tea flavor is stronger imo). I ordered pineapple bun and beef noodle soup. The serving size was huge and it was under $10. The pineapple bun could've been served warmer so that the butter could melt into the bread.  Food comes out quick so you won't have to starve waiting for food :)"}
{"text":"Yeah finally opened in Richmond Hill! opened 2 days ago, located across from Moxies, Jack Astors and etc..  The milk tea is so gooood! A *must try *...tea base is very bold...   As to the breakfast... just not there.. I can't have my luncheon meat deep fried... oh please.. why is my luncheon meat deep fried... sighs...   It's suppose to be pan fried.. it's half self served like the one in Scarborough, you go and buy your food at the counter and pay. Your food will be bought to you shortly..   The food needs to be improved. I'm giving it a 4-star is ONLY becuz of the milk tea... maybe I'm being biased..   But just come and buy the milk tea.. you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I got Pineapple bun with pork chop comb (fries + milk tea). Love everything here! The bun was soooo soft, and the pork is fresh and tasty?They serve the best milk tea in this area! And the fries are crispy, even better than McDonald's ( I love their fries very much! )"}
{"text":"A-lot of hype but not much substance here. Apparently, their award winning blend of HK style tea is too good for the average joe as it wasn't available (even if you're willing to pay; I inquired). What you do get is an average (by a stretch) milk tea with a decent smooth finish; \"food court combo worthy\" I would say. Their food is not worthy of a mention as it's mediocre at best. The service is non-existent (as would you expect from such a joint). This is like the Tim Hortons of the milk tea nation and I am no fan. A star for pity."}
{"text":"The milk tea is very smooth but strong so if you like weak tea, this won't be your cup of tea! The service is unique...order and pay first at the counter , food brought to table. I guess you could avoid paying tips?  Ordered breakfast items (sausage and eggs,roast beef and eggs) and it's fairly mediocre. I did like the upgrade to the crispy condensed milk bun instead of toast.  Overall, stop for the tea but pass on the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is overrated.  Ordered baked pork chopped with rice and curried beef brisket over rice during lunch time.  Our order took so long and we were seated before others and they got their orders before us.  We also had the milk tea and I seriously had better milk tea elsewhere.  It was a disappointing experience so this was our first and time time here."}
{"text":"Speed Read: 1) Milk Tea is OK - definitely not the award winning one. 2) Food - Corned beef egg Sandwich - Super thin slice of egg and corn beef - not good.  The biggest attraction of this place is the \"Award winning milk tea,\"  and they charge a premium for it. I've been to this place multiple times for the tea, and I would say it's a hit and miss. In the best of time, it's still not the award winning taste.  On my unlucky day, it's just milk with over-soaked bitter tea.  If this is any old HK style restaurant, I would give it 3 stars as an average restaurant.   However, if they brag about their award winning milk tea and charge a premium for it, then I expect them to live up to their brand and claims.  Food - Corned beef Egg sandwich. How can u possibly screw up? Well, by giving me a tiny piece of egg/corn beef between the bread.  It's $5.5+tax for the sandwich and tea, please provide me with something of decent size.  If you read it this far, here's a tip: wifi password: hkmilktea  Please like or compliment me if you enjoy reading this.  Thanks! Any feedback from reader and the restaurant are welcomed."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place because of their outstanding milk tea. however, their food is not even close to their high standard of hk milk tea. I have tried their breakfast, noddles and rice dishes. All of them taste plain and one time, my rice smelled strange..... I think it was cooked long time ago and has been siting in the kitchen for very long.   I will only do milk tea take-out next time. Marathon should really upgrade their food for the people who came here for milk tea and wanted to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Come for the drinks and nothing else. 5 stars for the iced lemon tea - its flavour is different from your typical cafe! Milk tea & condensed milk bun are ok.   But the dinner food - meat sauce on white rice - possibly the worst ever. The egg & corned beef sandwich was sad and soggy.  To top it off, everything is way overpriced."}
{"text":"4 stars for the milk tea, 2 stars for the ham and egg with toast, 3 stars for the service. When can me rate for half a star here at Yelp?  I'd definitely go back only for the milk tea.... Or better yet try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I come here only for their milk tea and toasted bun with condensed milk and butter,  Love their milk tea; both hot and cold.  Cold milk tea with ice cream is yummmm Tried honey drink with ginger; not bad.   ** Free French Toast or Toasted bun with condensed milk and butter on birthday with ID - dine in only **  Just noticed this birthday freebie when waiting for take out today : )"}
{"text":"It's your typical Hong Kong style cafe/diner...cheap & quick food, very basic eating area, order your food from counter, minimal service with little etiquette, average rating food, and small portions.  Don't expect more as this type of setting is expected for your general Chinese cafe/diner.  The only saving grace is the Hong Kong tea is better than average. It definitely has a stronger flavor of black tea with high proportion of evaporated milk making it heavier and creamier. I wouldn't say it's an award winning tea but definitely better than the average tea.  Would I come here again? Probably, if I'm in the neighbourhood for some cheap Chinese food, by myself, and in a rush...sure, why not."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on their milk tea. I heard a lot of good things about the milk tea here, including that it has won some awards (you can see it all over the front door when entering).  This cafe is located in a small plaza off of Hwy 7 on East Beaver Creek.  It has a large green sign with a horse head as their symbol. Parking can be hectic in this plaza during peak times. But otherwise its not too hard to find parking.  When you first walk into this cafe, you will find a counter at the back of the restaurant with the words \"ORDER HERE\" right above the counter. Their menu is hung all around their walls, so as you walk up you can see all the daily specials and offerings, though I was here just for the milk tea.  This is not a restaurant where you go, sit down and be served, its more of a cafeteria style setting. Meaning you walk up to the counter, place your order, and if ordering food they will give you a little tent card, you find a place to sit and they bring you your food.  During rush hour, they are actually quite busy with take out orders for their drinks. I ordered their large cold milk tea and it came out to $4.75 flat.   Their milk tea I found did have a very nice flavor profile. Upon first sip, I found it to be smooth and creamy with a hint of sweetness. It finally ended with a bit of a bitter after taste from the strong black tea they must use. But overall I felt the milk tea is as advertised, its pretty darn good!   Also to note, if you feel like playing some lotto they also sell instant lotto cards you can scratch. So you may walk into this cafe for the milk tea, but you may win cash for life as well!"}
{"text":"Marathon Cafe is known for their award winning HK milk tea.  So I was pleasantly surprised when they opened up in Richmond Hill.    Today I ordered a Ham Omelet combo. They were kind enough to make a custom omelet for me as I had asked if they could add onions/green pepper inside to make it less boring.  I am unsure if I had to pay extra but my total came out to $5.40 after taxes.  The food came quickly.  The omelet was a bit hard though, the onions were slightly undercooked, the toast was the non-HK type which was hard and not soft/condensed.  Did not try other items on the menu so I cannot comment on overall food quality here.  Marathon Cafe is different than other restaurants as you need to go up and pay for your food before sitting down.  The place is clean and nice, the staff was very friendly especially when compared to their Scarborough location.  There is free wifi and LCD TV's showing chinese programs."}
{"text":"The HK style milk tea is on of the best around. I can drink this all day, everyday and would not get bored of this drink. When combined with the bread with condensed milk and butter its $4.25. The butter bread is literally like the name suggests. I do not recommend the bread because its something that can be easily made at home and it would taste exactly the same as it does here. There is no added effort to make the bread stand out. The milk tea is highly recommended though."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since I was in the area. Mainly for the milk tea because the tea tastes more similar to the ones you can get back in Hong Kong. Order at the cash and they give you a number so they can deliver the food to your table. Starts to get busy when the lunch hour hits since its in an industrial area. Food is okay. Price is on the higher end of HK style cafes but if you're willing to pay $7-8 for a bubble tea from chatime or $6 for a frap at starbucks.....why not here? Staff are definitely friendlier here than at the Scarborough location. Overall, average food but good milk teas :)"}
{"text":"It's quick and fast. Same Cha Chaan Tangs like the ones around the city except it has a more \"fast food\" feeling to them. Lots of booth seats (and roomy too). Food is what it is.  HK milk tea may say their award wining, but it tastes at par with others like \"Leslie Cafe\" (Finch/Leslie), Phoenix (Bayview/407, Steeles/Woobine) etc."}
{"text":"I was complete excited to find out that Marathon opened up a branch in Richmond Hill, so I didn't have to make the trek down to their original location.  The Milk tea is wonderful and while pricier than other places, it's well worth it to drop your coin on the Marathon Version of HK style Milk tea.   Everything else, however, I can't say I'm a huge fan of their food, I guess my reaction to it, while the milk tea is easily the best thing on the menu, everything else is kind of meh.. to \"where is the flavour\"   I definitely don't recommend the BBQ pork on rice; which the BF said was easily bland and forgettable.  Their satay beef macaroni isn't bad, but it isn't knock your socks off with flavor either.   Overall - I'd say come for the milk tea, and a pineapple bun, everything else is just ok."}
{"text":"I love HK style milk tea and this please is now close to me so I will be here often.  This is the only place I know where large is 16 oz as most places large is about a medium."}
{"text":"I been to this location and so far the yelp reviews look consistently good on their milk tea. Dropped by this place on a Sunday afternoon and it was busy!  Ordered large cold Hong Kong style milk tea 20oz. ($4.20) It was refreshing, sweet, silky and smooth. Hong Kong style tea was a good balance between bitter and sweet. It was simply delicious. This tea is best served hot or cold... doesn't matter it's all good.  Speaking of busy afternoon, almost everyone had a cup of Hong Kong style tea or lemon tea at their table and the few people ahead ordered takeout Hong Kong style tea. side note: the restaurant serves food too -fluffy egg sandwiches, macaroni soup, baked buns, etc. There were quite a few diners inside.. at least a third of tables occupied tables all with food.i have never tried the food before and I'm not sure about the food.. it looks okay but, definitely come visit and try their Hong Kong style tea! Hot or cold it doesn't matter! Once the hot tea beverage cools down it still tastes just as nice! The service is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Steer clear.  The food here is awful and the milk tea is barely average- yes, they've won an award but that was years ago.  The fried eggs that came with my vermicelli soup noodles was broken so the yolk leaked into the soup. The soup itself was bland and tasted a little soapy even- this was true for my soup noodles as well as my companion's. He ordered sausage vermicelli soup noodles with an egg sandwich. The bread used for the sandwich was stale and old, and the scrambled egg in the sandwich was chewy and overcooked- nothing like the fluffy egg that you're supposed to get.  Do yourself a favor and don't eat here- the kitchen doesn't seem to care about the food that they serve. The prices they charge for the quality that you get is a joke."}
{"text":"Weekday dinner, 3, take-out.  I had a cup of cold milk tea. I don't think I'm qualified to comment on it (eg. world class?), but I had no problem with it.  The staff were friendly. The food took an exceptionally long time to come out. However, I did enjoy it a lot when I finally got home to eat it.  The Spaghetti Bolognese (?????) was oily, but tasted good once the meat sauce was mixed well with the spaghetti. On Thursdays, this dish is the daily deal at $6.99 and includes a hot drink, is a good deal.  Their baked tomato sauce pork chop on rice (??????) has one of my favourite tomato sauces out of all the different HK-style cafes I've tried. It's very satisfying and mixes well with the white rice base of the dish."}
{"text":"i must be high. but i did not enjoy it here at all. ordered pork chop bun with milk tea, approx $5.  my wonderbread nontoasted sandwich had porkchop not even covering half my sandwich and acted more like a garnish (basically eatting straight up wonderbread-no exagerration!).  truly disappointing.  i know, i must have ordered the wrong thing, but this just ruined my first impression.  they shouldn't even be serving anything like this AT ALL on the menu.   milk tea, which is what it's known for, is a strong cup of milk tea, if that's how you roll, you'll love it here. (surprisingly, comes in different sizes)  also this is not a standard diner, the way it works is you order and seat yourself in which they bring over the food once it's ready (or/and call out you're number).  parking: 5/5 ample location: 3/5 meh uptown near chako/destiny plaza food: 1/5 atmosphere: 2  standard ghetto diner, nothing special"}
{"text":"Heard alot about their milk tea and finally got a chance to try the very first time. I order my favour dish satay beef vermicelli in soup. The milk tea was OK, maybe I expected too much since they won the milk tea champion before. The satay beef vermicelli was a small portion and it was in water not soup because it had totally tasteless. The satay beef taste weird. Will I come back for their milk tea? Maybe yes, will I come back for their food? Most likely not..."}
{"text":"I've only tried their award winning HK milk tea. I always get it iced, as I love cold drinks. It's very strong tasting black tea, perfect sweetness and very smooth. Their large iced is $3.75 flat if you pay cash (iced drinks cost more than hot ones). They also accept debit, but charge some sort of fee, about 25 cents per transaction. Apparently they also sell their milk tea in small to large takeway jugs now so that you can have some in the convenience of your home.   I haven't really tried anything other than their milk tea here. Based on other reviews it look safe to say their drinks are what shine."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for when I need a space to study that serves actual beverages. Marathon serves top-notch milk tea; one of the best that Toronto has to offer to date. Although it might not be the prettiest establishment, it is a comfortable for casual conversation or in my case, an extended study session."}
{"text":"They are well known for their milk tea which is the best!! Minus one star only because the food was half decent. This place is unique for the hk feel it brings me. It's just like Hong Kong you order pay then sit down. It's not nearly perfect since their was some mistakes with the toast we got but the manager was very nice about it. Normally restuarants would charge for sauces on the side but when I asked they didn't charge me. Tips was also not mandatory but they deserve it for the nice service and satisfaction they brought me. I usually never go into a place without complaining about it but this place has certainly satisfied all my needs."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Quiet at times I guess it was post lunch so I decided to try it out. A very good small place hidden from other areas of HK style food. Cheap good eats, I am not sure if the wifi was working or not couldn't connect at all. I tried the curry chicken on rice, nice portion size needs a bit more chicken. Will return again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"We really like coming here for a quick casual meal!  The value for one is really great, all meals are under $15 and pretty much everything comes with a drink. The milk tea is really good, better than most places and the food isn't bad!  The restaurant has a fast-food feel to it, you order at the front cashier and they bring your food to you. The people working there are generally friendly, we've never had any issues with service.  For around $30 you can really have a large meal for 2. For this price we got the satay beef and noodle soup combo which came with a cold milk tea, an egg sandwich and the noodle soup for $8.99. The egg sandwich was surprisingly delicious and the beef soup wasn't bad, not very salty which was good. We also had the mixed meat sizzling platter which came with a good portion of steak, pork chop, chicken and a hot dog, on a pile of fries, some corn and a tomato, covered in their black pepper gravy. This meal also came with a drink and spaghetti, which unlike a lot of HK cafes actually has tomato sauce on it and can be eaten on its own. It's really a ridiculous amount of food and most of it was actually quite delicious!  The food is pretty good considering the price. You really can't expect to get a keg quality steak at McDonalds prices, but for the prices, the flavour and freshness are pretty good!  We also had the coke float which was standard but still a nice treat.   The restaurant isn't very pretty, but it's passable and clean enough if you're used to Chinese restaurants. Posters of their menu cover most of the walls, there are also TVs playing Chinese shows.   We will definitely be back, the breakfast seems interesting and we really enjoyed our meals there which we would get again!"}
{"text":"just walked in grabbed a milk tea and walked out. was just what i expected of it."}
{"text":"Hit or miss.  Always packed with toddlers like it is a daycare.  More of a place to go to grab an HK tea and get out, not somewhere I'd recommend for sit down food let alone a proper date unless you don't mind the noise of children and mothers everywhere.   Seems a bit overpriced but I guess that's what happens when you open shop in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"All these hype about Marathon Cafe's winning Milk Tea maybe hard to understand.   This newest Marathon Cafe in Richmond Hill though is one of the nicest Hong Kong Style Cafe to chill...  It operates more like a self serve coffee shop where you order and pay for your food, pick up your drinks and the food will deliver to your table.  This location is a lot more spacious than Scarborough. +0.5  Free Wifi! and Chinese TV program for you to enjoy.  Food is so so and with a limited menu. I wish my tea is served in a real \"HK Milk Tea Style\" cup...  Milk tea quality can be a hit or miss... since the winner is not really at the counter and make that winning tea for you when you visit!   Cash Only!"}
{"text":"I saw the ad \" best milk in town\" Maybe too much hype, the milk was okay but just the regular taste. Normal....."}
{"text":"Ordered luncheon meat + 2 fried eggs w toast n milk tea $5 + macaroni in soup w ham +$3.  My macaroni seems a little under cook. Other than that food was good.   Quick service. Free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Marathon Cafe is pretty good for lunch and snack as there are numerous combos that are lunch appropriate.  Most of them are noodles and rices, all come with Marathon's famous Hong Kong milk tea or coffee.  The shop works like a diner, in that customers pay at front desk, get their own tables (no greeter to seat customers), and obtain the food at counter themselves when the food is ready.   We ordered a beef brisket on rice noodle combo ($8.50) and a pork chops on egg noodle ($5.75).  The beef brisket on rice noodle had lots of beef chunks and noodle.  It surely could satisfy a big man's hunger.  My BF said the broth tasted spicy and sweet yet a little bit oily.  The pork chops noodle came with 3 pieces of pork chops of good size.  While the pork chops tasted average, the egg noodle tasted really good, and its texture was similar to wonton noodle.  I think the value of both combos are okay.  Just a note that the chili oil is potent.  A little bit in the soup noodle goes a long way; I learn this the hard way.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"MY FAVOURITE HONG KONG CAFE! I love this place so much! Every time I walk in the door I'm greeted by the friendly manager's face! The way to order at this place is to walk up to the counter order your food and pay, and then they will bring your food to your table. I always get the baked pork chop here it is 10/10! Their milk tea is so good, there is a reason they won #1 in a milk tea competition! AND THE BEST PART IS THEIR PRICES ARE SO CHEAP!   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place by my brother as him and his coworkers often drop by for cheap HK style drinks.  Prices are quite fair (if you're comparing to BBT giants like Chatime etc). Marathon Cafe is quite popular within the asian community. Its your typical Cha Chan Tang style of food and drinks but I was pleasantly surprised about its cleanliness when I walked in. Usually its not this bright and clean. The workers were friendly, it'd help if you could speak Cantonese though.  Ive been a huge fan of ice cream black/milk tea after trying it once in Waterloo but I havent been able to find anywhere from the BBT giants in toronto that offer this. I was estatic when I saw that they had this on their menu. The tea tasted strong and delicious and the ice cream hit the spot. I am interested in coming back and trying more of the items on the menu for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Hong Kong Style Milk Tea, so good that it actually won awards. Open early so I can grab breakfast to go before heading to work"}
{"text":"I would rate the milk tea 3 stars but the food, 0 stars. Ordered the Thousand Island Pork Chop w Fries and the Pork Chop Bun. The pork chop was dry, flavourless, and super small. Overpriced food that doesn't even taste good.  Would not recommend this place except for their drinks."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend people to come here for the HK milk tea! It's absolutely delicious and much faster than other bubble tea places if you just want a drink. They have food choices as well which are also very typical HK meals for breakfast and lunch/dinner at decent prices. It's a food court style cafe so you would order, pick up a number, and they'll bring your food to you. One more thing - they sell their milk tea in 2L bottles at $15+HST! Keep in mind there aren't any preservatives you'd have to finish it in 3-4 days, but it'd be good to share with a group of people. This place is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Recommend by a friend. I came to try their milk tea after dinner else where. I like strong tea taste so didnt ask for sugar in it, and I really enjoyed it. The price was good. Also looked at the menu, they have a wide selection of other food, will come back for a meal soon."}
