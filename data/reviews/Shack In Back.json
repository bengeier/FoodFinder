{"text":"This place rocks! Used to go to the rodeos every Friday. Visited the bar often during the week. Great service, great people and great view!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this with: This is a dive bar. I love dive bars. Therefore, it's 4 star rating is for it's status as a dive bar. 

Disclosure: Ladies, if you are looking for $30,000 millionaire, Scottsdale pretty boys, this isn't your spot. Guys, if you are looking for plastic babes looking for a $30,000 millionaire, this place is not for you. 

Now that we have that straight..... This is the open air bar behind the Buffalo Chip in Cave Creek. Why do I dig this bar? First off, the bartenders are really terrific and know how to pour a drink... No watered down BS poured by a rookie with a shot measuring device trying very hard not to let you get drunk while charging you $10 a piece. And, the better you treat them, the better they treat you.

They also have live bull riding Wednesday and Friday night. Very diverse crowd makes it fun for any walk of life to go and get some free entertainment and not be hassled.

Finally and most importantly. My best buddy and constant companion is my english bulldog Frank. Even though Frank is a lover and the consummate ladies man, dogs are persona non grata at most drinking establishments. Not the case at the Shack. Mans best friend is welcome here. As long as your pup can maintain his/her cool, bring em on.... Great staff, good drinks and good prices.... Check it out"}
