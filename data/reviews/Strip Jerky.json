{"text":"I don't do this very often, writing a yelp review that is.   The two young ladies in the store were very informative and knew there product.  They gave me samples of everything before I bought a single product.  I ended up with a bag of everything they had.  The jerky has the right texture and they are using the right quality and cut.   These two ladies listened to me ideas of improvement, this place is aces.   Your missing out if your a beef jerky fan if you don't stop in."}
{"text":"The best jerky in town!!! We tried it once and will be back for more. The thai teriyaki and peppercorn now is our family favorite. Taste so good with rice too... the staff are so friendly and helpful. They have variety of flavor that you can taste it before buy it. Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"This jerky shop is awesome! All the flavors are great! Try the peppercorn, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful new artisan beef jerky shop. I have been waiting for them to open for a while, and the wait was beyond worth it. The texture and flavor of the jerky was astounding. Each flavor was properly balanced yet never overpowering the flavor of the jerky. The meat itself was a proper dryness where it wasn't overly chewy or too moist. 
A simple breakdown of flavor:
Original- simple smoke and salinity 
Honey BBQ-Sweet and savory(sesame option)
Spicy Honey BBQ-sweet and heat
Peppered-sweet and peppery
Thai-wonderful Asian spice (sesame)
Secret Atomic-ghost pepper with some sweet (off shelf by demand)
The ladies who run the shop are sweet and fun to chat with and will do a tasting of their products with you. I walked out with Spicy Honey BBQ and Thai both with sesame. Also plan to return many times.
Military and Senior discounts available as well as tunning promotions."}
{"text":"Great jerky! Quality of the jerky gave me good value for the price. At $9 or $10 per bag I was expecting high quality and it is what I got. I tried the Peppercorn and the Spicy Honey and both were awesome. Some pieces were drier than others to the touch, but in my mouth they all melted and had a great flavor!  I will definitely be coming back.

Also, not sure what the normal hours are since I didn't look, but looking now, Yelp says 10-6, but I was there at 7pm on a Tuesday and the Open sign was still on and they were making more fresh jerky in the back and came right up to help me with samples and a sale!"}
{"text":"This is the best of Las Vegas! Tour buses should include this place as a stop on their tours. Honey BBQ is so tasty that one bag is not enough. Family owned business with quality a number one priority."}
{"text":"Best jerky there is. No artificial flavors or preservatives!! It's all so good I had a difficult time figuring out which to buy. Friendly staff and great looking store. Highly recommend checking it out. You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Superior jerky for its quality beef, cut and flavors. I like the Thai Teriyaki with Sesame Seeds and the Peppercorn styles but all their flavors are really good. Very fresh and shipped fast. Great customer service. Chris Albe and his team are doing a super job. I've ordered jerky from all over and this is my favorite."}
{"text":"I am a huge jerky fan, very picky when it comes to the quality of jerky. The high quality that they serve at Strip Jerky exceeded my expectations. To the warm greeting when I first walked in and how welcoming they were to let me try a sample of every flavor. This place is my new go to spot for the best beef jerky in town! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great stuff, the Thai teriyaki with sesame seeds if the best.  Nice friendly staff. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I bought the honey BBQ and the spicy honey bbq and believe me I'm going back for more! So so good very healthy and they told me about their new lean series coming out and when trying to watch what you eat this series is going to be amazing!!!

Oh also check out FOR REAL protein there it's seriously the best shake ever!!!!"}
{"text":"No joke, I hate beef jerky...but this jerky is the absolute BEST I have ever had. Forget the convenient store jerky, or all other jerky for that matter...this is your place! Flavors are addicting, and quality is consistent. Grass fed beef instead of God only knows what your getting with commercial beef jerky. Best family owned business, people like this are hard to find especially in Vegas. They truly care about what your getting  and you being happy with the product vs what they are getting in return! Need I say more....BEST EVER!!! Even if you hate jerky, give it 1 chance you'll change your mind!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! My boyfriend has been excited for this store to open for MONTHS. So when i told him they finally opened this past week we had to try them out! Now i've honestly never liked beef jerky. But my boyfriend convinced me that I needed to give it a shot, so i did!
First off the staff is great! Everyone is super nice and welcoming. Thats one of the most important things for me when going anywhere. They were very informative about their products, and were great at helping me pick out which flavors to get. Did i mention their beef is 100% grass fed? Score! So now for the flavors, I got Spicy Honey BBQ, Original, and Thai Teriyaki.

I got Original because I wasn't sure about trying different flavors. I'm a \"plain jane\" type person and i usually go with basic to be on the safe side. Anyways, it was great! Its perfect in texture and flavor. It wasn't tough, so it wasn't insane to chew lol. And flavor wise, the light smokey-ness was yum!

Spicy Honey BBQ was another flavor I wanted because I love spice, and i love honey bbq. So i figured it was a safe flavor to try and experiment with. This one was my top favorite out of the three flavors I got. Texture wise, its also nice and chewy. Flavor wise, its got a nice little spicy flavor, but not so much it kills you. And you get a good amount of bbq flavor in there too! 

Thai Teriyaki is the third flavor I got. This one was my boyfriends top favorite. He loves Asian flavor inspired things. The employees told me this was their spiciest flavor. To me, it did have a good amount of heat but not crazy spice so that was great. I like when spice doesn't kill me! Lol. The flavor had a really nice sweet flavor that balanced out the hotness too. Texture wise, it was also nice and chewy. 

All in all, we really loved the jerky here. I was not a fan of beef jerky before, but now I am! My boyfriend and I are for sure coming back. I think you guys should deff give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty jerky. Can not get enough, also the staff is super friendly. Looking forward to getting more jerky."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the quality of their jerky. The flavor is perfected and the tenderness of each piece is consistent. I'm looking forward to trying their other flavors. Shop small business."}
{"text":"The FLAVORS of Strip Jerky is awesome which sets apart this specialty shop from all the rest! If you haven't tasted it you're in for a surprise!!! 

Peppercorn-Most popular with everyone that walks into the shop!

Spicy Honey BBQ-Perfect balance of honey and premium steak beef!

Thai Teriyaki-Great marinade with specialty spices!

Honey BBQ-Awesome balance of honey and BBQ sauce!!!

They're all great flavors! My favorite is Spicy Honey BBQ! Can't get enough of it!!!!"}
{"text":"I went there today on a whim and I'm happy I did. I bought spicy jerky for my friends and family! I tried some of their samples, and I was quite impressed. I'll come back to fuel my boyfriends jerky addiction."}
{"text":"I have to say...this is some of the best jerky I've had!
Couldn't wait so I opened a bag of the Original in the car.... can't wait to try the Honey BBQ and the Thai
Very friendly staff and talk about clean! I happened to be there when they received A rating by the Health Department!!! 
If you want the best jerky in town... StripJerky!!! Off the Strip...."}
{"text":"Best flavored jerky i've ever had!! Staff is very friendly and will recommend certain flavors depending on your taste.. also they have fountain drinks which is always a plus. Must try, you won't be disappointed."}
