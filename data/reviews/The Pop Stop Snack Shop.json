{"text":"Milkshakes are outrageously good but everything here is also outrageously priced. It's a shame that both staff (non physicians or management) and middle income families can't afford to eat here more often because of the price."}
{"text":"Not very impressed at all. I had the thanksgiving sandwich & soup for lunch yesterday. The sandwich  was ok the broccoli and cheddar soup was thin and overly salted and not much broccoli in it at all. Later that day we wanted to try the chicken gyro. I went down at 4:17PM ( they close at 5PM) one set of doors was closed they weren't cooking anything and you could only buy a drink or other small items( like chips, candy, etc.). So today we got the chicken gyros here again they are ok not really a gyro at all. They are a wrap with a cucumber sauce feta cheese mixture with lettuce and tomato covered in some type of oil. Wrapped in a flour tortilla.  I wanted to try a different soup today but they were out of soup and the special. Lack luster overly priced food, but when your stuck in the hospital there's not much you can do..."}
{"text":"Small but great selection of allergy friendly and vegan options. They have NuGo Organic vegan protein (10 gms) bars and 1 out of the 3 soups were vegan and allergy friendly (dairy free). They also sell Silk chocolate and plain soy milk and Naked fruit/veggie juices. They had clam chowder on the soup menu but it did not list ingredients. They take cash and cards."}
{"text":"This is a great place on the 3rd floor of Children's hospital. I've honestly never had anything here that wasn't delicious and well made. This place has it all - Freshly baked brownies, pies, cheesecakes, and cookies abound.   Their sandwiches, salads, and wraps are delicious and well thought-out. Best of all, all of their sandwiches are served with freshly popped popcorn! (Hence the name...) Make sure you try their \"Thanksgiving Sandwich!!\"  They also have spectacular soups, which are served with a roll and butter - perfect for lunching on.  They also have great coffee and even more incredible milkshakes and ice cream. Service is fast and friendly, and they always strive to give you a good experience. The music they play in the shop is an awesome mix of 80's and 90's music, peppered with other favorites like the Beatles, the Stones, and other well-known artists.   If you are in the hospital, it's a great place for a 'pick me up' to make the time pass and put a smile on your little one's face!"}
