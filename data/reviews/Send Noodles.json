{"text":"(Parents would mostly benefit from this review)

To end the curiosity I took my kids (two toddlers) here to try it out. Catchy sign for the exterior and an interesting look in the interior. 

We started off with some tempura green beans and bang bang broccoli for my kids and surprisingly they enjoyed the dish no questions asked. I would say that they hid the vegetables in a very fancy way (that totally made my mom life easy). Though I had to ask them to omit the spicy taste to fit my kids palate. 

Another merit for this new spot is that the servers and cooks are on their game. Considerate enough knowing that I'm with two kids by myself (either their totally nice or maybe I just look like I'm really crying out for help lol).

Then the noodles came out.. That's when I started to wonder if I should take my kids out here once a week or even more. I ordered the ramen mac-n-cheese and roasted duck. Duck was roasted perfectly and the ramen is not your average Mac-n-cheese. Somehow these dishes fit together and that their taste are like fireworks in my mouth.

Lastly, Nutella honey toasts for the win. Never in my entire life I have thought that I could go crazy over an ice cream and a bread.

We came here on a not very busy time of the day. Maybe I'll update this review when we get a chance to visit on a busier day and see if anything changes."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great ramen place or just a great place to eat in general I highly recommend send noodles. Right away I was greeted with a bright beautiful smile from the hostess Jena who was a great help throughout the entire night. I ordered the crispy chicken bao as an appetizer which was just as tasty as it was appealing. I also ate the house ramen it was nothing short of amazing. The waitress was very quick and efficient I never had to ask for a refill which is a huge plus for me. With all being said it's a place you must come to eat."}
{"text":"This place has the best gyoza's I've ever tasted.  The Singapore noodles are spicy but awesome! We tried duck for the first time and it definitely didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Visiting palms? Make sure to stop by Send Noodles, it's a little hole in the wall but food and guest service is amazing; Hostesses Jena and Mikee are very welcoming, didn't know what to eat so they suggested the best items on the menu. My server Yoshi was very friendly, ensured everything was to my liking.

For appetizers, if you like seafood try the Gyoza it's filled with delicious pork and has a hint of Shrimp. Moving on with the main course, try the Chicken Pad Thai it's very flavorful and has a good kick of spiciness. Unfortunately didn't get to try dessert but with the quality of the food, I'm sure they would of been amazing as well."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant, very tiny place. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. I had the beef chow fun, lots of very tender beef. My husband had the spicy pork noodles, and our friend had the chicken pad Thai Very large portions. The tempura green beans are amazing! Service was a little odd, all of our food was brought out at different times instead of together.  All three of us thought the food was very good."}
{"text":"This update is after the MOD reached out to me. I do appreciate that she did and I'm willing to give it another try. 

This time, I tried the macaroni and cheese ramen and the beef chow fun. I was honestly a little hesitant with the ramen but it seemed popular. I was pleasantly surprised. It had a nice smooth flavor and the noodles were perfectly al dente. Good traditional American fusion with a Korean/Japanese traditional dish. I think it would be fun to see more fusion dishes like this. Hmmm, maybe a toasted sesame cracker with pistachio nut butter and some kind of oriental fruit jelly. This could be a fun theme, mixing Asian tradition with American tradition. If the chef could expand on that, I might reconsider my taste for this place but until then...

On my first visit, I got the pad Thai. It wasn't exactly bad but I was expecting it to knock me off of my feet. Maybe because of my expectation, it seemed mediocre. This time I got the beef chow fun and it was similar. Very...normal. Which again, isn't bad. Just having high expectations seems to change my feelings towards it. 

It seems that this restaurant was a last minute decision and the chef is expected to work a miracle with it. The layout is awkward. It's triangle shape makes it difficult to seat people. 

I sat at the booth and turned my table horizontal so I didn't feel like my back was going to get clipped if anyone walked by. Plus, I like having my back against the wall but I was with a female friend and if I have to choose, I will always offer the wall seat to the female. But, turning the table allowed me to sit next to her and we could both enjoy the wall seat. They might even be able to put the same type booth on the adjacent wall. I did feel much more comfortable sitting in that high seat rather than the lower tables. What would make these low tables better is if they were also triangle shaped. Stick with the theme of the area. Triangle! It might even be cool to incorporate 3's and triangles into the menu somehow. 

This place still needs work but I'm starting to see some possible potential and hope that they take some of these ideas and do something because I don't see it lasting much longer if they don't."}
{"text":"So I've visited \"send noodles\" twice and let me tell you, worth it both times. My favorite thing on the menu is the tum yum soup, beware it has a kick to it. Second favorite, that is a must, is the Mac and cheese ramen. The Gouda cheese makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Staff is always friendly, and the beers are always cold."}
{"text":"F*cking delicious. Everything was amazing and our waitress was charming and attentive. I highly recommend the Peking duck. They didn't have the jellyfish though sigh"}
{"text":"Apps were amazing.  The kids loved the Mac and Chesse Ramen.  Service was quick and even manager stopped over for a quick chat.  Will return before we head home."}
{"text":"Send is new, bright, & shiny having opened in March 2018.  I put off going not only to anticipate but to avoid the just opened glitches.  Every time I walked by Send, there were 2 hostesses (why r there 2 for a small square footage?)  Then despite being empty, we were placed next to another table of 2 for dinner.  That means the server kept bumping into us because of. the narrow aisle.  The order;  beef tendon ramen $16 & spicy chicken pad thai $16

Pros
- food tastes fresh
- brand spankin' new
- allure
- Asian place
- exec chef Francis Mo
- 2 Asian murals on wall by James Jean (American of Taiwanese descent)

Cons
- oddly shaped
- $super pricey$
- smallish portion size
- cramped space holds 34 diners
- too many employees standing around
- poor execution 
- letdown feeling"}
{"text":"No sparkling or bottled water available for ordering. Ordered gyoza they were just ok. Ordered the house ramen and didn't eat it at all the broth was not very good and had that weird too much chicken taste. DO NOT Order the spare ribs!! So tough not even able to get the meat off the bone. Not even edible. Didn't eat any of my food and was asked if it was ok and I said I didn't care for it and ribs were tough. Nothing taken off the bill. Total crap. Would never come here again."}
{"text":"Chicken bao: order more than one (each order comes with 2). They were amazing! Chicken was fried and crispy. The waitress even suggested we take off some of the chilies if we didn't want it too spicy. 
Just like everywhere else in Vegas the alcohol is pricey, but the sake cup was really good. 
Bowls of ramen are really big. The eggplant side dish was saucy and yummy.
Service was spot on."}
{"text":"Cute little noodle place in The Palms. I got the house ramen which was flavorful and delicious. As expected from a noodle place, the ramen noodles were perfect. I asked for something to make it spicy and they gave me Szechwan paste. Amazingly spicy and just the right amount of kick. Service was fast and friendly. Definitely recommend this new yummy restaurant!"}
{"text":"Send Noodles is a great place to come to if you love   an Asian Fusion cuisine. I've eaten here multiple times and my favorite dishes are the spicy Tom yum soup (which had a ton of flavor), the XO lobster & the shrimp Pad Thai. The prices are reasonable since they give good size portions.  

Everyone's customer service is beyond exceptional including the hostesses. Yes there is usually more than 1, but they did other things besides seat guest, they helped buss tables, deal w payments ect. 

I would definitely recommend everyone to try this place!"}
{"text":"I took a point off right away because the chefs were not wearing hair covers.  It is a big No-No when you have an open kitchen just next to the dinning room.  This is a similar setup at the Ping Pang Pong and the Noodle place at the Gold Coast.  All their chefs have hair covers.  Some of them wear baseball caps and that's OK.  

We ordered Beef Chow Fun.  It was pretty good. The beef was way too salty.  We also ordered the Moo Sue Pork.  They were all pre-wrapped in pancakes already.  There were four of them.  They were pretty good.

Price-  They are more expensive than Noodle place at Ping Pang Pong

Service:  Average.  We had to ask to get waiter to fill out glasses.  Dirty dishes were not removed after we ate.

This restaurant is more comfortable than the Gold Coast noodle place.

We went there because we have a coupon for $15, just to check out this place.  If I have to pay full price, I would go some place else."}
{"text":"Always a good meal here!  
The Spicy Tom Yum seafood soup is one of our favorites with a side of rice. It's spicy while still being full of flavor.  (Perfect for a hangover) 
The Mac & Cheese ramen is very rich, I don't recommend getting it to-go. It tends to get thick and clumps together; but hot and fresh at the restaurant it's amazing!
The Dan Dan noodles & Pad Thai also good options.  
The absolute best item is the chicken bao.  It's a must every time we go!"}
{"text":"I was excited for this place to open since the name was funny, but I hate to say that this place was very underwhelming. 

The good stuff: The mural. Gorgeous mural by James Jean, same person who drew the poster for The Shape of Water (Best Picture at the Oscars this year, but was it though? Three Billboards was pretty amazing.) If anything, go eat some ramen to stare at this thing. Service was really nice, and they looked real spiffy in those short sleeve button downs (button ups? WHO KNOWS.) 

The bad stuff: 
1. They didn't have the mango sticky rice. According to a friend that had visited the day before, they didn't have it then, either. What's going on? Stop sending noodles and start sending ripe mangoes! 
2. I had one of the noodle plates, took me a minute to find those said noodles since they were buried beneath a thick layer of bean sprouts and scallions. 
3. Thai tea comes from a can. Six bucks. And it's in a can.

I'm not huge on noodle bars, so I sincerely hope you noodle bar lovers out there like this place more than I did."}
{"text":"5 adults and 2 children got together on Saturday night and we ordered several things from this newly opened noodle house in the Palms Hotel and Casino.

We ordered:

Crispy chicken bao
Okonomiyaki pancake
Gyoza
Tempura green beans
Beef cheek bao
Singapore noodles
Ramen mac and cheese
Dan Dan Mien
Bang Bang broccoli
Nutella honey toast
Sesame balls

The dishes were hit and miss.  I'm the Singapore noodle person and I thought it needed more curry--not for heat but for more curry flavor which was just too mild for me.  The gyoza were standard.  The Bang Bang broccoli was disappointing.

On the better side, the crispy bao chicken was good as was our dish of tempura green beans.  The ramen mac and cheese was a great fusion of East and West.  

For dessert, the sesame balls were OK and the Nutella honey toast was quite appealing if somewhast hard to cut and eat.

They need to do some work on some of their dishes.  It's just A-OK."}
{"text":"For it to be my first time I truly enjoyed my self the chicken bao was pretty delicious and hostess services was excellent made me feel comfortable and at home"}
{"text":"Great new hot spot at the Palms!! High recommend the ribs and tempts broccoli along with the Mac and cheese noodles!! Friendly staff and very clean. A must try"}
{"text":"Got the shrimp xo udon to go. I asked them to help me pick a good noodle dish and they recommended me this dish. It was $18. I would say it's a bit overpriced at this location. The noodles was fine but I don't think it was anything special. They give you a good amount of shrimp  they said their xo sauce was good but I thought it was alright. It was basically just udon noodles with shrimp. This place is pretty new. I would say they have room to grow and become better."}
{"text":"First Trying this place it was Amazing House Ramen was on Point along with the Spare Ribs!! Save Room for Dessert Nutella Honey Toast is as good as it looks in the pictures!! Ken Our Server was on it!"}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to eat at Send Noodles, and I must say that I was quite impressed with both the restaurant and the food they served. I felt the ambiance to be comfortable, in my opinion I portrayed the restaurant as a modern hole in the wall type. The decorations and murals were very captivating. Immediately after being seated by the hostess, our server quickly came to take our order for beverages. Because it was our first time there, we were not sure what to order, fortunately the server was more than willing to share his recommendations. Not only was our food brought out to us in a very timely manner, but the food was absolutely delicious. Through out our dinner, our server did his absolute best to check up on us and ensure our needs were satisfied. I will highly recommended this restaurant to all my friends and family, and I will be back to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"My business associate and I were impressed with the service and quality of food we received. You absolutely have to try the tempura fried green beans, I've never had anything like it. The manager Kathy, was the sterling example of what a customer service employee should be. Our server Morgesh Was not only knowledgeable and personable but extremely attentive. We will definitely be returning and strongly suggest you do too."}
{"text":"I knew it was a bad idea going in, but wanted to give them a fair chance. Noodles were dry and everything was bland. Don't waste your money eating anywhere at Palms. There is a lot of great food in Vegas but not at this spot."}
{"text":"If you live in Vegas, or are visiting the Palms this is a must try.

I ordered 'Beef Cheek Bao' as an appetizer, 'Beef Tendon'  as my choice of soup noodles, and the Joseph James Hop Box Imperial IPA as my drink.

The 'Beef Cheek Bao' was delicious. The 'Beef Tendon' was really good as well, and it came with a good amount of beef. 

I've experienced places that usually cut the meat portion short but there was a good amount here. In addition, it went really well with the Imperial IPA which reminds me much of Lagunitas.

Also, if you have a sweet tooth ask for the 'Nutella Honey Toast'.

Overall, very good service from Jena the beautiful hostess and the rest of the friendly staff.

 Great food and great beer. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"As the puzzle of the remodeling of the Palms continues to be revealed more and more fantastic restaurants pop up...   

This new restaurant is located in the space that once was the original High Roller room at the Palms.  It housed the Bar, cigar humidor, Blackjack and Baccarat tables that had the likes of every celebrity and athlete of the 2000's.  That high limit room has now moved and they very smartly and creatively added this noodle shop into this space.  

This shop has a great menu and variety of great food and drinks.  The host politely found us a seat quickly, our server promptly got our drink orders and then took our food order. 

We watched as the cooks quickly looked over our order and very quickly started preparing the food.  

When our food arrived it was very well plated and almost didn't want to eat as it was so pretty....anyway 10 minutes later it was all gone and it was soooooo good.  They have great soups, entrees, drinks and desserts.  

If your ever in the neighborhood I suggest you try this for a great dinner."}
{"text":"XO Shrimp udon deserves 5 stars - great dish with lots of different flavors. Gyoza had a ton of shrimp, but not something I would order again. The ribs were very tender with great flavor and just the right amount of sweet. Solid spot to eat."}
{"text":"So far making up for the closure of Alize with an impressive makeover of their 24-hour Café and Buffet it was alongside six others that a seat was taken at Send Noodles inside The Palms on Saturday, ages from Children to a Senior Citizen represented including a Chef and Assistant General Manager from elsewhere with all coming away a bit confused by what turned out to be a hit n' miss meal.

Created by Station Casinos under the direction of Joseph Kudrak and Francis Mo, the former's oversight a big part of A.Y.C.E. and Lucky Penny's success with the latter operating as the Noodle Bar's top toque, Send Noodles is described as featuring \"a robust menu with influences from Mandarin, Cantonese, Szechuan, Japanese, Korean, and Thai cuisines as well as creative takes on American and Italian classics using Asian ingredients\" and although no menu is yet posted online the concept proves true to its word with seating inside for perhaps fifty at most.

Open now for just four weeks on the north edge of The Buffet, its narrow profile and sparkling-clean bar catching eyes behind neon signage and a hostess podium, it was shortly after getting settled in that beverages including $28 Sake and $6 Thai Tea from a Can were served in addition to Water, Chef Mo stopping by with an associate to say hello and then turning the night over to servers unafraid to upsell more expensive items like Duck and Lobster but otherwise sufficient in their role.

A bit busy to begin but settling down by 7:30pm, an order placed in three rounds coursed out as anticipated save for one forgotten item that was brushed away with excuses rather than an apology, it was while chatting that dinner got started with crave-worthy fried Green Beans topped in Eel Sauce and bright spices while flavorless Gyoza identical to those at Lucky Penny disappointed for $10, the $12 \"Bang Bang Broccoli\" next proving to be the night's most polarizing selection as some found the heavily truffled Hot Sauce off-putting while others felt it worked well in the plate's context.

Intentionally inauthentic but occasionally sticking to tradition, the Japanese Pancake as fluffy and funky as expected beneath dancing Bonito, those looking for excellent Bao would be well-advised to check out crispy Chicken painted in fermented Chili and dressed in crunchy Vegetables while rumor has it the Beef Cheek version is less than stellar, one youth refusing to eat anything but the steamed Bun and his father confirming the Beef was too sweet and unpleasantly textured.

Moving onward to Noodles, a bowl of house Ramen and Mapo Tofu fulfilling the needs of a Gluten-free member of the table, it was in the opinion of one that Singapore-style Vermicelli could have used a bit more Curry that others found fault in overcooked Shrimp, the Dan Dan Mein on the other hand performing very well and appropriately spicy while $11 \"Ramen Mac-n-Cheese\" was sticky, rich and full of textures that were appealing to all.

Rounding out the evening with Desserts, all three from Send Noodles menu served in double portions, suffice it to say that fans of Adzuki Bean Paste will happily devour Sesame Balls featuring a crispy exterior and almost no oiliness while no one particularly enjoyed Mango Sticky Rice that was thick, pasty and nearly devoid of sweetness, the exact opposite situation as found in $10 Nutella Honey Toast that is every bit as delicious as it sounds but definitely best shared by two or more
 
THREE STARS:  Certainly not mailing it in with a menu of high aspirations and prices far lower than on-Strip competition it seems  as though Send Noodles still needs time to dial in their recipes before being fully recommendable, though those selecting carefully and dining with a group can easily sample a lot of good stuff without spending more than $30-40."}
{"text":"It's the worst Chinese food I ever ate. So salty and gross. We order $200 in food and not one thing that we like.  This was just for 2 people eating. We watch them cut of our strawberry to put on top of our dessert and they didn't even wash the strawberries. GROSS!  -5 stars restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"The good: the service is outstanding. Friendly and observant. The serving sizes are large.

The bad: the food was disappointing. The saltiness of the fried rice overwhelmed any other flavor. It isn't a dish I would care to have again."}
