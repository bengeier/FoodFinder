{"text":"I've never eaten at a Mediterranean restaurant before. I had very high expectations for this place, but it fell pretty flat. 

The chicken kebab was alright it was a little too dry for my taste. Same goes for the falafel. I have no idea what the white sauce that came with the order was, but it tasted amazing with the falafel. The rice that came with the kebab was also very very very dry I had a hard time swallowing it. Shrimp kebab, French fries, and the fatush salad were amazing esp the salad. 

Customer service was bad. The waitress with too much lipstick was slow and lazy. She was rude too she didn't even bother to greet me or anything. Not even a smile. The dude with the beard that gave me my food took forever and didn't even hand it to me. I also ordered the baba ganoush which they ran out of and didn't even bother to call to tell me!!!!! I'm very pissed off by their service and I felt very uncomfortable the 5 min I was there. The service is why I'm never coming back here. Unless they fire that waitress."}
{"text":"A friend had recommended Jasmine months ago, but I just made it down here. Ful Medamas, a fava bean dish served with pita bread, started me off and all by itself was a delicious and memorable meal. So many different flavors, all of them great. Followed wit tabouleh, lamb and shrimp kebab on yellow rice and a house salad, along with a cold, pink jasmine drink, and I realized I had two problems: I couldn't leave anything behind and there was too much beautiful, delectable food! I had a square of baklava to finish, although I was more than a little concerned that a Mr. Creosote incident might occur. It didn't. I rolled back to my room to sleep it off. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"After a year spent in US and finally had great Chicken Shawarma yesterday night... the staff is very warming and welcoming with a Smile... I ordered a chicken Shawarma and expected it to be like what I eat in Chicago usually, but when the food arrived my eyes were wide opened and mesmerised reminding me of the shawarma I use to have in my city Mumbai-India.

The chicken was juicy and well cooked.. The wrap was tasting great.
I was quickly done eating that fully and ran upto the desk ordering one more... The person at the counter also served a small Baba Ganoush as complimentary... 

This being my first meal in Charlotte I would say it was Overall a really best welcome to me here. :) 

Only 1 point about the shawarma was the quantity... it was a bit moderate for a price of ~$7. It can be filled with some more chicken. 

Recommended if you are searching good food in Charlotte..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I would highly recommend it to anyone. We had the hummus...so good! We also had the chicken kebabs with yellow rice and baba ganoush and the chicken shawarma wrap. Everything was so fresh and very, very good. The staff was friendly and very helpful. They answered all of our questions, we had a lot because it was our first time eating there. Try this restaurant, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"2nd time at this place and it was great before and even better now.   the lentil soup is absolutely delicious.    i ordered extra to go so i could have some more for dinner.   food looks and tastes fresh and the guys manning the grill looked like professional chefs at work.   i will be coming back again and again.   after the second time here i think it's got la shish beat.   don't get me wrong, la shish is good as well but this place has it beat by 3/4 stars."}
{"text":"I've eaten middle Eastern food in Dearborn, MI and in Dubai. This small unassuming eatery does the cuisine great justice. The food is fresh, full of flavor and every bite is a treat. Limited menu but includes every item you would expect to find.

Going to have to come back here soon."}
{"text":"During Ramadan they have a buffet with the best chicken I've ever had. My family eats here at least once a month and always enjoys it. We order one of the combos and feed 5 or 6 people and it's always plenty of food. Sometimes it's a little slow, but the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and authentic middle eastern food. The staff is very friendly. We were greeted at the door with a bright smile and our waiter was very sweet. He took the time to explain the menu, as well as describing the food to us (little did he know we're middle eastern so we already knew what the food was). The service was quick. It seemed like we ordered our food and it arrived in moments. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I flew in to Charlotte and arrived at lunch time.  I wanted to try something different and was perusing Yelp and came across Jasmine.  Holy cow, this place is awesome.  Too bad the pictures aren't scratch and sniff.  I had the beef, chicken, and kafta plate with fatush and hummus.  My wife had the lamb kabob with yellow rice and fatush.  Both plates were excellent and the portions generous.  This place is about 45 miles from my house, but I will be making the drive down here.  In fact, since I travel for business, this may be the spot we hit when I return to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been twice with friends and the food is excellent. Very clean with a courteous staff."}
{"text":"My family absolutely loved Jasmine Grill! The appetizers, kabobs, shawarma, tea, dessert...everything..was cooked perfectly. We wanted to try a variety of different things and anything we didn't know or understand was explained to us. The owners were very friendly and accommodating.  Prices are great, portions are large. Our friend from Iraq said it was some of the best middle eastern food he has had in the USA."}
{"text":"This place is, put simply, legit.  I was rolling around Charlotte aimlessly and stumbled across the joint.  It's in a little strip mall next to a dominoes and a tax preparation establishment...  Two dudes were behind the counter, and both were subdued yet friendly.  Cool atmosphere, good crowd, yet quiet and low key. 

I started with the Vegetable Delight, which is an appetizer made up of grape leaves, hummus, baba ganoush, and falafel.  It was excellent...  And a ton of food.  It was at about this point that I begun questioning my decision to order so much.  After a twinge of food guilt, I powered through and readied myself for what was coming next.  

Main course was a shwarma platter, which was essentially beef, chicken, and lamb grilled and served over rice.  It too was most excellent.  The lamb was by far my favorite, once I got past the fact that I was eating baby sheep.  This momentary pang of animal life-robbing guilt quickly passed, and I crushed the entire pile.  I love animals.  Paired that up with Blackberry juice, which was nothing short of awesome.  

In summary.  You should probably eat here.  I plan on returning this week...  And, I found $20 in the parking lot.  Win."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Mediterranean dish, do not pass this place up. The chicken kebabs with yellow rice and baba ghanouj were awesome. Great food and super customer service."}
{"text":"This a great Mediterranean restaurant. Visited for the first time and was lucky enough to catch their buffet .. tired chicken, humus, rice, baklawa .. everything was delicious.. 10 stars.."}
{"text":"If you love Mediterranean/middle eastern food, you don't have many options without having to go to Matthews. This is the best close to the City and its delicious. The place is always pretty full, a testament to their wonderful service and delicious, home cooked style meals. I order take out so frequently and forgot my wallet one day, had to run all the way home for it. When I returned the gentlemen at the register said, oh you should have let me know, you could have paid next time. This is a rarity anymore. Super nice people and yummy food."}
{"text":"I've been to many kabob houses in Charlotte.Jasmine Grille has excellent service and great food!  I may have to come back tomorrow for lunch.  This place is a must. Get the falafel. Seriously."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed.  Stopped by for lunch.  Service is amazing and the food exceeded expectations too. Very affordable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Always ALWAYS order pick up from this place if you can- the in-store service is very slow and gets crowded very fast. But the food is excellent. My husband enjoys the kebabs and shawarmas, and I always order an extra side of their yellow rice - it is flavorful and yum!"}
{"text":"The staff was sooo nice & the food was amazing! I got the veggie plate for myself & the chicken kebab plate for my hubby. The salad was nice & refreshing. The hummus & baba ghanoush was flavorful. The garlic sauce was heavenly with my pita, falafel, & spinach pie. Very great overall food experience."}
{"text":"I was in the area and I had walked in the restaurant near to their closing time.  The owner was very hospitable after he came from the back room and he said he would have no issues if I wanted to order and/or eat-in at the restaurant (even though it was their closing time).  

I had ordered the combination plate.  Everything such as the chicken kabob, hummus, rice, etc. tasted good and flavorful, except for the lamb kabobs, it was very well-done to the point it was black, hard and not edible.  When he asked me about the food, I told him that everything was good, except for the lamb was overcooked and he said he thought I wanted well-done because people of my origins (Pakistani/Indian) want well-done meats.  The portions were huge!  The bread was not what other customers were saying, homemade or fresh, because it was cold and dry.  Maybe they were out of it.  But I'm giving four stars for the customer service and other portion of my food.  The owner was very nice, friendly and catering -- allowing me to eat in at their closing time, and the portion of my meal was very big."}
{"text":"I'm so confused.  I see reviews in here from several years ago and I just found this place about 5 months ago (and, I pass by it every single day)??  I'm wondering if it was there and I never saw it?  Anywho, in the last 5 months, I have probably been there 4 times and it keeps changing so I assumed that it was still new.  I was just there last month and today I went in and there was a new menu and new decor - again.   The first few times, they were not that attentive (verging on ignoring us - especially when we arrived) but the food was outstanding so it warranted more visits. Now, however, I can say that their service is staaaarting to match their food.  I have never had a bad meal there and their hummus is one of the best I have ever had (and I have been to the Middle East several times).  I'm not a huge fan of their baba ganoush, however.  Their lamb shank is a total steal at $9.99.  (It used to be $12.99 which is still pretty cheap.)  I'm a huge foodie and I think that this place is pretty darn good.  The oil/garlic/salt mixture is fan-freakin-tastic and I could bathe in it!  Typically I have gone for dinner and today I went for lunch.  It was only $6.95 and it was great.  I'm going to start adding this to my weekly rotation of places that I go since I really like it."}
{"text":"Delicious!  2nd time I've been there for take-out and it was again wonderful. Shawarma beef & lamb was sooo flavorful. I didnt want rice so opted for salad & hummus.  The salad had parsley in it w/their own homemade dressing of just a few ingredients --it was so bright, fresh & actually  refreshing.  The hummus w/the homemade pita bread, great.  Garlic sauce--it is sensational!  eat it in the pita w/some shawarma and a bit of tomato (from the salad) and ooh la la delicious!  My husband got the beef & chicken kabobs--he was surprised--actually surprised how deliciously tender they were. Again, chose the same sides w/no rice. and the price was very fair. We'll be back--!!   
PS. Our first take-out order a few weeks ago was the lamb chops---LOVED THEM!"}
{"text":"Excellent Place. Food is delicious, service is prompt , reasonably priced and good decor."}
{"text":"Jasmine grill is my go-to when I want to mix things up a bit. Tasty Mediterranean dishes and the sides are always a fun experience! The two guys that are always working there are very helpful with recommendations and suggestions. So don't be intimidated by unfamiliar menu items-they will walk you through it ! 

The food is always bursting with flavor. I've been 5-6 times now and I've never been let down. 
I usually get the chicken kebab or shawarma with ganoush and/or fattouch. 

Give them a try. You'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"eveyrthing is fantastic! the customer service is great and they are always crowded!"}
{"text":"I ate here several times before posting a review. The food has a very fresh and authentic taste.  I usually order hummus and tabouli to go just to have a little taste of their food at home.  The restaurant has a warm and cozy feel."}
{"text":"This is not typically my style of restaurant but I recently met for a business lunch here.  I went with the recommendation of the waitress and was very pleased.

Garlic and hot sauce mixed in made it quite the flavorful treat!"}
{"text":"Had a party of 8 today for lunch and everyone at the table had a great time.
Easy to find and tons of parking up front. Place had plenty of sitting with a decent atmosphere. Good service, even though our waiter could have use some help. 

The food was fantastic (Kebabs,Shawarma Plate,Tahena Salad etc...)  I personally tried the Arab Style Shawarma Wrap and it was delicious, I highly recommend it if you haven't tried it.

The food took a while to arrive at the table, which does happen when the meat has to be grilled for a party of 8... that was really the only downside, every thing else was just perfect. 

Will definitely go back again for lunch, probably next week and try different things on the Menu."}
{"text":"This place was probably my best find since moving to CLT! The food is fresh and fast and full of flavor. I stopped in during lunch time. The place was a mob scene! However, the staff noticed me right away and took my to go order. I got stuffed grape leaves and lentil soup to go. In the few minutes that it took to prepare, I was offered some bread while I was waiting. The lentil soup was some of the best I've ever had. It's currently 10:30am and I'm stalking their Yelp listing waiting to order lunch again!"}
{"text":"Tasty and fresh food. Great service. Just all around bomb. My friend ordered the chicken  shawarma it was a little dry. I ordered the chicken kabob no lie BEST CHICKEN I EVER HAD OMG!!  Perfectly grilled and juicy af. I also recommend the jasmine juice"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food..! I was craving Mediterranean until I came here. We ordered the chicken tikka kebab and the half chicken with pita bread. Perfect.. Just well done. The hummus was mouth watering. Must go place. This place will be on my visit list for sure wheneva I come to NC. All the items here are fresh!! Thanks and keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Great fresh and authentic Middle Eastern food. We loved it! These guys should get the word out!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special lamb kebab and chicken kebab. Included sides presented well (soup & salad).  Hummus super smooth and pita not doughy. 
A great value and pleasant helpful server. 
Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Very good service. Food is great. Don't let the appearance fool you. Servers were friendly and helpful with the menu. I will be back."}
{"text":"Love their food and courtesy to customers  :) Especially the shawarma chicken is awesome. Also the Baba ganush dip has nice smoky flavor of eggplant. Truly a must try place."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!!!!!  I was in town from Atlanta over the weekend and randomly stumbled upon this place, best decision ever!  I ordered the chicken kabob and when I say there was a flavor explosion in my mouth, that is not an over exaggeration!  The chicken kabobs were so tender and flavorful, accompanied with a side of rice and grilled veggies and I felt like I was in food heaven!  Do yourself a favor and check out this place!  I so wish they would open a location in Atlanta, my life would be complete!"}
{"text":"The food is great and has a reasonable price. I loved the lamb chops, they were so tender and delicious. The Kunefe was one of the best I've ever had. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and you should try the Kunefe as well. Great place."}
{"text":"We came because of yelp reviews and it didn't let us down.  I had the Arab style beef and lamb shawarma and mom had the traditional beef and lamb shawarma.  Both were very good tender and flavorful,  the garlic sauce served with the meal was delicious. Generous portion left us full.  service was friendly and quick.  The menu had it correct fresh fast and friendly.  We ended with baklava that was delicious.  You won't regret stopping here for a meal.  We will be back next time in the area."}
{"text":"I used to work at a Moroccan restaurant, so I am one of the pickiest Mediterranean eaters I know, and this place has the BEST BABAGHANNOUSH! 
Really great lamb as well! Fantastic place."}
{"text":"Great customer service !!!
We tried the Lamb shank, tilapia with garlic sauce and lamb liver and it waaaaas delish :)"}
{"text":"Jasmine Grill has fantastic middle eastern food. I have been here twice now and have been impressed with the tender meats, garlic sauce and ground sumac for flavoring. I got the chicken kabob lunch special this last visit and chose the yellow rice. It came with a salad and soup. It was more than I could eat and only $6.99. The salad was a tabbouleh. It was a little on the sour side but so fresh. I still ate all of it. I forgot to ask what the soup was, but I think it was a pureed chickpea or lentil. Very tasty. I'll be back there as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Was on a family trip to NY all last week, you know it's a Mecca of food... Tried some nice Shawarma ( street good stuff ) and thought will google what we have here in CLT. Jasmine Grill ,,,,, Good lord what beautiful tasting food it was, i took the Chicken Shawarma Wrap and mixed kebab grill ( lamb, Beef and Chicken )... Let the Stars i gave say it all,,, very nice guy behind the counter, requested him for some extra chili sauce and he gave me lot more than i asked, even the ones i never asked for.... Good Job Guys, will recommend you to all my friends and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!! Moist Chicken kebabs. Best Baba G I have ever tried. Usually rice sides are a bit on dry side at most of the med restaurants but not here. Yellow rice itself was so yummy. They can improve on the service though. During lunch hours the house was fully packed and just one waiter tending everyone. We got our drinks 15 mins after ordering. But the food was worth the wait!!! I just don't feel like cutting a star even though service wasn't top notch."}
{"text":"Awesome food and value. Lunch time sometime can be tricky and you may wait a bit. They do the best they can. Always good food with good service. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, good food, and very nice portion size.  We really enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"OMG is all I shave to say about this exotic cuisine. This is one of the best kept secrets in Charlotte tucked away along South Blvd. Bold flavor and everything made fresh...no GMO of pre-package nastiness here. Will def be back for lunch this week."}
{"text":"Waited for forty minutes and they refused to seat me saying they don't want to waste a table on a one person
I decided not to waste my money on them"}
{"text":"Yummy lamb, grape leaves, hummus, etcetera everything I've tried here is delicious. The ambience is like your typical strip mall joint however, I will say don't judge a book by its cover. Definitely my go to place for kebab."}
{"text":"1st visit for lunch. Fantastic chicken kabobs and lentil soup. Served quickly. Great service."}
{"text":"Have been back many times now. Lamb shank is great and affordable. Lamb chops are tender and juicy while lamb kebabs is tasty and chewy."}
{"text":"Food is good, not as good as other big cities, but I still like it.  Unfortunately they keep on messing up my carryout order and more than once left out a item.  I trusting them didn't check until I got home.  Hugely inconvenient and not sure if its worth getting carry out if I have to worry about this.  Happened more than once, sadly."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to get Mediterranean food from. Excellent quality and great customer service. I eat here every time I visit the Charlotte area for my work travel."}
{"text":"Almost all their dishes are delicious.  The only exceptions are the Falafel and the pita bread.  I found them to be a bit dry.  The yogurt drink, Aryan, and the dessert Kanafeh, are fantastic.  The prices are unbeatable. The best value for money middle eastern restaurant in Charlotte.  Plenty of parking places anytime, any day."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place to eat at!Everything was AWESOME!!! My husband and I both had the chicken kabobs with big sides of hummus and yummy fatoosh salad . Everything was so flavorful and fresh. The portions are large. The service was great. Excellent place for middle eastern food which is our favorite. Wish it was located in my city. We visited Charlotte for my husband's job. Going back tomorrow before we leave town. Best Mid East food I've ever had !!!! Really clean place as well. Nicely decorated restaurant."}
{"text":"The grape leaves and the Fatush with chicken are amazing.  Best I've had outside Jordan and Israel!"}
{"text":"Great service!!!!
As soon as my family walked in we were treated with great hospitality!! 
The food was fresh and tasty . 
We ordered the lamb and beef Sharma plate, my husband ordered the lamb kebabs with rice the yellow rice was mouth watering cooked to perfection. My daughter ordered lamb Sharma with French fries and she loved  it !!! just the right amount of spice also cooked to perfection !! We will come back again 
Also for a great drink mix the guava juice with mango !!!!!"}
{"text":"I stoped buy tonight to get me a quick diner. As I got in I noticed that there were two table one with group of 6, the other one with 2 people both of the table already served. I waited for about 40 minutes to get Chicken kabab with humus. My chicken wasn't cooked; it was like heated. I hate uncooked chicken. I was waiting for the server to take it Back to be cooked. He was busy with some guests who just walked in. I took the plate to the Cook and I told him \" please would you  make it well done\". After 40 seconds the server brought it back at the same uncooked condition. Well I am a steady Client I ate there more than 4 times a week. The food is tasty but the service is very slow or the servers are negligent. Tonight I decide not to go there no more. If you don't care you won't get my money."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I have tried almost all the items on the menu and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the lamb/ beef shawarma. Sooo flavorful and the prices are hard to beat."}
{"text":"Of the best restaurants that I went with the service very good, and you'll find the family the valley , and the most beautiful in which the food is a wonderful taste"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food! Not pricey and loved their home made fruit juices!"}
{"text":"I hate it so much when the staff sweeps the flor around the food churning the dust into the food. I never went back. And one more worst thing ,i saw kods walking around the buffet picking food off the cart , GROSS."}
{"text":"Best middle east/turkish food I had in US... Lunch special chicken kabab is one of the best value of money lunch item you can get in entire Charlotte."}
{"text":"For $100 you can easily get a great meal, but Jasmine Grill does it for 10 bucks. I had the chicken kabob with a side salad. The food was great and the presentation was that of a high end restaurant, a very clean and colorful presentation. The service was very efficient and friendly. I hope I get back there before I leave town."}
{"text":"The first couple times I ordered takeout from Jasmine, I was very impressed: service very friendly (despite being packed at weekday lunch time), the lamb shank very tasty and reasonably priced. I love Mediterranean food and was hoping to write a five-star review after a sit down experience. 

I finally got a chance taking my husband there for a sit down lunch on a weekend when we were in the area. I ordered the Veggie Delight, which includes falafel, hummus, baba ganoush and stuffed grape leaves, and he ordered the chicken kabob plate. 

We both agreed the falafel was among the best we've had, the hummus very good but the baba ganoush lacking the smoky flavor I like. I had to ask for the yogurt sauce for my falafel since I wasn't given any but I didn't realize the stuffed grape leaves was missing from my plate until I got home. Dang. 

The chicken kabob was pretty good though a little on the dry side. 

I was not thrilled about the service we got when the place was not packed. We had to get our own silverware and napkin since the wait stuff didn't notice there was none on our table. Our ice tea didn't get refilled once until I asked for it at the very end. Did I mention I didn't get my stuffed grape leaves and had to ask for the yogurt sauce?"}
{"text":"Hummus, baba g, shawarma and labnah are top notch. Gotta remember this place the next time in town. Great price and you will not go hungry. Staff knows the menu"}
{"text":"As soon as I entered and saw the lunch crowd descending onto this place, I figured I was in for a tasty lunch.  I was skeptical since I don't know a lot about this cuisine.  I ordered up the special of the day which was the Chicken Kebabs.  We also ordered the Baba Ganoush as an appetizer.  While we waited for our meal, the waiter brought out a fresh Mediterranean salad and Lentil soup.  The lentil soup had a great consistency and awesome flavor.  The portion size was nice (about a cup).  The salad was very fresh with juicy tomatoes and cucumbers and lightly dressed.  The Baba Ganoush had a nice smoky flavor and was well seasoned with hints of garlic, lemon, and garnished with olive oil and parsley. It was served with fresh hot pita triangles in a cloth lined basket. The jasmine rice was some of the best I have ever had.  The portion was very large.  The chicken Kebabs took me by surprise.  With the impressive grill marks, I worried the chicken would be dry.  Boy was I wrong.  Very tender and flavorful.    My only regrets are not asking for a to go box for my leftover rice.  I was stuffed for less than $10.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.  Fast service, plenty of food to eat while you wait for your main course.  Good customer service.  Jasmine Grill can be a little cramped considering the size of the dining room and the amount of customers they seem to receive during lunch.  A few more visits like this would likely raise my scored to a 5."}
{"text":"If you want good traditional Mediterranean food, please give Jasmine Grill a try. The owners are a family from Jordan (brothers and sisters) and are the sweetest people. My husband and I have been there at least 6 times since they have been opened which is only a few weeks. I always get the chicken kabob and I love it. It comes with salad, rice, grilled tomato and onion.  I opt out for the rice (I'm not a big rice eater) and get the hummus instead. Their hummus is fresh and they garnish it with parsley, olive oil and cumin and that's what I like about it. It is the traditional way to serve it. I will try the tabbouleh next time and if it is as fresh as the hummus, I am sure I won't be disappointed! Also I would like to mention that it is listed in Ballantyne, but it is in Southpark/Southend neighborhood. South Blvd between Tyvola and Woodlawn. Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to dine here on a weekday with some colleagues on a business trip to Charlotte. Had the lamb kebab with some hummus and tabuleh. Colleagues had the lamb shawarma plate and the chicken kebab. The lamb was great, charred slightly on the outside but soft and tender on the inside. Price was reasonable too. They lose a star because they looked like they were struggling to manage their crowd - it took us 5 min to be noticed and another 15 to be seated and there was confusion between our group and their group as to who had what table and the staff didn't help. In the end we had to negotiate with another seated party to change tables in order to accommodate us. Wait staff looked very stressed. That said, would still definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Jasmine Grill is approximately 0.3 miles from my home. Thus, every time I want a good lunch option with a small bit of exercise when I am working from home, Jasmine Grill always pops in my head (usually it's a debate between Jasmine, Crispy Bahn Mi, or one of the million Mexican joins near there!)

Yesterday I called in a Jasmines Grill order for pick up. I have never actually sat down and eaten in this restaurant but typically all the tables are full, especially for lunch! My favorite thing on the menu is the hummus. Easily one of the best in Charlotte. 

On this particular occasion, I ordered chicken kabobs and substituted hummus instead of rice. Always substitute hummus!! The lunch orders come with a house soup and house salad. They even threw a bag of pita in for me! I am not a huge fan of the house salad as it is more mint leave inspired. However, their soup (I think it is lentil???) is a pureed delicious concoction of a soup. They also threw in a side of this garlic paste like substance that was super tasty on the chicken! All of this for $8. Score. 

Jasmine Grill is a bit hidden off of South Blvd (really just look for the purple gawdy Panda Express Building...it's behind that) but give it a try. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the service was great.  Everything we had was awesome.  I had the veggie platter and my wife the Arab chicken wrap."}
{"text":"Excellent joint, pictures speak for them self

Rock on, this chef knows what his doing

He is got presentation and taste plus baking skills

You MUST TRY THE Knafeh ..."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in Charlotte. Beef & lamb shawarma is fantastic. Stuffed grape leaves are yummy. Make sure to get a side of the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great prices! Best falafel wraps I have had in a long time. I got a falafel and a side of fries for 4.99- can't beat it. It was the perfect portion for lunch.  The chili sauce and garlic sauce that come on the side is my favorite- definitely adds a lot of flavor to the dish."}
{"text":"I loved their lamb kebabs and the garlic sauce that accompanied it. Very flavorful. Their salad with the fried pita is also very good. Despite the fact that the place was packed on a Friday night, they really made it a point to approach me to ask if I needed anything or to refill my water glass."}
{"text":"Highly recommended, this place is absolutely delicious. I had the chicken kabob with an order of hummus. The young lady who waited my table was very friendly, welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best baba ganoush. Hummus has right amount of tahini (most places you can't taste any!). Salad with chicken was excellent. Chicken perfect color, spice and doneness and still moist. We will be back and with friends!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is unassuming from the outside but the food is delicious! My boyfriend and I arrived and decided we were going to get the food to go. The server was very helpful and patient in explaining everything and helping us decide what to order. We didn't have to wait very long which was great cause we were hungry! The plates came with two sides. My boyfriend ordered the lamb and beef shawarma with yellow rice and hummus. I ordered chicken kebab with the side salad and yellow rice as well. They were both very large portions, that we split in to two meals (even though I wanted the whole thing) and everything was very flavorful. It also came with a side of pita and some sauces. We will definitely be going back to try more!"}
{"text":"Delicious...so good I dream about it!  Looking forward to going back soon.  I orders the kabobs, hummus and salad.  Went there for lunch and the chicken kabobs were the lunch special.  You get a ton of food for under $8."}
{"text":"Love the food here. They have a lunch special and they give it with soup and salad. Had been to this place countless number of times. 

Would go here any day, anytime."}
{"text":"This place deserves as many stars as I can give.  I'm not amazingly familiar with Mediterranean or Middle Eastern fare, but this restaurant gives a great foray into the cuisine.

I enjoyed a Beef Kofka lunch, which came with lentil soup, house salad, and rice.  Everything was top notch.  I also had a side order of Hummus, and maybe I've been missing out on decent hummus my entire life because this stuff was phenomenal.  It was even presented in an aesthetic fashion.  The beef had a perfectly light crisp on the outside while still retaining a nice level of juicy meatiness on the inside.

Perhaps one of the better things about this restaurant is it seemed all of the employees here actually wanted to be there.  They were all smiles and genuinely seemed to enjoy their customers.

 Bon Appetite."}
{"text":"Don't be dissuaded with the locale or looks of the place - this restaurant is genuine Middle Eastern cuisine done very well. It's quite evident the cook knows what he's doing in the kitchen.

We had chicken kabobs, shwarma, & mezza - all perfectly seasoned and presented well. Only one suggestion which is to go a little lighter on the salt. 

It felt like each dish was personally prepared by a chef who cares about their craft. 

Lovely and courteous staff give this place a nice family feel.

Jasmine has the best baba ganoush in town (nicely smoked eggplant) and the saffron rice is addictive."}
{"text":"I've never actually sat down in this place. I have had the great experience of this wonderful food being delivered to me at work. I have had the rice, I have has the roasted chicken, I have had the lamb. ALL ARE WONDERFUL!!!!! When I am on this side of town, I WILL VISIT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and called to place an order.  I am allergic to dairy and they were super helpful with explaning the ingredients and dishes. Had the lamb and chicken kabob which were a bit dry....but it was take out and the time it took to get back to work may have contributed to that.  The hummus and grape leaves were outstanding!!!  Also had baba ganouch for the first time and it was very good.  I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"So this place had a special check-in offer (just a free drink with your order). However, when I went to redeem it, it did not say dine in only, but the manager or owner said he cannot take the coupon if I do not dine in. I honestly did not feel like dining in after a long drive up there. I just wanted to go to my hotel, eat, and crash. Nonetheless, the beef shawarma I had was great! I ordered to go from here twice in the two days that I was there and I enjoyed my meals."}
{"text":"It's strange to see such a highly rated restaurant tucked away in a strip mall. Driving up you'll wonder if you're at the right place. It's not like it's a bad location, it's just that I guess I'm used to more outward marketing of a well-reviewed place. Don't let this dissuade you though. 

The best thing I can say about this place is that they really care about what they do. The ingredients are fresh, the dishes are well prepared, the waitress really wants you to enjoy your order and the manager makes sure everything is clean. I can't imagine how anyone could find anything wrong about this place."}
{"text":"Lunchtime at work is usually an underwhelming routine, but sometimes a treat. 

I tried Jasmine Grill through Door Dash because I was bored of the same stuff I usually get. This lunch was an absolute treat.

The food is very flavorful, my lunch combo came with two huge pieces of pita bread, and everything was outstanding.

I'll definitely be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food here was very good. I was greeted with a smile and great customer service . There was lots of stuff to order from, the homemade humus was excellent!  I also had the shaved grilled chicken with yellow rice. It was nicely seasoned with fresh herbs/spices. I will most definitely  come back to jasmine grill again! High Five!!!!Jasmine Grill for providing \"FRESH\" fast food to Charlotte."}
{"text":"It's the real deal. The lunch specials are a killer deal. So. Much. Food. The hummus is fantastic. The chicken and beef kebabs are so flavorful. And the shawarma is just as good."}
{"text":"Super friendly people, and the best falafel wrap and hummus I've had outside the middle east!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!!! Business is family owned by Syrians/Palestinians and they make authentic middle eastern food. I love their sharwamas because it is made in very thin bread and toasted. My most recent visit, I got the lamb and beef shawarma with a side of hummus. 

I've been there previously and have ordered their kanfaa. Also, have been to several events and they catered and did a great job. 

Definitely would recommend this place to anyone and hands down the best middle eastern joint in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We came at Yelps suggestion & came back with more friends because the food is SO GOOD!  The Veggie Delight is the perfect appetizer. Hummus, Baba Ganoush, grape leaves & falafel. All good! The lunch specials offer a delicious lentil soup. And, Their delicious version of a Greek salad. We have enjoyed chicken kebabs, chicken shawarma, Arab style shawarma with beef & lamb. All excellent. And for dessert - baklava. 
BTW - we flew into Charlotte on Friday, today is Tuesday, this is our 3rd time here!  It's that good!"}
{"text":"Went here for a break between soccer games with my son, and was blown away by the freshness, delicacy and the use of spices. I am a huge fan of Mediterranean food and these guys rocked it. Staff were very friendly and there was international soccer on the television. Among other things we had the beef and lamb kebob and it was simply amazing."}
{"text":"In March, we were looking for a special dinner to celebrate my birthday the following day.
Saw some good feedback about this place, we decided to give it a trial.
Upon arrival, it looked like a small shop, quiet to start with.  The waiter was very helpful to explain everything that we placed our drinks and food.
Everything came out very nice.  From Hummus to seafood and meat. Can't tell what we have ordered but I did take pictures.
I even walked up to the chef who was actually the owner of the restaurant.
Sure I'll come back again!

Todate, in June, my son came from SFO & we like to dine out.  As we knew this place close early, we came before 6:00 to avoid crowd.

We had the fruit juice even we could have free soda that I really didn't care.

We ordered the lamb kebob and lamb shank.  They were so delicious.

Besides the owner chef, I've seen 2 more chefs.  The food was very good as my son did like it.  The place had become popular now.

Hope they have more servers or servers have to work faster.

No reservation to share, good place to go for good food and the price is very acceptable."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma's the best and at an incredible price. 
Very friendly staff. I can see myself coming here for a long time."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and food plus friendly staff! Monday lunch special chicken kabob with rice salad and lentil soup all $7.00"}
{"text":"Love love love their babaganoush! So smoky in flavor and you can't get enough!
Their tilapia is a bit on the heavy side but it's still really good. Not to mention the surprisingly low prices! 6 pieces of falafel for less than $5? I don't know where else you can find that in Charlotte. 
The staff are really nice and it's so convenient to get things to go. Order online and pick up! They also do delivery through various apps. 
Can't complain about their pita wraps either. I've been looking for a great Mediterranean spot in Charlotte and this is it! I wish they'd add more things into the menu so there are more vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Found this place while on a trip to CLT. Great fresh kabobs and appetizers just really really good food. And super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always get the chicken kabob which comes with lentil soup, salad & hummus. Delicious!!! And inexpensive. Might have to wait if it's busy but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We tried this place based upon Yelp reviews and we were not sorry!  The lamb chops were amazing and even though they were cooked well done, they were not dry and still really tasty.  We enjoyed everything we ordered and the young lady who took care of us was incredibly nice!"}
{"text":"Perfect lunch.  After reading great reviews online about the food, and especially the hummus, my wife and I decided to drive over and check it out.  It was very easy to find since we knew where to look, thanks to GoogleMaps.

We arrived just after opening at 11:00 on a Monday.  No lunch crowd yet, though people trickled in as we ate.  Service was prompt and friendly.  We received our drinks very quickly and were told of the daily specials.  We ordered falafel for an appetizer.  My wife ordered the special, chicken kabob which came with a salad and soup.  These three items came very quickly.  I ordered the chicken shawarma with yellow rice and hummus.  The hummus came with the appetizers.  Honestly, we could have stopped here.  The food was great and there was a ton of it.

The main meals came out shortly after I finished the falafel.  Oh my!  The rice was amazing.  My chicken shawarma was moist and very flavorful.  The two sauces which came with it went very well together and added great flavor.  

The service remained great for the whole meal and we left so stuffed.  The restaurant smelled great, looked great, and created two very pleased customers today.  I could eat their falafel everyday.  The perfect texture inside and out.  A wonderful lunch for under $30 for two!  We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After a long flight and being extremely exhausted with no plans to go home to cook the hubby and I decided to stop in here to grab a bite after checking old trusty (Yelp) for something to eat in route or within 15 miles.

The staff was very informative and friendly. We were so hungry which isn't a good thing when trying a new restaurant because we wanted to order one of everything on be menu just about.

We started with the Baba Ganoush which is something we both never tried. The server was very informative and told us that it's basically egg plant, the pictures looked like hummus so we were intrigued. He brought it out and it was DELICIOUS he then brought us the hummus to try just because it was it first choice (score). We also had a house salad appetizer which was so GOOD.

Main courses includes Garlic Tilapia with yellow rice and Mixed Kabobs (lamb, beef, shrimp & chicken). The food was good and this is definitely a place to grab a bite when in the area. They also offer fresh juice and I had a mango and pineapple freshly squeezed which was so refreshing."}
{"text":"Great food every thing was well prepared and presented. the service can use some major improvement hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Had a Lamb Gyro and the fries...very good but can't say it's THAT great...a true gyro should be shaved off a spit that's been marinating in its own juices in my opinion....The fries are really good try those for sure...I will say the guy behind the counter (I assume he's the owner) is worth an extra star all by himself...very friendly, constantly asking everyone in the place if their food is ok, do they need anything...truly wanting to help and caring if everyone was satisfied...we'll go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a reasonable price. I got the beef and lamb shawarma platter with hummus and fatuch salad. The flavors were incredible and the ingredients tasted fresh.  Server was super friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend to anyone looking at eating Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Place was busy packed when walked in at 1ish. Was greeted promptly and a table cleaned off.
Service was very helpful with today's specials and if anything needed explaining. 
Sadly out of the beef/lamb shawarma so ordered the lamb kabobs with yellow rice. Very good, tender, good flavor. Good amount of meat for the price of the plate. 
Chicken kabob with soup and salad was today's special . Liked the tangy salad dressing. Never had lentil soup so first thought it was a potato soup lol . Kabob was tasty no dipping sauce needed.
Looking forward to visit again ."}
{"text":"Excellent wraps! Beef and lamb wrap was my favorite. Had a side of hummus with it which was very good as well! Definitely recommend for some good, not high prices Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Yelp definitely didn't steer me wrong with this one. The wife was on yelp trying to decide what we were going to eat for dinner and came across this gem on yelp. Absolutely delicious food, I had the chicken and beef kebab...the wife had lamb. The food was seasoned to perfection, and all the meats were perfectly cooked. Service was friendly, and welcoming. If your in the area do yourself a favor and stop in, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Discovered this place last year while on a to-go run to Panda Express which is in the same strip mall. Gave it a try and have been a regular ever since. In fact, almost everyone from my office has become a regular too!

The food is genuinely tasty, and at $6.99 for the lunch specials it's a steal! Lunch special includes salad, lentil soup, choice of grilled kebabs (usually chicken and beef kefte), choice of rice (white or fried with onions and peppers). It's a lot of food for a small price!! I usually skip the rice and get a plate of babaghanouj (smoked eggplant and spices, ground to a consistency like hummus) for an extra $1.00...it's the best I've ever had, served with warm pita bread.

I highly recommend this place...can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I reallyclike this place!
As the others have stated, a little sketchy looking on the outside but great place!!!
(Being here at night with a dark parking lot doesn't help the feeling)  ;)

I ALWAYS get shish tawook. 
Grape leaves are fantastic, hummus is delish!

A go to for sure!!! Good prices!"}
{"text":"Was very good!! Had no idea what to order, and menu was no help. No listing of what the food was or how prepared? Ordered steak and chicken and it was really good. I got some side that was a mixture of hummus and eggplant and comes with flat bread! I would come back!!"}
{"text":"My first time going.  I got the chicken schwarma because they were out of the beef.  I also wanted some pickled turnips but out as well.  It is ok because the guy helping me have me some pieces of baklava instead  and it is delicious!  Falafel is also very good!  Did not have to wait long and staff was friendly.  Will definitely order again"}
{"text":"A regular customer here. By far the best lamb chops in town, haven't tried anything else on the menu because it's too good and very well prices. This place should be in uptown."}
{"text":"That middle east restaurant is awesome!!! Absolutely love the taste of everything!! Hummus and falafel is so good and grilled chicken and beef is fresh and different! That's the right word.. different taste! Every time we take take away for later. Try.. you'll love it!"}
{"text":"So honest moment, I've had this place bookmarked for a while and drive by it all the time so I really don't really have an excuse for what took me so long to give them a try. 

But the stars aligned and last week I finally had the opportunity to give them a try. And this place didn't' disappoint.

  I already knew I wanted to try the chicken shawarma - but since I wasn't very hungry I opted for the wrap which comes with fries and a yummy dipping sauce for the wrap. It was such a good choice - the chicken was tender and so full of flavor. 

Overall, great first experience. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"During my typical foodie grazing for delicious finds, I happened upon this true delight. Upon arrival, I was greeted with a smile and suggestions to suit my taste. I LOVE Mediterranean food, so menu options made it hard to choose.

I had the chicken kebab with yellow rice and fattoush. The meal was absolutely superb! The kebabs were cooked to perfection with a wonderful mix of Mediterranean spices. Yellow rice was delicately cooked with just the right hints of spice. The fattoush was perfect mix of herbs, spices, fresh veggies and a \"just right\" mix of crispy pita prices and oil. 

Jasmine Grille will certainly become a place that I frequent and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Got the mix meat plate with lamb chicken and beef. The meet was juicy and savory. Also had a nice chili sauce with garlic paste on a bed of yellow rice. Definitely the best Mediterranean food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I am late with this review, but I enjoyed the food. Everything was cooked to perfection and the flavors and spices were great. Cool little spot and some very good food to go along with it too. Who would dare to complain?"}
{"text":"I previously gave Jasmine Grill a higher rating, but had to lower my rating a bit after my experience today. My friend and I came here for lunch on my recommendation. The place is small and it was pretty crowded. Almost every table was taken. They were short staffed. There was one server working the floor for one large party and about 7 or 8 smaller tables. There was one cook and that was it for the staff. 

From the time we walked in and sat down, no one greeted us, no one brought us a menu or a drink or took our order...no one ever came to the table. We sat there for about 25 minutes trying to get the server's attention, but he just rushed around without stopping at our table. We finally ended up leaving because we both had to get back to work.

The quality of the food has also started slipping a bit since I first came into their place  about 6 months ago. They have dishes with avocados on the menu, but are always \"out\" of avocados when I order something. They frequently forget items when I get a take out, and I have to check my order carefully every time I'm there. 

I think the good reviews on Yelp have caused their traffic to go up, especially at lunch, and they just haven't been able to handle it. I'll probably go back once more, but if service and organization don't improve soon, I'm probably going to mark it off of my list."}
{"text":"An excellent Mediterranean offering in Charlotte. This place has an excellent yelp track record which is what drew me over here. The food quality was excellent. Portions are generous and prices are very affordable. I ordered the kebab platter with two lamb kababs. The lamb was some of the most succulent and delicious grilled lamb I have ever had in my life. The yellow rice that it sat adjacent to was flavorful and moist!
I ordered hummus and baba ganoush as well. They were delicious and very flavorful!

Will return next time I am here!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma plate with yellow rice and garlic paste and a salad with fried pita chips. The chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned. The rice was fresh and delicious . My son had a leg of lamb that was so tender it fell off the bone. The flavor was awesome. Authentic food!!! Can not go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a columbian restaurant, but now is mediterranean. However, you can still order sweet plantains as a side! Pretty cool. The people are very nice and typical dish is $9 with a salad and some chip like things to snack on prior to your meal. You will not leave hungry. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in Charlotte! Once you try them out one time, you're hooked! I absolutely loooooove the chicken kabobs and the hummus!! Theeee bomb!"}
{"text":"Good solid food!  The chicken kabab with yellow rice and a side of hummos is a ton of food.  Next time I will order a plate with two kinds of meat and the falafel appetizer and just split it.  Great tasting chicken off the grill with just a little bit of char.  The falafel is very light and it's the straight chickpea kind (not the green ones with parsley added).

I will also try a dessert next time.  We just ordered so much food I didn't have room!  It was comfortably busy on Sunday.  Service gets a little slow at times because there are only two waiters for the whole dining area.  But for the price and taste it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent little place with a friendly waitstaff and, more importantly, excellent Mediterranean food. The chicken schwarma was excellent, with subtle flavor and a crispy wrap; served \"Arab style\".  The beef kebabs were tender and well seasoned. Great place for a lunch that doesn't leave you feeling weighed down afterward."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here because of the excellent reviews.  I have been to several other middle eastern places in town so my expectations were high. My favorite place is Le Kebab Grill near the University area.  I will say the flavor of the chicken at Jasmine grill was better than Le Kebab.  The salad they served us was not crispy and fresh. It looked like they had it sitting in salad dressing for hours and it wilted.  The tables were not properly cleaned-- restroom area is pretty scary and gross. With boxes of restaurant supplies stored right near the restroom area. Not sure if that is a health violation but should be!   The main eating area just looks like a basic run down fast food place. Dark lot, dingy, no music and the waitstaff did not smile. 
Back to the food,  it was good, chicken was excellent, everything else I had was bland.  Their garlic paste was nowhere near as good as le Kebab.  Even the texture was not right.   Just for comparison I ordered Baklava and it was ok. It was slightly burned/ overcooked. Presentation was boring. 
I might go back if I happened to be in the area but Le Kebab will continue to be number one in my book.  They have great food, decor, music and the people are at least friendly. Never had a bad thing to say about Le Kebab.  Clearly this place is not hurting for business with the great reviews-- but I am scratching me head. Maybe all of you have not eaten elsewhere? Idk."}
{"text":"Whoa - ate here today just on a chance and was not disappointed. Interior and seating is great. The food was just outstanding. I do prefer my pita bread a bit thicker to hold dips, but the flavors are on here! Would totally go back. Nice staff, good service. Nice local find."}
{"text":"This place was fairly disappointing. We all ordered the chicken and beef kabob entrees and none of us could finish our plates. The beef was extremely  dry and I could barely chew it. I am 25 years old and have all my teeth and still couldn't bite through the beef. The chicken was okay. And the service was extremely slow. 2 stars given for the fries...those were pretty good."}
{"text":"The blackberry juice was a bit sweet, BUT holy smokes the chicken and also the beef and lamb shawarma were to DIE for!! They make their own bread and it definitely makes all the difference in the world. The place itself doesn't look like much, but they more than make up for it with their talented kitchen. 
Reasonable prices
Amazing hummus
To die for shawarma
Call me crazy but I am coming back!!!"}
{"text":"A fabulous find - food is delicious and owners are super friendly.  Absolutely the best baba ghanoush in the Queen City!"}
{"text":"WOW! This is the real deal! I stumbled upon this place and I WILL BE coming back. I had the chicken kabob lunch special with salad and lentil soup ($6.99). And a side of baba ganoush (bc I'd never had it). Very kind and sincere service. Take out or table service. Even outside dining. If you like Mediterranean food you must go to this restaurant. They've been in business since 2013...how have I missed them until now?"}
{"text":"I love this place...I don't know what else to say! I ordered the chicken kabobs and the meat was moist and flavorful...just delicious! I also tried the shrimp and lamb which were also good. Not sure if I've ever had shrimp that good before. I'll definitely be back..."}
{"text":"The Arab Shwarma wss excellent.  One of the best \"gyro\" meats I've had.   It was incredibly tender.   Not dry or crusty at all.  The hot sauce on the side is really hot, but a nice flavor.

Then I saw something I'd never heard of, or at least remember... a dessert called Knaffeh.  I expected it to be a custard or flan.. it isn't.   The texture is unlike anything I've eaten, and the flavor is subtle.   Nothing like I expected, but it is great.   It's made to order so give yourself 20 minutes.

While I was enjoying it, my server brought out some baklava to try.   Arrggbhh   I only ate half the Arab, and will be struggling to finish the Knaffeh.   I think I'll force myself.   This is not a to-go item...  gotta eat it here.

Tee Hee... just went through my review... \"only ate half the Arab\"  that's a sentence I never thought I'd put on paper ;-)"}
{"text":"Just found this place a couple months ago and now its a go to for lunch during the week. The food is prepared fresh and authentically middle eastern. The lunch special is $6.99 and comes with soup, salad, and main course which I almost never am able to finish -- it's a good amount of food. The rice is particularly very good, I'm not sure why, but it is way better than typical american restaurant rice.

It is oddly empty every time I visit but don't let that deter you."}
{"text":"I am extremely satisfied with the quality of the food and the friendly behaviour of the staff. I am new in Charlotte and this place will be my \"to go\" destination whenever my tastebud for ask for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Good mediterannean restaurant in charlotte. Falafels are good.Ordered Knaffeh which they make fresh takes 20 mins but is not worth it."}
{"text":"I initially wasn't expecting much, but figured it'd be edible based on the reviews. Well, Jasmine Grill shocked me.....

I got the chicken shwarma plate with yellow rice and baba ganoush. I added a pita, extra garlic dip and hot sauce. The meat was tender. The rice was fluffy. Everything was well seasoned and the portions were a nice size. 

But, the icing on the cake for me was the delivery service. I'm staying at a nearby hotel and ordered through their third party, door dash. My food arrived in less than 45 minutes and was still piping hot. I got everything I ordered and the delivery guy was nice and professional. 

I will definitely eat here again. Good job Jasmine Grill!!"}
{"text":"I wish they would figure out how to serve faster and upped their decor a bit because their food is just so freaking delicious! Their pita, hummus, all their meats are so flavorful. And whatever that buttery sauce is they give you needs to be bottled and sold, it's my crack. I mostly go for takeout now since there isn't much of an ambiance and their service can be so slow if you sit down. But damn,  the food still keeps me a patron."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for about a year now and am just getting around to writing a review. This is my go to place for comfort food. Chicken kabobs, shrimp kabobs (OMG) hummas  (OOMMGG) and the most flavorful yellow rice I have ever had. I could eat here everyday. It's that good. I've taken friends from out of town here and they all can't wait to come back. LOVE this place!!!!"}
{"text":"We were really taken by surprise by this restaurant. We ordered the chicken shawarma plate with fatoush and baba ganoush. The food was authentic and the meat was seasoned so well. Try the freshly made fresh fruit juice. So refreshing!"}
{"text":"Excellent food overall but consistently mediocre service. Chicken kabobs flavorful but dry. Very slow and poorly trained and organized waitstaff."}
{"text":"Terrible ownership. Ordered food online from their website and received confirmation that food would be ready in 20 minutes.  Went to pick up food and restaurant was closed.  Credit Card was still charged.  Called the next day and was told manager was out but would receive a call back.  The call never came.  Called again later and spoke with manager who said he would take care of it and call me back in 20 minutes when done.  Never received a call back and the refund was never processed.  Finally went into the store to speak to the manager who wanted me to call the company that they use for their online orders and that I shouldn't be upset about having to make a trip to the store only to find out they were closed, call multiple times about getting a refund, and then him not wanting to give it to me.  

Finally got refunded my money but not for my wasted time."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Always nice to find a hidden gem in a shopping strip mall.  Hummus was delicious, the kebabs were made fresh and the service was top notch.   I can't wait to come back and try more menu items.  This place has some of the best Mediterranean dishes in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Exceptional kebabs! The bill was about $13.00 out the door (LEAVE A TIP) for a combination kebab plate including chicken, kufta (ground lamb + beef and herbs mix), and beef (sirloin maybe) kebabs. The plate was massive and the kebabs were served on thick bed of rice with a grilled onion and a grilled tomato on opposing sides of the plate. If that isn't enough, they offer you a side item! You may choose from hummus, baba ganouj, salad, and about 3 other options I can't recall.

The baba ganouj was lacking... it wasn't the best I've ever had. They also serve it with a home made pita bread which is thinner than the pita to which I am accustomed, but it was good. I would have liked the pita served warm, but it was served at room temperature.

So why 5 stars after the previous paragraph? Because the entree was absolutely flawless. The beef was served in 4 glorious morsels cooked to a remarkably moist medium rare that was more medium than rare. It was also seasoned perfectly. You could taste the seasoning but also relish the succulent quality of the red meat.

The chicken was also exceptionally moist and tender. Seasoned to perfection, and the seasoning/marinated penetrated the chicken rather than simply resting on the surface.

The kufta was one of the finest examples of kufta which I have experienced and I can not say enough of wonderful things about it. If you've never had kufta, ignore the name and go for it! The name always put me off but it is absolutely my favorite meat on any menu.

The chef (and presumably owner) came to my table three times to inquire how my experience was, and asked how I'd heard about the place. I informed him that I'd heard about it from Yelp, and that I was just passing through on business. He was so grateful for the business and concerned about my experience that I felt compelled to write up the review.

The inside is certainly no frills, and the tv was a bit on the loud side (it was entertaining though), but this place was unfortunately empty on the Monday night I dined here. This place certainly needs your support. Get in there and give them your dollars. The food is spectacular and the owner(s) conscientious. 

It's worth a try and at $13 OTD (not including tip) for a combo plate that could feed two, it's absolutely worth every single penny!"}
{"text":"Pleasant experience. Nice staff that helped explain dishes we weren't familiar with. Food tasted as it should. It was delicious and freshly cooked. Will stop here again for food I know will taste good."}
{"text":"Wow placed a to go order and I see a lot of people that have been seated after me and are being served. I'm not being served even though I paid already for my to go order. 

Had to wait over 30 minutes for the veggie plate- nothing had to be cooked! Only got it after I went and asked for a refund- then it's suddenly ready. Only took the food because I didn't want to disappoint the wife."}
{"text":"We're frim out of town but stopped in based on Yelp reviews. OMG! Excellent food! We ordered the yogurt cucumber appetizer and the veggie plate appetizer (hummus, baba ganouch, stuffed grape leaves, falafel). My kids ordered chicken shwarma and chicken kabob with rice. We all loved our food! Service was also pleasant and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!  The food and service is over 5 stars. Everything we got was delicious and fresh. We will be back here next time we are in Charlotte. I got the lamb kabob, we got falafel, schwarma, and one of each of the desserts. To die for!"}
{"text":"We had the 4 item vegetarian appetizer and baked pies. Both were delicious. We will be back to try something new real soon. Our server was patient, friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Stopped for the night in Charlotte on a road trip and saw that this restaurant was close to our hotel. As a lover of Greek food, I saw the good Yelp reviews and thought I would give it a try.  I ordered the chicken shawarma with yellow rice and baba ganoush. My fiancé ordered the beef and lamb shawarma with yellow rice and hummus. Everything we ordered was fantastic and very UNIQUE compared to other Greek/Mediterranean places I have eaten at in the past. I'm not sure if this place was more authentic or if they just did things differently than other places but they definitely know how to cook food.  The hummus was super creamy and the baba ganoush was very smokey and delicious. All the food comes with a little cup a spicy chili sauce and a cup of \"garlic dip\" that honestly looks like lard with garlic mixed in. Great service and food. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot, authentic food. We had the chicken shawarma, hummus plate before the meal and baba ghanoush with the meal. All was excellent, service was great, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best in town. My Fav n must try: chicken shawarma, half chicken, hummas.

Small place with open kitchen so expect a little noise during your meal."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The flavor of everything we've tried is amazing. I don't know much about Middle Eastern food, but I'm very happy that a friend suggested this place. 
It's a small place, this gives it a quaint home grown feel. The staff is always pleasant and nice to talk to. I have never been here when it wasn't a steady crowd of people either dining in or taking out."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken kebab with rice, salad and hummus. Very generous portions, more than i could eat at lunch. The chicken was the star of the meal, cooked perfectly, slightly charred, delicious seasoning and moist. Service was attentive but not overly so. Great spot!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Wow!

Beef and shrimp kabab was amazing, the seasoning had just the right amount of spice and was grilled to perfection. Honestly, some of the best beef & shrimp I've ever had. 

What a great find! Restaurant isn't fancy but it's nice to sit down for dinner (more than just a place to grab carryout).

I will definitely be back next time I'm in this area. Wish I was closer, food would be great to carry out when we host dinner."}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for some time now, definitely regret not coming here sooner! The food is amazing and the wait isn't too long from the time that you order. The rice is just as I hoped, and the meat was authentic and so deliciously soft, you cannot go wrong with this place!! Come and see for yourself !"}
{"text":"First time here. I had the beef and lamb shwarma, and it was amazing! The yellow rice as a side was delicious. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! This food is fantastic! Fast and friendly service and the prices are very reasonable. The chicken lunch special I had came with salad, soup, chicken, and a hug heap of rice (I chose the yellow rice which is very flavorful and fluffy)."}
{"text":"My husband and I found Jasmine on Yelp and the reviews were such we gave it a try.  We were not disappointed.  It was excellent! We had several items off the menu and they were all prepared with obviously, from their presentation, much care.  The owners can certainly take pride in their recipes as they were delicious!  A welcoming atmosphere awaits you.  We highly recommend Jasmine!"}
{"text":"We did the vegetable appetizer and it was delicious. The hummus at Jasmine is the best I've ever had. My wife and I then split a kabob plate with lamb, chicken and beef, and it too was excellent. The server suggested we order the Fatosh as a side, and it to was wonderful. And the homemade bread ... out-of-this-world good.

The prices are great and the service is excellent. We found this place on yelp (we're from Dallas). Thanks to all those who came before us and took the time to review Jasmine Grill. Dinner tonight was treat!"}
{"text":"All in on 5 stars:  great service, reasonable prices, plenty of seating...oh, and great food, too!  All their food is prepared in-house and it shows.  My lunch special was a chicken kabob grilled perfectly, rice, grilled veggies, freshly chopped salad and lightly dressed, and a cup of vegan lentil soup.  My belly is happy and so is my wallet, $6.99 + drink (which was comped with my Yelp check-in, and refilled)!  I'll be back for sure.
PS:  my server did an excellent job explaining their food choices, philosophy, and attending to my dining needs."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while waiting for my car to get done at pep boys. I had the chicken shawarma and my boyfriend had the beef kabob. We loved every bit of it. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious. FRESH. Family owned. Open late. Delivery available. 

Yes, it is true! I now have my favorite go-to Mediterranean restaurant on the SouthEnd/SouthPark side of town. It won't break the bank and you'll have plenty to eat. 

It's a newly established restaurant taking the space of the latter Las Palmas Restaurant. The menu has a lot of dishes in Spanish as a way of honoring the Las Palmas crowd. Be like me though and skip over to the authentic Mediterranean dishes. The baba ganoush is the best I've had in Charlotte. Its smoky flavor almost had me licking the plate clean. My flexitarian side came out and I had to order the mixed plate with the beef, chicken, and lamb kofta kebab. OMG. Grilled to perfection. The dish comes with a fresh salad filled with cucumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce topped with freshly squeezed lemon juice, EVOO, and pepper. 

As of now, there are a few things lacking because it's a new start-up place. For instance, it's not too vegetarian friendly. They only serve flan and cheesecake, but eventually want to have baklava and other Arabic desserts. In a week they'll serve breakfast and sometime in the future they want to add Hookas. 

For those wanting to score a great lunch under $10, this is the place. For $7.99 on Tuesday, Wednesday, & Friday you get most anything on the menu. 

I almost cried tears of joy when I saw that they offer delivery. Now my lazy self doesn't even have to leave my home or office as long as I live within 7 miles of the place. 

The service is great. It's family owned. They don't serve alcohol (but the bar next door does).

Try it out and you won't regret it. They are open late until 9:30pm during the week and until midnight Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and I absolutely love this place. The yellow rice is my favorite and I highly recommend it. I've only tried their chicken options and they are absolutely delicious. The chicken kabab it one of the best I've eaten in the US. They serve lentil soup in the beginning and I don't know why but they serve it with a piece of lemon to be squeezed so that the juice goes in it. It hardly makes a difference because the lemon-like taste disappears in the soup. Anyways, it still tastes good - high in protein content.

I don't give a damn about sanitation ratings of this place. In my opinion, this place could be just as filthy or clean as an American/Indian/Asian/Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome !!!The best tasting shish tawook wraps and their garlic dip is the best:)"}
{"text":"This place used to be a columbian eatery, but now is mediterranean. Nevertheless, you can nevertheless purchase sweet plantains as a side! Quite cool. The folks are extremely pleasant and typical dish is $9 with a salad and some chip like things to bite on prior to your meal. You won't leave hungry. We'll undoubtedly be back."}
{"text":"What a great find! I love all of their options. The sauces are great and the flavors are awesome. We opted for order pickup but the dining area looks great. Can't wait to go back. 

Wraps come with fries as a side. plates come with a side of your choosing & are so large you could easily feed two people. I went with beef & lamb shawarma plate and it did not disappoint.  

Not sure what the white sauce is but dang it's good!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here Saturday night. Had I known it was going to take almost 2 hours I probably wouldn't have but it was too late to change it. I ordered the chicken/steak kabobs with rice and hummus. I also ordered a side of falafels. The meat was good, nicely flavored but not very tender. Both the chicken and steak were a bit tough but not to the point that it was bad per se. The falafels were really good which is why I'd prefer giving 3.5 stars but since that's not possible I'll round down. The hummus I didn't like... Not even a little bit and the pita bread was hard and not very fresh. The rice and veggies that came on the side were good but I would have liked more veggies!! All in all it was a decent dinner but probably not one I'd repeat."}
{"text":"Jasmine Grill is worth going out of your way to get to. Thanks to a previous reviewer who said don't let it's location fool you, I finally had lunch here today. Wish I'd tried it sooner. Great food, friendly staff, and great prices."}
{"text":"I am a former regular customer. I say \"former\" because I doubt that I will go back. My go-to lunch here was the beef and lamb sharma plate and they have increased their price for this from the $11 range to now $14. That's ridiculous, especially for lunch. Very disappointing how hole in the wall restaurants try to price gouge once they get popular. I went across the street to  Crispy Banh Mi and paid under $7 for a large sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem! We went there for lunch today and their lunch specials are hard to beat. For 6.99, I had a chicken shawarma plate, hummus with pita, and a bowl of soup. 

The service was great. Our waitress was kind and attentive. 

The food was delicious! The lentil soup was perfect on a cold day. And the hummus is some of the best I've had. It has tasty oils and spices on it that add to the yummyness. The chicken shawarma was also great and the white rice was great. 

We left stuffed and with happy tummies! 

I would highly suggest anyone who wants to try some authentic Mediterranean food to come here!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and had the falafel appi. I've never had it before and it looked a little too crispy, but that could just be me not knowing what it's supposed to look like! Lol had the chicken kebab for dinner. It was excellent. Like. Excellent. I love the yellow rice. Wowzah. It came with a side salad that was also very good. I think I accidentally put the falafel sauce on my chicken dish instead I wasn't sure what sauces went where! Over all excellent and delivery thru yelp was so fast! At max 30 min."}
{"text":"Yelp didn't steer me wrong on this one, it definitely lived up to the 5 star reviews. We had the chicken kabobs with house salad and yellow rice. The kabobs come with a garlic paste which is delicious. The chicken was super flavorful and tender, and I loved the char on the chicken. We will probably start frequenting jasmine grill! It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"First and last?
Maybe they were having a bad day but it took them 25 minutes to make my shawerma. The guy kept saying that all the other orders were placed ahead but it was clear that that wasn't the case. What's wrong with saying \"sorry we forgot\"?  I rather have that than a a dog ate my homework deal.."}
{"text":"Really solid Med food! The chicken schwarma was very tasty! But the best thing was their accompanying tzatziki sauce, or their version of it. It was AWESOME! Made the schwarma really really delicious! Also had the stuffed grape leaves that also were very good.  They were of the warm variety which I prefer over the cold ones. Yummy babeh ganouche (sp?) to start and voila a GREAT lunch! Can't wait to try their other yummy delights."}
{"text":"Food - 4.5 stars. Service - a whole different story! This review is based on multiple visits and experiences (takeout and dine in) 

1. Let's start with the food, I don't understand why they use TORTILLA instead of pita for wraps. This is a Middle Eastern restaurant, and I should not have to specify wanting my wrap to be pita to get pita. But wait, even after specifying....I didn't get pita. It was on the order, I see it on the receipt but the cook just didn't bother. If you have allergies, stay away from there!

2. Take out issue - They insist on using small foam boxes for hummus and baba ghanoush, both have a decent amount of oil and the bag is always a mess when I get to my final destination, in fact I have a carpet stain in my car. Maybe they should check out their competition who use proper boxes for these things and don't make a mess. Stop being stingy!

3. Overall service - I called at 1:30 to place an order...my order was beef shawarma plate with fattoush and baba ghanoush...everything is made already and it really just needs to get boxed up, but I figured maybe they have a late lunch rush because they said it would taken 20 minutes. I get there and only two tables are occupied, the guys behind the counter are doing nothing. There is a box sitting unpacked. So I proceed to pay and figured they overestimated time, he gladly took my card and processed my payment quickly! Then I didn't get my food...okay...so I wait a few minutes and again they were NOT doing anything behind the counter, no phones, no chopping, no packing orders. Literally just standing there - my 20 minutes were up so I finally went and asked if my order is ready. That box sitting was it! They slowly scoop salad in another box and pack it as slow as humanly possible and hand it to me. 0 respect for people's time! I don't know about them, but I get a strict lunch hour and I'm less than a mile away, so it shouldn't take half an hour to get food and bring it back. Such lack of urgency! 

4. Dine in issues - this was a Sunday lunch. It was very cold, and they don't have enough heat and lots of tables are by the door. What happens when the door opens? We freeze!!! Great! That's not all of it. We see on the new menu \"fresh juice\" and we ask and press the waitress about it after we get one and it's frozen juice. She tells us it's frozen fruit...umm that is not fresh! It may only have fruit but fresh juice comes from fresh fruit, not frozen - no ice or water should be added. Honestly it'd be better if it was packaged juice. I got a soda that was never refilled in time. I ordered the meat pies as an appetizer, it was cold in the middle - and when I sent it back to be heated it took forever and was clearly forgotten at some point. 

Bottom line, food is good but they don't care about service or people's time. I get that it's not a fast food place, but still it's not a freaking steakhouse and I never even order kabobs it's always shawarma which is already made"}
{"text":"I got the beef and lamb shwarma wrap and it wad amazing! Would definitely go back and i can't wait. Staff was also extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Read about Jasmine Grill on the Charlotte Agenda & decided to give it a try. Glad I did . I ordered the shawarma, it came with soup, salad , & yellow rice. $6.99 the food was flavorful & delicious. pita bread was not good at all, but that's not a deal breaker. I will be back & absolutely will be recommending. The waitress was nice, the restaurant was clean ."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  We will be visiting this place often. I had the beef kabob lunch special with grilled veggies, rice, side soup, and salad. My fiancé had a yogurt marinated chicken, jasmine rice, pickled turnips, and a yogurt garlic dipping sauce for the chicken, which was delicious with the beef as well. It's quant, but they have TVs and outdoor sitting as well."}
{"text":"Some of the best middle eastern food I've had in the city. I am fortunate to live right down the street from this place. Previously they never had a take-out menu so I never thought about it when I wanted to eat out. 
However, now they do and I'm there more often than I'd like to admit. The guys behind the counter work hard all the time putting out orders. And it pays off because you get quality food at a great price and time. 
They have an excellent lunch special and it's definitely worth coming back for dinner. My favorite is the chicken Schwarma but my parents got an all veggie dish and have not stopped talking about it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Excellent service and excellent food. I am very picky and only food that is fresh and this place is very fresh!   The chicken kebab is so moist and delicious. Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 7-March-2017
Time of my visit: Lunch

I was in the mood for something different for lunch today.  And since I was on a business trip, I could take a little risk in terms of food.  I search around and found this joint!  And boy was I not disappointed!

I walked in and the place was busy.  Waiter directed me to sit down anywhere I wanted.  He came over right away, I had a free drinking for checking in on the Yelp! app.  I ordered unsweetened ice tea and Beef Kabob plate with side salad and rice.

The salad came out first.  It was good, about what I was expecting it to be!  The plate came out next.  The rice was moist, mixed in with some veggies and delicious!  The beef was firm, but juicy and very well prepared.  This has been by far the best Mediterranean food and experience I have had!  My only complaint was that some people got complementary pita, but I did not, as it turned I had to ask for it.

Overall an A- experience! Definitely recommend this joint!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I got a to-go from here couple  months back.  had some falafels and chicken kabob.  quantity was good enough.  taste was good, nothing special or unique.  just been here once so haven't tried other stuff yet.  the guy at the counter was engaging and courteous and offered a table and drink while I was waiting for my to-go order."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot.I love their chicken shawarma with a side of lentil soup and it's easy to order from their business on YelpEats and EatStreet apps. Their dine-in business is legit, but I tend to grab takeout. Because everything is made to order the timing can be a bit slow. Even for takeout you can expect to wait about 25 minutes. The staff is friendly and the interior is clean and spacious."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the extremely delicious food I would rate this lower than three.

First it took the wait staff 5 minutes to seat me.  There were three tables available and one needed to be cleaned up.

Second it took seven minutes before a menu was given and no comment about what to drink.

Third was the state of the men's restroom.
There were towel paper on the ground, the towel bowl brush was lying on the ground.

There were open trays of baklava, steps from the restrooms.

My waiter ignored my attempt to get his attention to ask for bread.

It was only when I used my phone did I get attention from the waiter.

I think that next time I will just order my food to go."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you, this is a great place to eat!  I have had chicken skewers and fattoush salad with chicken.  The yellow rice is very tasty and flavorful.  They give you a side of pickled vegetables   that I keep meaning to ask for extras of.  The portion size is huge. The chicken is moist and not dry at all.  I love this place and will definitely be back when in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This may be the best Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in Charlotte.   Try the Veggie Delight appetizer for excellent Babah Ghonoush and Grape Leaves.  Lamb & Chicken Kebabs are incredible.   Must order the yellow saffron rice - beats fried rice any day!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I've been looking for my Mediterranean restaurant in Charlotte and I've found it. I ordered chicken kabob with fatush salad and baba ghannoush. Chicken was perfectly seasoned and tender, fatush salad was fresh and had just enough dressing, and baba ghannoush was the best I've had in a while. Only negative is that I ordered it to go and it was a little slow, but it was well worth the wait. It is very average looking from the outside, tucked in a strip mall, but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Everything we tried was great. We got the grilled fish, beef and lamb shawarma with yellow and white rice and a yogurt with olive oil and spices. They were willing to cater to specific requests without issue and were extreme helpful in explaining items we hadn't tried before. It's a must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Very good lamb shank.  Service was quick, efficient and friendly.   The price was a good value for the quantity and quality.   The one issue I had is the 90 sanitation grade and a general unclean look inside and out."}
{"text":"This gem is located in an uncharming strip mall but the interior is cheery and the value is excellent.  Hummus and Baba Ganoush are tasty...I like that they are served with thin, flaky pita bread, not the thick spongy type.  Try the lamb shank...for $9.99 you get a whole leg on the bone, more yellow rice than you can eat, and rich, savory vegetable soup with a hint of cinnamon.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome low key place for Mediterranean food!  The food has been amazing every single time. I love eating here and doing take out. I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for authentic Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Decent place, not too classy or fancy but the food is really good & flavorful. Portions are big for the price. Reasonably priced and I'll go again."}
{"text":"I had heard this place was great so I decided to give it a shot for lunch. Wow! The food was great and there was SO much of it. I went with a friend and we split an order of babaganoush- Delilah! We each got the lunch special- chicken Kevin with rice. It also came with soup and salad. It was all great and we walked out paying $10 each. I will be back no doubt about it"}
{"text":"Everything here is excellent. Service was very pleasant. Customers were various foreign ethnicities. Very low key, calm
Vibe. This place is a lovely hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Oh my freakin' word..total mouth water, and mind-blowing. A coworker recommended this place. So th lad I took him up on it. This is a must try...must have. My 17 year old loved it too. They will be seeing me more often. #FoodieHeaven"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken kabobs, yellow rice and side salad it was a huge portion of food couldn't even finish the meal. The chicken was tender, well seasoned and was very good, like I said before one of the sides that I ordered was the yellow rice also good favor and it had grilled green peppers and onions as well as a side of hot sauce and a white sauce that had garlic very good combination enjoyed it. House salad was also very tasty well mixed cucumbers, lettuce as well as others veggies all mixed with there dressing."}
{"text":"Best food by far the most delicious middle eastern food I've had. Be sure to try the lamb chops, they are the best in the world!! Also the lentil soup is amazing"}
{"text":"Holy crap is this place amazing. Never expected anything as fresh, delicious and authentic as this restaurant in Charlotte. Don't be deceived by the generic storefront location and unremarkable interior decor. The food is as good as it gets. Everything is bursting with flavor and the staff is super helpful and friendly. I'll definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"We order takeout from Jasmine Grill on a regular basis and it's always delicious. I'd add 5 minutes to the quoted time if you don't like to wait. The chicken is my favorite with rice and hummus. Always ask for extra pita and side sauces. I think you can get delivery trough DoorDash or uber eats."}
{"text":"Long wait for average food.  Servers were great but the cooks seemed lost and not happy to be doing what they were doing (poorly by the way)"}
{"text":"This place is great.
My friend and I stopped in here today after hearing so many good things about it and we both left full, happy, with leftovers, and we only spent $7.

The place is no-frills. It's a simple restaurant with a simple, yet incredibly delicious, menu. The people who were working were all incredibly friendly, and our server was able to explain everything about the menu items, which is great for people who are unfamiliar with Middle-Eastern cuisine. 

The food was DELICIOUS. Not one bite lacked flavor, and the chicken was incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned. For only $7 for hummus, pita, salad, rice, and chicken, I was BEYOND satisfied.

I will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Ordered Falafel, which I don't normal like but theirs was delicious. Chicken Shawarma wrap was fantastic. Fattoush salad was great and the Baklava was soooo good. No complaints at all! Service is fantastic. LOVE!"}
{"text":"I LOVE MEDITERRANEAN FOOD. I was so thrilled to see that Jasmine Grill was so highly rated in Charlotte when I was visiting and took my friends there. I wish I had written this review sooner so I could actually remember what the dish names were...but 3 of us ordered 3 entrees and 4 sides. We loved everything and all deeply love Mediterranean food! I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu. The service was great, presentation was beautiful, and I really wish Jasmine Grill was located in my city. Whenever I am back in Charlotte, I'm definitely going back...or if anyone ever tells me they are visiting the city, I'll be telling them to come here!"}
{"text":"One of the latest additions to our regular cycle of eating out. Delicious food. I believe we order the veggie plate with falafel, hummus, baba ganoush, and grape leaves. It's plenty of food. 
Also have tried the falafel wrap which I enjoy, but not quite the varied plate like the veggie plate. It comes with French fries. Seems silly, but you eat them anyway. 
They seem to know what the word vegan means, so that's good too. Super friendly, so we don't mind waiting a little bit for the food. Small joint, so get it to go and take it to one of the breweries. Three spirits is closest."}
{"text":"They have a sign that you get 15% ofg of first online order. You can't order daily specials online. I asked about it, it was 3;12. 12 min past lunch hours and was told lunch special is over. If it was during lunch hour, you will be able to get special online. I logged on today and fo not see it"}
{"text":"I have never left a review on Yelp. UNTIL NOW! Oh my gracious this place is amazing. I had the tilapia in garlic sauce. It was well seasoned and a wonderful sauce. Prices are good as well. Service was excellent...excellent:) One of those places that when you leave you can not stop thinking about."}
{"text":"The wife and I came out for dinner but we could not get past the appetizers as we were full.  We ordered the Veggie delight and the baked pies.  They were both very good.  We had freshly made pineapple juice and blueberry juice instead of a fake sugary carbonated drink and were very delighted.  We shall return to try the entrees next time."}
{"text":"Ok don't get me wrong the food here is great. It's cheap and affordable but the reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because the service here today was not great at all it took about 5 mins to ask for what we would drink and we was the only people in here. My water wasnt refilled until we was getting the check and getting boxes for the food. That's why they got 3 stars"}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food in the Charlotte area!   Can't wait to go back.   Everything is so good!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mediterranean spot! They are run by authentic Middle Eastern people, that are very nice. They are pretty quick for service, so it was a great stop for lunch. The food portions are quite large, so I ordered an entree and an app and shared it, and left stuffed. They have some pretty simple, safe options for those that are less adventurous in foreign foods. I was very pleased with the quality of food, including the meats. Doesn't seem like they cut corners on quality. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is SOOO good. This was my first time eating at an actual Mediterranean restaurant so I was a little hesitant, but I knew I liked at least hummus OMG it was amazing. Staff was friendly as well. Price is good as well."}
{"text":"The food was great. Nothing that hit a home run but just good.
It took 75 mins for the delivery to arrive ! I wouldn't blame them for it was 1.5 miles away and I ordered via yelp app.
The portion was just and presentable.
The food was fresh."}
{"text":"What a great find!  The lamb chops are amazingly tender and flavorful.  We shared the lamb chop meal and the veggie appetizer combo.  Everything was wonderful and we will be back for sure.  This makes it worth driving to Charlotte to fly out from Asheville."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants - I hate to give the secret away ;) The food is fresh and delicious. The wait staff is very kind and attentive. Nothing to complain about here .."}
{"text":"Simply delicious food. Love the falafel, hummus, and baba ganoush. Yum! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food!
I was in town on business and wanted to grab dinner before heading to work.
I checked in the hotel and looked for a restaurant on yelp. I was in mood for something else, but when I looked the pictures of this restaurant, I had to check it out. I'm glad I did! 

It was short drive from my hotel, and I arrived here around 7pm. There were a couple of groups were dining in. 
The staff greeted me and told me to sit wherever I liked. 
I sat down, and the staff brought me the menu. The menu was very simple, and all entrees came with a side or two sides. 
There were some sides that I wasn't familiar with, but the staff was nice enough to explain to me. I ordered lamb kebab and sides of baba ganoush and fatuch. 

The staff came back with my fatuch after five minutes. It was nicely presented and seasoned very well. Lots of diced cucumber and tomatoes which I really liked. 
I waited 20 more minutes to get the rest of the food. My food looked delicious. 
Baba ganoush was salty as the staff mentioned; however, I couldn't stop eating it. It was addicting! 

My lamb was cooked medium and very tender. I've never had lamb this good before. It was cooked with grilled veggies. 
Their homemade pita bread goes well with the meal. My meal was so good that I just kept eating. 
After I finish my meal, I realized I was very stuffed. 

The restaurant is very cozy. The staff is nice and friendly. The service is also good. The prices are generous, and the portions are good. Ample parking. 
I'm glad I found this restaurant and will definitely be coming back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Best chicken kabobs! And very reasonable prices! It's definitely a place to check out..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

Service is a bit discombobulated no big deal, prices are very low and there are tables outside, another plus. 
The Kafta kabob  ($10)- mix of ground lamb, beef, spices- comes w/ yellow rice, grilled tomato and onion and a side of your choice. Simply excellent! 
4 stars

I got the Humus as a side... it was interesting. It was presented with stripes of Cumin and paprika and a bit of fresh mint floating in a small wading pool of olive oil in the middle of it all. I liked the flavor the unusual garnish gave it but I thought the hummus lacked something ... maybe tehini?
3 stars

My companion had a falafel wrap, it comes with fries. The falafel wrap was very good but the there was no dressing in it. Again tehini may have helped but there's a number of sauces that would have worked. The fries were the standard kind but they were nicely crispy and we ended dipping them into the humus, which worked great.
3 1/2 stars. 
  
We also tried the Cheese Burek, these were deep fried as opposed to baked, it tasted OK but honestly personally I much prefer the baked phylo kind.  The only bad note was the ice cubes had taste to them, they gave us fresh bottles of water to make up for it.

With Jasmine on the West side of town, Le Shish kabob on the East side and Kabob Je in Matthews, Charlotte certainly has Arabic food well covered."}
{"text":"First time here, and everything was amazing. The veggie platter was delicious and beautifully plated, and the rice was flavorful! My server, Amine, was very friendly and his service was excellent. I work just down the road and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the food here from falafel to kebabs it was all wonderful and the lunch special can't be beaten."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and ordered the chicken kabob. The waiter was very friendly and attentive, but the wait time for the meal was ~20 minutes (this was also considering that I was the only customer there at the time). With that being said though, the food was solid. The meal came with a thick and hearty lentil soup and fresh cucumber/lettuce/tomato salad in addition to the well grilled chicken kabob and rice. Do yourself a favor and mix in the garlic mayonnaise and spicy salsa, which adds a tangy kick to the chicken. For $6.99 + tax, this was great value."}
{"text":"Nice quality of fresh food which has been consistent the front of the house seems to always be short staffed though so it can be frustrating when attempting to wrap up and get out of there. Would be nice for them to check in with you while dining in but again that goes along with not having enough help."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. Lunch.  Had the chicken kabob with yellow rice, soup, small salad.  Have to say that the food is spot on.  Everything was tasty and hot and seasoned perfectly.  Service was excellent.  Lunch ran about $9 with tea."}
{"text":"Dude.. go figure that the most amazing shwarma I've ever had is in Charlotte, NC!! I'm not kidding.. the flavor profile in the beef/lamb is beyond. The falafel are light and cooked perfect, the babaganoush (I'm very picky) was spot on, and the humus had my husband in heaven. What really makes this place though is the service. Our server was polite, friendly, proactive, and passionate about his job. Keep it up guys.. I'll be back whenever I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"I was so ready to be disappointed in this restaurant.  They weren't treating me bad...just like I didn't matter...like they were preoccupied....kinda like you year your exgf when you have a new gf. 

And then I got my food.  And dessert. You understand how it feels to get you heartbroken right? And you very well know it's near impossible to piece someone's heart back together.  Every bite was better than the last Juicy. Flavorful. Authentic.  Ya'll can treat me however you want long as you keep feeding me that good good."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and they were crazy busy so it took a little while to get what we needed. However, very worth the wait. I'm not really a Mediterranean food connoisseur, but this was absolutely delicious. It's like the super yummy homemade version of Zoe's kitchen or Viva chicken."}
{"text":"Jammed right in the middle of a strip mall and can easily be unseen by the blaring lights of the pizza place next door is a delicious Palestinine/Jordanian restaurant. The food is GOOD and pretty authentic too. I got to try a few things last night which included hummus, baba ghanoush, fattoush, yellow rice, lamb chops, kefta kebob, chicken souk, steak kebobs, and of course kanefh . All good but what stood out to me was the baba ghanoush, lamb chops, and kanefh. The baba ghanoush was super fresh and I love the smoked flavor. The lamb chops were surprisingly tender and delicious- will come back for! Oh and the kanefh...Well first it's a big portion so plan to share with your company and second they make it fresh to order so it will take a few minutes. Oh but so worth the wait, definitely up there with the best I have ever had! FYI the food reheats well too!"}
{"text":"Come hungry!!!  Great kabob selection and the apps are amazing!!!  

Great value for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that it is a hole in the wall kind of place, not your date night spot. That being said, the highlight of this place is the HUMMUS. It is A-mazing. We got chicken sheesh kabob and chicken shawarma as entrees and I felt that the shawarma was more tender as compared to the kabob. They need to work on their service and wait time to serve food but the food does taste great."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight from Jasmin.  It was so delish.  Had the chicken schwarma, the house salad and the hummus.   The servings were gigantic, plenty for leftovers.  

It is the best mediterranean that I have found in Charlotte.  It was cheap fast and the staff were very nice. 

They were out of baklava, so I will have to go back again soon."}
{"text":"What a find!!! I only wish this restaurant was in my hometown. Phenomenal middle eastern grill. Fanatic authentic homemade Arabic food. Fatush, Hummus Lamb kebab.  5star food in a not so fancy ambiance. Loved it"}
{"text":"They could benefit from more servers. Great food and staff. Wish they had some low playing music. Too quiet. Ordered a to go order and was told 10 minutes. It took 30 minutes for falafel. ??"}
{"text":"Have had excellent meals here but customer service is just not good. Latest was that I ordered online, drove over and they had no record of the order. While I understand accidents happen, this is not the first time this has happened and"}
{"text":"After my first visit, I am definitely becoming a regular. Their portions are big and they are so reasonably priced! LOVED the hummus!!!

Only minor upset was the ladies bathroom needed a good bit of cleaning."}
{"text":"One of the best middle eastern restaurants in charlotte. I like almost everything on the menu. I mostly go mixed grill kebabs with yellow rice and baba ganouch. The only area they can improve in is the pita bread they serve. They should either stop serving these or start making their own. Rest is delicious and authentic. I don't easily give five stars though."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and reasonably priced. Unfortunately my chicken was slightly undercooked but my husbands meal was perfect. Just sucks because I'm pregnant but I enjoyed my meal otherwise."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  We just moved here from chicago and it has been hard to find food that compares to what we used to eat back in Chitown!  We had falafel wraps with a side of hummus and we loved it!  It was full of flavor and just delicious!!!!!  We will definitely back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here three times in the span of a week, while visiting Charlotte. The food was excellent and the service was better than exceptional. These guys rock!"}
{"text":"For the price you can't beat this place.  Then top it with the great customer service and friendly staff.  We had the chicken Schwarma platter.  A beef and chicken plate with baba ganoush  (pardon my spelling). Everything was delicious.  When I was ordering, he patiently described each dish for me.  Made recommendations.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My favorite Arab food in charlotte so far. Service is kind of slow, but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food great service will be a regular We ordered delivery and the food arrived hot fresh and to die for"}
{"text":"Two words: Lamb chops! We tried this  restaurant for carryout because I had a coupon and  it was not too far from the groomer where we would be picking up the dog. Serendipity!
   The aroma from the carryout bag had both my dog and me ravenous by the time we got home. Opened the box and saw lamb chops with perfect grill marks fanned across yellow rice studded with veggies. Just had to pick one up lollipop style and take a bite-- tender, perfect medium rare, and flecked with an herb mix that enhanced the meat and gave it just a hint of heat. Don't miss the garlic yogurt butter spread-- nice addition to rice. The bright, citrusy dressed salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, feta and mint added a summery balance. We even opted to open a nice bottle of red, given the entree quality! Later, yummy homemade baklava provided a perfect end to the meal. At $20 (inc tip) for one generous entree and dessert,  shareable by two with modest appetites, or as dinner for one with enough leftovers for next day lunch, a very good value! 
    Carryout service was swift and friendly. I was even offered a beverage while I waited.
    Interior is simple--think fast casual-- and it has several big tables where groups or families would feel welcome. 
     Worth the 20 minute drive from my house for a return visit-- even if the dog isn't at the groomers nearby! In fact, planning in being a regular and want to try other offerings--IF we can ever pass up those yummy lamb chops!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. The rice has an amazing flavor. I got the grilled chicken and it was very yummy. My husband got the lamb and said it's the best lamb he's had since moving to the States. We definitely found a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm yummy! 
We got the mixed grill ( chicken, beef and lamb kebab) plate. Comes with two sides; I chose the yellow rice and the baba. The rice and meat came with a red chili sauce and a thick white garlic sauce. The food was amazingly tasty, even the two sides were so good that not a single drop was wasted! The babaganosh was really yummy ... The boy doesn't much care for eggplant but admitted that baba was pretty darn good. If I had one complaint it was that the beef and the lamb were a bit stringy and tough. But the flavors were so on point i only removed one star."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I'm starting to really doubt Charlottes local Yelpers as they seem to have a odd idea of what a 5 star rating should signify. 

From the moment we walked into JASMINE GRILL I knew I was not going to enjoy my lunch. The seating is awkwardly situated and the decor falling apart. From the start it didn't seem like table service as the food appears to be cafeteria style, but a friendly gentleman greeted us and offered us a table immediately. They were pretty busy for lunch so I was hopeful that perhaps the local yelpers are right and the appearance is insignificant. 

The menu is confusing if you're never had \"Mediterranean Food\" so we chose a couple of familiar items such as the Chewy \"Lamb\" Kebobs with bland white rice and bag frozen French fries and the Rack of Lamb w/ Yellow rice FULL of peas and vegetables accompanied by an unenthusiastic unknown soup. 

The prices weren't horrible, but the food is definitely subpar at best! At a restaurant called JASMINE grill, you'd think they'd at least serve some Jasmine rice instead of that Uncle Bens poor excuse for rice. I'm not sure what the yelpers in Charlotte were thinking when they gave this place a 4/5 star rating."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have described, the service is dicey. The servers were all nice, and friendly, just not professional.

We waited at our table for 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us.  It was only when I asked if we were supposed to order at the counter that our orders were finally taken.

Chicken Shawarma was nice, and half chicken was tender (but the dark meat was dry and overcooked), yellow rice was tasty, and hummus was delicious.  Try it, just be prepared to wait a while."}
{"text":"Checked out the ratings on Yelp. Staying in a hotel, wanted to watch football and rest, so ordered pick-up on-line. The food was ready quickly. And, man, was it delicious!! The beef kebab was fantastic. The hummus and babba ganoush were delicious, as were the grape leaves and the falafel. I have to admit, my babba ganoush is better, but theirs is pretty good. I was very happy with my food. Very, very happy."}
{"text":"This place is always crazy busy like literally from the moment they open to close! Why? Because it's delicious!! You can immediately start smelling the wonderful aromas as soon as you step out of your car in the parking lot. When you walk in it's a small restaurant with limited seating but the service is quick and to go is always an option. They serve everything from shawarma to kebabs to falafel. The yellow rice is always one of my go to side items and is always perfectly seasoned and cooked. They have some amazing lunch combos during the week and the hummus is a must with every meal eaten here. 

This is a great spot to grab a quick delicious and cheap meal whether it's lunch or dinner time!"}
{"text":"Food is authentic, fresh and delicious! Every time I visit Charlotte I eat here. The service is good.  This is an extremely casual place so come with that mindset and enjoy great food!"}
{"text":"Jasmine grill has the best Mediterranean food in charlotte. Especially the hummus. Really recommend this place. They just need to work on the service."}
{"text":"Simply awesome. Brilliant food, great prices. Hospitality is great. Servers are very nice too"}
{"text":"I love Shwarma so found this place on yelp while traveling to Charlotte. I was not disappointed. Very friendly service. Great authentic Mediterranean food. 
Will try visiting again in our short trip here."}
{"text":"Jasmine Grill is unsuspecting but delicious. The kabobs are a great and you can't go wrong with any side options, though we always opt for hummus, babba ganoush, yellow rice and fatoush. The prices are also great.  You can eat a tasty meal under $20!"}
{"text":"They're near my office and I get lunch there maybe once or twice a month. Always delicious. Always quick--whether we dine in or pick up. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Hummus was awesome, portions were good. The Pita bread is good but not cooked in-house (I saw him take it out of a package) and that's pretty disappointing. The Lamb meat was pretty dry but very good flavor. I made the mistake of ordering fries as a side, and they were terrible. It also took longer than expected to get our food (carry out). I'll probably give this another chance but not super impressed.

I wish I could give it 3.5 stars instead of 3, but when I read my own review, it deserves a 3, not a 4."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to write this review to brag on the food! Delicious and refreshing all around!

My husband and I had a late lunch ( 3:30 )
And we both had the Beef & Lamb Shwarma which was tender and very flavorful! I had the Jasmine house drink which was a mixture of fruits and very light and yummy!

Service was a little slow due to the small staff but they were very courteous and warm from greeting to goodbyes :-)"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best places to eat for someone who likes Mediterranean food.
Very authentic, right down to the friendly staff.
The lamb chops weren't  good, they were perfect! And very reasonably priced.
Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The chicken kebab, hummus and grape leaves were amazingly delicious! Will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Went the first time a few months ago. It was decent. Decided to go back with some family who came to visit. It was beyond delicious. The server was so attentive. I ordered the chicken sharwama. So good. Yum. 

Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because they added a 18% tip since it was 8 person group. I usually tip 20% or more. I used to be a server. I didn't know it was added so I tipped 23 dollars and I was charged 21 dollars already. That pissed me off when I realized this later in the evening. I was going to call about it but I let it go. Anyway the price was decent 117 minus the two tips added. 

For 8 people it was good. My chicken sharwama was 6.99. Mango juice was fresh but it was tasteless. I guess I'm used to sweet juice. I'll def go back might even go back today but I'll  just have to keep a close eye on my receipt next time. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Was staying a night in Charlotte for work and didn't want to go eat somewhere so I looked up tasty food I could take out. Found this place, got some chicken kebab, and devoured it. Super good. A ton of food for the price, too. 

Git some."}
{"text":"Jasmine Grill was one of my favorite places to eat for lunch.  I ordered the Beef and Lamb Schwarma plate.  YUM.  *Licks Lips*

Tip:  Get there early or call your order in early.  It gets busy very quickly."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my brother and the food was really good. Waiter was very nice and helped us order.. pretty good crowd in here"}
{"text":"Amazing place. You can see the people making the food, and they hustle! Servers are all very nice! My favorite food is the chicken kabob, with yellow rice. Hummus is amazing with the pita bread! Would highly recommend it! Expect to pay between 15-25$"}
{"text":"Great food at great prices.  So glad that I found this place a few months ago.  My goto whenever I need my shawarma fix."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is by far the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. Visiting from California and found this place on yelp. Wish we had one back home. The Falafel and humus were some of the best ever. But by far the best part of our dining experience was our server whom I have to to say had some of the best customer service and attention to detail skills EVER. Enthusiasm out the roof! have eaten at a lot of restaurants in my 46 years on this earth and this little mom and pop owned jem treats their customers like they're eating at a five star restaurant. Way to go!!!"}
{"text":"So happy we finally got to try this place. The service was quick and the food was fantastic (also extremely affordable). I only gave it four stars because the waitresses' were just sitting at a table chit chatting and that was a bit odd. However, we will definitely be back for the food!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken Schwarma wrap. Authentic, delicious! Next time I will go for the buffet!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Good food & great service! The lamb chop here doesn't have that smell like other places! Which is a plus! They marinated it well!"}
{"text":"First time here and I learned about this gem on YELP.  Let me just say that THIS is the BEST restaurant that I have been to since I started all this yelping!  It's not about the sparse atmosphere, it is all about the food and all the flavors.  My taste buds felt like they went to a party on steroids!  First started with the Fatuch salad, which I cannot even describe other than it had a light lemony dressing on it and was topped with fried pita chips.  Then I had the chicken kabob with hummus, instead of the rice.  Again, I cannot even describe all the flavors in either the chicken or the hummus.  The hummus was whipped up like potatoes, kinda.  The whole time I was eating, I was squealing with culinary delight.  I almost never order dessert, but just had to try what the next table over was eating.   It is called KNAFEH.   Apparently it is a dessert found in Palenstine.  If for no other reason you go to this restaurant, go for this dessert.   There just aren't words.   For a few moments, we felt as if we had left Charlotte for either a Middle Eastern country or maybe NYC.  We'll be talking about this experience for many moons.   I may not brush my teeth tonight because I want to keep the flavors in my mouth.   Double wow."}
{"text":"My son liked this place so much that he wrote his first review 
----

Before I went to the restaurant, I thought that this restaurant would be okay, but now, I realized that it is so much more.  

My first like was the service. The waitress was really nice, and quickly attended our wants.  I liked the lamb chops. I also liked the baklava.  It was my first time having it, but it was so good that I ordered 12 pieces to take with me!

I really like this restaurant, and wish more people come here to eat."}
{"text":"So we tried this place totally based on ratings and it did not disappoint at all. Very friendly staff. We loved being there and it was such an inviting place that if I have an urge to eat Mediterranean food, this place is going to be on top of my list!

Coming to food, everything was delicious to say the least. We tried Baba Ganoush for the first time and realized what a wonder a magical set of hands can do to egg plants. Hummus, chicken shawarma, shawarma wrap, falafel- everything delicious and honest to their origin.

Finished with Baklava and it was the freshest and the most delicious set of 3 pieces I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Jasmine Grill has the best Mediterranean food. Their combos with rice are really good and the hummus is delicious!  They give you a lot of food so we didn't try any appetizers but can't wait to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is simply great! A wonderful family run establishment greets you with warmth and hospitality. I had a question about the lamb shank and the cooking process was explained from start to finish, greatly appetizing me and confirmed my order. The dish was as picturesque as those seen here.  The meat just fell off the bone, making each bite succulent and FULL of pure lamb goodness. The dish is served with a beef soup which will bring you back to that warm goodness Mama served up in childhood. 

I highly recommend you stop by for a meal, you will find a bit of life's more pleasurable moments here."}
{"text":"If u love Mediterranean, this place could be one of ur favorites. Their version of lamb shank was delicious. Fries and pita with hummus was good too!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow but the food was great! I especially love the garlic sauce that comes with the chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"We rushed to the Jasmine Grill for a fast lunch on a break during a one day conference on a Saturday. The restaurant wasn't crowded, and we were able to communicate our time constraint with the waitress. She was quick about taking our order and asked the cooks what items could be prepared quickly. These are the best falafels I've eaten. Better than any I had in the Middle East. They were green on the inside. Spinach? They were fresh, crispy on the outside, and tastey. I do like pitas but most places don't have special pitas. I asked about Jasmine Grill's pitas. The waitress said that they make the batter for their pitas. I would have to believe her, but they were taking pitas out of a bag. These weren't special like the falafels and humus, I'm sorry to report. There really isn't much by way of atmosphere, but the food is good and the staff we met were open and kind. Humus was plentiful, fresh, and tasted great. I liked the spices they sprinkle on, and I appreciated that they make a neat, line decoration with the spices rather than spreading them all over the humus. The waitress kindly offered us a to-go cup. Thank you, Yelp, for the helpful reviews that I read in choosing this restaurant, and thank you Jasmine Grill for a great, fast lunch!"}
{"text":"I go to this place during lunch a lot and they are very friendly and have great deals!  This place has a great chicken kebab with white rice. The white garlic sauce that come with it is some of the best sauce that I have ever had.  

They also have great hummus and soup too.  

I recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Everything was really good. Services is so friendly. The kebob, humus and falafel worth trying. We'll surely come back."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a older strip mill off South Blvd is Jasmine Grill, Don't let the look of the place fool you..The food is delicious. Just a few tables and the grill. But delicious Mediterranean food. We ordered the sample platter for an appetizer. It had Hummus ( creamy and good ) Baba Ganooch ( smokyand good ) Two falafel and two Stuffed grape leaves. Really a good amount. Served with a basket of Pita Bread. Then all three of us got the Fatoush Salad with Chicken Schwarma. Great chopped up salad covered with big chunks of white chicken that was dipped in spices and grilled...tender and juicy. I wish I would have had room left for some Baklava but I was stuffed! But I will get it next time. Really a great little place ! Service was very nice also and quick!"}
{"text":"Wow! I had the chicken shawarma wrap and it was amazing, maybe the best I've had anywhere, and so inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Jasmine Grill for about 2 years now. Its right down the street form my house and really easy for me to pick up if we don't feel like cooking. I'm slightly apprehensive about writing a review so that others don't go there and make me wait for a table. But, the food is so freaking amazing and the people there are the nicest and super accommodating that the world needs to know and they deserve all the business. I've eaten Halal food many many times and in some of the top places in North America where there are large Middle Eastern populations (NYC and Toronto mainly). From everywhere between the street carts on the corner of 53rd st(those \"guys\") to fine dinning establishments drinking Arak cocktails. And, with out a doubt, Jasmine Grill has consistently been the best halal/ME food I've eaten to date. Tip: You must get the hummus and baba ganoush, both are some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Love this place. The prices are great and the food is delicious. I got the falafel wrap and omg its one of the best that I have had.. It was sooo good. It comes with fries. It's hard to find a good falafel place but I def found my favorite spot in Charlotte. They are very clean as I watched him make my wrap and he made sure to change his gloves multiple times between different meals. The servers are great and friendly too."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the lamb. They were crowded but two waiters were able to handle things and keep it moving"}
{"text":"Thank you for excellent customer service and excellent food!!!! I left with a smile on my face and a doggie bag LOL"}
{"text":"After reading all reviews decided to try this place, we drew all the way from South Carolina. We tried chicken and beef kababs it was so good, very well seasoned and prepared, there ayran (yogurt drink) is so delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite lunch spots. The food is excellent! Including tip, you can get a substantial lunch for $9. 

My only complaint is that they're in no rush; once the food comes out it's hard to get the server to bring checks and even harder to get them to charge credit cards. Keep this in mind if you're on a tight schedule."}
{"text":"Worst Sanitation and never going back!


The chef cleaned his running nose with his right glove and prepared my order without changing the glove.I lost my appetite and trashed my order.

On the top of that, I waited for 50 minutes to pick up the MUCUS special falafel wrap."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and got a chicken schwarma sandwich and fatoush salad. Both were exceptionally delicious, five stars all the way. If you like Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food you'll love this place. 

Very fresh ingredients, delicious recipes, and very nice owners."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences ever. Was served cold lamb shank and soup. Was served water 20 mins after taking the seat."}
{"text":"Well, yeah. This really is that good. Unexpected to find a great shawarma here in Charlotte (this isn't Dearborn, ya know) and a terrific hummus that was the right consistency.

They were very, very slammed towards the end of the lunch rush with several tables needing cleaning and a long wait for ordering and then getting the check. Success is a good thing for a business, but maybe another wait-person would help?

Large portion of hummus to start, with a basket of warmed pitas. Not too much longer, a big plate of the mixed lamb and beef with hot yellow rice that was light and fluffy and very nicely done. I managed to clear the entire plate. Yum!

Service needs improvement, but the food makes it worth it."}
{"text":"My second visit here for Saturday lunch and this place never stops to amaze and flatter me with its variety of food...ordered falafel apps with two chicken kabob platters, one with white rice and baba Ghanoush and other with yellow rice and hummus. Everything was prepared to perfection and tasted really really GOOD ! My fav was the Chicken Kabob, which were well marinated and cooked. 
For a party of two, I'd say we had enough left by the end that we managed to take out and have the rest for our lunch the next day. All under $30 :D"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best middle eastern food I have ever had. It's location is not the best. But over all food was great and the service was kinda wierd. Not the best service not sure if it's because we came at a rush hour but still great food!"}
{"text":"Second visit to this great little spot. Friendly, attentive service. Delicious food. Reasonably priced. Especially love the baba ganoush and natural strawberry juice."}
{"text":"I just moved here from California, and this is seriously one of the best kabob plates I've ever had!! The baba ghanough is ON POINT. Highly recommend getting that as one of your sides!"}
{"text":"I had my first experience today at Jasmine Grill. My friend had raved about it for months, and happily agreed to meet me there for lunch. It was quite busy at 12:30 today but they quickly wiped off a table and sat us down. The waitress gave us menus and told us about their amazing $6.99 lunch special....lentil soup with a salad and then either chicken shawarma or chicken kabobs with their yummy rice. (I added the yummy part). We both went for the lunch special, but I substituted fries for the salad since me and most vegetables don't get along. The meal did not disappoint! The lentil soup was flavorful. The chicken was probably the tastiest chicken I've ever eaten. The rice was delicious. My fries were alright, but I'm not judging a mediterranean restaurant on their fries. Overall the meal was amazing and I'm thrilled my new townhouse is less than 2 miles from there.

Oh, and the staff there is awesome. The waitress seemed to genuinely hope that I enjoyed my meal since it was my first time. They didn't rush us at all even though it was busy. I will definitely be going back there soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff. Their falafel, chicken kebob, hummus and baklava were excellent. 

I would have given them a four star if they served everything that was on their menu. On a Friday afternoon they were not serving chicken shawarma and being a turkish restaurant I expected them to serve that at all times. On another occasion they were running out of chicken and veggie pies."}
{"text":"A hidden gem not to be missed!! The food was so flavorful, delicious, and presented beautifully. The staff was welcoming and gracious. Loved the yellow rice, hummus, and falafel, and chicken schwarma!!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I found this little gem on Yelp. So glad we decided to come here because the food was amazing! Everything was perfect, including the sweet tea. I had the baked pies and hummus plate. Never had hummus before but the one here is really good. Too bad we don't live in the area, but will definitely come by again when we come to Charlotte."}
{"text":"We were in town after a South coast trip, and found this place on Yelp. We love Middle Eastern food in Colorado, and decided to try it. We are so glad we did! The waiter was so friendly and helpful (he even had pictures on his I-pad to show items we weren't sure about! ) We ordered a vegetarian appetizer (like a meal), and the lamb and beef mixed dinner with yellow rice. It was so fresh and delicious. If I had one criticism, I would say the falafal was a bit greasy, but still delicious! The homemade pita was a bit thin and crispy, a wonderful change from the pita we are used to! I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was our first eat in @ JG. Food outstanding and their customers were as diverse as the food.
Felt like they were tasting moments from their childhood - You must eat here and commune with the folks who share this planet with you and when you take a bite of food and your eyes roll back in your head you'll get the picture. It's not about race, religion - it's about sitting down and enjoying a meal with family."}
{"text":"Tasty and quality food for a low price.. This is one of my fav place for lunch. 
Quality is as good as home cook food and lentil soup is a bonus!  I recommend everyone to go eat at this place. I am sure this will be added to your routine lunch list.."}
{"text":"This is place is a little hidden gem. I had the house salad which was delicious and fresh and the chicken, beef, and steak Kabobs. They included hummus as one of the sides but the pitas weren't warm and the portion of hummus was very small. All in all the food was good. I would consider coming back."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food! Nice little spot for lunch and super affordable. I had chicken shawarma that came with lentil soup and salad for $6.99."}
{"text":"So let's just say, I went on a Friday, went back on Monday for lunch and then picked up takeout Monday evening.  Both the chicken and lamb are so tender.  The baba ganouch is a delicious, smokey treat.  Even the lentil soup was very flavorful.  The baklava comes from their sister bakery, the Golden Bakery (also worth a stop - try the laham ajeen). Go, but not too often.  I need my"}
{"text":"Based on other Yelp recommendations, I ventured away from my hotel to try Jasmine Grill. Definitely, not disappointed. Their rice is very flavorful as well as the Shawarma. Hummus delicious, fresh pita. Will be back on my next travel to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love the place and the service. I call in to place my order before I reach and this reduces my wait time. Rates are affordable. Will recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a great hole-in the wall find!

If you enjoy authentic med fare, they do not disappoint!

We had the super family combo that feeds 6 people and comes w/yellow rice, beef, chicken, and lamb kabobs (we got the lamb chops, which has an upcharge to make sub) and an app of ur choice. Our waiter, who was a sweetheart, let us  split to get the baba-g and hummus. I was not crazy about the flavor of the chicken (but the rest of fam loved it), but that was not a problem since the beef and lamb were incredibly juicy, flavorful, and plentiful. I also had the \"jasmine drink\", which was a delish fruit smoothie-ish drink. 

We also had the pistachio baklava and we discovered the Palestinian dessert knfa, which is just indescribably good! We had the coffee as well, and while very good w/the hint of cinnamon, it was not as strong as I would have liked and the little cup was almost half grounds. So, hoping that was a one off.

All in all a great experience. Though, be prepared for slow service, which is more a cultural thing than an issue of the quality of said service."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and we got the mixed grill plate with salad and baba ganoush and a chicken kebab plate with yellow rice and hummus. We also ordered the jasmine and guava fruit drink. For a little dessert we ordered the baklava. Everything was great!! The guava drink has seeds in it which wasn't the best part."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a buffet!  From appetizers to dessert you want to try it all. Every staff member I saw had a smile and made me feel welcome.  Food was fresh, hot and delicious.  A definite go back place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a great dinner tonight.  I had the grape leaves for the appetizer. Very flavorful and fresh, I followed that with the tabouli salad. Nice and cold, crisp and fresh. The main dish was the Lamb Shank. Nice size portion, very tender, great taste accompanied by rice and vegetables. All in all it was a very enjoyable dinner. It was my first time here and it came at the suggestion of Yelp due to the amount of favorable reviews. 

Thank you Jasmine Grill for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious take out! My friends and I had the beef/shawarma platters and hummus and we all loved it!"}
{"text":"I have had Jasmine Grill bookmarked for awhile and completely forgot about this gem until I read an Agenda article about Jasmine Grill. When I walked in, I thought it was a fast casual place where you order at the counter, you sit at a table, and they bring you your food. But we were stopped halfway to the counter and told to go ahead and sit anywhere. My only complaint was the service was very slow as far as placing the order and getting our bill. The food came out quick once a server came by to take our order. I would come here again for their lunch special, but only do take-out. You really can't beat the $6.99 lunch special which consists of chicken kebabs, yellow rice (can sub for white rice), greek salad, and lentil soup. You can upgrade and get the kofta lunch special for only $7.99."}
{"text":"My brother told me about this place. I would have never guessed it was this good. It's a nice spot to drop in for a quick lunch, dinner or take out order. So far everything we tried is great. I love that this isn't a corporate owned restaurant. Supporting the small, local business owner is a plus."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a late lunch here today, our first visit to this \"Mediterranean\" restaurant on South Boulevard. We found the our waiter to be most courteous and friendly, and very knowledgable about each item on the menu (adequate without being lengthy). The restaurant is fairly small, though pleasant, with bright colors and wooden chairs and tables. The noise level was a bit too much, thanks to the loud exhaust fan over the cooking area (at the rear of the room, open to the customers). This made normal conversation a little tough for us 60+ yr olds. 
The salads were fresh, with pita chips and a simple but delicious oil & vinegar dressing. I had the lamb kabob, with hummus on the side, while my wife had a falafel wrap. A basket of warm pita bread arrived with our entrees--terrific, especially with the hummus. My lamb was perfectly marinated, though over-cooked, I thought (I like mine rare or at most, medium rare). Nonetheless, absolutely delicious, with peppers and onions;  the accompanying yogurt & cucumber dipping sauce--not tzatziki, but actually better!--was the perfect complement to the kabob, helping me forget the lamb's lengthy stay on the heat.
My wife spoke very little during the meal, a sign that she was busy enjoying her food too much to converse. I'll let her review her meal herself...
Wonderful iced tea...period. I am a Southerner through and through, and appreciate fine iced tea: they have it at Jasmine. Had the lamb not been too done, I would have given 5 stars.
No time for dessert. We will be back."}
{"text":"Easy to overlook this place driving down South Blvd with a lot of other business and restaurants that flank the hussle and bustle of the street.

I have to admit, the lunch meal started with the intention of going to Crispy Bahn Mi across the street... but the small detail of the bread shipment not making it in that morning caused us to wander across the street and try Jasmine Grill out.

Totally a fan.  Their hummus was delicious (as well as beautifully plated).  I had the beef and lamb shwarma, which I inhaled.  Each entree had 2 sides included (even though I searched high and low on the menu to see how many sides you were allowed).  Baba ganoush and white rice where my sides of choice.  The menu is not too big... so you won't get overwhelmed and the staff are super friendly.  A couple of us had questions due to dietary restrictions, but our waiter answered everything in a friendly and calm manner.

It was Saturday so there were a lot of folks in the dining room, but the food still came out super quick (in my opinion).  Some of my friends tried their wrap options and fries.  Next time I make it out here... I will have to try their falaffel.  They totally lived up to their 4.5 star rating on Yelp.  :)"}
{"text":"Jasmine Grill is a fantastic casual Middle Eastern food joint with extremely reasonable prices.

We started with hummus, labneh, and baba ganoush. The first two were excellent, and the baba ganoush is the best I've ever had. Smooth, tangy, and smoky, it was a real treat. For less than $5, they are pretty as hell too!

We also tried their baked pies - four for $4. We wanted to try their entire variety but they were out of beef so we had two cheese, a spinach, and I believe a chicken (it had some heavily flavored filling and was my favorite of the lot).

For my entree I got the mixed grill kebob - chicken, beef, and lamb. All grilled expertly, tender, and well-seasoned. I got it over yellow rice that was just as flavorful as everything else. My wife got the chicken kebob over yellow rice and it was more of the same, and just as good.

For getting two starters (hummus and baked pies, the baba ganoush and labneh were one of the two sides that came with our mains along with yellow rice) and two entrees, of which the mixed grill is the most expensive thing on the menu at $15, and two drinks, our total came to less than $40. You can't beat that with a stick.

Service was great, and they have a really slick iPad-based ordering system. Food came out fast and we were never waiting long. I've finally found my Middle Eastern mainstay. Next time, desserts!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is located in a strip mall and is kind of hard to see from the road.  But upon entering you feel a warm happy vibe accompanied with the smell of fresh food and spices. We ordered a chicken shawarma along with a beef and lamb shawarma. Our sides were hummus and yellow rice. The hummus was super fire and made up for the meat being a lil on the dry side. Would definitely go back and grub scene there again. Jah feel."}
{"text":"Loud distracting middle eastern music filled the tiny dining area in this dive like establishment . Ordered lamb kabab and it was nothing to write home about . It does have one redeeming quality  - Super relaxing massage is just two doors down !!! Hence the three stars."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to my hotel and received hummus with no pita and no utensils. On the bright side food is good."}
{"text":"Came in before the dinner rush. It was my first time here so I walked toward the chef area and was told to seat wherever I would like. Not being familiar with mediterranean cuisine, a patron and server informed me of some of the dishes. I ordered hummus, meat pies, chicken/lamb swarma, baba ganush(?), and a salad. The salad had some sort of vinegarette dressing, cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes. Very crisp and fresh. The hummus was great as was the rest of the meal. Service was a little slow as there was only two servers for 14 tables and to go orders. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"New restaurant.  Nice interior and small patio outside.  Home made pita bread is fabulous!  There are several vegetarian options on the menu here.  I had the falafel sandwich which was very tasty.  Great service here.  They are very friendly.  The food presentation was good, too.  This restaurant is in a small brick strip mall off South Blvd. near Seneca Pl. in the Madison Park area.  It's a little tough to spot from the road, but well worth going to once you find it."}
{"text":"How have I lived 5 minutes from this gem without knowing it!? The food here was ah-mazing! And super cheap. I am still full from last night's dinner. 

Unfortunately they lost a star on the front end. No one was there to greet us and we were worried we had somehow walked into a closed restaurant. We stood near a table for like 5 minutes in a completely empty restaurant debating leaving or sitting down. Eventually someone came out to seat us and sat us at a super sticky table. Not a huge deal I guess but first impression was not great.

What was great was everything that came after. I ordered the chicken kebob with hummus and fattoush as the sides. I was super excited that I was able to pick 2 sides instead of 1 side and rice. I am not huge on rice.

They brought the hummus out first with freshly made bread. Both were yummy and it was possibly the best hummus presentation I have ever seen. It was so lovely and I was pretty much full after eating it with the bread. 

The chicken kebob was super tender and well seasoned. I shared some and ate the rest and left the restaurant completely stuffed (the fattoush came home with me so I could have an easy lunch today). 

All this deliciousness? Only $8. You heard me right. $8 for a delicious somewhat healthy meal where we both left completely full. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is seriously some of the best mediterranean food i've had in a long time. the hummus was the perfect consistency and the tabbouleh was so fresh and green. the pita is wafer thin, perfect for spreading your hummus on. I had the beef and lamb shawarma plate, it was only $11 and it was a huge plate of food. the meat was so tender and full of flavor, and they give you this amazing sweet garlic mash that pairs perfectly with any dish. sadly I didn't take a picture because I was too excited to eat! My partner got chicken kebab that was charred perfectly, seasoned beautifully and the chicken was so tender and delicious. I can't believe the fantastic customer service we received either. the waiter , Amine, was so sweet and happy to help us, answered all of the menu questions that we had. he was amazing and we can't wait to come back. I am so happy with this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy with great prices and fast, friendly service. We had the hummus plate, a falafel wrap, a salad with cucumber, tomatoes, lettuce, parsley, lemon & olive oil, lentil soup, and chicken shawarma. Everything was delicious. Small but cute and cozy atmosphere. You would never expect to find this little gem in a strip mall in this part of town but it really is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Delicious and consistently good. All the vegetarian fare is top notch, but it was the chicken that surprised me. Maybe my favorite chicken in town. Service can be fast or slower, but they are always nice. Either way it's always fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"Really glad I stumbled upon Jasmine Grill. They have the best chicken shwarma in the town. If you love mideastern food you should definitely visit this place."}
{"text":"We do love the food from Jasmine Grill, but getting the food is tough!  We've stopped trying to go to the restaurant itself as that isn't a viable lunch option for a myriad of reasons so we now use food delivery services so we can at least get the food in some capacity.  Now the issue we have is that the containers they select for take out orders are horrible!  They don't seal in any way!  They allow leaks and spills so when the food delivery person arrives, we get a bag swimming in oil and salad dressing and every item inside the bag is oily and wet  :-(    (sigh)  So we have to clean each and every container, bag of bread, and cutlery thoroughly before we can distribute the containers or it gets everyone's desk and clothes oily.  WHY MUST THIS BE SO DIFFICULT?!?"}
{"text":"Had the Baba Ganoush, hummus, stuffed grape leaves, and cucumbers in yogurt. All were excellent. It was my first time at this restaurant and I'm going back today."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place. I'm visiting the Charlotte area and found this place using Yelp. Great food and dessert. 

I ordered my chicken shawarma on the Yelp app and picked it up within minutes of me ordering. I took it back to my hotel to eat and loved every bite. 

If I return to the area anytime soon, I hope to get another chance to eat here."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  I know Mediterranean food well, and this is as good as it gets.  It's the real deal, and always tastes home cooked.  Generous portions, and friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Great spot for quick friendly service! The server was very knowledgeable about vegan options and even brought out a free dish of beautiful, flavorful, pickled veggies! The Baba Ganoush was perfect and the Falafels were crisp without being overdone. We were very happy with portions, presentation and value. We will definitely come back when in this part of town."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip to Charlotte and being a big fan of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food I wanted to seek out a restaurant of that type. 

I made my way to Jasmine Grill and ended up having the kabob platter which consisted of kefta, chicken and beef. The marinated beef was probably the best I'd ever tasted. I ordered my platter with jasmine rice which was fantastic. All of the meats were cooked well and seasoned perfectly. The kefta was a little over done but still very good. 

I was a big fan of their hot sauce and the garlic paste. Their garlic paste was probably the best I'd ever had. It was not over powering at all. It was a perfect compliment.

The service was attentive and accommodating, I would definitely return if I make my way back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was not at all. They had one server, and one guy who I am not sure if he was the manager or a server waiting on tables as well. With a ton of togo orders and an almost full restaurant it was not enough to handle the crowd. The togo orders seemed to take priority. We didn't have drink refills for most of the meal and it took 20 minutes for the veggie platter to come out. They were out of the grape leaves so it was just hummus, baba ganoush and falafel. 

However, I really enjoyed the food! The hummus was great, and I loved the lightly dressed fatoush salad. My boyfriend got lamb and beef schwarma and I got beef kabobs. Both were huge portions and the meat was well seasoned although not very warm. I loved the sauces that it came with. They have some great lunch specials too. 

Heard from others after the fact that the service is always like that but the food is always great. Will go back again, maybe get takeout, or just expect to be there awhile!"}
{"text":"I have been in this location before, but it has been a number of years - and it was another business back then, so perhaps that is why it took me so long to get back to check it out again. So finally we took the drive and visited around dinner, and were warmly welcomed, Luckily, we made it just before the floodgates opened - literally. Just after we placed our order, about thirty people (who I do not believe were together) came in, and every single table was full, along with a few others standing and waiting, not to mention those who came only to pick up to-go orders. Talk about timing. I should have bought a lottery ticket.

It seems that the Mediterranean food spots have the dishes where they shine, and Jasmine is not unique in that regard. While Kabab Je may have the best baba ghanoush (baba ghannouj, moutabal, etc) around, Jasmine is where you should go to get the best hummus. Even better, their kebob plates come with two sides (rice does count as a side, however), where at Kabab Je, you get rice, but if you want a side, you have to order them extra if you want them.

Still, definitely worth a visit, just make sure you are at the beginning of the line or you could be waiting for a while."}
{"text":"Great food here! I keep coming back mainly for the lamb, hummus, and baba ganoush. Free pita on the side is just gravy.

I say that because the food is great and want them to stay open. They have a bit of an identity crisis, whether it's a true sit-down dining experience type restaurant. OR if it should be a great place to walk-in with gym clothes on, past all the seated diners, and take out pre-ordered food. Depending on the night, the place can get busy with both diners eating in and take out, the service can be slow and intermittent with only one person as the server and cashier. So we try to go on random week nights to avoid it.

Did I say the food was pretty good?! Because it is."}
{"text":"We had the veggie sampler and the lamb chops.   Everything was delicious.   The spices were perfect.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I definitely wouldn't have stopped here if it weren't for Yelp. I even had it bookmarked on Yelp and drove past it 2-3 times before realizing \"hey, that's the Jasmine Grill I've been looking to try\". Well, I finally got to try it today for lunch, and I'm really happy I did.
The food was great! My group split a hummus plate and some falafel, and both were excellent. I ordered a chicken kebob with yellow rice, and it was super flavorful and a very large portion. The house salad was a bit..odd I guess would be the right word with all the spices. It wasn't bad, just very different than expected. Also, the lemon garlic sauce that comes with each plate is fantastic!
The service was a bit slow, especially for lunch time, but the food quality, portion size, and price all make up for that easily. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been working in Charlotte for over ten years now and have driven by the Jasmine Grill for as many years.  When I picked up some show banners today at American Signs, my friend Chris highly recommended it.  

I choose their chicken kabob special, which came with a salad and soup.  I have to tell you that was one of the best seasoned salads I have ever had.  It's a simple olive oil and lemon based dressing, when you try it you'll know what I mean.  

The chicken kabob was very tender and again the seasoning used makes it stand out.  Served on a bed of onions and green peppers with a supersized serving of rice.

I will definitely make this one of my new favorite places to eat on South Blvd.

Note:  It is a little tough to find.  When I drove into the parking area I noticed Toppers and Baby USA but glanced right by the Jasmine Grill sign."}
{"text":"Best greek food I ever ate.
They have juices made from natural juices. And they are amazing.
I tried the tilapia with garlic sauce , cheese sticks, hummus and salad.
Couldn't get enough, so I came back next day with my co-workers for more."}
{"text":"Great experience here! I visited for the first time for lunch on yesterday (Sunday), and enjoyed it so much that I also returned for lunch again today!  I will speak about both visits.

On my first visit there on yesterday, I had the mixed Kebab grill, and they kindly substituted lamb instead of beef (I also got the shrimp and chicken).  With this, my 2 sides were yellow rice and hummus.  Having used the Yelp app to check in, I also received a free drink offer, and was able to take advantage of that.  Lastly, I decided to also order their falafel appetizer.  Everything was great and very flavorful.  The price was exceptional.  I was thoroughly pleased and quickly realized that this place would be added to my rotation of yummy places to eat.

However I didn't know that I would be returning so soon!  I went there for lunch today with a co-worker.  We enjoyed the special for $6.99 (we chose the chicken Kebab with yellow rice, and that comes with salad and lentil soup).  Terrific deal...I appreciate that they don't skimp on the portion size though the price of this deal is amazing.  Like my experience on yesterday, today's visit did not disappoint either.  I thought (especially after reading the reviews) that it may be packed during the lunch hour, but thankfully (today, at least,) that was not the case at all.  

Very satisfied with my experiences with Jasmine Grill... I will return again."}
{"text":"Really the best homemade \"pita\" in CLT. Not like your everyday pita- soft, a little spongy and delicious! Very addicting and goes great with the devine hummas and baba ganoush."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific.

Had lamb and chicken shawarma plate with a aside of baba ghanoush. Plus house salad.
Everything was fresh, flavorful and delicious.

Everybody's is super nice too !!!"}
{"text":"If you live in Charlotte and are in the mood for some tasty Middle Eastern food, you need to come here! My husband and I went there this past weekend and got the chicken schwarma and beef/lamb schwarma. It was fresh off the spinner and it was awesome! We asked about where the chef/owners were from and our waitor told us they are from Syria and Jordan.....I loved looking around and seeing a variety of different people and cultures all enjoying the food. The place was packed! We will most definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Great Food! They lose stars with their service.  Very disorganized and slow.  There is often long waits for the food at lunch. Twice I have been and seen people leave.  But if you have the time and patience the food is well worth it.  I live in university and drive here when I have a Mediterranean craving vs going to an establishment near my house serving the same type food. Have patience and your stomach will be rewarded."}
{"text":"Definitely the best authentic Mediterranean around. We've been several times and it is always good. Very friendly and attentive staff. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Jasmine Grill has reliably good food and everyone that works there is very nice. They do get busy during lunch so the service can be a little bit slow during that time, but they are so friendly and helpful that I don't mind at all.  Good vegan options--hummus is great, grape leaves are good, and the Lentil Soup is amazinggg!  also enjoy the falafel wrap.  Their garlic sauce is also vegan so I like to dip falafel in that!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Jasmine Grill? So much! I lived in Berlin, Germany and love small places like this one and eating Middle Eastern food. The prices vs. Germany are quite high, as they serve to an American crowd,  however, this type of food costs anywhere in Europe three times less. A Sharma sandwich with french fries costs EUR 4.50 (approx. USD 5), here it costs USD 9 plus taxes and tip. BUT!! it is so good and if you as I miss the Middle Eastern food from Europe or even from NY, you will come here often. And another fantastic thing is that the staff is incredibly! incredibly!! friendly. I always have almost tears in my eyes how kind and attentive they are. No matter if they are busy or not. 
The place has plenty of parking upfront, it has approx. 15 tables and plenty of space for large groups. It is usually very busy on the weekends, but the waiting time is totally fine.
The problem for many people who drive by is that it is not quite visible from the street as this place is located a bit lower than the street. 
The owner cooks often and is quite involved in business and talking to guests personally, which is very nice. 
I gave it five stars because it is a wonderful place with good tasting food and I understand that I cannot compare the prices with European prices, but it would surely make me stop by more often if I can just grab a Sharma sandwich to go for much less.
Thanks for being in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Had the beef and lamb shawarma plate with hummus and salad. Everything was fantastic. Will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place was yummy!! Hummus and baba ghanoush were outstanding. The pickled turnips they bring you were very interesting but very good as well. We had the beef, chicken and lamb kebabs. Chicken was super moist and perfectly seasoned. The lamb and beef were ok, but it's more of a personal preference that I didn't enjoy them as much , nothing they did wrong. This was our first time there and definitely won't be the last."}
{"text":"It's difficult to find good ethnic food on Charlotte.  Jasmine Grill was a nice treat. The chicken, kefta, and shrimp were fabulous. The rice, tabouli, hummus, and salad were incredibly salty side but otherwise a good meal!

Update...woke up with my face so swollen from excessive the salt :(. Won't be going back.  What a shame, I was so excited to have a place for middle eastern food."}
{"text":"The quintessential three-star restaurant, IMO.

LG placed a carryout order for us and we went to pick it up in about 15 minutes, but was disappointed that it took some time even when we got there.  Such a lag - I was chocolate-wasted and in need of some grub.  If you plan on carrying out or something, giving them ample time to prepare the food is your friend (and worst enemy... I want to eat NOW).

We ordered a bunch of dishes, and frankly, I don't remember all of them.  I just remember that the lamb was juicy and tasty.  The chicken was equally good.  They were dishes with rice and choice of protein... it wasn't terribly memorable, but served its purpose.  

Owners are nice and attentive.  Despite me sprawled out across the chairs and looking demonstrably bored (bc of waiting for food), they offered me some water and acknowledged me saying that the food was almost ready.  

So, while solid, not entirely inspiring.  If anyone can recommend a good quick spot to hit up for some Middle Eastern grub, hollatchaboi.

dmo out."}
{"text":"Excellent middle eastern fare and very reasonably priced.  Place is a little small but it was packed as well.  Would definitely Italy recommend as the falafel wrap was awesome!"}
{"text":"Jasmine grill is certainly a hidden gem in Charlotte. I've been here a couple of times and the staff are so friendly and warm. Typically I'm not a huge fan of hummas, but the hummus here is outstanding! I also have had the chance to try the fried redsnapper, the beef/lamb shawarma and the veggie plate and no better way to top off a meal than with turkish coffee. Nothing about this place has dissapointed me and I absolutely plan on coming back here several times in the future."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I always get the Chicken and rice combo with Jasmine juice. The servers are usually really good. I've gone here a few times now and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Always fresh and always delicious.  Friendly owners. Very nondescript storefront in a strip mall on south boulevard but don't let this deter you. Worth experiencing the food."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken and lamb Kebab... superb tastes and very affordable price.... I found the best near me."}
{"text":"Good thing comes to those who are patient.  Be ready to wait for your food, but it will be delicious. Been here many times. Usually start out with some hummus or laebna(?) And pita bread. Both dips are refreshing. I have tried their roasted chicken, kabobs, schwarma, and lambchops. I get the yellow rice because im Chinese and asians love to eat rice all the time, but also because the rice is yellow and it makes my food pictures a lot more vibrant. The chicken kabob and lamb chops are delicious. The chicken is juicy and flavorful. The lambchops are cooked well with a nice crust on the outside from being grilled over the open fire. Flavors are as bold as the colors. The garlic sauce and the hot sauce they give you is great for dipping as well. I like to dip my meat in both sauces combined. Great little spot."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations, even when I'd seen the great reviews before coming in.  Beef/chicken kabob were awesome, and the baba ganush blew my mind--I didn't even know I liked it until I had it here."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place! My bf and I have been here for at least 5 times. Food is always delicious! We are already looking forward to their Ramadan buffet this year :)"}
{"text":"Wow! What a phenomenal lunch. We got the daily special, chicken kebab and kefta kebab and we thoroughly enjoyed it!  We also got the blackberry juice and the mango juice which was almost like a fruit smoothie. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmm, the Lamb and Shrimp Kabobs were perfectly seasoned and grilled . The garlic and spicy hot pepper sauce to add was the cherry on top of this delicious meal . 

I loved that the order was cooked fresh and seasoned right in front of me, it's tons of food for any appetite so don't get too antsy about the prices, it's worth it . My coworker ordered a side of the falafel and I had one , YUM ! My first falafel experience and I'm a fan .

There is an option to order online , but the site was down when I tried . Try to come at 11 because as we were leaving the business lunch crowd started coming. I think this is definitely a spot to try if you love kabobs , there is something for every palette even vegans ."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Our first visit to Jasmine Cafe was pretty good.  But I'll have I admit, I saw the reviews commenting about the homemade bread, and I think they must have stopped making it in-house, because ours was cold, a bit dry, and pretty tasteless.  

But the other portions of our meal were quite good, including the veggie plate, shrimp kebab, and mixed meat kebabs (chicken, beef, and lamb).  Their rice isn't the standard basmati rice - it's a fragrant and flavorful yellow rice with peas, carrots, and I believe, cardamom.  

I love hummus and theirs is especially good.  They top it with olive oil and spices, which really add to the flavor.  Their baba is a bit chunkier than I've had at other places, and I enjoyed both the texture and flavor.  Their shrimp are large and seasoned really well.  My hubby loved the meat kebabs, and said the chicken was his favorite because it was so juicy.

You CANNOT get a meal here without ordering their cucumber-mint-yogurt dip on the side.  It's like raita, but better.  They make this fresh daily and slice the cucumbers into small chunks.  The flavor is AMAZING, and it really adds to the meal. 

Jasmine isn't in the nicest shopping center, but there's plenty of parking because some of the other businesses have closed.  Despite the bread and location, we'll likely return."}
{"text":"Sort of an odd place when you come in, you set yourself, no one greet you, so you're really not sure what's going on, it takes a few minutes for a waiter to come to your table, the food was taste, the house salad was nice and refreshing and the baba ganoush was some of the best I've ever had and the meats are seasoned very well, I would have gave more stars but the wait staff was a little slow filling drinks back up and coming back to the table and checking on us"}
{"text":"Best lamb chops I've had in a long time. Definitely going back. ............................................................................"}
{"text":"This place Is AMAZING. I lived in NYC before moving to Charlotte and was spoiled with Middle Eastern food. This place is on par with my faves from the city. I recommend the fatush, shwarma or the falafel. And hummus and homemade pita are bomb as well. Also the wait staff was over the top kind. Love that this is so close to my house."}
{"text":"Food is unbelievably good. I love Mediterranean/ Greek cuisine and have eaten at a lot of places but nothing comes close to Jasmine Grill. Turkish coffee and lamb kebabs are highly recommended.

I'd eat everyday if I could... But have to return to NY... I'll be back though, soon"}
{"text":"I am on a layover here in Charlotte and decided to give this place a try.  The food is outstanding, flavorful and a great deal for the price and what you get. I had the lunch special chicken Kabob which came with soup and some kind of salad. It was all delicious. The service was very pleasant also. My server was very attentive, polite and had a great smile. I can't wait to come back! Yum...."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times. The experience is always the same.  Good food, lousy service equals mediocre. I only tolerated the bad service because it's a priced conscious restaurant. I hate to say this but the service falls under the management for not properly training your wait staff. 
Here's the general protocol:

Once a table is seated, the guests must be greeted-acknowledged less than 3 minutes. 

Serve Drinks-ladies always first
Selling -suggestive sell isn't order taking 
Bring bread, plates for appetizers or salad to share and not wait to be asked
Clear dirty appetizer plates for guests before the entrees are brought to the table 
Checked on the guests within 2 minutes after entrees are served 
Refill beverages before guests ask, half empty and not half full, servers!
Maintenance tables, ask if guests would like their food packed and clear table of everything except their drinks
Suggest- homemade desserts 
Bring check & thank your customers!

It's about working smarter not harder in the service industry."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, friendly and welcoming.

The mixed meat Kabob was delicious and really tasty, yellow rice and choice of side - very good value, portion size and all very fresh.

I would recommned this to anyone wanting a tasty experience. Will go back next time in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem! Great food - Wonderful service and a nice change from  the same old thing! Totally recommend this place , the people running it are super sweet!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a cheer competition and wanted to try something new. Oh boy did we get an awesome meal. The Hummus was some of the best I have ever had. All the food that we ordered was full of flavor and cooked great."}
{"text":"Tried this place on the basis of reviews but I am absolutely disappointed! They ran out of falafel at lunch time? I mean seriously? The guy who was serving us was not good either. They took too long to serve and staff was not friendly. I do not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I need to give this place a second try. Comparing it to other Middle Eastern restaurants, it's only okay. I was impressed that this place was being efficiently ran by two men only. One cook, one server and they were able to get everything done during a busy lunch hour. While the guy who was the server wasn't exactly warn and fuzzy, he got my order correct. The food was okay. I had a chicken shwarma (?) sandwich that left me wanting more and needs something with a twang in it. Either a pickle or that plant that's pink that's found in Mediterranean food. Hope I don't sound ignorant. Long story short, it's a decent choice for lunch. I think I need to give it a second try dining in."}
{"text":"It was ok, we got our food to go which may not have been the best idea but we only live 5 minutes away...and it was cold.  The chicken shawarma is a little small, and the fries were very cold not fresh.  The yalangee (stuffed grape leaves) were just ok, they could have been cooked a little more."}
{"text":"Best falafel in the South Park area. Hands down. Will definitely add this to my list of lunch spots. Service was great. Garlic sauce was yummy as were the fries."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Brought my parents here for dinner and it was everything and more! Being from the Bahamas we can be very picky but the food was absolutely amazing!! We enjoyed! And they showed so much compassion to a homeless person. You don't see that. Totally worth 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Outstanding... I eat Mediterranean often in California and this place is out of this world. Meat cook and Seasoned perfect, rice was not dry. Better good service as well. I will repeat."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout. I went I. At the scheduled time and they were finishing up the food. Everything I ordered was delicious. My children are afraid to try new things. I surprised my children with the food and they ate it happily. My wife and I love to try new things and this set the bar for middle eastern food."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Mediterranean restaurant in an unassuming shopping mall. Don't judge the book by its cover!

Small little restaurant where you can order at the counter to go, or dine in and order at the table. The waiter was very friendly and welcoming. You can see the kitchen station from the tables. 

I ordered the Chicken Kebab plate and it came with generous portions of chicken and rice.  You also get to pick a side - so naturally I went for the side salad which was good. Dinner is super affordable here too, coworker and I ordered the same meal and a piece of baklava to share and our bill came out to $25! If anything this place should charge a little more. Great value! 

There are some TVs in the table area - so would be a good spot to come by if you are eating alone. Also, plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Was immediately greeted by staff and sat in a very comfy booth. I appreciate comfortable seating :). I ordered the beef and lamb shawarma with hummus and yellow rice. The server kindly explained a few items to me from the menu that I was not familiar with. The hummus was creamy and delicious, served with spices and oil. My meal came out quickly and it was amazing. A great portion for the price and the meat was so tender and delicious. Thank goodness for immigrants coming to this country and starting amazing businesses! Thanks Jasmine"}
{"text":"Very nice meal, great presentation of dishes. Good food. Service was good. Reasonable prices. Happy to have found it on Yelp while we passed through Charlotte"}
{"text":"Lunch special (chicken kabob over rice, with soup AND salad) was great and at a great price! Small casual environment."}
{"text":"This was my first time going and it is delicious! I got the swarma chicken with yellow rice and it's amazing! They give you large portions! They are also very friendly and it's a cute little place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've yet to try the fresh spit roasted schwarma but the chicken kebob lunch special is the best deal around."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Hummus is amazing. Really stellar salads, and of course chicken is delish"}
{"text":"Food: Amazing! Kababs are delicious and the white sauce it comes with should come with a bowl full. 

Service: Hit or miss. The two waitresses are often found hiding in the hallway on their phone instead of refilling your water. 

Bathrooms: Disgusting. The men's restroom smelled like a urine infested cat little box that had not been emptied in weeks. 

Would I eat here again? Yes. 

Should the manager talk to his waitresses about being on their phones? You bet.

Would I use the restroom? Never. Hold it."}
{"text":"Second time eating at this place and the service was terrible today. The good was a little bit of a disappointment also.... I might not come back."}
{"text":"So I got emailed from Yelp spot light to try this place. We drove @40 miles to try the shawarma and they are out??? Had veggie plater appetizers and kebob plates. I don't know where the rest of these people eat mediterranean who give high ratings for this place but they are nuts. The food was mediocre to blah. The service was good. The price seemed ok. I would not go out of my way again for the food."}
{"text":"This place is great. I walked in sat down and was immediately greeted. I order fatush (salad) for a starter. It was great. I then ordered the mixed grill. It came with kefta, chicken and maybe lamb, I think it was lamb. I can't remember. But with a side of hummus. It was fantastic! I then ordered kefne. It is not on the menu but because of a yelp review I knew. It was amazing and made to order. I recommend this place for sure :)"}
{"text":"The food is quite eatable, decent flavor. I ordered the falafel sandwich and fatoush salad. The service was good, friendly people, quaint establishment. The falafel sandwich was good but not authentic [authentic] I'm spoiled. I Know what a falafel sandwich, is able and supposed to make me feel, this was good, not perfection. Moving on to the fatoush salad, that disappointed me, the flavor wasn't there, and the lettuce was too soggy, at least the fried beet was good. Paw."}
{"text":"Food was just ok, had to wait 20 after my order was suppose to be ready. They also forgot to give me my hummus..... Make sure you check your order!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Falafels are crispy and delicious. No long wait times. Small but a great place to eat good Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Jasmine Grill is FANTASTIC! It has quickly become hubby and I's favorite authentic Mediterranean restaurant in CLT- I grew up eating Lebanese food, and I have to say this is as close as it's come to mom's cooking. Service is great, very friendly staff and prices can't be beat. I can't say enough good things about this place we LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Everything is great - in particular the hummus, lamb shank and shawarma.  I also love their tomato, cucumber and lettuce salad and lentil soup.  A great lunch spot for a delicious meal at a great price."}
{"text":"Wow amazing food! We went on a recommendation from a fellow Yelper and we were not disappointed.  We ordered the veggie delight to start: the babaganoush was fantastic as were the stuffed grape leaves and falafel.  I seriously could've ordered seconds just for the falafel.  For the main course I had the shrimp kebabs and my husband had the chicken, beef and lamb shawarma.  Both dishes were full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  Definitely get the house salad and yellow rice pilaf as sides. The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  This is now my new favorite restaurant and we will return frequently."}
{"text":"Almost empty but....chef out front talking to only other customers while I stand here and wait for a sandwich..nevertheless the food was ok...ordered to go humus was ok, but no extra pita for dipping..thought that would have been a given..it was ok..but for ordering a to go on dinner break, never again."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING Mediterranean food! The prices are excellent and the portions are HUGE! I tried the half grilled chicken today for the first time. It's my new favorite - ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"It was good. Not as good as I had up North but it was ok.  I really liked the Tabouli salad. Not bad, not bad"}
{"text":"My first experience here was great.  But I'm cutting it to 3 stars given the Horrible service that I'm experiencing right now. The restaurant is only 1/4 full, yet I've been waiting forever.  I can't even get my water refilled. I wasn't greeted when I came in so I found a table and sat.  It took a good 10 minutes to even get a menu.  

I ordered the lamb shank. I love Lamb shank. I just don't like this Lamb shank as it is completely devoid of Any flavor.  How it is possible to make a shank tasteless is beyond me. However, everything else we ordered was very good. 

Get it together Jasmine Grill.  This level of service is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Update from June 2018: I used to like this place a lot and recommended it to dozen in and out of town friends and colleagues, but service and the quality of the food went downhill. Last time we went, we had to wait 45 mins to get the food. It was cold and chewy, the server extremely slow and not caring, no refills, no question about how the food is, nothing. Very disappointed and will move my business and recommendations to other restaurants. Additionally, this place is extremely dirty, no one cleans up after people leave and fresh food is stored right in front of the toilets, within reach of customers passing by. AC doesn't work. Very dirty and unhealthy conditions. Sad about this development."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I get the chicken and steak kabob with yellow rice. It's amazing. The best hummus I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is truly excellent. I've eaten here probably 5 times in the last year and enjoy the food every time. Charlotte isn't exactly a Mediterranean food paradise - but this spot is definitely the exception."}
{"text":"I don't often leave reviews but this place is the best Mediterranean food that I've have found in  Charlotte. The chicken kabobs were so flavorful. Big thumbs up."}
{"text":"The hummus is fantastic. I could actually just eat that. I ordered the combo plate with steak, chicken and shrimp and yellow rice. They were nice gave me a beverage while I waited for my to go order. Very flavorful. If I lived in Charlotte I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Extremely great customer service. My server was very polite and his suggestion was perfect."}
{"text":"For some reason I thought I reviewed Jasmine Grill already, my bad.  After hearing great things I had to check it out.  Since then I have been back several times.  

Upon arriving you are greeted by the hostess, owner, cook, etc.  who is friendly and accommodating.  Having only been to a few Mediterranean places, falafel was a definite must to try at Jasmine.  So, I started with the falafel appetizer, six amazing falafel balls, with a great dipping sauce. The falafel was by far one of the best of have had in Charlotte and have since been back to Jasmine just to enjoy those.
That same evening I ordered the Chicken Kabob dinner, whoa a lot of food.  The chicken was cooked too perfection served with grilled vegetables and yellow rice.  Unfortunately, unlike others, the garlic sauce served with the dish was a little too much for my taste. I have also enjoyed the falafel pita and some other sides.
Overall, Jasmine has great food.  Service is good, however, be prepared to enjoy your time there as this is a two man show, so food comes out one table at a time."}
{"text":"This very unassuming restaurant in a strip mall might make someone miss this spot. However don't let the location fool you. The chicken kabobs are very flavorful and the yellow rice is yummy"}
{"text":"Quality food at an affordable price.  I've had better Middle Eastern food, but it comes with a higher cost.

The lentil soup was my favorite.  Next time I'm in town it will be another lunch trip to Jasmine Grill"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot - a little slow in service but solid value. $7 lunch special and it came with soup (I love lentil soup and it was great), salad (I'm not much a cucumber person), meat (chicken kebab) and rice. And you know what's crazy... I love their rice, I can just eat their rice plain and call it a meal. 
Definitely will keep this place in my lunch rotation, but just don't think you can be in and out and back to office in an hour :/"}
{"text":"Tasty, made from fresh, pleasantly plated food for a good price.  Falafels were great.  Baba ganoush was delicious.  Comfortable seating - not crammed like most restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow!   Everything is extremely fresh and all was DELICIOUS!   Best Mediterranean food in Charlotte!  So glad we stumbled upon this place!   Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome experience .. Customer service  was wonderful, he was smiling and addressing all our questions with patience..Best Lamb chops I had so far with right amount  of spices , kids had shrimp kabob and chicken kabab . They liked it a lot ..they certainly exceeded my expectation."}
{"text":"Lunch specials during the week are sumptuous, filling and good value for money. It includes a portion of skewered chicken, basmati rice, garlic butter and a side of delicious hummus and pita bread as well as a simple salad. Staff is friendly and informative."}
{"text":"The falafel was very moist, the beef and lamb shawarma plate was incredibly flavorful (I added a touch of the garlic and hot sauces to each bite), and the kanafeh for dessert was very delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just visited this place today for the very first time and I agree with other people who have said it's the best baba ghanouj in the area! I know how to make it and I know what it supposed to taste like and I haven't had at this good in Charlotte ever! The service was prompt and very friendly place appeared to be very clean the only thing I was a little bit disappointed in but it's OK is that their menu seemed a little limited. I like a more broad spectrum of offerings, but they are not a huge restaurant so if your hungry for a treat then they're a great place to go. They have some really nice appetizer platters that would be enough for me and my mother for two or three meals.  The amount of baba ghanouj that they gave me was twice as much as another place in Charlotte and half the price, And just as good if not better! Just one more reason for me to come to Charlotte all the way from South Carolina."}
{"text":"I'd pick 4.5 if I could, great kebabs, moist and flavorful, excellent baba ganoush as well. Friendly staff and service. The only negative was bland flat pita and hummus that didn't blow me away. Still, excellent value and quality!"}
{"text":"We love coming here! We've ordered both sit down and take out since we discovered Jasmine. The first experience I'm sure was a little off as staff was trying to send out a big catering order when we walked in. We waited patiently for someone to take out order, no biggie. I ordered the Fatoush salad and an order of falafels while the bf ordered the chicken shwarma plate with hummus and yellow rice. The food also took a little while but it was worth it, I think we both agreed that Jasmine trumps Kabob Grill. The prices are just right and the quality of food is great. The Fatosh salad was fresh and crisp with little bits of fried pita instead of croutons, its basically the house salad + fried pita. The falafels were also good as well, six large pieces for $3.99, pretty good in relative terms. My bf loved his chicken shwarma, good pieces of meat and it wasn't rubbery or dry. The rice was surprisingly flavorful. 

We ordered the same items last night for take out. I was a little disappointed with the salad, clearly it was sitting out, the greens were wilting and the pita crisps were soggy. My bf plate was consistent with out sit down experience. I advise not to order salads for take out. Other than that, we will definitely be back, our favorite Mediterranean place in Charlotte so far."}
{"text":"Amazing hummus, and the falafel was seasoned to a purrrfection. If you get the house salad make your own sandwich with the peta bread, hummus, and falafel. 

Service was friendly and the lime green walls are easily ignored once the food arrives.

 Least favorite dish was the fish due to an abundance of sauce, however it was still delicious. Expect strong flavors and big portions. ^..^"}
{"text":"Outstanding food . Simply delicious  , hidden gem . It's worth to try. Everything fresh. All i can say wow!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very tasty offerings from this small strip mall restaurant in the outskirts of Charlotte.
We ordered the humus, the equivalent of dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), house salad, chicken kabob with white rice, braised lamb shank with yellow rice and kunafa for dessert. 
All the dishes were on point... seasoned nicely and plentiful.  Chicken kabob grilled with a nice char but still very tender and the braised lamb shank was succulent. The yellow rice you can have by itself it was nicely seasoned. 

This is not a fine dining establishment but if you want good and simply prepared Mediterranean/ Middle Eastern food... enjoy this place! Oh,  yes... the service,  the night we were dining in the place was 75% full and there was a constant flow of customers picking up the take out orders.  The two waitresses working that night did not miss a beat attending to their dine in customers and take out orders.  I asked for a mint tea to have with my kunafa and the waitress said they didn't have mint tea bags. Instead she came out with standard black tea bag in cup piping hot and fresh mint on the side to flavor my tea... very clever!

My colleague that dined with me the first time went back to this restaurant a few days later with his whole family and they all enjoyed their dinner."}
{"text":"great food!
i had the beef kabob and tabbouleh salad wit side of hummus.

my new go to place!"}
{"text":"An absolute to die for!! This place may not look glamorous on the outside, but boy is the cooking the absolute BEST!!

I decided on the Lunch Special for $7.50 - I got soup, salad, a huge plate of jasmine rice and chicken shawarma. Every single food item was delicious!! It was the best lunch meal I had in a long time!!


Best tip about this place: They give you a side of this garlic dip stuff - so good!!, but such STRONG garlic - I could still smell it on my breath when I was going to bed later that night."}
{"text":"Simply put, this is a fantastic restaurant. Started with the house salad which was very flavorful. Next got a variety of kabobs which were easily the best I have had in Charlotte. Finished with baklava which was fantastic. Service was great. Portion size was perfect and a good value. Restaurant seemed clean and was recently updated."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for take out and the other to dine in. Despite being in a strip mall off South Blvd, it is AMAZING. The food is great. If you're going with one other person you can easily share a meal. I was there last week and split the chicken kebabs, rice, hummus plate, and baba ganoush and it was the perfect amount of food. The chicken was marinated and grilled and also comes with a yummy garlic sauce. The restaurant is a bit small and cozy, you can easily order ahead and pick it up. Sometimes they're a little slow, but just give yourself enough time and you'll leave full and happy! This will definitely be on my rotation of take out restaurants!"}
{"text":"Good food, would of been 5 stars if the French fries weren't heavy/greasy and the pita was fresh.  The baba, hummus, falafel & chicken shawarma (small wrap btw) were very good.  Good mediterranean/middle eastern hybrid flavors... deff recommended if you're in the area/state.  Nice staff too... Ty!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp has failed me on this one....

Though the place was clean, it was totally empty, and the waitstaff seemed really out of it.  I ordered the hummus based on reviews and was disappointed - it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't worth ordering. The worst part was the cold, almost undercooked bread that came with it. It was very chewy and kind of gray. 

Next came the salad, which was fresh, granted, but the dressing was a little bland. I also ordered the kofta platter, which came with rice. The addition of peas and carrots to the rice was nice. The kofta was pretty good, but over salted. 

A valiant effort, but I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in because of the reviews and good think I did. Food was awesome. I got the 1/2 chicken with 2 sides and could not Finish it. The picture speak for themselves. You must stop in."}
{"text":"Clean. Friendly. Fast. South Carolina rocks. The food is better than most other chinese places I've eaten. I'll give them 100 percent."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and great food!! My family came to visit from New York and we went to dinner with friends. Everything was great!! Fast and friendly service and every time we had great experiences!"}
{"text":"Can't stop eating their saffron rice! I ordered the yellow rice with the entrees, again! Beef and lamb shawarma are especially good. Switch out a side for lentil soup if they have it."}
{"text":"Awesome find! Yelp lead us to this little Mediterranean place. Awesome shawarma! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped  by this restaurant on the way to the airport. The food was so fresh! The meats were perfectly marinated and the portion sizes were very generous . Don't forget to try a cup of their Turkish coffee ! Delish"}
{"text":"From Alabama to Georgia to the Carolinas: Jasmine Grill is the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. I make a point to look for kebabs and schwarma in almost every city I visit. For the past 2 years I can't visit Charlotte without stopping by Jasmine Grill. We have some comparable places in Atlanta, but their garlic sauce always falls short. Jasmine Grill's garlic sauce is PERFECTION with delicious kebabs/schwarma/yellow rice to match. The hummus is more savory than most places and I personally find that delicious. I may have to take some pints of garlic sauce and hummus back to Atlanta with me the next time I'm in town. You won't regret visiting this gem!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte on business and was looking for a Mediterranean restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised to find the Jasmine Grill so close to my hotel. When I opened yelp to look for a restaurant, their yelp ad was at the top. Apparently it was the first day of their ad run and I was very glad to find it.
The food was fresh, made to order and very good. The hummus was lemony, just the way I like it. The Falafel was tasty, served with the sauce that was delicious.
The staff was attentive, courteous and as a first timer to the restaurant wanted my dining experience to be good. The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing.
This is a new restaurant in Charlotte and I definitely will be back on my next travels to the area. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I've been to many mediterranean style restuarants and the flavors here-- coupled with the price-- definitely make this place the best I've ever been to. 

The Jasmine drink is especially good! And the service is always great."}
{"text":"Best Arab food in Charlotte. Good people. Great food! Beef kabob and kefta kabob on point!! Knaffa is amazing. Ma"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and great service. The food is super fresh, tasty and authentic. Also, the prices are amazing for what you get!! Truly recommend it:)"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in Charlotte for reasonable price..

Good for groups and you can find wide variety of foodstuffs"}
{"text":"After a hiccup with an online order, I decided to give this place another try. I'm glad I did... the quaint space was nice spot to enjoy an intimate meal without all the hustle and bustle that Charlotte offers at times. 

My food was a good size portion and one plate is enough for one person with all sides included. The only con for this place... being its a family owned business, the customer service is a little 'laxed here. A couple of the servers were in the corner on their phones ..I was finally able to grab my server's attention to get a refill. 

Though the service may be subpar, the food was great so I will not count them out. Next time, I plan to try one of the wraps!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the casual restaurant Jasmine grill.  We had falafel and a hummus variant  for appetizers.  Very good.  We had kabobs for dinner wow fantastic, great rice too.  Can't wait to go back sometime soon.  Yummy, greatl fresh flavors!!!"}
