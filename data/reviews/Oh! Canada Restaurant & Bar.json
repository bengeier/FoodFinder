{"text":"Anything but a good Canadian!  I went to Oh Canada with a coupon from a charity coupon book. After my meal, the \"new owner\" told me he decided to no longer honour the coupon despite keeping the same name and menu. The owner didn't care if his decision was bad business. Clearly, the customer was not put first in this situation. I would never go there again. What a sham!"}
{"text":"Just plain BAD!    Its under new ownership and has really gone downhill.  The service was ok.  Aside from not honoring their coupons (I guess if a new owner takes over, they dont have to honor any coupons, even if the name remains the same...huh).  The food was also ok, something that tasted like I whipped it up at home.  I ordered the Pad Thai (I know, it was a gamble to order an asian staple at a \"Canadian\" eatery).  The \"Pad Thai\" was pad thai-less - no noodles.  Instead they swapped it with rice to make it an Indian fusion - may want to rename it.  The rice was minute rice, the veggies were typical stir fry and the \"nan bread\" was Safeway wholegrain bread!  The food didnt taste bad, but was misrepresented and for $19 I felt very ripped off.  If this meal were $7-8 then I would feel I got value.  Bottom line, with so many good restaurants downtown, don't waste your money here unless you are just stopping for a beer."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant quite often, as it is at the base of the tower where I work.    The restaurant has Canada as its theme, with such menu items as the \"Gretzky\" sandwich and \"The Tragically Hip\" beef and cheddar sandwich.  For my full review, click below, to check out the charm of this local Calgary restaurant, right in the heart of downtown Calgary:  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/2186645/review_oh_canada_restaurant_in_calgary.html?cat=9"}
{"text":"Gave Oh! Canada a try today.  Had lunch at the restaurant with a friend.  My friend ordered the Tragically Hip Sandwich with the soup of the day which happens to be wonton soup.  There was some beef slices and some caramelized onions within ciabatta bread, cut into half.  His wonton soup looked a little oily and he said it was a little spicy.  The waitress did make a mistake and brought over the mushroom soup instead.  It was whisked away and the wonton soup was quickly exchanged.   I ordered a light meal; I had the Beef Kabob Salad.  It came in a rectangular white plate with mesclun greens.  There were 2 sticks of beef kabobs alongside with cubed portabello mushrooms, onions and zuchinni.  There was a side dressing - it was sweet and tangy at the same time.  I could see mustard seeds floating in the dressing.  It wasn't too bad for a light meal.    Would I come back?  Sure.  I noticed that there was a lot of East Indian influences in the menu.  On my way out,  I noticed that a take-out menu of Namskar (the East Indian restaurant on 16th Ave NE).  Turns out the owners of Oh! Canada also own Namskar!  That's why there was biryanis, butter chicken, naans etc throughout the whole menu.    I also noticed on the front door a sign that says that the restaurant will start to serve breakfast at 7 a.m. starting in May."}
{"text":"Food: 1/5 Service: 1/5 Convenience: 4/5 Parking: 2/5 Value: 3/5  The only reason we keep going here is that its close and convenient.  I think they've changed ownership a few times but the service here is pretty poor, especially if you're in that lunchtime rush.  With all the alternatives near by, skip this one."}
{"text":"So, I know the category says \"American (New),\" but that's because there isn't a \"Canadian (Eh)\" option to choose.  I secretly wish they would have made the name simply, \"EH,\" but I suppose \"Oh! Canada\" is just as clever.  The name is fitting since this place goes all out Canadian.  Their decor certainly displays their patriotism with flags and other related paraphernalia scattering the whole place.  All their meals are somehow Canada-related and some have clever names like, The Wrangler, John Candy Platter and Snowbird.    One cool thing about Oh! Canada is that it's closed on the weekend, but can be booked for private functions.  This would be a great place for any work function to enjoy a good time with the place to themselves and service directed only to them!  This is definitely a great place for any Canadian to enjoy some real Canadian dishes.  Hey, instead of going for the usual Chinese or Italian meal, why not eat some good old fashioned Canadian food.  Support your heritage!!!"}
