{"text":"Awesome place, great atmosphere. Nice place for a guys night out, upscale pub feeling. The sliders there are fantastic, and are fillet mignon.   Wine list that can't be beat, and bartenders have a large repitoir of Jack Daniels drinks.  Large, wrap around patio is climate controlled, and cigar friendly."}
{"text":"Haven't been here but I seen the episode of barnyard builders the owner went out to PA they all tore down and old bank barn episode was cool now that I finally know where the restaurant is I can go lol. I can't wait to see what he did and how the restaurant looks :)"}
{"text":"Changed hands in 2011 and promptly went out of business on poor new ownership.  Too bad, the old Brokers was a Scottsdale classic!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a drinker or a bar guy, but this little place is comfortable, and it has some charm.  Outdoors seating is nice in season.  They have a decent beer selection and the food - while it is classic bar food - is above average IMHO.  When I say classic bar food - I don't mean that it is limited to burgers or wings.  they do a pretty good dinner here - including some serious steaks and such if memory serves.  I would say this is more of a wine and hard liquor joint.  My wife likes it and she is into wine.  The decor is classic dark bar, and it is small.  So, very cozy ad close,  One time we were there, there were folks gathered around some of the patio tables playing cards and backgammon.  Not the kind of fraternizing I am used to in PHX, and quite welcome."}
