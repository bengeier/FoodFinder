{"text":"The Billingsgate Seafood Market knows how to fry a fish. I don't say this lightly; there's a lot that needs to go right in order to produce something more than the oily, thick-battered fare you're likely to find in most Calgary pubs. Their fish is fresh (the place is primarily a fish market - one of the few in the city) , their cut is ample, their batter is thin, tasty, and just a little bit crunchy. A coating of house-made tartar sauce on each flaky piece seals the deal. The accompanying fries are fine, but are typically not made to order (unlike the fish), so they can vary from fryer-fresh to a limp, luke-warm.

There's more to the menu than fried fish but I was disappointed with their bland fish tacos and their cheese-rich-but-fish-poor tuna melt.  The seafood chowder is hearty and better than most at this price-level, but the quality can vary. They clearly know their fried fish, however, and I've never been disappointed with either their cod or halibut offerings. If you're in the area and craving a proper fish fry, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Had the panko oyster burger and my friends had the platter, tasted fresh, not greasy for very reasonable price. Bringing the kids along next time!"}
{"text":"Fish and chip shop, fresh fish market, and prepared/frozen seafood store all rolled into one. I'll address the highlights of each of these aspects briefly:

-The fish and chips come with a choice of fish, and is served with malt vinegar...the way it should be!  Additionally, they are licensed, so treat yourself to a halibut, and wash it down with an Alexander Keith's. Only down side is that the fries can be a bit limp sometimes.

-This is one of few places on town where you can consistently get good quality fresh scallops and mussels, but of course with a heftier price tag.  I know many Calgarians who don't like scallops or mussels, which I'm pretty sure is because of quality issues (hint: they should not taste fishy at all).

-The frozen and prepared fish section may not be as large as at places like T&T, but the variety of products is just as good or better.  The dry goods section has a number of hard to find gourmet products to accompany fish, e.g. cajun crab boil seasoning. This is also the only shop I know of in town that carries a large number of Newfoundland food products, for those hankering for seal meat or Purity biscuits, or who need hard tack to make Fish and Brewis.

All in all, a good place to get your seafood fix!"}
{"text":"Had the haddock and chips and oyster burger and chips. Definitely the best we've had in calgary. Great batter, not greasy at all. Incredible fries and the oysters were done to perfection. Great service and fast preparation."}
{"text":"I was sooo looking forward to going to Billingsgate for their clam chowder after reading some of the reviews. I was in that area of town so I thought I'd drop in. Ordered the soup and Sandwich deal and picked the clam chowder and the crab melt. I have had dozens of clam chowders in my life, from Sooke BC to San Francisco and this one definitely did NOT make the grade. Pasty, salty, more potatoes and carrots than clams. Yuck. And the crab melt was disgusting. Tasted like old canned crab, again overly salty on a grainy ciabatta. I couldn't identify whatever was supposed to be melted on top because there was so little of it. Would definitely not be back to eat. Maybe just to buy the fresh oysters to take home."}
{"text":"This place isn't just a legendary fish wholesaler, it's an awesome and comfortable casual restaurant! Beer, wine, snow crab legs, and hallibuit or cod fish+chips are some of your options.

I got the Cod Fish+Chips which wasn't as amazing as some of the deep fried cod I had in London, but this is the best I've ever had in Western North America. The chips are amazingly delicious and greasy. I think they cut them too thin (to suit Canadian \"taste\") instead of the thick cut that real fish and chips are.  Nonetheless, they're damn good. 

Oh, and their fish that you can buy where for your own cooking is just...wow. It's as good as it gets for a city that's hundreds of miles from the coast."}
{"text":"Sushi sushi sushi!!

I love making sushi but usually stick with avocado and cucumber. Partly because it's easy, partly because anything dipped in soy sauce and wasabi tastes awesome, and partly because I didn't know where to buy proper ingredients like you get at a sushi restaurant.

Billingsgate has a great selection of fresh fish in a large glass cabinet at the back of the market, including sashimi grade tuna and salmon. We grabbed a slab of each, originally thinking we could cook any extra that we wouldn't use in time as there was so much. That was before slicing it up and dipping it in sashimi soy sauce! So fresh and it just melts in your mouth! I think about half made it into the actual sushi in the end and there was definitely none left over at the end.

There were two people working behind the counter on a Saturday afternoon, both were friendly and efficient. The market also stocks some handy sushi making ingredients like seaweed and wasabi."}
{"text":"Large group of 20 cash back card holders all arrived at about the same time. Food was plentiful, tasty & well priced."}
{"text":"Love the staff here! 

Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to pick up some seafood for a pasta dish we had dreamed up.  This place is cute! Another seafood market coupled with a small cafe. This cafe is a big larger than some of the other ones, and I work in the area and I'm sure it has a solid weekday lunch crowd.  We chose some fresh digby scallops and a package of frozen prawns. The scallops were huge and the prawns ended up being some of the best I've had - I will absolutely go back for the prawns. 

The guy helping us out was so friendly and clearly loves seafood, he had us laughing and promising to come back in for a bite to eat and to try more of their market offerings."}
{"text":"Went in for fish and chips:

1. Chips were stale. 
2. Cod was tasteless. 
3. Most worrisome of all, the cod smelled like formaldehyde. 

I had to stifle the urge to vomit -- probably a mistake. I should go and induce . . . ."}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations, by reading previous Yelp reviews. We wanted to try something different, so we made the trek from the deep south to this location. 
We ordered two orders of fish and chips (2 piece meal). it comes with coleslaw and fries. The fish taco's and also a 1 piece fish and chip.
The prices IMO are a little on the high side. I have to say though, that the fish came out in around 10 min. and was piping hot.
The batter on the fish was a little on the heavy side. Kind of like the batter you would get on the frozen Captain Highliner ones.
I prefer a lighter batter, that's less doughy.
They have two entrances to the store, one to the left for the fresh seafood market the one on the right for the restaurant. It doesn't matter which one you go in, you'll end up in the same place.
I have to say $17.95 for a two piece fish n chip meal is pricey. I guess when you eat out a lot, especially on the weekends with the family it can really add up fast.
The fish taco's were good. Not battered on the taco's. They were a little on the spicy side.
Would I go back ?    Yes. if in the area. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again."}
{"text":"This is a fish market with a little diner. Or vice-versa. Best fish and chips in Calgary that I've found. Enough said."}
{"text":"Tasty, now have to go to their other locations as the building just couldn't survive with such good food and fell apart."}
{"text":"Kinda rude on the phone two separate days when I called to ask questions. I'll stick with Boyd's!"}
{"text":"Cool little place. On one side is the 'fish market' and one side is the restaurant.

The 'fish market' is pretty awesome. They have several types of fresh seafood, along with some frozen stuff in the freezer. They also have various seasonings for sale, for those feeling particularly culinary that day. 

Their restaurant is extremely basic. About 6-8 tables with plastic tablecloths, and an order counter. The menu is written on a board. You order and take a seat, and then they bring the food to you. I have tried their  tuna burgers (which were good), their fries (which were average), and their seafood chowder which was PHENOMENAL! I think its about 6 bucks during lunch and its a decent amount - enough to fill you up - even if you're a hefty eater! They serve it with a piece of bread. The chowder is so good I think it beats the chowder I had in Fishermans Wharf in SF! Yup, that good.
 
Worth checking out if you're into any kind of seafood.

{"text":"I glanced over some of the other reviews, and I agree that it's a little over-priced, their coleslaw isn't the best, and their chowder is a little on the watery side. That being said I enjoyed their fish and chips. The batter was good, the fish inside was good, and the tartar sauce was good, and if it wasn't for the before mentioned issues, I would have given this place 5/5.

Go to Tim's or Wendy's if you don't like it, or want to save money. Oh and you can grab a beer with your fish & chips which is nice."}
{"text":"Writing this at the location and horribly disappointed.  The menu is light on details and when I asked some questions, and I was the only one in line, I was greeted with eye rolls and answers that were demeaning.  I ordered the frog legs which were pretty bland, there was also the clam chowder and fish and chips at our table.  Nothing stood out.  Overall I would not go back."}
{"text":"So I'm from Houston, Texas and every time I go to Calgary this is a must eat place on my agenda. The small market and restaurant give it a nice appeal to the locals and travelers like myself; especially if you love fresh seafood. The cajun blackened fish, shrimp and oysters (seafood platter...I think) is absolutely delicious! Try it out you will not be disappointed. All in all, the location is west near the university but it's well worth the drive from anywhere in Calgary. It's not a swanky place but why must it be if serves up great, fresh seafood."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the clam chowder here. It wasn't good. It was gummy, floury, missing the clams - so disappointed! I had to add a ton of stuff to it to make it edible.
Staff were nice enough. 
I never have seen 1 person in my life dining in here. It may be the time of day that I am going or this place isn't doing that well on the restaurant side?
Unsure if I will try again. My quest for Calgary's best clam chowder continues!"}
{"text":"Had the ultimate platter with scallops, oysters, haddock, and shrimp. Boy it was delicious. Not too battered and not too greasy, the seafood was fried just right. Fresh seafood from a seafood market and the gentleman behind the counter was just the nicest guy. Will return. Five star if the value was a little better but not unreasonably priced at all."}
{"text":"Being a LT Calgarian, I knew this place when it was DT.  Lost track when they hit a rough patch and relocated.  Just went back there a couple of weeks ago for the Cod and chips.  Really, really good.  It's greasy, which is expected for deep fried foods, but the oil is smoking hot which means you can dab off the excess quite easily.
Food - first rate.  The cod fillets are fresh and the batter is very light and tasty, seasoned well.  Chips are cripsy on the outside and meaty on the inside.
Service - again, first rate.  Friendly counter staff and the chef as well.  One of the pieces of fish didn't turn out quite right, they redid another one for me.  Fast and efficient.
Decor - basic diner tables, nothing fancy, but solid.
Parking - spaces in front.  If you need to park in the actual lot, there is a cost.
Retail - they have fresh and frozen seafood.  King crab legs!  You can also purchase a bag of their batter flour for your own use.

Overall - really a good experience.  You can have fantastic F&C, and then purchase some fresh salmon or tuna for grilling later.  Will return."}
{"text":"So glad this place is near my house. I love some types of fish, especially when it's fresh. 

The gentlemen working there was so helpful as well. I noticed squid rings, that weren't battered, so we asked him the best way to cook it was without breading. He gave us this marinara sauce and told us how to cook it. And it was delish!

We also picked up some ahi tuna steaks, which I seared and were super good. Their fish is usually sushi grade sashimi so you don't even have to cook it. I found there to be lots of selection and not bad prices. I mean it's fresh fish I'll pay for quality. 

There is also a restaurant on the other side, I've never ate there, but it is always an option if you don't want to cook your own food."}
{"text":"Disgusting is the only word for it. Greasy fish, terrible coleslaw, dirty dishes left out, and way overpriced!"}
{"text":"The seafood market is half fish market and half restaurant. I didn't actually buy anything at the market but the prices seemed a bit expensive to me (I'm from California so I don't know how it is compared to other Canadian locations). 

I ordered the Boston clam chowder and clam strips (I absolutely love clam strips). The clam strips were good as expected since everything deep fried is delicious as long as it's not overcooked. Topped with some lemon juice and served with cocktail sauce...delicious.

The clam chowder on the other hand? I can't say give the same praise. I don't really have a problem spending over $5 for a soup, but I expect it to be delicious. The creaminess was good, but it was over salted. I had it during lunch so I doubt that it over reduced. The biggest issue however was that there was practically no clams in there. Every spoonful was just vegetables....very disappointed to say the least. 

If it wasn't for the clam strips I could have easily dropped a 2 star review. And that is biased since I have a childhood love for them."}
{"text":"Billingsgate Seafood is fantastically fresh.   We had some lovely halibut for Easter Dinner from this purveyor, and it lived up to it's price and reputation.  Tonight I'm writing about the cafe, the Lighthouse Cafe, the small 10 or so table  attachment to the fish store.

My husband gave it 3 stars overall because he didn't think the ambience was worth more than 2 stars.  Yes, it is 'cute' but when we went in at 7ish (I didn't get home from work until 6ish) the tables were a little sticky, there were napkins on the floor under the tables also sticky floor and we weren't qutie sure whether it was table service or not.   

It's not. Hint, go to the counter on the right and order your food, then sit on down.There will probably be a menu at one of the tables you can look at, but seriously,  go online first to pick what you want to eat because from the tired faces of the staff, this place can get really busy on a weekend!

What that little cafe lacked in ambience, even Mr.Critical had to admit, it made up for in Fresh, Tasty Food.   The fish was excellent.  He had  hablibut fish and chips and even though I was kind of angling for a bite,  he gobbled down that thick cut perfectly deep fried halibut all by his own self.   Not a bite to spare for his willing to trade bite for bite wife!  

That's okay, I'll try some one day since we're going back, he said.    And that means it's very good and very affordable.

Now, for the Yelper's choice.   $8.95!  Only $8.95 bought me an Oyster burger stuffed with two of the largest, juciest, most tender, fresh  oysters I've had since leaving BC!  And they were Pacific oysters,  too!   The menu says they come with tomato and lettuce garnish.  Mine came with just Iceberg lettuce nad when I saw it I wondered a bit.  Okay, not gourmet lettuce but the bitter of the iceberg, and the crisp finished that burger with a generous dollop  of creamy, slightly dill flavoured tartar sauce.  

Now I added fries for $2.00 more and a cup of slaw for $1.00 more just to try them. They Oyster Burger is just that a Oyster Burger, not a platter.  The Fish and chips come with slaw and fries.  The fries were well cooked and if there was salt on them it was a minisucle amount.  Good news for my not-so-salty freinds who like their blood pressure lower.

 The slaw was light and had just a little oil, maybe and was served with a lemon wedge on top.   Mr. Critical wasn't fond of his, he likes creamy coleslaw.  I liked the crunch and fresh taste of the lighlty flavoured slaw.  It complimented the fresh taste of the seafood.  

I finished my meal with a sense of sasifaction.   I had found a place that was affordable where Mr. C could chow down and not break his piggy bank open to leave a tip!  

There are a lot of good things on the menu at the Lighthouse.   Crab legs, Lobster Dinner, Fish and Chips, Fish burgers, OYSTER and chips (yummedy Yum!)   A couple of things to remember.   It's free parking for 3 hours in the parking lot (which is close to the Stadium).   It is next door to that cute Cat Place (for cat lovers).  It is also open until 8, but I'd recommend a take away and a quck drive over to nearby EdworthyPark.  That's what those little hot bags you can buy in the grocery stores are for!  

I'll be writing about this place again, but until then,  Yes To the LIghthouse for your Friday Night Fish fix."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  Amazing casual fish and chips and fantastic fresh seafood to buy to take home.  I grew up on the coast and I have hard and fast rule.  If a fish shop reeks like fish, walk away.  This place always smells fresh and clean and I'm thrilled to find a fresh seafood shop 1000km from the coast."}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl of the New England Clam Chowder from the little cafe attached to Billingsgate. It took about 5 minutes to prepare and came in quite a sizeable bowl with a small slice of sourdough bread on the side. 

The utentils they gave me were dirty. Not a good start.

Onto the food. The clam chowder was tasteless and watery.  I literally could not taste any onions, clams, etc. It was like eating a bowl of white-nothing. I had a couple of spoonfuls, added some salt and pepper and it still tasted like watery nothing.

If I could give this little restaurant area zero stars, I would. Terrible food and not clean. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I recently learned to make sushi at home. I decided to go to Billingsgate to pick up some fresh fish. I found the staff to be very helpful with respect to what type of fish I could use for sushi. They were also very candid about what fish was fresh and what wasn't . I really enjoyed the service and will definitely be back for future fish needs."}
{"text":"Seafood to go, seafood to stay, seafood that's already been cooked up for you, or seafood that you want to cook up for yourself. All bases are covered at Billingsgate Seafood Market. 

Walk in and to the left and you have yourself a full-fledged seafood market. Fresh fish up at the front, a live lobster and crab tank, frozen seafood and a variety of accompanying products and sauces all lining the walk up. Walk in and to the right and you'll find yourself on the restaurant side. It's not big, maybe 10 tables? But you can get your fill of fish and chips, scallop and chips, shrimp and chips, calamari, clam chowder, steamed mussels, oysters, crab cakes, oyster or halibut burgers, as well as a myriad of other lunch or dinner options. Just head on up to the counter and place your order. They'll bring it out to you when it's ready.

I ordered myself the scallops and chips. Tasty mid-afternoon snack, though the fries could've been a little crispier. On the seafood and chips front, I'd give this particular dish a 3/5. But the market is rockin' enough to earn itself a 4 overall!"}
{"text":"Heard about the Billingsgate Fish Market from friends.  We are two retired professionals who travel around quite a bit, so driving to Calgary from Lacombe for a meal is no big deal.
We drove to Billingsgate and had lunch.  It turned out to be one of the best seafood meals I have had in quite a while.  Hubby and I both had the scallop dinner.  The scallops were so succulent, I ate them really slowly to savor the taste and texture.  They were cooked to perfection.  I am a island girl, relocated here from Cape Breton Island, and I know fish!  We were very impressed with the variety and freshness of the fish they handled and we came home with a collection.   We have already had the muscles and halibut we bought.   Both were delicious and great quality.  I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a good fish meal, served by friendly, knowledgeable staff.  Prices are more than reasonable.  We will be making the trip there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The fish and chips here are delicious!! As they made it with very fresh fish!!... Also, they offer other appetizers that looked very good!!.. I bought some fresh fish and other stuff that is not easy to find in most supermarkets... I'm really glad I found this fish market, I think it will be one of my favorites spots in Calgary to buy fresh fish, as there are not many good ones in town!...  In addition, It was great to have some good seafood, while shopping!!.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  As a Maritimer, I know fresh seafood and this place is excellent.  Really good turn over of product so you know you are getting quality that is ready for your plate!  And don't forget to try their prepared food.  The fish and chips were light and crispy, with hand cut fries representing.  
  I can't wait to try the PEI mussels next time I need a lunch or maybe the PoBoy...so many tough decisions!"}
{"text":"Their flagship dish, fish and chips was among the lowest quality I have ever had. Ok, I'm English and may have higher standards in this dish than some, but still. Over cooked and obviously far from fresh fish and limp yet hard chips. Not cheap, either."}
