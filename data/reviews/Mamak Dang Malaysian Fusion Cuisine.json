{"text":"Compared to downtown places for Laksa, I think it tasted better then most places.!The prices were reasonable the portions was a lot, and the service was pretty quick. I tried the special Laksa which has a little bit of everything such as beef, seafood and vegetables. Next time, I will try the beef ball Laksa since I enjoyed the beef the most."}
{"text":"I'm also confused with the high rating of this restaurant. I ordered beef rendang which was very disappointing. It lacked flavour and spice and came at room temperature. It also had a thick, gross gelatin texture to it. I think I received only 4 small, fatty pieces of beef and the rest was this gross sauce. The roti on the other hand was completely delicious! It's like biting into a buttery, fresh croissant."}
{"text":"Delicious. My buddy is a frequent customer at Mamak's first location. When this location popped up, I had to see what he was raving about. 
We ordered the Mixed Laska Soup ($12.99). The noodles were slippery and toothsome. The broth was super spicy (which we requested) and creamy. It's great to clear out a cold. I was coughing, sneezing and sputtering (in a good way). You get a good amount of shrimp, sweet fish cake, beef, and pork and beef balls. Usually at noodle places you get more noodles than meat and seafood. Here, it seems the amount of toppings is quite generous. 
The roti was served hot and crispy ($5.99 with curry). The prices aren't the cheapest in the area but the quality and taste make it worth it. 

Mamak just opened up. Check it out before February 10th and you get 10% dine in and 20% for takeout."}
{"text":"We went to this place after hearing John Gilchrist's strong review on the restaurant. Having had great Laksa in California, I was truly disappointed. Our meal started with an order of rotti with curry ($6) - the dish came with two crusty rotties and a curry that was over thickened with starch. The consistency was gelatin like and tasted bland and over processed (like the instant curry in a dry package you'd find at any Asian supermarket). The laksa ($14) was a generous portion with two shrimps and various processed balls. It was spicy back lacked the depth of flavours I've come to expect from a great laksa. Service was quick and courteous and the restaurant was clean in a relatively dingy Asian mall. 

Calgary's laksa scene is pretty lame so if you're desperate, it's a good place to satisfy those cravings. Otherwise, the experience was just underwhelming."}
{"text":"First time trying Malaysian food. Had the laksa and the beef. Good food and fair prices!"}
{"text":"The rating makes me wonder what is going on here. So came here with my colleague thinking that this is a legit Malaysian restaurant. Well seems like most people here order the Laksa noodle. So not sure if this place is only good at making that dish.

My colleague and I both ordered the Rendang beef with rice combo. First off, I have been to many Malaysian restaurant and none of it tasted like the Rendang beef I had here. The color was off to begin with. It didn't have the spice kick to it. Its good that the dish wasn't salty but at the same time it doesn't have a strong flavor to it either. I showed the picture to my Singaporean and Malaysian friend and they all said the beef color is off. 

So this is a fake Malay place or this place doesn't know how to make Rendang beef. 

Also this place is not busy at all. No one really walk in. Not even take out. I feel sorry for the owner running this place. Definitely need to work on the recipe if they want to stay in business."}
