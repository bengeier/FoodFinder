{"text":"I have faithfully been a customer twice a week of this location for over five years. Unfortunately I have to say no more. When I first started eating here the food was amazing, hot and fresh. The management greeted you like you were a friend and the service was top notch. This restaurant has gone down hill to the point where I will no longer eat here.  The management is rude and never speaks to any of the customers.  The servers seem frazzled and over worked.  This no longer is a comfortable place to eat and it doesn't seem to be a nice place to work.  My recent experience with the food was that I ordered a veggie skillet and the vegetables that were on it were raw. It was like they were an after thought tossed onto potatoes and actually served to me not cooked under some eggs. The second problem is a consistent one that the food is coming out of the kitchen cold. It doesn't matter if they are slow or busy, the food gets to your table and it is cold. This has happened the last two times I have been there and even though the cashier notified the manager (or at least I think it is the manager, she is a blonde woman but the way she seems to purposely not interact with customers it is hard to know what her title is) she just ignored me. The dollar add on fruit, pancakes ect are now over two dollars with tax. Other menu items have been increased in price. The cost is something I would not worry about  if the food and atmosphere were consistently good. To pay an average of just under ten dollars for my meal not including my coffee and have it not cooked properly or just plain cold is unacceptable. There are other places I can spend my money every week and get a better quality meal and service.  My advice would be to pass this one up."}
{"text":"The Good Egg was a good place for a fast breakfast.  Food was ok and the service was courteous and attentive!"}
{"text":"Not sure whats going on at this location..because usually I would give 5 stars......  BUT its  sure not like it used to be.... staff leaving after being there since it opened if not longer... a new manager who has no business being a manager... and the staff that is still there is not happy like they used to be....  before  you felt like you were at a family's place all the employee's acted like family ... NOW since the new manager its not that way....I even asked why the new manager and all the waitress would say was...\" she is new here but will be a district manager soon\" Why would she get to move on as a D.M.?  she is horrible, I have seen the way she treats some of her staff... and trust me I eat there on a regular basis..... she has a fake smile and when she greets you and you ask for s specific server  you can tell by her body language and facial expressions she would rather seat you where she wants you.... The more I think about this as I write it I hope that info is true and she will be moving on soon so that the place gets back to the \" happy family\" feeling that that location once had. Maybe we will get lucky and every one that has quit or been let go will come back....  There is a group of us that meet at this location and EVERYONE gets the same feeling I get .....The food is consistently good there, BUT the service  is what keeps me coming back...  it is NOT the decor thats for sure......   HEY GOOD EGG.... make some changes... I am very willing to drive to another location  or even another restaurant all together...."}
{"text":"I used to come here 3-4 mornings/week. The servers were wonderful-attentive and friendly. I always felt their warmth and was welcomed. They have recently gotten a new manager who has either fired or driven out the best servers and has beaten down the morale of the employees who are still there. It is no longer an enjoyable and social experience. When the employees are told they are not allowed to be jovial, it deflates morale. It's clearly evident that no one receives respect from the manager, she shows favorites and those that the customers love are punished for expressing concerns about the changes in the customer's experience to her. Shameful behavior by a manager and acceptance of this behavior by the owner. I will not be frequenting this restaurant as before."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Good Egg several times.  The service is always excellent and the breakfast is always good. Their potatoes are a bit over cooked. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My family loves The Good Egg! They have great service and delicious food. I love the \"Light\" Crepe Eggs. Also, the staff is very friendly and always happy to entertain my two year old's request for \"Mickey Pancakes and Chocolate Milk\" right away."}
{"text":"Such a open space lots of natural lighting. I came here to get some breakfast, however I got some of their lunch items. I had some of their cups of soup. I had the green chili which is Amazing! Then had their chicken Baja which is to die for! Then I had two sandwiches the first one was Santa Fe Straw so delicious. The other one was California chicken so light so filling! I would check either one of these sandwiches out when you come here!"}
{"text":"The food was delish with a great atmosphere.  I like the rustic look and try the cucumber mint refresher, amazing"}
{"text":"This is was my first visit to the Good Egg and unfortunately also my last. I ordered the Baked Potato skillet which was $9.29. For that amount of money I expect that I'd take some home. Nope, the portion size fit on a 6\" plate. There was maybe $2.00 in cost at the most. That's about an 80% profit margin. I had an iced tea, which was $2.50. It was plain ole' weak iced tea at that. You can make six gallons of iced tea for $2.50. I think they are way overpriced for what you get and  really not all that good. We all went away hungry and spent $45.00 for 2 adults and 2 kids. It was maybe a $30.00 meal at best."}
{"text":"I was hoping to like this place, but unfortunately... I didn't like it at all. I should have gone to Denny's. The food quality is very poor. I ordered an omelette & it looked plastic. The potatoes are bland & it is way over priced!! I just paid $17 for an omelette & a cup of coffee! I wouldn't mind paying that if the food was actually good. The waitress was really nice, but slow. On a positive note, the restaurant was really clean. So, good job on that!"}
{"text":"I am new to Arizona and am very picky about where I go out to eat. I hate factory food (dennys, ihop etc) I got lucky finding a breakfast place at The Good Egg Tramonto by my house. The food selections are deliciously over the top. Always a few new specials you won't find on the menu. Cooks Memo and Izzy have it down to a science.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is warm and inviting. The staff is very friendly and gives me my Ole small home town feeling. Kind of an extended family as I have got to know a little about each one as they have sat down at the counter sometimes with me and shared a meal. I have gone from going one or two days a week to almost every morning as my new ritual. The interaction of getting to know the staff has a  comorarady all of its own and would please the ownership to no end!  I like sitting at the counter to catch all the fun. Always lots of laughs and you leave with smile on your face. April and Victor run a tight ship and interact with all guests to make sure everyone has an enjoyable dining experience.  Elizabeth, Angela, Christina, Susan, Candace, Jacqueline, Michelle, Ann and Danielle keep you coming back for more and more. Definitely a unique place to call home for breakfast and you will have to experience it for yourself !!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast restaurant. The staff is amazing- servers, managers, bussers alike. Everyone is extremely friendly and attentive. Every time I come the staff is working hard, and there is great teamwork. My favorite part of the experience is the atmosphere. Everyone is always happy, and it is contagious. Excellent healthy options- everyone should try the breakfast tacos! If you are looking for something a little less healthy- the Berry Amor pancakes are spectacular."}
{"text":"We have been here repeatedly and they have good and bad days regretfully!   The food is always decent to really good - just a bit pricey for what you are getting.  The service is only why they are not getting another star.. the last two times we have been there - we may not be returning.  How hard is it to toast a english muffin?  and burnt is burnt... the orders even were wrong the last two times we were there."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!! The country combo and kale shakes are the shit!!! My only complaint is that the don't check on drinks enough. But the service is good otherwise."}
{"text":"I normally LOVE this place, but never for lunch and now I know why. I took my mother here for lunch and it was a little an hour before they close at 2:30. The waiter?? Totally worthless. He didn't write down our order so my daughters food was wrong, didn't bring butter for the pancakes and the salt was missing from every table. He just seemed to be bothered by us even being there. I even had to ask the hostess to refill a drink.  I gave 2 stars for the yummy sandwich."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they are no longer selling their cinnamon rolls. They were the main reason I drove to this side of town for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love this place! No one has better pancakes. Good service, yummy food, and clean place. Also loved the huge drink to go when we were leaving!"}
{"text":"We love to come here. The food is always good and service is always helpful. We LOVE the punch card it helps us be more loyal."}
{"text":"The food was good today but had horrible service from Bailey. She had no personality. She was irritated at my indecisiveness when ordering. She dropped off (literally a \"walk by\" drop off) the check before we were half way done with our meal. Not to mention I wanted a cinnamon roll to go.  I don't think I have not been asked \"Is there anything else I can get you?\"  I had to stop her from running off to tell her I needed the roll.  All in all, disappointing considering that it is my birthday and my honey had taken me out for a birthday breakfast.  On a positive the food was good."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times, as well as other locations (Bell and 35th, Scottsdale and Carefree).  It is a pretty good breakfast place, but the service can often be sub par at this location.     This morning, I brought my parents, wife and 2 year old there.  45 minutes after placing our order we asked how long until our food would be out, 10 minutes after that I went to find the manager.  The manager treated me like I was an idiot, told me that it was taking a while because it was busy (it wasn't very busy compared to some mornings, there were a number of empty tables inside and out).  I explained to her that two tables that were seated 15-20 minutes after us have their meals, and she said it was busy again.  I then pointed out that a family of four that was seated just before us had finished their meal and left, she again told me it was really busy.  I am going to assume that the waitress did not put our meal in, mistakes happen.  I understand that we all make mistakes, but it is what you do after a mistake that makes all the difference.  Don't treat your customers as if they are idiots, tell them that a mistake was made, and that you are fixing it.  To add insult to injury, a waitress tried to carry all of our meals out on her arms with no tray, and dropped my mom's meal.  Happy Mother's Day!  They also forgot a side I ordered.    The manager did take 50% off the bill, in the future I will drive the extra 10 miles to Scottsdale and Carefree Highway, and I suggest you do as well."}
{"text":"Just sat at a table for 15 minutes with no service.  Staff seemed to avoid attempts to make any contact.  Table close by got service after 5 minutes... after hearing other tables having to ask and remind for drinks and similar, we decided to walk out.  Not sure which is worse: horrible service or no service."}
{"text":"They have the best pancakes! Great customer service. Clean environment with outdoor patio seating when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I've been sitting at my booth now for over 5 min and no one will bring us ice cold water when it's 107 out. We also ordered drinks and those have not come yet. Drinks just came with no straws and rude service. Food was not fresh, bread stale and I can not in good faith suggest coming here and spending your hard earned money. Shame on this Owner."}
{"text":"Food is decent especially for price.  The issue was cleanliness and service.  Chairs were messy and after I cleaned off the seat I didn't notice the back was covered in syrup. Now my back is covered...  The table was sticky and one of place settings was in a glass.  Glasses had soap residue as well.  I think we saw our waitress 2 times once for orders and then food a ticket.  I have been to some other GE's that were better, I won't return to this one."}
{"text":"After about 15 visits to this location over this last year it's time to cry uncle . Even with an occasional free breakfast due to punchcard, this place is off our rotation. Cold food , unfriendly servers  and managers. Sometimes you get a water pitcher, sometimes not. Portions get smaller and smaller with at least two price hikes. Sorry good egg, you've gone rotten."}
{"text":"This is my most fav. Place to go ever! I just relocated near Casa grande Az and still drive this 45 mins to get to this location! They have the best food and staff ever! Had a new server today (Rachel) and she was on top of the service. Never had to ask for anything and she knows what she is doing. Love coming here never had as great of service and food anywhere as I do here!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the Good Egg the food,service top notch."}
{"text":"We went in and were about to be seated when a lady told our server to take us to 63. We walked over and the table was next to the bathrooms. I asked if we could have another table and our server sat us at a corner. We decided to leave. Peculiar experience."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the many locations of the Good Egg Egg for years. The food is great and the service is exceptional. The only item that needs some work here is their coffee. It would be wonderful to have some options for lattes, cappuccinos, or flat whites. The coffee they serve is weak and not much flavor. There really is nothing better than a good cup of coffee with your breakfast. Keep up the great work and add some awesome coffee and this place will be perfect."}
{"text":"Food overpriced, and decor was outdated in the 90's , yet they think it still works for them?  I think the last time the place was thoroughly cleaned was back in  the 90's as well.  Food was ok, and that's being nice.  This place is always crowded on the weekends so all I can conclude is that people are really THAT lazy to make breakfast on the weekends.  This is a DNR......"}
{"text":"We had breakfast before heading out of town. Breakfast is above average.  Plenty of seating, and still had a wait on a Sunday morning - good sign.  They had complimentary coffee while you wait. Took a while to get our food, but the staff was super friendly and helped entertain our kids.  Cami, our server, was an outstanding."}
{"text":"Excellent, fast service.  Great selection of food on the menu although very flexible on substitutions.   We were able to order everything eggsactly how we wanted our breakfasts to be.   I love places that when you order coffee leave you the pot, that's a great service.  Prices were eggstremely reasonable.   Eggsceptional service."}
{"text":"Very good and in the same class as First Watch. Substituting the potatoes with black beans is a must."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, atmosphere and friendly staff. Very clean. Good for the whole family. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Although its not the best food it is exactly what a weekend breakfast/brunch spot is all about. Food is average, prices are slightly high, but the overall experience is good every time we come. Clean restaurant with fast service."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to go here on one of my loading days for the diet I was doing, which means I could eat anything I wanted without guilt. I had the beautiful 4 Peaks French Toast, which was absolutely tasty.  The decor of the place is your standard country kitchen with the roosters and the eggs and old kitchen appliances for decor.  Very bright though. There is definitely no darkness in there.  The best part... you can bring 10 friends with you and sit at one of these gimongus tables... and it will fit you all comfortably.  Even if there are only 2 of you, they will sit you at these tables.  To me, those huge tables are brilliant.  Go to other breakfast places and they are always so backed up because of the large parties going out to breakfast and this just solves the whole problem.  Good for them. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Awesome menu. Very flavorful food. I had veggie panini with basalmic vinegar and country potatoes. So good. We will be going back for more!  Staff was nice and delivered food to go very quickly."}
{"text":"Good breakfast.  Always a favorite.  Friendly service, clean and quick even when there is a wait list.  Love trying all the different pancakes they come up with. Always appreciate the punch card so you get every 6th meal free."}
{"text":"I love The Good Egg and this is my favorite location. I am always greeted with big smiles and ushered to my favorite booth. They go out of their way to make things right. Love those BIG pancakes and many other menu items!"}
{"text":"Egg-themed breakfast places...our market is inundated with them. Each one has it's own little piece of flair that they bring to the table to set it apart from the rest.  The Good Egg actually has a couple of highlights that will undoubtedly bring me back.  First things first...I love the menu! It's breakfast, so of course, there MUST be eggs! This menu offers an obscene number of options. The part of the menu that most intrigues me is the healthy options section. There's something called \"La Casa Potencia (Power House)\". This thing is DELICIOUS!   The power house has 6 scrambled egg whites w/ diced chicken, fire roasted green chilies & bell pepper, topped with fresh pico de gallo. served with house black beans, a large whole wheat tortilla and salsa. All said and done, this delicious concoction has 51 grams of protein. FIFTY ONE GRAMS OF PROTEIN! Now THAT'S the way you want to start your morning!  One quick word to the wise. If and when you order this meal, find a way to get the beans on the tortilla without the juices. If you just dump the beans on top of the eggs, you'll end up making a great burrito...that leaks like a sieve. So, it's delicious...but it's messy. Still...worth it!  A common theme in my reviews is my love for a good outdoor seating area. This particular location (one of 15 in the Valley) has a PHENOMENAL outdoor seating area. It's absolutely gargantuan. In all honesty, I think it's about the same size as the actual seating inside the restaurant.   When we were last there, it was late morning. There wasn't a single drop of sunshine shining directly on the patio. Needless to say, the weather was fantastic. Granted, it WAS in early fall, so the weather is typical perfect. But, in the summer time, this patio is still going to be shaded from the sun, thus, a great way to enjoy the outdoors without completely melting.  In the Valley, you have dozens of egg-themed restaurants from which to choose. However, I feel like I've found my favorite! Low calorie/high-protein menu, great prices!  VIVA BREAKFAST!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and won't be going back. Thought I would try again since the first time was take out and was way over priced for what you get. They are remodeling and the staff has no idea who is doing what . Almost walked out was seated and took 5 mins to get coffee and water while one waitress did her job and the other 4 stood around talking. Ordered and wasn't anything special the cook can't read a order. Asked for no gravy and order came with gravy. Finally got it and was just ok. Overpriced for what you get. Weird menu, and service needs work $10 for skillet breakfast that was very small for the price. The biscuits are good"}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent and staff are always nice.  I think what really keeps me coming back is their stamp program where you can get a free meal after so many visits + military discount."}
{"text":"Yum! During my first experience at Good Egg I wasn't that impressed. Due to it's proximity to the bf's abode, I decided to give it another shot. I'm really glad I did!  My first visit was on a Friday morning and the place was pretty dead.  The food was just kind of meh - the bacon and eggs were lukewarm and the biscuit I got was hard. Plus service was lackluster. Huge disappointment.  The second visit was on a very busy Saturday morning and this place was PACKED.  The wait for seating was a good 20-30 minutes.  Luckily it was COLD based on AZ standards so we were able to snag a table outside on the patio immediately.  The patio had some heaters so we weren't affected by the \"cold\" at all.  Our server was awesome, I wish I could remember his name! The food came out in a jiffy and everything was warm, fresh and cooked to perfection.  The biscuit was brown on the outside and perfectly delightful on the inside!!  It totally made my morning.    Random question - can someone please tell me what kind of candies they keep at the checkout? I took quite a few with me last time but now I'm out because they're so yummy. I would love to purchase them and keep my own little stash if only I knew what they were."}
{"text":"I love Good Egg.  That's all there is to say.  It's always great service and great food.  At this particular Good Egg, I liked the special blend iced tea so much our server arranged for me to buy a small amount!  The only con is you can't go to Good Egg on Sunday mornings---those church people will take you out!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food.  My wife and I both had omelettes.  The biscuit was toasted.  I never had a toasted biscuit before but it was good.  Prices seem normal for breakfast food.  Nice atmosphere.  They leave a insulated carafe of coffee on the table.  I like that.  I get to have refills at my desire as opposed to waiting around for the waitress to see the empty cup.  Service was also very good.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was great!! My food as well as my coffe was really delicious. Our waitress Sarah was great! they have a deal going if you purchase a entree, you get a free cinnamon roll and can I tell you the cinnamon roll was good all by itself. It was totally different. Very flaky and cream on top was awesome!! If you have not been you must go!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been to any of the outposts of this Arizona chain.  This morning I had a business meeting in the far North valley so I looked at what was available in the area and decided on here.  Chain quite often means food that will appeal to a large market share without going off in to wild tastes.  And that is what you get here.  I had the Farmhouse Benedict.  Split buttermilk biscuit topped with 2 slices of bacon, 2 turkey sausage patties, 2 slices of bacon, 2 poached eggs and all of it smothered in gravy.  While not being exciting it was OK.  I asked them to cut way back on the potatoes because I hate wasting food and they did and it was a good thing as they were unexciting also.  Service was pretty good but had some pauses in it, like when I asked for my check and I was surprised how long the order took to come out.  This is a pretty new building.  It is well laid out with patios on both the East and West sides so at differing times of the year you can take advantage of the sun's warmth or hide away from it in the shade.  There is at least one round counter type table set up with stools that can be used as either a group table or counter service for single diners.   When I was there the restaurant was almost vacant which is surprising for a Saturday morning at 8.  Seeing what else is in the area I would consider it one of the better choices for casual sit down dining."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast and after waiting 40 minutes we stopped the waitress to find out what is taking so long, and we found out that they lost our order, though they did manage to know that we had 3 coffees, and one orange juice. We liked the old resteraunt, but we're not liking the new set up with the new management, I doubt that we'll go back there..."}
{"text":"I walked into a bank and cashed my check then ask the ladies where I could get a great breakfast. They highly recommended The Good Egg and when I walked in The Good Egg I was greeted with happiness. The establishment was clean and neat. Our waitress, Candace, was very nice. The best part! The freshly squeezed orange juice and my country omelette! Satisfaction level is five stars! :) yum yum yum. I highly recommend this place too and a huge thanks to the bofa tellers. :) I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"Nice find for breakfast on my way back to Phoenix from Flagstaff! Very comfortable, \"eggcelent\" service and good food as well! I will definitely return when back in the area!"}
{"text":"Great for a relaxing comfortable breakfast. Service is always great. We go often. However we would go a bit more often, but it is a little overpriced for what you're getting."}
{"text":"Apparently First Watch took over this Good Egg location. The new renovation looks great, although a lot of the seating was removed. We were first disappointed to see that the entire staff had also changed, although the service was just as good so no complaints there, however the food was less than stellar. I was happy to see they had kept several Good Egg specialties along with the best of First Watch, but when the food arrived, it was all pretty tasteless. I ordered spicy breakfast enchiladas. They were covered in what looked and tasted  turkey gravy with virtually no seasoning at all. My husband ordered a basic breakfast with ham. The ham was dry, the rest also tasteless.  While at first I wondered if removing some of the seating was a bad idea considering how busy I have seen this place get, after eating I can't imagine finding a table will be a problem. Can't say we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Class act with the follow up-and glad management listened to sites like this.  Won't be back - but again thanks for acknowledging"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but a little pricey.  I had the French toast which was about $9.  I may give it another try when I feel like the splurge."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful breakfast. Our waitress was pleasant and accommodating.   The pancakes were awsome, the french toast was perfect.  I am not sure how they did the the eggs so perfect, but they did.  Even the bacon was cooked to perfection.  Their hash was very nice.  It was wonderful to have such a wonderful breakfast with my parents before they left for NY.  The atmosphere is quiet and calm, and you can eat inside or out.  For a memorable time, visit The Good Egg!!!"}
{"text":"Best french toast EVER! GREAT SERVICE..... and even though it almost always busy it's well worth it. Which says a LOT!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful early morning breakfast. My server, John, made it even better with his pleasant, attentive service. Best staff all around. What a great start to my day!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here almost every Sunday... Though get here early to avoid the wait. Food is good, and they've tweaked their menu to show the calories of every dish as well, which is great for those who want to be health conscious.  The prices are average, more expensive than Denny's but the food is superior than Denny's as well.   Much better in service and food preparation than the Cave Creek one, which out of the ones I've tried is the worst one. The Bell road one is between the two and Camelback one is also top notch."}
{"text":"So I previously did a review on the tramonto good egg, and I must say im super bummed I dont feel like I can brag about this location anymore. I loved coming here with my two little ones for the upbeat environment. I dont know if the management has change or what, I do see a few new faces . The food is still good but good with a not so good vibe is just another buisness to me that wants my money and I can put my money where its really wanted and earned. After all this is a customer service industry and a customer should feel that way. Hope things change so il want to come back. :/"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have been to this location, and the food is absolutely outstanding. I had the Lumberjack breakfast and could not finish it it is so much. The gravy is fantastic and the rest of our mail was just as good. Excellent service, spotless restaurant, I had to recommend it."}
{"text":"So yeah not ever doing this again is what we said as we walked out.  Sorry but if you want to eat in a barn it's for you but not us.  Flies everywhere, I even killed a couple using my hat as a fly swatter and staff didn't even seem to notice.  Food was so so what   I could get down that they didn't land on.  Haven't found a decent breakfast place yet."}
{"text":"Went here with some family because we were desperate for food. The food was ok, but I think I just expected to be \"wowed.\" One thing I did like...they had a few choices of hot sauces to add to your food. The staff were friendly, but I don't think I would come back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Super-fantastic place with great food, service, and most importantly patio!  We spent our Saturday morning lounging in their huge patio before heading over to the races as PIR.  My husband had the Wildcat Scramble which he loved and I had the Mach Nacho Benedict, yummy.  The service was eggceptional.  Without a doubt, this is the best breakfast spot in North Phoenix.  We'll be making this our regular hangout for many years to come."}
{"text":"Good options including low carb, high protein.  They have great service and you can get a free meal after so many.  Can't beat it... Love this place!"}
{"text":"Always have great service and the food is usually good.  they always go to the max to make our grandsons happy too."}
{"text":"The women at the hostess counter spoke very rude and she clearly acted \"superior\" to the gal that was about to seat me.  Not a great way to start a meal.  Food is good and my server was great"}
{"text":"We got seated in our booth and got some coffee right away. Our waitress was attentive and flexible giving us the option to put in cream and sugar in it ourselves and kept the refills coming. We both got the California Omelet special. It was pretty good. At first I thought the portion seemed small, but it was just right as I was quite full. Everyone seemed to say that this place is overpriced, but when I was looking online for other breakfast spots there were barely any within a 5 mile radius. Plenty of bagel spots, but no real competition it seemed like. I guess it makes them able to charge a premium. There were definitely plenty of options on the menu, and the place was very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Having the 'Hearty Breakfast' special and its amazing!! My husband had the yogurt parfait and he said it was like having desert for breakfast even though nutritionally it was probably better than mine. Service was great and was surprised to see how empty it was on a holiday weekend Friday morning but most people likely didn't get the day off. Yummy yummy!!"}
{"text":"On our way to Flagstaff, we stopped by the area for gas and a late lunch on a Saturday.... Luckily, this place was still open... What made us try it??  Cop Cars: If 3 cop cars were here eating food...then it must be filling and good. The place was almost empty so we got seated right away. The ambiance had a definite shabby chic/ country feel to it....  True enough...we got our money's worth for our orders. Nothing beats eating breakfast on a non-breakfast hour....  Cory got the Lumberjack and the serving was enough for his appetite. and trust me. It's hard to fill his growling athlete's stomach. He savored every bit of it....And i too got a taste of it. It was good, packed with meat...and the eggs' texture was great and the flavor was amazing.   I, being the more traditional one, got my most favorite breakfast (you can even include lunch and dinner to that)...Bacon and Eggs with Toast. It came with potatoes which I was too full to even touch. I liked how it came with 5 long strips of bacon that were perfectly fried and not too salty. The eggs i ordered came out just the way i wanted. Over-Medium.   If eggs were a topic. This diner makes the best out of their eggs.  Service was excellent and the food held our hunger for the rest of our trip to Flagstaff...with a stopover at Sedona."}
