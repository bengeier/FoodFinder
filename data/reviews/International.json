{"text":"Great place! Much better than Fred's and the Valley bar and grill nearby. Great for sports. Spacious bar and never feels crowded unless a major sport event is on like the World Cup of Soccer."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best wings that Mississauga has to offer crispy , saucy delicious and for the price (Mondays) can't be beat . I highly recommend it to anyone who's an avid wing crusher such as myself."}
{"text":"Nice place with a standard sports bar menu. They cater to a mature but lively crowd. There's also a live band here Saturday nights.  The band that is playimg tonight is quite decent."}
{"text":"Love coming here! International may be tucked away in an industrial area however it has alot of potential.   Been here a couple of times especially for this year's World Cup madness. Coming here when its that packed and busy and their customer service is always great. What i like about this bar is that its an eatery and a bar. So about half of this place is still family friendly and the other part is a normal bar. Iv been here with family and also with friends. But its not a crazy or rowdy type of bar. People come here after work to chill out and some people come with their kids to enjoy their food. As far as the food goes, their food is fresh and tasty. They do have daily specials on their food. Im here on a Monday for their 50 cent wing deal and my tummy is happy. Oh and its not just bar food, they have pasta, souvlakis etc. So you have a variety of diff types of food.    Also i can't say that their food is pricey because its totally not! It's a well run place and i'll totally vouch for this place."}
