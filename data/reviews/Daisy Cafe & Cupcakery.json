{"text":"the best cupcakes in Madison, WI!  I go there for cupcakes; they're fresh and delicious!  However, their coffee and food are not as good as their cupcakes."}
{"text":"The Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery has a well thought out menu with a fewer selections than most places but they have excellent food. I have had breakfast and lunch there- both were good. I always have cupcakes when I go there and they are ALWAYS good. There is usually a unique variety of cupcakes and they barely make it home before I devour them! 
I like this place! Local, independent place lovely interior and cute waiters."}
{"text":"The three cheese grilled cheese I had from here was simply AMAZING! And maybe you're thinking, who goes to a restaurant and orders grilled cheese? And let me tell you, I have been to a few different smaller cafes and restaurants and they can turn something so simple into something you won't forget! This cafe was one of those. 

The cupcakes were very light which was a nice ending to our meal but they were not something I would go back for specifically. 

Cute little cafe and service was quick!"}
{"text":"The cupcakes are to die for.  And I don't even like deserts.  or cupcakes. 

The food is also quite good, but a bit expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Breakfast is great! Fresh ingredients, good price, and full of flavor! Not impressed by the cupcakes but everything else is great!"}
{"text":"Visited here with a large group and they were able to accommodate us without skipping a beat. The food selection is pretty wide and includes both gulten free and vegetarian options. And then there are the cupcakes, they are fantastic. Definitely would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I got the carrot/cream cheese frosting cupcake and loved it. I am a sucker for cream cheese frosting, though. The latte was good, and it was all under $5.

The furnishings are very cute."}
{"text":"I want so badly to give the cupcakery 5 stars. It truly is my favorite and most visited restaurant in Madison. Delicious food, and I am so extremely grateful for the healthy options. I LOVE the vegan \"meat\"loaf. Brunch here is just lovely. I love the atmosphere, and the service is always exceptional. Unfortunately... I haven't been impressed by the cupcakes (and I keep trying!) Since the cupcakes are their namesake I cannot justify the 5th star."}
{"text":"I get nauseous just thinking about the breakfast I had there. Don't understand the great reviews, unless my experience was a fluke."}
{"text":"We were in town for a volleyball tournament and asked around to find a nice place for a group of 10 people to have dinner. We were exhausted from playing out in the sun all day. We couldn't have made a better choice. The food and service were OUTSTANDING. Our server was quick and accommodating. The other staff members were friendly and enthusiastic. The location was convenient and the setting was bright, tidy and charming. And the food was original, filling, fresh and DELICIOUS. If you are visiting Madison, it's definitely worth a visit. Our dinner experience was wonderful -- but we wish we could have been in town longer to try their lunch as well. The lunch menu looked just as creative and inviting. Next time!"}
{"text":"Never had their food, but I am pretty sure that their cupcakes are from a mix.  If not they spent a lot of time painstakingly recreating the taste of a box of yellow cake mix.  
The cupcakes look really pretty though!"}
{"text":"I called in a short notice cupcake order and they didn't grief me about it at all. I got a great assortment of cupcakes at a reasonable. Price. The staff was really nice as well. The cupcakes...I can imagine a few people from my office will be heading over there to check it out now.

I'm really looking forward to going here and eating their actual food as well."}
{"text":"Cute little space, seems very good for children. 

But more importantly, their cupcakes are incredible! They are probably some of the best I've ever had- light and fluffy, with equally light frosting that is not too sweet but adds that extra bit of creaminess to the cake. I have worked my way through five of their flavors which are all delicious: tiramisu (my favorite, the cupcake I think is actually a modified lady finger),  strawberry champagne (my only critique is that the strawberry frosting could have a bit more bite to it), blueberry lemon, red velvet, and chocolate raspberry.

That being said, if you are craving cupcakes after 5pm on Monday through Wednesday, good luck filling your desire with something equally satisfying since they close quite early those days."}
{"text":"First off, if you have kids and are looking for a mid-day stop, this place is a nice fit.  The servers are all very friendly and the theme and room just works for families.

The cupcakes are cute to look at and taste just average...but your kids will love them regardless.  I am by no means an expert on cupcakes.

I do like comfort food however and the 666 chili with chorizo added is really, really tasty.  They also have a sloppy Joe made from chorizo called the Sloppy Jose which is also really good.  

During these tough times I have to drop the snob routine a notch or two and give props when I see nice people trying really hard.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I call their signature offerings the Cupcakes of Indeterminate Flavor, because it's so hard to figure out what they're supposed to be. Too much frosting that has so much grease in it I feel like I've used shortening on my lips instead of Chapstick. Once you get to the cake, good luck. The texture is fine, but what is it? The fillings are random & the only cupcake I can identify on sight is the red velvet, which is nothing spectacular. Any cupcakes I've had from them have been free, which is good because I'd never pay for them."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast/lunch restaurant in town.  I love that I can go here for breakfast and leave feeling good about what I just ate (read: not a greasy spoon breakfast joint).  I love their vegetarian options- tofu scramble, juevos rancheros, grilled cheese and roasted veggie (ok, it sounds simple- but it's really quite tasty- made with bread from Madison Sourdough- it just can't be beat).  They serve awesome tea from the ChaCha teahouse- so good.  I agree that most of their cupcakes tend to be on the dry side, the one standing exception being the Extreme Chocolate- it's amazing, if all other cupcakes have disappointed you here, I do suggest the Extreme Chocolate- or if you're a vanilla fan they have an Extreme Vanilla which is the same concept different flavor.  I'm here often with my daughter and family- we all love it.  Very family friendly :)  Also, they offer excellent service every time."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review this place for a while now. I've been here four times with my boyfriend, and each time has been a wonderful experience (hence why we keep coming back). Every dish I've ordered has been spot on. They have a decent selection of both meat and vegetarian items, all of which are excellent, so everyone can leave happy. The brunch is exceptional and always has enough flavor. I've gotten the huevos rancheros and the veggie omelet, and both were amazing. My boyfriend usually gets the chili-espresso steak hash and he loves it. I have also gotten the veggie enchiladas for dinner, and they were some of the best I've ever had. The food always comes out in a timely manner as well. Also, the cupcakes are amazing, but the chocolate extreme one is my favorite. Michael has been out waiter for 3 out of our 4 visits, and he's always been extremely hospitable and friendly. I wholeheartedly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"These cupcakes were of bake sale variety.   

 I bought 6, and asked for their top sellers.   I was not impressed.  The chocolate cupcake was dry and chewy, not tender and moist.  The buttercream icing had a terrible mouth feel(greasy), with only a hint of flavor.   The banana cupcake was dry and crumbly.   The carrot cupcake had a overpowering nutmeg taste, though the icing was ok.     Madison deserves better."}
{"text":"Can't really give a full blown review since this was an after thought of a stop on our way out of Madison. My husband and I needed a place to pick up some treats to share with his niece and since I'm a sucker for cupcakes this was what my Yelp research led me to.

Ryan and I quickly popped in to grab an assortment of cupcakes. The flavors varied which was a plus and there were some really interesting ones to select from. We got a red velvet, mocha chocolate, hot chocolate, lemon blueberry, buttered rum, and chai latte. My husband tried the mocha chocolate and his only complaint was that there was a bit too much frosting. His niece commented on how the hot chocolate one had marshmallow also in the filling. A friend of mine devoured the red velvet and said it was good while another said the buttered rum was delicious but the cake was a bit crumbly.

Overall the cupcakes were pretty good a little heavy on the frosting side. The other comments I heard from friends and family was that the fillings were tasty and pretty spot on. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Nice staff and good breakfast food. Some highlights are the award winning breakfast sandwich with crunchy bacon, perfect eggs, avocado and more; the french toast strata swimming in maple syrup; and a sandwich with cranberries and gruyere."}
{"text":"Waaaay more than just cupcakes!  My husband and I went there for brunch on a Saturday around 12:30p and we were seated right away.  The place was jumpin', but they have a ton of tables which means almost no wait time.  I had the breakfast sandwich--really delicious, but beware if you're intimidated by messy food (or if you're on a first date!)  The sandwich has a fried egg and by the time it makes it to your table it will be bleeding yolk!  I think I used 15 napkins throughout the course of the meal (okay, only two :)

The potatoes were spicy and just what I needed to wake me up.  Great coffee too if you're thinking of just going to use the wifi.  Will def return for some sweets in the near future."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for brunch, dinner, or a cupcake pit stop, and every time was a disappointment. Their cupcakes are nothing special. For sweets, go instead to chocoletarian or batch. For brunch or lunch, 4&20 is a mile away."}
{"text":"First time here, and ordered my meal to go.  The young lady that took my order was super friendly! I give an extra star for great customer service. The food has that diner comfort feel."}
{"text":"I have to agree with others when they say that the signature item of this restaurant is the worst thing they have (their cupcakes!). I'll save the rest of my cupcake bashing to myself just because they made up for it everywhere else. The FOH staff is always attentive and almost \"too nice\", but in a good way. Food and drinks are amazing. The atmosphere is unique and inviting. Always a good experience when I visit.

{"text":"Daisy Cafe will always hold a special place in my heart since it is where I first went out with my partner. The food is great! The cupcakes are wonderful when you get them when they are fresh otherwise they can taste quite stale. My only issue with this place is the service. For some reason we always overhear other customers having outstanding service but for some reason we are the table that is forgotten. We just went there on 2/11/2015 for the 5th or 6th time and we received bad service once again. Our waitress was complaining when we walked in the door to her co-workers about not feeling well. Upon sitting down she seemed to be in a hurry with us. We placed our order and when the food came out she asked if we wanted anything else and when we said no, she disappeared not to be seen until she came and gave us the check. I had no water or iced tea for my entire meal. What made it worse was when we saw her counting money at the cupcake counter as though she was getting ready to leave. Being handicapped I couldn't just get up and grab her attention and I shouldn't have to. AND while our waitress was checked out the male waiter was giving outstanding service. Although we wished he had seen our table without anything to drink."}
{"text":"We were looking for a sweet treat and decided to try this place. We were both disappointed with our cupcakes. I had the ginger lemon curd with raspberry frosting. The cupcake was dense (like a fruit cake) and I could not taste the ginger (although my friend said it had a strong ginger taste) and the raspberry frosting was sweet but too rich. My favorite part was eating the little teaspoon of lemon curd. I did not finish my cupcake. My friend had the chocolate mocha cupcake and she said she could taste the mocha but she has had better cupcakes made at home. We were not impressed by the taste or the size of the cupcakes. The cupcakes were small and were $2.50 (Mocha Chocolate) and $3.00 (Raspberry Lemon Curd Ginger Cupcake). 

We did like the space in the restaurant as it was roomy with lots of tables. We thought about going back for a meal without cupcakes but probably will not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Throughout my time living in Madison I always loved stopping at Daisy's for their amazing food and cupcakes. I've had many good experiences with them, but I am finally writing a review because of how wonderful of a job they did providing cupcakes and a wedding cake for my wedding this past June. They provided almost 300 cupcakes in 5 different flavors for the wedding, and it was one of the things my guests raved about the most. On top of that, my husband and I got a two tier wedding cake made from their champagne cake with strawberry frosting and it was incredible! Daisy's was great to work with, flexible, on time and made our day that much more special! I would recommend them not only to go and eat their next time you are hungry in Madison, but to also hire them for your next event or party!"}
{"text":"I enjoy taking friends and family who visit us in Madison to Daisy Cafe.  Their food is consistently very good - creative and tasty. My favorite is the Cinnamon and Apple Strata.  I also like the location on Atwood, its a great Madison spot. As a proclaimed cupcake-a-holic, I have yet to find a cupcake that I would order again. While they earn points in presentation, creative flavor combinations, and use of quality ingredients, they always leave me with a feeling that they are incomplete. I think, for me, it is because the cupcakes are not quite sweet enough. But, rest assured, I will continue to go back for more, and I hope to find that perfect just sweet enough cupcake!"}
{"text":"The cupcakes are pretty good but the food is disappointing. I've tried it at least 5 times over the past few years and I'm always sad that I did. Just not tasty."}
{"text":"This amazing little shop has some of the best food around. It is tucked away, but worth every minute. Would make the 2hr drive again from southern WI, just for a meal at Daisy Cafe!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place since everything on their menu sounded delicious.  

Service was okay.  Waiter was overwhelmed and because of the way the table was positioned, he needed to lean completely across the table directly in front of me several times.  Ick.

Our food took a LONG time to arrive, and my potatoes were cold.  The mushroom strata that had sounded so rich and delicious in the menu's description was lukewarm, bland, dry, and overcooked.  I didn't detect any of the cheese and pesto that was supposed to be in it -- maybe they forgot?

Cold potatoes really didn't appeal to me, so I asked for a different side dish that was already prepared (didn't want to risk the long wait again).  The edamame salad he brought just wasn't my thing -- pretty bland and basically the whole thing tasted like raw onions.  Sooo, I tried the fresh fruit that came with the strata.  When you're serving fresh fruit, you really should be sure it actually tastes good.  At least it didn't have the requisite bruised strawberry with nasty, unwashed leaves.  Instead I just got some tasteless melon and a worn-out-looking slice of pineapple.

But everything could be redeemed by their cupcakes, right?  Unfortunately, the cupcake was awful.  I had the chocolate with mocha frosting.  Ick.  The simple chocolate cake recipe on the back of a Hershey's baking cocoa box beats this one by miles.  And the frosting was greasy -- a little bit like adding some chocolate and coffee flavoring to Crisco.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Cupcakes are terrible!  I have given this place a shot a couple times hoping that I just had a bad batch of cupcakes the first time around...but I was wrong!  The cakes were really dry for 3/4 cupcakes I tried and the frosting for all of them was SUPER greasy.  They did not sit well at all and I would definitely not recommend them to anyone.  The food on their menu looked pretty good, but we had only went in for cupcakes and will not be back to actually try their food."}
{"text":"My grilled cheese with roasted veggies was great.  Cute eclectic atmosphere. Good prices.  Cupcakes look yummy but didn't try one yet. Not too much parking."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for cupcakes, once for dinner and today for lunch. I think the lunch menu really shines. Highly recommend the grilled cheese with veggies and they do soy coffee drinks. Cupcakes have been mixed...sometimes divine, with the occasional clunker (caused by a chunk of butter in the buttercream frosting). Best vegan cupcakes in town. Lots of veggie and some vegan options. I do wish they would add a windblock in front of the door. But I've wished for that with all of the building's former tenants."}
{"text":"I feel so lucky that this place is in our neighborhood. It's like my ideal kind of casual restaurant: varied menu, delicious food, friendly staff, warm atmosphere. I love breakfast here, and the meatloaf is a joy. I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"absolutely AMAZING!!  I get all verklempt just thinking about this place actually!  Brandon was our server - ask for him.  This was by FAR one of the best brunches I've ever had.  I also got their fresh brewed green tea - really yummy!  The vibe in this place is so cozy I'm happy just recalling it.  We'll be back for sure!!  My only complaint is that I don't live closer!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here today on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  I got my order to go, so I cannot speak of service when seated, but leaving my order and pick up was smooth and simple.  The food was very good and my husband devoured the cupcake I brought home to him before I could get another bite.  My only complaint was that the building was hot and I was sweating while waiting for my food."}
{"text":"My wife and I planned on going to a different restaurant but since the wait was too long we decided to try daisy's since we had heard good things.  We sat down at the mismatched furniture not sure what we were getting into.  We were blown away!  Good service but the food was awesome.  I had the meatloaf and my wife had the fish fry.  Everything on the plate was delicious.  The chicken tortilla soup was so good we got a bowl to take home!  Who can beat a cupcake for desert?  We can't wait to try this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Cod Fish fry is great here! It's a perfectly breaded piece of fresh cod - you get a nice chunky piece of cod unlike most places in Madison. I'm always on the hunt for the best fish fry in Madison and this is on the top of my list along with Lake Perch Fish Fry from the Seafood Market. 

I usually am not a big fan of coleslaw but the one they have here is actually really good! 

The portion is well sized. For less than $10 you get the fish, a huge serving of coleslaw, and lots of potatoes. I was stuffed to the brim and couldn't even finish everything on the plate. Love it, can't wait to try brunch here! 

Also, I should add service was just right here - quick, efficient, and the waiter was good in coming over when needed. I hate it when waiters/waitresses come over every 5 minutes to 'check' on you when you're in the midst of trying to enjoy your meal. This place does it well between checking in you regularly enough so you don't have to be looking for them and waiting around, and checking so often you're tired of their voice. Kudos to Daisy's Cafe!"}
{"text":"Half a block from my house and consistantly awesome food.  I love Daisy Cafe.  New menu items that we tried were all great: housemade chicken sausage, chicken tostada appetizer, Rustic Mexican Chicken with rice and black beans.  I'm sure I'll be back later this week or something. Julia, Luis and Ryan Ramig are the best.  Now if only we could get you to open for dinner on Sundays and Mondays....."}
{"text":"I ate at Daisy today and the meal was great. I had the Daisy cod sandwich and my husband had the smoked salmon omelet. The cod was flaky and hot, and the potatoes were perfectly seasoned. 

We got a couple of cupcakes to go. We dived into them later that evening, and mine tasted like it had been sitting in the case for a week. So stale and dry. Was totally excited about eating that cupcake and was so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is good here.  My mocha was pretty tasty too, though I wish they had almond (or any nut) milk.  There is lots of seating.  It's much bigger inside than I imagined.  I had a breakfast sandwich and it hit the spot.  The potatoes were just OK.  I didn't have any room left over for cupcakes, but they looked adorable.  Many had bacon on them if you're into that (I'm not).  
My husband ordered a strata.  He liked but not loved it.  
The only strange part of this place was our server.  First of all, she was the only server, taking care of every table in the restaurant, and doing a great job at it.  The odd thing was her outfit.  She was wearing a strapless dress that was kind of flesh colored and she looked naked!!!!!!!!  Every single customer in the place was wearing far more clothing than her.  It didn't really bother me, but also didn't seem totally appropriate.  Though I'm still getting used to Madison.  Perhaps dress codes here are more casual than all the other places I've lived."}
{"text":"i heart this place for breakfast.  

uber strong coffee - check.  friendly service - check.  cute mismatched chairs and tables - check.  great selection of tasty morning noshes - check.  cupcakes-to-go on the way out - check, check, check."}
{"text":"Cupcakery,
If you're reading this, please take the following as a compliment...
After eating here, I felt like I should have just taken the day off, gotten high, and wandered around State Street for the afternoon.
The chill-ness of this place kind of permeates into your bones.  It's just a kitsch, cool, Madison breakfast joint that you should check out."}
{"text":"I stopped in for an impromptu lunch with friends from out of town, and whole group was impressed with the meal. Obviously, this place can't compare with Bunky's old decor in this location, but flower paintings and pleasant staff provided a warm atmosphere.

Our courses ranged from the gigantic burgers to the French toast to the avocado omelet. I just got a small cup of chili with a brioche. All the food was great, made with fresh ingredients, and severed quickly.

Nearly everyone bought cupcakes to go. I can't say how my friends fared, but I loved the carrot cake and blueberry in my box."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! My friend had the huevos rancheros and I had the tofu scramble, one of the best I've had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was so pleased. I had a ham and gruyere cheese sandwich with a side of the edamame salad. Not only did the food come to our table very quickly after we ordered, but it was SO DELICIOUS. I also had a red velvet cupcake which was very yummy. A bit small for what I'd except from a place that has \"cupcakes\" in its name, but enjoyable nonetheless. 
Staff is friendly and the store is cute and quirky. 
Parking lot is tiny tiny tiny, so I had to park a block down."}
{"text":"I haven't had their food yet but the cupcakes are off the hook. The cupcakes are super intense but SOO good. 

My sister gave me a few for my birthday. 
Maple frosting/Bacon = Kind of weird. But ok. 
Peppermint/Chocolate = YUM!
Blueberry = effing amazing
... err I can't remember the last one. My birthday was a few weeks ago..

Point being... having just had the cupcakes I'd definitely try the food too."}
{"text":"Meh is good description for the Daisy Café, it has a lot of potential and then seems to let you down. The concept of this restaurant is great: homemade cupcakes and a menu with unique and semi healthy fresh food and in a welcoming environment. However, the service is incredibly slow. We visited there today for lunch and with the restaurant only half full it took a very long time to get our food. Once the food finally arrived one of the dishes was not what my friend had ordered and had to be sent back to the kitchen. Her correct dish did not arrive until after we had all finished our meals. She was never offered for the price of her dish to be taken off of the check, or a free cupcake or anything to make up for the inconvenience. That was disappointing and seemed like a lack in customer service. When we asked the waitress, who was friendly, what the soup of the day was her response was that she was unsure, she had to go check. The food itself is ok. The items as they are listed on the menu are deceiving because they sound great until the actual dish arrives and is ultimately just average, semi greasy food. Once you are finished with your meal you have to wait to pay at a counter on your way out and this too takes a very long time."}
{"text":"Casual place for brunch with consistently good food and service, I can't count the number of times we've been here over the last few years. I almost always get the egg sandwich and highly recommend it with a free substitute of avocado and tomato in place of bacon. Good and easy place to take guests."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was fantastic!  I had the egg sandwich (fried egg, bacon, cream cheese, purple onion and cilantro on grilled rosemary bread. Served with oven-roasted potatoes and fresh fruit) and loved every bite - I would have loved more bacon on the sandwich, but it was tasty nonetheless.  The servers were friendly and attentive - my cup of coffee was never empty.  They should drop the \"Cupcakery\" and focus all their attention on the \"Cafe\".  We will be back!"}
{"text":"i was SOOOO excited that a cupcakery was finally opening in madison, and rushed over during their first week.  i was a little bit disappointed when i looked into the bakery case and saw a rather homogeneous bunch of cupcakes.  it was their first week, so i will cut them some slack for their utter lack of creativity. i also thought perhaps their lack of external pizazz would be compensated by really great flavor.

this was sadly not the case.  the cupcake itself a little bit dry for my liking, but also very bland.  it tasted like a lot of flour mixed with a little sugar, and very little else.  the frosting was the real let down though. my \"blueberry\" frosting (recommended by the girl at the counter, who also seemed to have no idea what she was doing) tasted like butter. whipped butter.  i didn't taste even a hint of blueberry, despite its tepid cornflower color.  i could barely taste any sugar. it was a huge let down.

my girlfriend and i, avid cupcake lovers, couldn't finish our one little cupcake.  i was so disappointed, i haven't been back since. however, a few of my friends are more forgiving, and went back. each and every time they have been disappointed. i hope that the daisy cafe can step it up and provide some tasty cupcakes- i really want to like them, and they are right down the street from me. but for now, i'll keep buying carl's cakes at montys."}
{"text":"Seriously people! Anything less than a 5 star rating was done by amateurs. I seriously had the BEST cupcake in my life and I've tried a lot of cake in my day. I ordered the Red Velvet Gluten-Free cupcake and it was absolutely amazing!!! The food was also wonderful and the staff were very friendly. They also have soy milk for the latte's. Yay! Top notch establishment!"}
{"text":"This place is bullshit. The cupcakes still suck, but if they couldn't suck enough, they actually got smaller! As far as \"Restaurant Week\" goes, Daisy should take note that they're actually a part of Restaurant Weak. I hate the cupfakery, their annoying food that third graders can make, and prices only idiots would pay."}
{"text":"Atwood has really grown lately with the opening of the Ironworks Cafe in the Goodman Community Center and the Daisy Cafe & Cafery nestled in the spot that used to house Bunky's.  Thankfully the Daisy renovated the space and it's very nice inside now.  There are some familiar and friendly faces here as several staffers also work at Monty's down the street so the service was great.  They have a full breakfast and lunch menu and a slew of different cupcakes to try.  I was at first a little disappointed when I saw the cupcakes because even though they were all lovely they seemed to be very basic cupcakes with different frostings and I was expecting a little more variety out of a \"cupcakery\" but when I tried the cupcakes they quickly changed my mood.  The cake part is very soft and moist and all of the frostings are perfection and tasted very fresh.  All in all the Cupcakery is a welcome addition to the Atwood area and Madison in general and as packed as they were I think it's a safe bet to say they'll be around for quite awhile."}
{"text":"Great place for tasty, locally sourced brunch! Walked in at peak brunch time on a Sunday: No wait for a table, friendly service and hot coffee! What more could you want? The decor is artsy and adorable, lots of mosaics and stained glass. Oh, and the cupcakes are AMAZING! So glad to have a great place within walking distance of my place!"}
{"text":"Met friends for brunch here today and can't wait to go back. Loved the comfortable, kitchen-table seating, friendly, quick service but the food was the star. 

Two of us had breakfast, one an omelette and one a plate of chili espresso steak hash with basted eggs; two had lunch, one the No-Meat meatloaf and the other the New Mediterranean sandwich. All four of us commented on how the food was perfectly seasoned and cooked. With the exception of adding catsup to the potatoes with the hash and omelette, there was no need to adjust the seasoning at all. The person with the hash was impressed that the basted eggs were correctly cooked. The absolute best part was the carrot-parsnip-saffron cupcake - it had a moist, tender cake with crispy, caramelized edges, a tasty cream filling, and a light, sweet icing. Mmmmmmm. Delicious as it was the mocha chocolate came in second. One great thing about the cupcakes - they are incredibly good and very satisfying, but are a reasonable size, just right for one person. It's nice not to over-eat something wonderful because a treat is larger than your fist."}
{"text":"A family favorite. My family of four have been to the Daisy several times. It has become the go to stop that we all love. We feel right at home and get good food and service."}
{"text":"This eclectic little eatery is a hidden gem on Willy street. Fresh food with the right variety of options to tantalize the taste buds but not overwhelm the mind muscles. Recently had the specialty egg sammy that was divine but the highlight was definitely the edamame salad. Bomb.com for realsies. Super hipster vibe reflected by the laid back style of the staff who you may have to remind you're a patron needing service while they're lost in Mad Men dreams of the past.  That's what I'm assuming is going on because they're too friendly to knock their service but let's just say lower your expectations and focus on the food and you'll be right as rain. Toys for the tots if you got 'em and a bright, friendly atmosphere true to the soul of Willy locale."}
{"text":"The chorizo & avocado omelette changed my opinion of the meat from negative to positive, and the breakfast potatoes were among the best I've ever had.  Toffee and cherry ale cupcakes were divine. Only quibble was that the service was pretty slow, probably due to insufficient servers for a busy Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I love the food, especially the stratas! (YUM!!) 
However, after a bad experience with the waitstaff I will not be going back. I went to breakfast with my daughter on Saturday morning and had a male waiter (I forget his name). I like how the staff at the daisy work together, and you can tell because other waiters and waitresses step in to deliver your food and fill your drinks. I have liked every waiter I have had there thus far, and have no complaints there. However, I was absolutely appalled when I overheard my waiter Saturday making comments of a sexual nature about my 16 year old daughter, when he was well over 25. Maybe I misheard him and he was talking about another customer, but in either case, I found it wholly unprofessional and inappropriate. I tipped him a dollar and went on my way, and I don't think I'll return for awhile, or at least on a day when he's not working."}
{"text":"We have only eaten here once, but I sure wish we had one of these at home. Fresh food, using local produce. Good value, Good for kids. Did not try the cupcakes. Loved the chicken and chutney sandwich, orzo pasta salad, sloppy joe, coleslaw, root beer. The TBA sandwich was OK. 
LIttle living room area was nice to let my infant play with their toys while we waited for food to arrive and to be seated."}
{"text":"Cupcakes and meatloaf?  How dare you tug at my heartstrings!  

Needless to say, I thought this spot was simply just a cafe/cupcakery.  Little did I know they served a damn fine dinner.  We strolled in to find a warm and cozy atmosphere, killer service and excellent food.  I opted for the bacon meatloaf and it lived up all my expectations.  Studded with carrots, it was heavy on the rosemary, which I happen to like and the ancho ketchup really rounded things off.  My wife's fish fry was legit in every way; a nice chunk of panko-encrusted cod, panfried and served with coleslaw and potatoes.  We finished off the meal with cupcakes.  I opted for an eggnog with brandy frosting and it was damn tasty.  

We can't wait to go back.  Breakfast, here we come!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Daisy Cafe! I would highly recommend their apple cinnamon strata and a bottomless cup of coffee. It atmosphere is fun, service is timely, and the food is excellent. This is defiantly one of the east side's hidden gems."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch when we were just passing by Madison.  It sure beats anything you can get at an exit just off the interstate, and it was not too far out of the way.  The food was good and the staff was pleasant and of course we got come cupcakes to go.  We would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. All 8 of us at the table really liked everything we ordered. The cupcakes were blah. Our table shared 4 different kinds. I'd go back for dinner anytime, but never eat dessert there again."}
{"text":"The cupcakes are okay. The favors sound fun and interesting, but are so-so.

The food here is great.  I've been a few times for lunch and have been consistently pleased.  They have great, hearty vegetarian selections, which isn't the easiest thing to come by in Madison (we still are in Wisconsin, after all).  The veggie sausage option at breakfast is swell.

My fave so far is the portabella sandwich and the fiesta slaw.  The chili is also great - mildly spicy and very hearty.  My father, an avowed carnivore with blatant disrespect for my vegetarian ways, even likes the chili!

The acoustics are awful. It's impossible to hear your dining companions."}
{"text":"I finally made it to this place for lunch last week. I don't have enough time to go out to lunch during a normal work week and since the place closes before dinner it's taken me a while to stop by. I enjoyed the meatloaf that I had. It has a few slices of bacon wrapped around it and nice chunks of veggies throughout. I think it would be nice and comforting to enjoy this winter. The veggies that came with seemed oily to me. The potatoes were fine, but nothing to write home about. Service was mostly pretty good although it did take a long while to get the refill on my iced tea. 

Like others I had to try out a cupcake for dessert. I went with red velvet. It was good but not great. The size is somewhat small for the price and the flavors didn't wow me. In the future I think I'll just wing down to Monty's and get one of the Carl's Cakes cupcakes if I'm craving one."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite brunch place in Madison. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside has a \"home\" feel to it. And the Chili Espresso Steak Hash is the best breakfast I've had in my life. I could eat there all day."}
{"text":"Took the kids. My oldest said it was the best burger he'd had. Had the Reuben meatloaf - very good. TBA sandwich also good. The cupcakes were just okay, though."}
{"text":"Been coming here for brunch for quite a while.  While it is a cupcakery, the brunch is extraordinary.  They also have great coffee and the service is happy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite casual spot in Madison. Standouts for me are huevos rancheros for breakfast, new Mediterranean sandwich for lunch and Daisy fish fry for dinner. Every dish I've tried is bursting with flavor. They have something for everyone, from vegan to beefy bacon burgers. The service is always prompt and friendly and the dining area is cute and cozy. Cupcakes aren't usually my thing but these are amazing. With so many flavors to try, you'd regret not grabbing a box of 4 on your way out."}
{"text":"Best egg sandwich ever!  It's on rosemary bread with avocado, bacon, tomato and is delish.  The cupcakes are totally worth the calories!"}
{"text":"I am seriously committed to weekend brunch and this place delivers. LOVE the staff. LOVE the owners. We have hosted fundraising events in the back room and had staff meeting here for work and always been thrilled. We come for the people and stay for the food. Personally, I'm not a fan of the cupcake thing- in general- but fortunately- they have tons of tasty food for all palates. The whole grain pancakes are seriously delicious.  

The AC is a bit anemic in the summer -so you might avoid coming here on the hottest day of the year. 

Recommend the biscuits and gravy weekend special. It always puts a smile on my face!"}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD. They are extremely accommodating with food allergies (but you'd never know by the taste. It's all so good). My husband had the huevos rancheros with chorizo and black beans, which was more like a flavorful vegetable hash. I had the salmon, pesto, and goat cheese omelette, which was delicious and just the right amount of fluffy. The potatoes are very garlicky. 

The best part after the savory? Those cupcakes. We had the gluten free chocolate mocha one, and my child proclaimed that it was the best cupcake she's ever had - including gluten ones.

Come here. Eat happy. 

8/2/16 - still wonderful!"}
{"text":"Just went here with the kiddos.  We didn't even get cupcakes and LOVED it!  The orzo vegetable havarti salad is soooooo good!!  Pretty much every plate was clear!  The kids chicken is grilled, which my eldest didn't realize when she ordered (her bad for not reading the word \"GRILLED\"), so she didn't love it, damn kids and their love of deep fried chicken strips.  I didn't think I was so hungry when we went in, but couldn't stop eating!!  I had the TBA (turkey, bacon, and avacado), I devoured it.  I will definitely be coming back here next time I am in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with cupcakes from Daisy Cafe.   We shared with friends however, since it was my birthday, I got the first choice!  My cupcake (in very cute paper) had an amazing-just-out-of-the oven homemade moistness with a a deep chocolate flavor.  It was exactly how a good cupcake should taste!  It also had just the right amount of icing that didn't overwhelm the cake!  Thanks, Daisy Cafe!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a return trip.  A warm and friendly interior, each table is different, one from the next.  Mismatched chairs and tables, ready to seat two to four to more, seemingly from antique shops all across Wisconsin.  With paper lanterns warmly lit above you, I love how each table makes you feel like you're sitting in someone's cozy kitchen. 

The menu offered a variety and was fairly priced.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  Food was so-so, but I'd be up for trying again since I really liked the ambiance and energy.  I had the Strata (which was a bit to bread-y for me, but I suppose I should have known better).  We went around 10am on a Sunday and were able to get a table without a problem. By 11am, there were still tables available!  Nice...   The place was definitely family-friendly (translation: NOT quiet) so don't go thinking this is a cafe where you are going to be working on a term paper!  All in all, I'm ready to go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places in the Atwood area.

I am particularly fond of the meatloafs, original and tasty! I've also had their yummy burgers and pasta. So far, I have yet to be disappointed. Food is delicious, cupcakes weren't bad, and servers are great!

The place itself is cute and quaint with a dining and casual coffee shop feels and very kid friendly (but not overly). It's comfortable and you can't go wrong with the meals."}
{"text":"This places makes me feel happy because of all of the art and bright colors. To top it off, the vibe is very cool and it's a great place to relax. The menu has lots of great multi-ethnic inspired foods and the best homemade cupcakes that you will ever have in your life! I ordered the Chorizo, Avocado, and Cheese Omelet with a mimosa. The chorizo was homemade and probably the best chorizo that I've had this far. It had lots of flavor, tasted fresh, and matched well with the omelet. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and the mimosa had the perfect balance since it wasn't too acidic. And the cupcakes...... I tried the vanilla bean and the chocolate and they were delicious! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place every time I'm in Madison I always stop in. The menu is full of options. And don't forget the cupcakes they are super good.  My favorite cupcake is the cinnamon one. Try it it's a party en la boca."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Everything I've had here has been amazing.  Everyone I have taken here has agreed.  House made chorizo is wonderful.  Can't go wrong with their breakfast food!  However, cupcakes were just so-so."}
{"text":"Used to be one of our favorites, but something changed and they are really going downhill.  The last few times we've been there, we've gotten pretty terrible service and even a little bit of attitude from the staff.  Lately, the coffee tastes old and reheated, but I still consider myself lucky if I can get more than two refills during a slow brunch.

Today, after an hour they finally brought out our pancakes and they forgot the maple syrup.  My wife went up to ask, and got a dirty look, like she was a nuisance for wanting syrup with our pancakes.  That's when it finally dawned on me that I've been way too forgiving of this place for wasting everyone's time.  It's time for Daisy's to close down and give that spot to someone who actually wants it."}
{"text":"I want to find another star for this review but just cannot.

Great service and  in my neighborhood yet I just can't get into it. Maybe it is what I ordered, a smoked salmon salad,  but this is not the first time I was underwhelmed.
My dining companions loved their meals, chicken and salmon. Maybe it is me.

My salad was so uninspired. Lettuce, Gorgonzola and salmon with some onion. Nothing crunchy, nothing special. It was fresh and of sufficient size. That is all I can say.

I have eaten at Daisy a few times before. I have had their breakfast strata and enjoyed that just fine. I once had the veggie chili and really liked that!. I have had a couple of sandwiches I can't remember and some meatloaf i did not care for.

I had a fancy cupcake which did nothing for me. Maybe that is a good thing because I do not need the calories or the sugar.

I will go back, likely for breakfast.

Each to their own."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  After a nice dinner my wife and I wanted cupcakes and were wishing for a cupcake place in Madison like Molly's in Chicago (see past reviews).  So, I whipped out the Droid phone and...a cupcake place in Madison!  So we took the drive over to Daisy Cafe & Cupcakery.

Well, we go there and after walking in we noticed they had two options...vanilla with chocolate frosting and chocolate with vanilla frosting.  Are you kidding me?  I can buy that at a grocery store.  The worst part is when we asked if they made a variety and different cupcakes (because a place known as a cupcakery should make unique cupcakes to me) they responded with \"the case is normally full.\"

Disappointed we decided to try their cupcakes and WOW how boring werethese things!  Not only were they hard on the top of them but they lacked in any sort of flavor and the frosting was really nothing but whipped cream.  

SUGGESTION:  Make you own cupcakes or go down to Molly's Cupcakes in the Lincoln park area of Chicago."}
{"text":"A neighborhood favorite of locals, but not a go-to of mine. Service can be slow and disappointing. Food is good, but typical of a Wisconsin diner. Nothing I cannot make at home better. 

The cupcakes are flat, greasy and overpriced."}
{"text":"I love this place, the atmosphere is bright and energetic and the food is delicious. Service was great too, I like how they right away ask if you want coffee and keep your cup full with good quality stuff the whole time. Our waitress was very prompt and polite and not pesky. 

I got the chorizo omelette which came with perfectly ripe avocado, yummy roasted (but not burnt) red potatoes, a biscuit style cupcake and fresh fruit to wash it all down with. I highly recommend this place to anyone and plan on coming back again!"}
{"text":"This *is* the best brunch place in Madison. I *will* fight you in a physicial fight about this.

Because cupcakes.

But also, their spicy breakfast options are awesome, and that's what I want.

And their mimosas are the best.

So in review: Cupcakes + spicy breakfast + mimosa = Correct! Maybe even #Correct!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to dragging myself over to the East Side to try this cafe. I've been looking for a new brunch place and I was pleasantly surprised. We got there around 11:00, so it was pretty crowded - maybe a 10 minute wait. 

I got the chorizo avocado omelet and my friend got the bacon cheddar omelet. From looking around, I really want to go back and try a strata and also the egg salad sandwich. The omelets are huge - and not just because of the egg. They're packed with stuff. I think mine had more meat than it had egg - though the avocado was really lacking (not quite ripe yet). The side potatoes were also quite good.

Unfortunately, I'm not a cupcake person, so I passed on dessert. My friend got a chocolate cupcake, but she was not impressed. She didn't feel like it had enough taste.

Service: Very friendly, but our waitress did forget to bring us ketchup and was a little slow with checking in. Good about the coffee refills though, which is definitely a plus for brunch.
Environment: Nice space - bright and sunny. Mismatched decorations give it that charm. They have a couch and some chairs for waiting as well."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast on a sunday. Had huevos rancheros el daisy..with chorizo.. Fantastic... Wonderful flavor and texture... Stole some of my sisters potatoes and they were good.  It was pretty busy.  We had to wait a half hour to get seated, but there were 8 of us and the hostess did tell us ahead of time it would be a half hour.  The food came out pretty quickly for as busy as it was. Some of the cupcakes that I see people raving about caught my eye, but I didn't indulge. I think I wish I did."}
{"text":"When cupcake is ur staple then I expect them to b phenomenal unfortunately they took a back seat to the food. I'd come here again for sure but not for the cupcakes--frosting was terrible, I can tell it's a butter cream of sorts but it's not tasty; I did however love the icing in the center--for some reason they don't use the same on top, what a costly miss."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious!

My former coworker and friend got me hooked on Daisy Cafe! It's a smaller restaurant that packs a really great punch! The food is phenomenal and the people are so friendly. 

There are only a few restaurants where I can say that I enjoy the entire menu, and this place definitely has won that title...although there are items on the menu that I favor more than others. My absolute favorite dish is the Daisy cod sandwich, with a side of edamame salad; they don't skimp on the portions in the sandwich and it is melt-in-your-mouth amazing."}
{"text":"Showed up at my son's parent-teacher conference the other day with the following four sublime gourmet cupcakes from Daisy Cafe & Cupcakery: 1) Chocolate cake with Raspberry buttercream frosting, 2) Lemon cake with Blueberry buttercream frosting, 3) Red Velvet cake with Cream Cheese frosting, and 4) Gingerbread cake with Lemon buttercream frosting. (The super helpful gentleman at the checkout counter patiently advised this gourmet cupcake novice, then labelled each one so we'd be sure to know what we were eating.) I'm pretty sure my son's teacher thought she'd died and gone to heaven! With this place I'll probably never bake another birthday cake. After all, variety is the spice of life and this place has got it! Be sure to try the pie-inspired cupcakes, too. Once you get over the fact that the cupcakes look too good to eat, you'll simply be amazed at the way the buttercream frosting melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Daisy is one of my favorite places to go for some breakfast! One of my good friends (who used to live in Madison) was visiting. We decided to come here for breakfast before going to a bridal shower. Worst - service - ever. I think we sat at the table a good 10 minutes before the waiter came by to take our drink orders. We ordered our food shortly after.  We were waiting..and waiting... I started to see people ordering and getting their food (they came in after us) and leaving. It didn't help that I had a migraine and it was SOOO loud in there. About 30 minutes went by and I went up to the counter and asked about the food. She said that they were working on it and the ticket was there. Now, it's been over an hour that we were sitting there. I went up to the waiter and asked what in the world was going on. He said it should be out in a minute. It did finally come out about 5 minutes later. The waiter stated that the 'kitchen lost the ticket'.  Well - the other woman that checked before saw the ticket, so we were led to believe the waiter just forgot to put our order in and then lied to us.  My friend ended up being VERY late for the bridal shower. The food was good, but such a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Amazeballs custom cupcakes!
Ordered custom cupcakes and blew away my expectations.  Amazing!
Easy to work with for custom orders.  My client nearly peed in their pants and didn't' want to eat them they were so perfect and pretty.  Daisy Cafe and cupcakery is now on speed dial (that is if I still had a phone like that).
I need to get back over there to actually sit down, enjoy the coffee, other foods and I heard their bloody mary's might shame your mother."}
{"text":"I've been here twice while visiting family and I will say with me moving to Madison in the new few days I do plan on stopping in more often :)

The first time I was here we came for dinner, cousins raved about the place and how good their breakfast was...but wanted to try it out for dinner.  The food was great, love the atmosphere here very homey. The staff was pleasant, but the wait on the food, to get a drink, and to get a refill was extremely long for the amount of people that were in there.
 
The second time I visited we decided to stop in for breakfast, for a weekday it was surprisingly busy. Got a coffee and the breakfast sandwich and substituted the bacon for avocado and tomato. Now, I found a new found love for avocado, so this bfast sandwich was to die for, for my taste buds. The service was alot better this time around, speedy, very friendly, and attentive to all of her tables!

Definitely stopping in alot more :)"}
{"text":"Food here wasn't particularly bad, but I don't see myself coming back regularly, at least not for dinner. For one, the dinner menu is somewhat limited (especially if you don't eat pork) and I found myself wishing I could just get something off the lunch menu. I had a decent meal that didn't cost me much, along with decent service that was kind of slow, but not unreasonable.

We started off with a bloody mary that's purported to have 10 flavors in it, but tasted more like it had 2. I had to load that thing up with hot sauce and pepper myself to keep it from tasting like a cup of thin tomato juice.

The southwest \"steak\" (read: random hunk of low-grade meat) was as bloody as a rare steak but as tough as a well-done one, and the marinade just tasted like black pepper and nothing else. It came with a pile of peppers that tasted like anything you'd get at a grocery store, and some green salsa that was pretty excellent on its own merit. 

So, the good. I also ordered a bowl of vegetarian chili that was perfectly satisfying even to a voracious carnivore. It was loaded with several different kinds of beans and had just the right amount of burn to it. The spices made the chili taste really warm and hearty; it left a great aftertaste that was perfectly hot without making you break a sweat and reach for the water.

My crappy steak also came with some soft, buttery fingerling potatoes that I would be sure to order again - on their own. They were sweet and creamy, almost like mashed potatoes.

Ultimately, Daisy Cafe's inconsistently good food as well as their slightly off-putting environment makes me ambivalent about getting a meal here again. But it does have its draws. I also grabbed a chocolate mousse-filled cupcake on the way out that was worth all 3 dollars I spent on it. Richest, most delicious fucking chocolate cupcake I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for restaurant week and once for lunch. They have amazing food. Their entrees were way more than i expected from a cafe and cupcake place. Absolutely delicious  Food seems to take a little bit in my experience but has always been worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place rocks! They have an excellent variety of cupcakes (vegan, gluten-free, etc) with a huge dining room that let's you just sit and chat without rushing you out. The only downside is the small parking lot, but the neighborhood offers lots of places if the lot is full, and you can park on Atwood. :-)"}
{"text":"I would have loved to give them five stars having attended many meetings and meet-ups there as I LOVE the quirky, artsy atmosphere and the staff are always amazingly friendly and helpful (besides any, yes any, cupcake you try is delightful and sweet-tooth-satisfying). I always feel comfortable and welcome there and feel I get a fair deal for my dollars -- great for a coffee and cupcakes with a friend (or friends!). 

The one star gets knocked off because I'm a persnickety vegetarian. I rarely go out to eat BECAUSE I'm a persnickety vegetarian and: I shouldn't eat and don't enjoy green salads, I'm so over fried/grilled/roasted/raw veggies wedge between bread and billed as a \"sandwich\" (that includes portobello mushrooms marinated in balsamic -- so over-played); having grilled cheese as my entrée isn't my idea of dinner out; and I'm always grossly disappointed when I do go out to eat a meal. I just want MORE than the standard vegetarian fare ... I can do that at home. That stated ...

It was 2 p.m. and I was meeting my mentor there to talk business, I hadn't eaten lunch and was hungry for real FOOD (not my go-to cupcake and java), so I ordered the Grilled Cheese and Roasted Veggies. It read beautifully, \"Gruyère cheese and roasted vegetables, grilled on sourdough bread and served with tomatillo-avocado salsa.\" The tomatillo-avocado salsa wasn't ... it was red and tasted more like a roasted red pepper sauce. Delicious, but not what I expected. The cheese and bread were lovely, except the bread was so coated in that (what my taste-buds believe to be) oil/artificial butter spread which most restaurants use ... so every bite I took I had to wipe my hands and mouth ... it was a lot and it really knocked the sandwich and experience down a notch. The roasted vegetables were okay, but very moist and I'm not a big fans of wedges of onion (there was a LOT of onion with just a few chunks of squash, tomato, etc. -- really not a fan of chunks of veggies as a sandwich, I think slices would be much more practical anyway and perhaps more satisfying).

Not that anything tasted bad by any means (other than that oil stuff, ick), but I think I'm just ready to call a fig a fig; I don't go out to eat *meals* often because vegetarian fare is boring (or bland) and being a persnickety vegetarian -- I'd like to ask every restaurant to raise the bar for vegetarian fare (they could start seeing new smiling faces -- like mine -- in their establishments more often)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - eclectic artwork, community-related posters and playbills - it is just a great local vibe to it.  I stopped by this cafe on a recommendation from a Madison friend for brunch and was really happy with it the minute I walked through the door.

A large menu offers something for everyone: they code each dish for gluten, and veg*ns, so it was simple to find something that met my specifications.  I loved my tofu scramble! The spices were savory and well-done. Husband got a sandwich which he also enjoyed.

If we lived in Madison, I think we would be regulars."}
{"text":"Dropped in and got a strawberries and champagne cupcake. Light, and delicious! I would definitely get it again."}
{"text":"I have been to Daisy probably 20 times now and it is definitely one of the better brunch places on the east side.  I usually get the Sloppy Jose, wife likes the egg dishes.  

The wait on weekend mornings has never been bad, I think I have had to sit only once otherwise always had a table.

The non-egg breakfast stuff has never been great and the dinner fare did not interest me but for brunch it's great.

The cupcakes have always been good though I think the ones with genache and other non-butter frostings are a lot better.  They tend to be more expensive as well, but some are really good and just the right size.  Being real cake and not styrofoam they do not last well in the fridge or otherwise."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town for breakfast, lunch and dinner. First, there is a reason the team wins the friendliest staff award in the annual Isthmus poll. We have always had outstanding service, both friendly and helpful.

The menu is extensive and accommodates a variety of tastes and food allergies. Vegetarians, vegans, carnivores, herbivores, locavores, Atwoodavores, blah, blah, etc., etc., will love it here.

My favorite thing on the menu is the panko breaded cod sandwich. I'm not into gigantic sandwich buns so I end up scraping off the sauce and eating the sandwich with a knife and fork and eating 1/2 the bun. 

Today I decided to order the sandwich without the bun. Why didn't I think of this earlier? The presentation was beautiful. I had two pieces of the cod, a side of slaw (nice, light slaw, not drowning in dressing), side of the special pesto sauce, side of tartar sauce (which I did not eat - not my thing) and a side of fruit. It was a perfect lunch, and as I added it up in My Fitness Pal, it was just about 500 calories, even with the breadcrumbs on the fish. Eating healthy in a restaurant is very difficult, but I feel like I know what I'm eating at this restaurant.

And, oh my god, don't forget the cupcakes. I skipped one today but have had nothing but great cupcakes in the past. My only complaint is they are light on the frosting. I'm not much of a cake fan, but I can throw down a bowl of rich, buttercream frosting (sounds crazy after all this healthy talk above, but that's how I roll). I'm probably going to continue to skip the cupcakes unless they start adding more frosting.

Bottom line: great food, great service. Visit soon!"}
{"text":"I love Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery. I am so glad they decided to start serving dinner! Their themed new cupcake flavors are always fun and I can't get enough of the banana/pecan/chocolate/peanut butter cupcake!"}
{"text":"This is also a cupcake only review. I have had multiple flavors of their cupcakes on multiple occasions. Sorry to say they are really bad. Dry, crumbly, hard and the buttercream frosting is greasy rather than buttery. The last one was so bad that I only had about 2 bites before throwing it away. I can't remark on their other food but since they have \"cupcakery\" in their name, I would expect good cupcakes."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and will definitely not be our last, we had a fantastic experience between the fun & casual atmosphere, the quality of the food (the crimini and Gruyere strata is phenomenal), and the friendly efficiency of the waitstaff has bumped this to the top of our favorite breakfast places."}
{"text":"The food is always pretty good, but the cupcakes are always mediocre. My coworker once again bought some for employees for Valentine's Day, and the one I just ate isn't something I'd recommend."}
{"text":"For someone that calls themselves a cupcakery, I'm very disappointed. I'm a baker, myself, and cupcakes are my speciality. These cupcakes are always a little too dry, or too dense, or the flavors just are only halfway there. I always leave with buyers remorse and just really feel like I've wasted money that could've gone to a much better product. I will say that the only reason this place got any stars from me was because of the service provided by the staff. The people working at Daisy always go above and beyond. They seem to always be genuinely happy to work there, and they put a lot of passion into what they do. The service and staff are truly the only redeeming quality of this cafe/cupcakery."}
{"text":"What crawled up the butts of Madison's collective of food haters.  I've been here for both Breakfast and Dinner.  Breakfast was a French Toast Strata and made for a very tasty breakfast indeed.  Dinner on one night was the Lime Steak and the other was a Daisy Burger and both of those made for very good meals.  Is it the best dining I've ever experienced?  No but they aren't going for that.  It's a F'ing CAFE and it does cafe/diner food very well.  $2.50 for a bottomless cup of FAIR TRADE COFFEE is not expensive by any means.  I know you snobs are paying more for the crap at Starbucks and it's not even fair trade.  And now for the cupcakes, which I've ingested several of.  They are moist and have really nice frosting.  I've had cupcakes at the grocery store and no they are not the same, these things are made with love and I know how lame that makes me sound.  Get off your high horse people.  Bitch and complain about Food Fight and all of the chains you want to but try and be a little supportive of the small local eateries which try to be a part of the community.  I mean they support Porchlight people!  If you don't know about Porchlight then google it.  Or just go to the Daisy website."}
{"text":"Eat there yesterday. Good food, great service. Very welcoming. I had the no meatloaf and my husband had the biscuits and gravy. Very good, my veggies were good potatoes were fantastic. Cupcakes were good, but not buttercream like the description online. That was disappointing. Good flavors though."}
{"text":"I had the special of the day, biscuits and chorizo gravy with 2 eggs and fresh fruit.  It was fantastic!  My friend had the chorizo omelet with avocado and said it was delicious.  Very friendly staff and great atmosphere.  The only problem was that we were too full to try any of the cupcakes.  But they looked great and seemed reasonancbly priced. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Super fast service wow. It was really busy today and got to us super quick, Coffee was great had the Biscuits and Gravy made with Chirozo nice twist. Would for sure hit this place again."}
{"text":"Seriously good breakfast and desert items with ok coffee.  Bright and sunny atmo, with plenty of room, although I am told it can get very busy."}
{"text":"Stopped by for just cupcakes. They were good, and I liked how the frosting and cake was just the right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"I've dined at Daisy's and have also been the recipient of a cupcake order from Daisy's, and I have nothing but good things to say about both experiences.

The location is cute and unique, and the menu is pretty big. I ate the smoked salmon omelette; husband had the pancake (yes, just one -- it was huge!) with eggs and bacon. Service was great, and all the food was fantastic as well as the OJ and coffee. The menu said the OJ was fresh-squeezed OJ, and it indeed tasted that way. The OJ was lovely!

During brunch, we decided that Daisy's should be added to our personal list of places to which we take out-of-town guests so they can be impressed with Madison. 

Regarding the cupcake order: in a nutshell, the cupcakes are delicious, and Daisy's has incredible customer service. I received a cupcake order for my birthday. There was confusion surrounding the order since I personally did not have the cupcakes when I was supposed to (they sat overnight at my work's front desk, so I had them the next day). Daisy's owner, Darryl, sent me a gift certificate and letter apologizing for confusion. He went out of his way to fix this issue -- which was really only a minor issue in my opinion, since I did receive the cupcakes the following morning. I shared the cupcakes with my husband, and we loved every one of them. The cupcakes were moist and decadent, and the frosting was perfect. The best cupcake was the mocha. 

Daisy's is a nice and inviting cafe, and their cupcakes make for a great birthday gift! And I give the level of service at Daisy's an A+. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop in and give it a try after seeing the sign outdoors saying they served breakfast.  Up until that point I thought the were just a bakery.

They had a breakfast and lunch menu with many choice.  Food was great.  The restaurant itself was very cute with various styles of tables and chairs."}
{"text":"We have eaten breakfast at Dixie Cafe before but this is our first time having dinner here. I had the steak with gorgonzola cheese. My wife had the Daisy Burger. Both were excellent. We really like the atmosphere at Daisy's and enjoy watching all the other patrons. The wait staff has always been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery.  And wow!  Do they really have great food!  I took a chance on something a little crazy.  It was the turkey pesto and sun dried tomato meatloaf.  It was served with breakfast potatoes and grilled veggies.  Wow!  

The seasoning was amazing.  The flavors were robust and bold.  There was even a little spice element.  Just delicious.  I would recommend that everyone try this place out.  The serving was bigger than necessary but no complaints.  The service was great.  When our server was busy another server stepped in to clear our plates.  Brunch only took us about an hour but at no point were we rushed.  Our food was up fast and hot.  

Now, for the missing stars.  I tried a strawberry and chocolate ganache cupcake.  It just was not great.  I am so disappointed with their cupcakes."}
{"text":"The food is good and they have a great family atmosphere.   We've had no issues with taking our 1 yr old and 3 1/2 yr old there.  We've only ever had to wait a short time (only wait was a Friday night at dinner time, prime going out to eat time in Madison, so it made sense).  Everything I've eaten there (fish, pasta, burgers) has been pretty good. 

A prior reviewer did comment on how tight it is in there and I would agree, at times it can feel like you are sitting way too close to the table next to you.  However the staff has always accomidated us with moving, shifting tables, etc.  

However, I am not a fan of their cupcakes.  I have tried them multiple times and they just don't do it for me.  The cupcakes are more like muffins and the frosting always seems to be lacking in flavor.  

Go for the food, search somewhere else for cupcakes."}
{"text":"Went on a weeknight for dinner and was disappointed by the very slow service that was never explained (maybe this is typical?). I'm pretty patient too but the time it took for a server to take our order almost had me ready to leave. Then took longer to get our meal. Food was good but not amazing. Had a toddler with us and thought the kid menu was ok. It's a minor point but didn't realize that the diet coke I ordered was a single can vs fountain drink w/refills (can't recall the price but it was high). I really wanted to like this but won't be back. Doesn't live up to the hype at least for dinner, won't try to see if breakfast or lunch is better."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast in Madison. The food tastes so fresh and so flavorful. The chili espresso steak hash is a must order."}
{"text":"How does this place not have an overall 5 star rating? My experience was so good and I hope to go back at least once (or maybe twice??) during my stay in Madison. 

Got in around 9 on Saturday morning. They were fairly busy but I was seated promptly. The set up is very different from most other restaurants, almost seems like what the dinning room at my grandmother's house would look like. The cupcakes were on display as you walked in the door and it was hard not to stop and drool over them.

Got the Huveros Rancheros. I just let out a big sigh as I remember how wonderful it was. Corn tortilla, black beans, corn salsa, eggs over medium and wonderful guacamole sauce. Mouth is still watering as I type. It was excellently made. I got a large orange juice and it tasted a bit watered down. That really is my only complaint about the experience. I looked around and everybody had something I wanted to try. All the meals looked so inviting. They have a lot of different vegetarian options, both on their breakfast and lunch menu, as well as during dinner. 

I'm not a huge cupcake crazy person but I tried one and I was glad I did. The cake was soft, moist, and had a lot of good flavor to it. I'm picking up a few tomorrow so I can take some to the folks that helped with my dog's surgery. 

Madisonites are very very lucky. Madison is such a great town and the I'm awed every time I try a new restaurant. Daisy's cafe is great and I will recommend it to anybody that wants to try wonderful breakfast."}
{"text":"Listed as a bakery with gluten free options, I was excited to try this place.  There were many many baked items, and two of them were gluten free cupcakes.  I got one of each.  They were DELICIOUS!  They were moist, flavorful, and very much a treat.  They were also tiny and quite pricey.  If I lived nearby, I'd probably get one on rare occasion as a nice treat, bu not regularly and certainly I wouldn't spend the money to get enough for a party.

Also worth mentioning, they did have one vegan option, as well.  The vegan option was not one of the gluten free, so I didn't try it.  Judging on the gf ones, I'd guess everything they make is probably scrumptious.  And maybe the non-gf baked things are more reasonably priced?  But that's not relevant to me, or this review.  :)"}
{"text":"Okay, I've been here three times in the past couple of weeks, so I've decided that I must really like this place. Therefore, it deserves five stars...

But if you want to get technical, Daisy's is hands down my go to spot for breakfast. It's a very cozy atmosphere, which the colder weather will soon highlight. I'm all about ambience and this place has it. On top of harboring such a welcoming vibe, Daisy's also houses some kick ass food. Be it the egg sandwich, which I can't get enough of, or one of their signature strata's - I prefer the crimini mushroom & gruyere - you will not leave disappointed. You could even dabble into their lunch & dinner menu (I've heard great things about their chili, cod sandwich, and their sloppy jose). This place kind of has it all, including their notorious cupcakes, which in all honesty I have yet to try. I'm more of a savory kind of guy.

I must also mention that service is topnotch. Refills aplenty, knowledge of the menu and specials, and consistent even while extremely busy."}
{"text":"I found Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery on Yelp in my search for restaurants in the area that served vegetarian friendly meals. I also had been craving a good chocolate cupcake! This cafe, of course, has both. It's also really close to my house, which is super convenient! 

On this trip I just ran in quick for a cupcake. I ended up getting the \"Extreme Chocolate\" which is chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream filling and chocolate ganache frosting, with little chocolate shavings. The girl at the counter was super friendly, and she packaged it up in a little cupcake box. (So cute!) 

Next time I go I plan on trying one of their breakfast items. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I used to live a few blocks away from Daisy, and became quite addicted to visiting them for breakfast and brunch on the weekends.  I guarantee that when you walk in the door you will be greeted by a friendly staff member.  Somehow, Daisy managed to hand-pick friendly people from the Madison area to wait tables without acting like they hate their lives.  In fact, they act like serving you is the only thing they were ever meant to do.  Apparently, miracles do happen!  

I am an egg sandwich person, and theirs does NOT disappoint.  With bacon (or without), red onions, delicious bread and cheese, this sandwich is the motherload of egg sandwiches.  Also not to be missed is their huevos rancheros.  I could drink their tomatillo avocado dressing by the gallon.  I have to slow myself down when eating this concoction which includes home made corn tortillas, spicy vegetables and beans, and two eggs any way you like.  Did I mention the tomatillo avocado dressing that goes on top??  Also, don't miss their mimosas.  Best in Madison.

This is a great place to bring kids and/or a group of people.  Their menu isn't sodden with fried foods that children usually get stuck with on their portion of the menu.  Sides of fruit are served bountifully even with the children's entrees. I go often with my sister and her three small children, and we are always seated immediately (important with three impatient little ones) and are served with smiles, even when an errant pancake gets smeared into their clean carpet.  

Stop by and say hello!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fun little place. They have plenty of vegetarian (and some vegan) options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even in cupcakes! I believe they have gluten free options as well."}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR CUPCAKES ONLY. (They also had brunch/a mini cafe here but we already ate so we didn't look at their food menu.)

I admit to being a cupcake snob. The only cupcakes I love are from Sprinkles but I actually really liked this place! We were only driving thru town heading back home to Chicago but I suddenly had a hankering for sweets-- mainly cupcakes-- so we stopped here because of the reviews.

Sooo glad we stopped in! I got the orange champagne cupcake, the red velvet, something with nuts, and the blueberry lemon. I loved the frosting on every cupcake! Light, not overly sweet. And the cakes themselves were the perfect moisture and texture. Great combination together.

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars is the price. For ~$4 a cupcake, I was expecting bigger cupcakes. It was still good though. I just... am very partial to Sprinkles! Haha.

Overall, if I were to drive near Madison again, I'd definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Lunch with the mom was good. It's a nice place to have a relaxed conversation, and eat healthy, interesting food. Good local spot."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to grab a meal while in Madison.  I've never been disappointed by any of their menu offerings but try their fish sandwich and their chorizo biscuits and gravy.  Fantastic food all around."}
{"text":"We (two of us) stopped in for a snack since we happened to be on the East Side and had heard about the \"cupcakery.\" It was an early afternoon on a lazy weekend and the place was near to full. The cupcakes looked like toys, they were so small and overloaded with icing. Expensive toys to boot: THREE DOLLARS for one small cupcake? Give me a break, the Riverbend Bakery at the West Side farmer's market sells small pan loaf quick breads for the same price, probably about five times the size. 

And as it turns out, based on the one cupcake we sampled, about five times better. Wife went with a cupcake while I called for a berry scone--which was more reasonably priced at something like $2.25 for a much bigger serving. Perhaps the competition against Lazy Jane's for the East Side scone market keeps the Daisy Cafe honest.

My wife's lemon w/lemon buttercream was terrible. As dry as the worst church bakesales. I couldn't believe it was made that day. It should have been sold for 75¢ or a dollar at most.

I'm sorry to report: this place is yet another in the long list of over-hyped Madison restaurants that could not survive in any bigger city. Skip it. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the service was cheery and without attitude and the scone was acceptable. But they're not bragging about the scones, are they?"}
{"text":"After a walk through Olbrich Gardens we had a sweet brunch at Daisy Cafe. I had never been here, though my daughter knows it well.
My husband was thrilled I saw the Sloppy Jose with chorizo and I had the delightful French Toast Strata with potatoes and fresh fruit. My daughter really liked her tofu scramble.
They have toys and books so my almost 2 year old grandson was happy to play.
Very lovely setting, gracious and helpful staff, and people from all walks of life happily chatting away.
Definitely a high point of our visit!!"}
{"text":"It's not that I didn't like this place, it's that I didn't like it enough to ever want to come back. 

The food is basic and other reviews scared me from trying a cupcake. If the food was more expensive this place would be a wet blanket. But because the prices were reasonable, i left feeling satisfied but not wowed. 

I got the chorizo omelette and the potatoes were cold. That was super disappointing."}
{"text":"Alright. I agree with Leigh S, these are the best huevos rancheros in town!! I got it with the chorizo this morning and I spontaneously said, I quote, \"that was a burst of flavor!\" Obviously, with words like that, it warrants a review. Uhhhhmazing. And their Cha Cha iced tea is great!! Seriously on my list of top iced tea in Madison. Such a cute atmosphere too when you're in the front room!

But now you ask, Amanda, with such a great review, why only 4 stars? My little quibbles: I almost always get seated in the back room which is dark and a lot less cute, the rest of the food I've had there is okay, and they never cook the eggs to the exact doneness me and my friends specify. I'll say over hard and one is over easy. My friend will say over easy and they will be over medium. Kind of a shot in the dark with that one.

However... WORTH IT."}
{"text":"I think this may be my favorite restaurant in Madison.
Brilliant, inventive dishes with fresh, many local ingredients. 
I absolutely LOVE the reuben meatloaf- incredible. The edamame salad is to die for, and when asked about ingredients, they gave me the recipe with zero hesitation. 
Super cute atmosphere,  great service, delicious food all around. What more do you need? 
I hear their cupcakes are pretty awesome too, I don't do sweets, so can't vouch for 'em."}
{"text":"I stopped by Daisy Cafe recently for lunch with a friend and will definitely be back (partly because of how many chorizo dishes they have; I LOVE CHORIZO!) 

From the moment we walked in the door, the staff was incredibly friendly and eager to tell us about the delicious looking cupcakes in their display case. We were immediately seated and quickly brought the homemade Arnold Palmer which was quite tasty. 

Unable to resist the call of chorizo, I ordered the Chorizo Strata. The bread cubes were perfectly toasted and the spicy, yummy flavors of the pepperjack cheese and chorizo blended beautifully in each bite! My friend ordered the Daisy Burger and although I loved my strata, I have to admit that I couldn't help but steal bites of his burger throughout the entire meal. The chicken patty was so moist and flavorful that I just couldn't resist. I will likely order it myself when I visit again!

To end our wonderful meal, we shared one of the month's featured cupcakes, \"The Blues.\" With a sweet potato cake, filled with BBQ/Bacon/Chocolate ganache and topped with a whiskey buttercream, this was definitely unlike anything I had ever tried before and it was amazing! It was very tasty, but having sampled many cupcakes before, I would say that the cake lacked a bit of moisture. Still delicious though.

Daisy Cafe is definitely a place worth visiting! Not only is the food delicious, but every member of the staff is extremely eager to share information about their menu and cupcakes!"}
{"text":"The whole trend of cupcakeries seems really bourgeois.  It's about as awesome as buying a $4.50 cup of coffee.

Anyway, the cupcakes are NOT that special. They seem dry, and the buttercream has that taste of being made with shortening, rather than butter.  At $2.50 each, I'd honestly rather spend my money on a duncan hines mix and make 2 dozen at home."}
{"text":"Fun neighborhood place with delicious breakfasts and a large menu of options (including vegetarian plates).  Everyone I've brought here has liked it, too.  Down to earth staff seem sincerely happy to have you there.  

Admittedly, I am not a cupcake expert but I did enjoy the red velvet cupcake.  Daisy Cafe seems generous with the frosting on their cupcakes, if you like that."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Not only cupcakes...they have delicious dinners with a wide selection of Gluten free options. Very appealing menu with comfort food and fancy too."}
{"text":"This place is so unique . From the decor the layout of the place to the waitstaff . Great ambience .  Amazing food !! The cupcakes are a must try ! The red velvet and the chocolate explosion omg omg !! They are soooo soo good !!!  The mimosas are  quiet delightful  ."}
{"text":"It's just ok. Really, I don't see what all the fuss is about this place. The cupcakes are average (definitely not something I would consider \"cupcakery\" worthy), as is the food and coffee. The atmosphere is not really anything special either. I don't go there on a consistent basis (because I'm not that impressed with it), but whenever I do go there,  the staff and service is always nice."}
{"text":"This has become a regular spot for my boyfriend and I to get breakfast or brunch on the weekends. My most common order is the breakfast sandwich which is just delicious. I also commonly get the huevos rancheros.  The place is usually hopping with couples of different ages and young families  - but somehow they avoid long wait times. The service is almost always excellent (attentive, speedy, cheerful) and the prices are reasonable.  The ambiance is sort of \"bohemian sunflower farm\"; with mismatched wooden tables and chairs but decidedly hippy-flare. I've definitely enjoyed becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"Daisy is one of our favorite spots in town.  We tend to think of them first for breakfast or brunch, but there are great lunch and dinner choices as well.  I'm a big fan of their chili-espresso steak hash, the burgers, and you have to try the meatloaf (several varieties to choose from)!

Daisy consistently wins the \"friendliest waitstaff\" award in local polls, as you'll see why when you come in.  It's an eclectic cafe with a casual atmostphere.  As the name implies, they have a bakery case full of all sorts of interesting cupcakes.  Today's variety included maple bacon (with actual strips of bacon!) and at least two that were made with local beers."}
{"text":"Disappointed. 1st time and probably last. I drove to the other side of town to pick up some cupcakes for a bday here. Was a little disappointed how small the cupcakes were for $2.75, nevertheless I grabbed 6 different ones to try. I expected more variety also.. It was just meh. 

Even if they weren't larger in size I expected it to make up in taste. Sadly the cupcakes were a bit dry and nothing memorable. If I had something nice to say the buttery icing was the only thing I liked. Hyvee however is comparable if not better.. Sorry 

Didn't eat the food there so comment."}
{"text":"Two friends and I just ate lunch at Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery on its fourth day in business (today is May 21, 2009), and we were very pleased.  The service was slow (hopefully just a first-week-open problem that they'll solve soon), but the staff was very friendly and the food was delicious.

I ordered the fresh vegetable strata, a souffle-ish dish of eggs, cheese, veggies, and bread cubes.  It was wonderful!  The eggs were light and fluffy, the bread cubes were a nice crusty contrast, and there was just the right amount of gruyere cheese baked into the dish to make it flavorful without being overwhelming.  It came with a side of seasoned roasted red potatoes and fresh fruit, all of which was excellent.  My friend, Michael, ordered the beef and bacon meat loaf, which came in its own adorable little dish and was perfectly cooked, moist and flavorful with lots of yummy little vegetable chunks mixed in with the ground meat.  My other friend, Haley, ordered the egg sandwich, which we all agreed was a serious egg sandwich, in the best sense.  No mere fried egg slapped on a roll with some cheese, this was, rather, a well-considered sandwich of crusty bread, egg, gruyere cheese, and red onions (which added an especially flavorful kick).

Full but not wanting to pass up the bakery section of Daisy, we each got a cupcake to go.  While the presentation was lovely, it seemed rather wasteful to put each individual cupcake in its own cardboard box (with an additional stabilizing cardboard device inside).  Once I ate the cupcake, however, I realized why such accoutrements were necessary: the frosting on the cake was so soft that it was even a bit melty, and the cake itself was rather spongey and soft.  I prefer a firmer cake with a thicker, stiffer frosting, so this did not particularly suit my fancy (I did, however, appreciate the taste of the frosting, which was whipped cream, as opposed to the more typical buttercream frosting--this was much less sweet, and the fruit flavoring was quite obviously real).

So go for the meal, skip the cupcake, and enjoy the open, sunny room, the good tunes on the stereo, and the friendly vibe while you wait (hopefully not too long) for your server to take your order!"}
{"text":"I love Daisy Cafe! The atmosphere, food, people, decor.... Such great things. Small town delight in a hip part of Madison. Love! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Breakfast!  It still exists!
I have spent years trudging through one breakfast place after another.  Often a mirage would appear upon the horizon of what promised to be an oasis of perfectly cooked eggs, sausage, potatoes and other morning food staples only to have the image fade with the sad plate set before me.  Though some restaurants did better than others none became a true go to place for true satisfaction.   
Then suddenly, without mirage -though with some high recommendations by others, I entered the Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery.  My experience went like this:
Cafe.  Here it is.
Place to park.  Good.
Greeted as I entered.  Good.
Cupcakes? Yep, there they are.
Seating?  A lot of tables and some terrific artwork dancing off the walls.
Menu. Bam! Pow! Kazzowie! This is GREAT!   Look at the great selection.  
Happily my dish and the dishes of those with me were all excellent.  Everything was served beautifully. We eat with our eyes you know.   The coffee was very good. (imagine!)  The service was spot on.  The potatoes were some of the best tasting and correctly done I have had in a long long time.
I now have a place go to for a good breakfast with entrees done in unique and creative ways.  Thanks for putting these dishes on a menu and having someone who can cook like this.
After breakfast I explored a little more.  The art in the back room is somewhat Edward Goreyesque.  Is this for Halloween?  Or does this art remain in the back room throughout the year?  I like it for the season but not year round.  
The washroom was a bit crowded/awkward.  It was clean and the mirror is terrific.  I just hate being squeezed up against a wall.  Can you improve this?  Yes.
Overall, I and those with me had a great breakfast and a good time.  If more people find out how good the food is here they will run out of room fast."}
{"text":"See? I did it...I stopped back to try their food. Boy, was I glad I did! My friend and I got brunch on a Sunday. There was a short wait when we arrived around 11 am. We browsed the cupcake selection while we waited. Their \"cupcakes of the month\" are very pretty.

We were seated and attended to by the best server. He was amazing! My friend got the huevos rancheros (her second time ordering them). I got the turkey meatloaf with pesto, feta and sun dried tomato. It was served with some sauteed vegetables and grilled potatoes with great seasoning. Everything was fresh and delicious.

After breakfast, we ordered a couple of cupcakes each to take home. I ended up trying the root beer, red velvet and one made with Tyranena beer (from my hometown)! The red velvet was the least expensive and the best. Great frosting, ok cupcake. The other two were $3.25 a piece. I probably wouldn't get another \"cupcake of the month\" again since I liked the $2.75 cupcake the best.

I wish they would drop the cupcake part of their name. If rating on cupcakes, they get a 3. If rating on food, they get a 5. So I had to average it out to a 4 since they do promote their cupcakes."}
{"text":"Grabbed breakfast here with my brother, after a night of gaming. Breakfast menu is somewhat limited but creative. I had a mushroom and cheese strata. It was super hot and pretty tasty. It also had sundries tomatoes and was supposed to have spinach, I believe, but I didn't see any. The potatoes that cam with it looked good but they lack flavor and weren't very warm. My brother had the Biscuits and Gravy. It wasn't traditional sausage gravy-more of a Latin version, but it was good, with just the rightf amount of kick. Service was okay. A little rough around the edges, but she was nice and tried her best. I'm sure we will be back as it is walking distance from my brother's house."}
{"text":"I keep coming here and I keep leaving super happy!
Breakfast review:
Had the \"award winning egg sandwich\"; for the 1st time. I can clearly see why it may be called this. Yum! 
A fried egg with cream cheese, onion & cilantro. Yup, it's goodness all on toasted rosemary bread. Hard to beat this for a breakfast sandwich.
The best  part of breakfast at Daisy is the red breakfast potatoes. I'm not sure what they are cooking in them but the really tasty. If I had to guess, It's almost like they are cooking them in some chorizo leftovers maybe...Great flavor & perfectly cooked.

Fresh fruit with most of the breakfasts! 

Also if you order a omelet,  you will be very happy with what you are given!!!!!! They are never stingy with fillings/veggies/and meats. You are going to leave here happy. Trust me!

Bottomless coffee. They keep your cup full the entire visit as well. Again, not sure what kind of coffee they are offering but it is great stuff! 

Daisy----I think you are great!"}
{"text":"For cupcakes I definitely think they are as good as it gets! They are creative and always delicious. I've had lunch and dinner here. The menu is fabulous, the options are unique and fresh! The lemonade is home made and it is absolutely wonderful. The only bad thing I could say about this place is that they should get comfier chairs ;)"}
{"text":"I love their multigrain pancakes with a side of breakfast potatoes. Mmmmm. Their cupcakes are really good, but the cake part tends to be a bit dry for my taste."}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week and will definitely come back again! I also want to try their breakfast/brunch. It's a cute cafe and has pastries you can purchase from a counter at the front.

Service was outstanding. My waiter was genuinely friendly, which made the whole experience even more enjoyable.

For the three courses, I got a crab enchilada, tortelloni, and a chocolate cupcake. I was pleasantly surprised by the generous portions. I finished every bite (except the German cake filling in the chocolate cupcake - I'm not a fan of coconut). My roommate got steak, and her mashed potatoes were so good they were addictive. I kept stealing them off her plate!

While their lot was full, we didn't have any issues finding street parking right outside. We went on a Wednesday night and had a reservation, but probably didn't need one although the place was pretty full."}
{"text":"I've never had a meal I disliked here. The wait staff is always very nice and accommodating. An eclectic and friendly atmosphere, not to mention the cupcakes are to die for."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try out Daisy forever... but it's a bit of a drive for me and the reviews on yelp were a little weak so I never made it over.  After about the 7th person telling me how great it was I decided to try it out.  
LOVE.  
Service: host was very nice and helpful, so was the other girl at the counter.  Our server was nice, but fairly absent.  Not horrible 
Our food was great and the drinks were WONDERFUL.  Great bloody and mimosa with fresh OJ, coffee was good too.  We got cupcakes to-go and OMG!  I'm so mad at myself for waiting so long to try it!!!  Chocolate cake, maple cream with BACON is so very very very good.  Vanilla is great too."}
{"text":"Really nice place. One of the places we like to take out of state visitors. The vegetarian selection are very high quality. Delicious cupcakes."}
{"text":"I'm amending this because I've never found better huevos rancheros. They're the best and I crave them constantly. A+, guys."}
{"text":"We make a point to stop here whenever we visit my sister in Madison. I've probably eaten here more than 5 times and it's been great. I'm gluten-free and I've enjoyed numerous menu items on their breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu selections. I always eat a cupcake with my gluten-free son too. Delicious and never any ill-effects. We will be back! :)"}
{"text":"This is some amazing home cooking!

A co-worker introduced me to this place and I've been hooked since.  REAL food, not the sodium laced food you get at the standard chain restaurants (though we patronize many of those as well).  I'm not a vegetarian but my rule is at a good restaurant I choose the vegetarian entrees because I know they will be delicious and this is no exception.  I'm hooked on the No-Meat Loaf and hubby get the Reuben Meat Loaf.  Both come with new potatoes at lunch time (mashed potatoes at dinner which is the one item I don't care for simply because of the butter) and sautéed vegetables.  If we're there at dinner I get the vegetable enchiladas.

The restaurant has a very casual feel with tables that don't necessarily match each other (who needs that anyway) and the waitstaff seems uniform free.  I'd love to know if this is a great place in Madison to work because it seems to have that vibe.

Given the \"feel\" of the restaurant one thing I'm surprised they don't have is at least a small bike rack.  We biked there for lunch once and had to chain our bikes to a railing which isn't ideal for us and likely got in the way of pedestrians.  All very minor, just something to point out if you plan to bike there."}
{"text":"I was delighted when my boyfriend surprised me with a couple cupcakes(to split) from the Daisy Cafe. He had gotten the Carrot Walnut, and the Vanilla Blueberry. The Carrot was good(what isn't good with a nice cream cheese frosting?), but I found the Vanilla Blueberry to be ordinary, if even a bit dry. I like a moist, but fluffy cake, which this just wasn't. Perhaps it was due to being in the pastry box he brought home for a couple hours...but I'm not sure.  Overall, I consider these treats good but basic."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars!

Very casual, warm and inviting atmosphere. Daisy is one of those relaxed joints we've been eyeing for a while so glad we got a chance this past weekend. A bit late for lunch but nonetheless we drove over around late afternoon.

Service : Sweet, friendly and attentive. Impressive considering we came at an odd \"in-between\" lunch and dinner time frame. No complaints!

Food : We ordered Reuben Meatloaf and Roasted Vegetable Enchiladas (With house?made chorizo). We took some Sweet Things (Duh!) but Ill get to that later.

The Reuben Meatloaf was delicious! I don't know how but somehow they made the texture of it very similar to a well made crab cake! The combination of meats and spices in the loaf was perfect. The meatloaf itself was moist and you could taste the individual components of cheese and even sauerkraut! I love their version of 1000 Island sauce with chopped boiled eggs.

The Enchiladas dish was better than what I've had at a lot of traditional Mexican restaurants! Their chorizo was seasoned well and finely chopped so you get these scrumptious little nibbles throughout as you devour your dish. The black bean paste was sensational and can stand on its own as a dish in itself! The whole dish was portioned rather generously and the balance of flavors was to the point. Well done!

Now onto the Sweet Things I mentioned. We boxed a  Peanut Butter cheesecake and a Standard Chocolate Cupcake as they ran out of all the Gooey/Filing ones :(.... Nonetheless, the frosting was rich and creamy and easily the best part of the cupcake. The cake itself was a tad dense and dry. Not too bad though. The cheesecake was baked very well and you'll love it if you like me love peanut butter!


All in all, if you haven't had a chance to drop by this joint, please do so!"}
{"text":"Really liked it.  Much better feel than Bunky's that was there before. (Bunky's is still a great restaurant). More space, couch, great back room for meeting, parties, etc.  The cupcakes were good, I did expect a little more va, va, vavoom with the icing, but they were good.  Bottomless cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Cupcakes are all right but I can't say the food is anything to go out of the way for.  Service is a bit meh.

I ordered a chorizo omelet.  Omelet came without the avocado that was supposed to be on top. The meal also came with a generous portion of melon, but unfortunately, because it was on the same plate, the fruit ended up having taco sauce on it.  They told me they were out of rolls and said I could substitute for toast.  Then I had to ask them to bring out toast when they forgot.  Also, I had to go up to the counter myself to ask for water refill.

My companion's food was better--seems like I'd stick to t he lighter fare here--he got a hummus sandwich w/ edamame salad."}
{"text":"I am so happy to be in walking distance of such a perfect breakfast restaurant. The best egg sandwich I've ever had, amazing home fries, tons of vegetarian options, and of course, delicious cupcakes! They have an expansive menu, which at some places can mean the quality of dishes suffers, but Daisy puts 100% into every menu item. I have never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. They've really hit the nail on the head by using quality ingredients to make even simple dishes (like the Wisconsin Burger, which at first glance looks very plain) taste amazing.

Great service too! Things can get slow during their busiest times, but once when my drink order was lost and I had to remind the server of it, he apologized profusely and took it off our tab, which I really appreciated. (Thanks, Michael!)"}
{"text":"What a great brunch experience!! We arrived at peak brunching time and were nervous there would be a wait-- however, they have so many tables that our wait was less than 10 minutes! From then on, it was nothing but smooth sailing.

Our server was a total rock star-- we sat in their back room and he was all hustle, efficiency and friendliness. Nothing took too long, which is unusual for a brunch service, and our food was just perfect at a great price. The side of potatoes is probably my favorite in Madison now! 

We will definitely return and next time, I'll save room for a cupcake."}
{"text":"Waitress was pleasant. Food was good. Small mix up with order but fixed as beat they could."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast and dinner!

{"text":"I like taking out of towners to Daisy's. It has a really cool vibe that you don't get from too many other places. Wait staff here can be a little surly from time to time.. But usually they are just indifferent (which isn't much better). Also for whatever reason, it is ALWAYS so hot in this place. I must have never visited in the winter months, because I'm sure it's cooler.. But when I go here, I always start sweating!
As for food.. Yum!!!!  I love the award winning egg sandwich! And not that I ever would, but I like the option that you can substitute the bacon for avocado. This place is not only vegetarian friendly, but they have MANY vegetarian dishes that are actually tasty (many places cater to vegetarians only by omitting meat, but not by adding anything tasty and substantial to their dishes). Also, the potatoes that come on the side of many dishes are absolutely delicious. 
I love that I can eat here if I want to eat healthy and leave feeling full and satisfied, but I can also choose to pig out if I want and be equally satisfied."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times since my first review and I still LOVE everything about this place!!! The food, the service, the atmosphere, the EVERYTHING!!!  Tonight we went for restaurant week and the Brandy crab bisque was to die for (I actually got some to take home to have for lunch tomorow), the steak was made to perfection and the veggies were perfect!!!  I had the cheesecake which was also amazing!!!"}
{"text":"A solid lunch joint. Also, it has a parking lot, which is a huge bonus for Atwood ave.

I loved their strata and their meatless loaf. Their menu is pretty extensive, so there is something there for everyone.

Also, breakfast is served until 3pm. Love me some pancakes for lunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The breakfast is amazing. The spicy potatoes and pancakes are to die for!!"}
{"text":"After living in the neighborhood for some time, my better half and I ventured to Daisy's for their happy hour. The drinks were delicious, but you never know when your number is called so we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. It arrived quickly and glistened like lake Monona on a night hosting a full moon. It took effort diving our forks into the creation, but once that morsel hit my lips every ounce of dopamine was released to my brain. All worries vanished leaving me in a tranquil yet positive state of mind. This establishment represents what it means to feel alive. I can't wait to try their food menu."}
{"text":"So much variety.   Gluten free vegitaerian, meal, dairy free.  Tried most everything but the meat and am impressed on how flavorful it all is.  The cupcakes are amazing and I no longer pay attention to anything but flavor as gluten free and dairy free makes no difference"}
{"text":"We've been there twice...once on the drive from Cleveland to Minneapolis and once on the way back. I'm not sure if I can be completely objective because, after enough hours of driving, it seemed like an amazing oasis. That being said, the cupcakes were fantastic, the coffee was good, the ambiance was great, the service was friendly. We'll definitely consider stopping by the next time we're driving through the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally tried this place for Saturday brunch after I moved just up the street almost 3 months ago. We were very impressed!! We are major suckers for the nearby Monty's Blue Plate diner, but the long wait times there can get annoying when all we really want is a high quality, delicious breakfast anyways. I am SO glad we came to Daisy Cafe. The restaurant was about 80% full so we were seated immediately at about 11:30 on a Saturday, when it can be tough to get a table in Madison.

Their version of huevos rancheros was pretty unique, as it was served with seasonal roasated veggies and a creamy yet spicy avocado tomatillo salsa. My boyfriend got one of their omelets - something with bacon and cheese. He said it could've used a veggie or two, but I'm sure they could've added something if he had asked. The side potatoes were absolutely wonderful as well; had more than a bit of a kick to them. 
I don't think we will ever go for lunch or dinner, I'm not much a meatloaf person and none of the other options on the menu really stood out to me, but as a breakfast place it was perfect.

Service was very friendly. I even noticed a woman next to us was asking for plain tomato juice, and the server searched all over the kitchen until he could find exactly what she wanted. We actually forgot to leave our tip on the table and didn't remember until we left the restaurant - they were totally nice about my mistake when I ran back in with a bunch of bills for the server. 

Cupcakes were just alright, I tried a strawberry champagne one but as a chocolate lover I know I'll have to give them another chance at some point. We will be back!"}

5 stars for the Lemonade. Homemade lemonade done right and really well. I mean this is the stuff, right here. 


One can buy the Lemonada \"good stuff\" per glass or bottomless for $2.49.


I walked in and noticed a flyer for help wanted and I'm seriously thinking of applying as I do need the tip money. I have done too much travelling and plus, I like this place. I mean I like it for what it's worth and trying to do. Or so I perceive. 

Here's the dealy-o...
Good: The Lemonade, of course. 
The grilled cheese. It was not as thick as I had at The Noble a la Milwaukee nor Salt Grass Steakhouse but it worked. The 3 cheeses meshed well together. I was impressed with the collaboration. 

The ladies had an omelet type sandwich - one with bacon, one with avocado. They made accommodations for one with no cilantro with just a bit of cilantro hiding out. The no cilantro lady said the plate offering was more than she expected and couldn't finish it. 

Both ladies lady shared their oven potatoes. A few were under cooked. 
Paying at the register - they prefer cash and there's an ATM. 
Large leather brown sofas await your heiny if you have to wait for a table or just want to have a family talk away from the table so more people can eat. 

Plus, I don't see how the service won best service. I didn't read the huge banner saying such but I read Corey D's review stating such and was like there's no way. It wasn't busy and we were all first timers so the ladies took forever looking over the menu while I reviewed, in advance, to know what I want. I've had better service. I've given better service. Yet, something I've noticed as of late is I've had to ask for refills at several places in town. I don't know what that's about but it's water - please top off any and every glass."}
{"text":"Cupcakes seem to be on the tail end of \"big things\" lately.  While I still think of it as a bit of a fad, I hope that it outlasts frozen yogurt, but only if it means that places like Daisy still around.

The staff here is great.  They're exceptionally friendly and proud of their space, and they've never seemed frantic or annoyed when faced with a pile of people at the counter waiting for those random folks who take five minutes to pick out a few cupcakes to go.  That says a lot when you look at the overall size of the place.

The cupcakes themselves have always been spot on for me.  They make a soft icing, rather than the solid block of sugar on top through which you must cut.  The cake itself is always moist, and they run through a bunch of great themes, such as the Oktoberfest line they've got in place now.  I just picked out six and I have to give all kinds of props to the oatmeal stout and the pumpkin that I ate.  I missed out on the other four because I was too polite and shared.

I don't get here as often as I would like since I come in from Milwaukee, but I make it a point to come by every time I'm in the general neighborhood.  This is one of those shops that I've found Milwaukee has yet to match."}
{"text":"Only been here for Saturday morning breakfast so far (as this was one of our 'City Tin' locations). So glad we stopped in! 

I feel weird taking pictures in the context, but trust me when I say the place has a very warm and inviting decor - colorful lights and paintings, lots of natural light from the windows.

I had the Salmon/Cream Cheese/Pesto omelet served with very tender red potatoes, and I basically licked the plate clean. It arrived with generous slabs of pineapple and cantaloupe. My partner was thrilled that they serve Morningstar vegetarian products, and thoroughly enjoyed her Breakfast Sandwich. Though skeptical, I wanted to try a breakfast cocktail, and was extremely happy with the Whoopsy Daisy - a concoction of agave wine, lemon juice, and pomegranate molasses, garnished with lime. I normally don't enjoy something that sweet, but this was delicious.

The entire staff worked together to make sure we were never without water, coffee, hot sauce, etc. Overall, a great meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We set out for breakfast on New Year's Day, tired and hungry and hung over. Not a damn thing was open (except Monty's, and there was a line out the door. Thanks but no thanks - we were at the hunger equivalent of DEFCON 1). After driving around for what seemed like forever, we finally stumbled upon Daisy Cafe, and it was open, and there was no wait. Hooray!

I've been here a few times now. The food is consistently great, and the cupcakes are really good too. The service is a little slow, but otherwise it gets a thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Some friends and I went there for brunch last weekend- enjoyed by meat eaters, vegetarians, savory and sweet lovers alike. Try the egg breakfast sandwich on rosemary bread or the No Meat loaf with crimini mushrooms and nuts. Deeeeelish."}
{"text":"A trip to Madison is just not complete without a stop at Daisy Cafe! Prior to coming here, I once believed that all Huevos Rancheros were created equally; I was quickly proven wrong as their bean-egg-cheese-salsa-whatever melody touched my tongue. Huevos Rancheros de la Daisy is my favorite rendition of my favorite breakfast food. 
As the latter part of their name suggests, their cupcakes are also fantastic! The available flavors change daily/monthly/seasonally, but if available, I recommend the Strawberry Champagne or Cinnamon Carrot flavors!"}
{"text":"They had taken the turkey/feta meatloaf off the menu for a while but now it's back! Easily the best meatloaf they make. Another one of my favorites off their lunch/dinner menu is the chicken & chevre sandwich."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and was very impressed! The egg breakfast sandwich is incredible, fresh eggs, cilantro, cream cheese and onions; delicious!!! Not to mention fresh squeezed orange juice!

The cupcakes where good, nothing special. The frosting is very buttery which sometimes overpowers the flavor of what it's supposed to be (blueberry, vanilla, chocolate, etc). But if you're looking for a treat for yourself, they wont disappoint.

The only downside to eating here was there was a bit of a long wait for the food from when we ordered until we received it."}
{"text":"What?! They serve dinner too!  Being a \"cupcakery\", I've stopped in several times for their awesomely delicious cupcakes, but after stopping in for a full breakfast, was amazed, excited and delighted to discover they also have a full lunch and dinner menu too.  The building actually extends far back into the building, so it appears they have ample room for a dinner crowd.  Although, they did tell me that they take reservations on busy Saturday nights.  While we love going to Bunkys Cafe a couple locks away, I'm pleased to know there is another sit down dinner option same Atwood Street area that is a bit more moderately priced in comparison."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Saturday lunch. Everything had great flavor and came fairly quick for being busy. The staff were very friendly as well. Had a TBA  (turkey bacon and avocado) sandwich on gluten free sandwich bread with a side of edamame salad. Took a gluten free blueberry lemon cupacke to-go, which was a nice treat when I got home. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Mediocre service. The waitress looked my daughter and I as if we did not belong. We only had coffee and cupcakes .The coffee was ok, but for a place that calls themselves a ''cupcakery'' you would think they offered at least decent cupcakes. the moisture of the cupcakes is ok, but they merely tasted like sugar without real savory taste. I observed how waiters assisted the customers and I was just not impressed with the level of service. Most waiters did not hide the fact that they did not want to be at work on a sunday morning."}
{"text":"Have only gone for breakfast, but they seem to have a great balance of 'classic' and creative breakfast options.

Friendly & genuine staff. 

Love their goat cheese & roasted veggie omelette.

Don't forget to grab a cupcake! Moist and delicious."}
{"text":"Finally got brunch at Daisy Cafe, and it was great. The first good sign was that their menu looks awesome, and there were multiple things that appealed to both my husband and me.

I had the Chorizo & Avocado Omelette, and I loved it! The house-made chorizo was tasty without being too greasy or overwhelming. The egg was fluffy. The avocado was a great balancer, and there was enough to have some with every bite of omelette. The breakfast potatoes were also really good, as was the fresh fruit.

My husband's Chili-Espresso Steak Hash was good, if not as spiced as we hoped. The real star for me was the super-tasty tomatillo avocado salsa. I saw this with other things on the menu, and it was good enough to sway future choices.

We also brought a few cupcakes and a butter cake home. The butter cake was excellent, as was a carrot cake cupcake with cinnamon cream cheese frosting. I wasn't crazy about the buttercream-frosted cupcakes. The frosting was very buttery, not very sweet or strongly flavored. Fine, but not my jam.

I liked the eclectic, east side atmosphere, and the waitstaff was friendly and kept my water and coffee full. I went in really hungry and ate my whole meal, but I could  easily see having leftovers from their generous but reasonably-priced portions.

We'll definitely go back. The Chicken, Chutney, Chèvre sandwich is calling me already."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!!!

Service 5stars
Food.    5stars

I had some of the most delicious biscuits and gravey iev ever had! They were a weekend special. Poblano chile gravey over delicious biscuits. I ordered a side of potatoes because they looked so delicious, and they were!

Our waitress was Megan, she was very attentive to our big group and was very helpful with all our questions :) we were visiting from California and had a lot of questions. She totally went above and beyond with her service :) thank you!"}
{"text":"Good local place that will surprise you with their options. Menu is large and they are friend to special diets and vegetarians/vegans. They are known for their cupcakes but I have to say they are expensive and are the size of half of a average lady's palm. I tried the vegan cupcake even though I am not vegan. Shockingly, it was pretty darn good and taste like \" the real deal\".  

My issue is the atmosphere. Place is very small and I feel like I am sitting on top of other people. Nothing is uniformed which isn't an issue but they need new tables and chairs. I just felt very uncomfortable while dining there the 2 times I've gone.


Good would get a 4 stars but atmosphere hurts opinion a bit. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"10/17/17 Ate here again. Last couple times my friend and I have been having brunch. Love their 'Daisy Sunrise-Sunset' drink. For $8, their 'Pick three' breakfast is the best, except that there are so many choices! Morningstar sausage is a nice option, but their oatmeal pancake will fill you up for hours. Service was always fabulous and appreciate the advice on limited fruit options. Will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"Didn't try the cupcakes, as I was told they were okay but kinda dry.  We did have a couple of other baked goods at our table: the fruit coffee cake muffin was good but, yes, a bit dry.  The cinnamon roll was really good.  There was a good assortment of cupcakes in the case, and a couple that appealed to me, but I wasn't in the mood for a lot of sweets (and the mound of frosting on top of each kinda put me off...)

The meal, on the other hand, was great.  Service was good; we had a big group, constantly growing, and they did a pretty good job of handling it. (We had called ahead to warn them.)  I had the huevos rancheros, recommended by friends and every bit as good as they said.  Tasty, good ingredients, accompanied by fresh fruit... Mm.  I also had a \"bottomless\" house-made lemonade, which was nice.  

I'd certainly go back, and might someday try a cupcake."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Kickin' breakfast potatoes. Great burgers. Favorite place for brunch."}
{"text":"The food here is fairly and usually good, but the service was poor during our last visit. I have an aversion to being surprised by hot spice in my food so I asked the server about some of the choices. After our discussion about not liking hotly spiced food I decided on the crab cakes asking for something else to replace the sriracha sauce that came with the cakes. The menu didn't say the crab cakes were spicy, just listed the sauce as spicy. We had a discussion about some alternate sauce possibilities and I felt satisfied that my needs were being met. Until the crab cakes came, and were themselves spicy hot. The tarter sauce replacement helped tone them down but I took them home for my partner to eat. When I asked my server if she had known the crab cakes were spicy when I ordered them after our \"spicy\" discussion she replied that to her they weren't that spicy and it was a personal taste thing. She did apologize and said she should have told me. yeeeaah. Glad I am not allergic to hot peppers."}
{"text":"Eclectic restaurant. 

Came here for lunch and was delighted by the range of dishes, the hanging stained glass art, and the variety of bevies. 

My table ordered cobb salads, chicken sandwiches and one of their premium cupcakes. 

They have a rotating menu of cupcakes, so I went wild with their \"Rock & Roll\" concoction. It had buttercream and toffee and I don't know what all, but it was as rich as can be and that little nugget was all I needed to cap off a delightful meal."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of days ago for breakfast. Fairly large menu. Good gluten free options for my wife. This place has some pretty cool menu items that you won't find anywhere else. Wait staff was VERY prompt and friendly. 

Atmosphere is a tad too hodgepodge for my liking but.. Whatever. The food made up for it. 

Make sure to grab a few cupcakes to go!"}
{"text":"It was good. It wasn't outrageously great, but it wasn't horrendously bad. 

I ordered the Turkey & Rosemary Omelet and my boyfriend ordered the French Toast Strata. 

My meal came with an omelet, oven-roasted potatoes and fresh fruit. While everything was good, I have to say that I probably could have made the meal at home. If I go back, I wouldn't not eat this again, but I would definitely like to try something from their lunch selection first. My boyfriend was pretty much in agreement there. While he said his meal was good, he wants to try their burgers. 

They have a nice size menu filled with lots of veggie and lean meat dishes, which are perfect for me. However, they also cater to my boyfriend's style with such dishes like the Wisconsin Pride Burger (cheese curds and bacon on top of a 1/2 lb burger). 

We actually went their for breakfast for my boyfriends birthday. With that in mind, we left with a cupcake (I passed; too full to even think about cupcakes). My boyfriend chose the carrot cupcake with cream cheese frosting and walnut bits sprinkled on top. He wolfed it down and said it was good. 

I may update this review after we go for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"I found myself on Atwood Ave and saw the Daisy Cafe. I had heard about it, but never had been there. I decided to get my kids each a cupcake. Totally disappointing. The frosting literally tastes like and has the texture of a lump of lard and the cupcakes themselves were dry. They looked really pretty and the young woman that helped me was very nice but even my husband, who eats anything said, \"These are bad!\""}
{"text":"Came here for weekend brunch and had no problem getting a table even though it was busy. The Bloody Mary was perfectly spicy and my mushroom soufflé was very savory. The breakfast potatoes were fresh and a big hit at our table. Brandon was our server and he was so sweet and attentive. Would love to come back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I can't find anything to complain about.  Went there at 9am today for brunch and had the salmon omelet.  It was very flavorful and just the right size. I got a walnut, carrot cake cupcake to go and it was really moist and fresh tasting. I'd definitely love to try more of their flavors."}
{"text":"Tofu scrambles gets me going day and night. 
Usually i go to Monty's for the bk for din option, but tried Daisy's version for Sunday brunch this morning. 

Verdict - yummy (and gluten free, yes!). I don't know if they do breakfast all day, but if they do, I'll add this to my repertoire. If they don't, they should - please do. 
We didn't get \"Madison's favorite waitstaff\" service though. Negative one star for that. But I'll give it another try at Daisy's for sure."}
{"text":"My brother and I have been coming to this restaurant for years whenever I visit Madison. It has a special feel. The classic tables make you feel like you're at home your mom's kitchen.  The staff is ultra friendly and don't get me started on the food. Everything on this menu is amazing. I'm especially fond of their meatloaf.  About a year ago I started to take my food a little more seriously, and discover that this restaurant also has a wide variety of healthy options. Their salads are ridiculous. Their salmon is one of the best I've had.  They have a wide variety of beverages, including freshly squeezed orange juice. This place is definitely worth your time to visit. Oh, and to top it all off the prices are completely reasonable."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food, layout and staff.  I had the grilled cheese sandwich with avocado - and for this picky pregnant lady - it was a hit!  Our waitress was so nice, as was the owner when asked many questions about a potential private event.  They are flexible with group events, btw.  
I particularly liked the layout - the mismatched antique tables and chairs and lighting made for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times and each meal has been rock solid. 

The award winning egg sandwich was that good amount of savory, crunchy breakfast whoa you want when you want a unique breakfast sandwich you can't replicate at home.

The pesto & vegetable pasta was the least favorite meal I've had here... but I should state, pasta isn't my favorite, so part of that was me. The flavors were there but it's hard to wow me with pasta. And it was a creamer dish than I anticipated. I expected a raw pesto base, not a creamy one.

Finally - the Daisy Cod Sandwich. WHOA!! All sorts of amazing things happening with that combination of panko breaded cod, slaw and sauce. HIGHLY recommend. (Although, if you're not a fan of spicy sauce, have the sauce on the side.)

Sadly, the cupcakes aren't my favorite in town. They aren't loaded with sugar, which is a plus. But I find them a little dry and haven't found a flavor that wows me. 

Oh- and the soup! Super good - made in house. (Very important to me.) Worth a try if your'e in a soup mood."}
{"text":"Meredith L nailed the review of the cupcake. The cake part was okay, however, the one I bought was very stale. The big disappointment was the frosting. As Meredith L said it should be a ...\"rich creamy frosting.  This was really oily, and the frosting was really heavy on the shortening and light on the chocolate-flavored goodness.\" In my case it was vanilla, but still very light on vanilla flavor.

This is not a good cupcake."}
{"text":"Came for the cupcakes but ended up eating. The breakfast potatoes are superb. I had the tuna steak sandwich. Fabulous. Everyone in the group enjoyed their food. It was a little slow getting the did burr worth the wait. Atmosphere was enjoyable. One guy was working on the laptop while others socialized. Fun place!"}
{"text":"i want to like these guys so badly, they always have really creative cupcakes designs and flavors so i keep giving them a shot when i am in town but EVERY TIME THE FROSTING IS TERRIBLE!!!  frosting-shaped creamed butter is not buttercream frosting.  other food options are just okay."}
{"text":"My roommates and I love Daisy! This restaurant is on a trendy, nice street and has a great ambiance. Their food is excellent (Egg Salad Sandwich is amazing) and, let's not forget, their cupcakes! Delish! It's a sweet little place and offers wi-fi, the staff is kind, and they do serve beer and wine."}
{"text":"Cupcakes are delicious! It's so hard to pick just one!"}
{"text":"Sweet place.  Came here for the first time a few days ago and had a great lunch.  The caprese egg salad sandwich was fresh and full of flavor.  The coffee was good and the service was prompt.  Chill vibe- I will be back!"}
{"text":"This update has been a long time coming! Rullll long. 

After SEVERAL more visits to DCC I can safely say this place rawks my socks off. I've grown to love their meatloaf, many of them, the bacon wrapped being my fave. But there's like 8 bajillion varieties so it's hard to pick a favorite. Their lunch sammies are uber tasty and the sides are delicious, the edamame a standout in my book. On a recent trip and during a weird week when I went super Paleo they made some mad accommodations for me which I appreciated. 

As rad as the menu is, as funky/cool as the interior is, as rawkin' as the jams are, nothing beats the people. Voted Madison's favorite servers three years in a row (the place has only been open for 3) there's just a good \"we'll take care of you\" sort of vibe about the place I've grown to love. I get the feeling that owners and staff are really in business to make people happy, push the envelope of what \"healthy eating\" means (it can taste good) and have a vested interest in the community and its history."}
{"text":"This is a very cute family run place with lots of local art on-site. I met friends for brunch and was impressed with the menu offerings - strata, egg sandwiches, pancakes and lunch options all looked tasty. They were out of the strata I wanted so I went with the turkey feta meatloaf. It was Ok. It was burned and a bit dry but covered in rosemary gravy. My sides were not good - veggie sticks drowning in oil and over salted roasted potatoes covered in oil. I would return to try the bakery items but am not rushing in for another meal."}
{"text":"Always good food and friendly staff. My favorite is the huevos rancheros. Gluten free entrees and cupcakes too."}
{"text":"Dry, bland, crappy cupcakes. Greasy frosting. What do they use, Crisco? Yuck. I can make my own damn cupcakes, thank you very much. Fucking bourgeois fad bullshit, that's what this is. Feh.

EDIT: While the cupcakes are trendy crap, the breakfast/brunch is actually not bad."}
{"text":"This is a cute little café with lots of tasty looking homemade cupcakes and pastries. We were here for a late lunch and had a nice fresh cob salad with chicken. It's worth stopping by when in the area."}
{"text":"I settled on three stars for this review, but I'd actually break it down like this: 4 stars if you're going just for the cupcakes and 2 stars for the rest of the menu.

On my first visit to Daisy Cafe, I'll admit I was disappointed at the selection in the cupcake display.  I had figured that a cupcake place would have cupcakes that were... well... a little more out of the ordinary.  As it turned out, the cupcakes may be simple but they are delicious.  The cake is light and fluffy and the frosting is similarly light and nicely flavored.  They have a vegan cupcake each day, which is what I tried on this first visit.  I'm not a vegan, and I'm usually wary of foods labeled vegan but this was delicious (and not just in a \"good for a vegan cupcake\" kind of way).

On my next visit I decided to give the breakfast menu a try.  I ordered a strata, which arrived a disappointing rubbery texture.  After this I came back a few times for the cupcakes, but avoided the food menu for fear of a repeat of the strata incident.

Now that they've been serving dinner for a while (Thurs-Sat) I decided to give them another try.  They have burgers on their menu, and it's hard to find a good burger, so I stopped in tonight to see how they rated.  I'll admit up front, I'm picky about my burgers.  If they aren't rare, they're not worth eating.  I had asked on a previous cupcake excursion if they cooked their burgers rare and had been assured they did.  Before I ordered, however, I verified this with my waitress who confirmed they would.

I ordered the basic burger with swiss cheese \"very rare\" and selected the edamame salad as my side.  After taking my order, the waitress returned with the most delicious whole wheat bread and whipped butter.  This bread was seriously good - I would buy it and take it home with me if I could.  I was a bit disappointed that the butter was served in disposable plastic condiment cups, which seemed like a waste.  I noticed that diners who had salads were served their dressing in small metal cups, which would have worked great for the butter as well.

As you've probably guessed, when my burger arrived it was not rare.  It could charitably be called medium rare but that would be stretching it.  If you like your burgers cooked, you'd probably like this one, but I don't.  On the plus side, the bun was good - toasty but not hard, and the tomatoes that came on the side were ripe, juicy, and firm enough to hold up on the burger.  It also came with a nice selection of greens.  I'm not sure if they were intended just to go on the burger, but if they were there were an awful lot of them.  They could have made a nice mini-salad, aside from the lack of dressing.

The edamame salad was a bit disappointing.  I should have asked what was in it before ordering, as I don't like onions and this had more onions than edamame.  I later heard a waiter describe this salad to another diner, but his description didn't really match up to the salad either.  It was tossed in a ginger dressing, which was actually good.  Unfortunately, the celery overpowered just about every other flavor in the salad, so you didn't really taste the dressing.

My waitress was apologetic(the staff has always been very friendly and attentive) when she stopped to check on my meal and I told her the burger wasn't cooked properly and offered me a free cupcake for the mistake.  The cupcake was, as usual, delicious."}

Following up 4&20 with a few more pastries for the road the last stop on a recent trip to Madison was Daisy Café and Cuppcakery, a kitschy spot on Atwood Avenue where neither cuisine nor customer service experienced in-store was particularly remarkable, though 'back-to-school' themed cupcakes would later save the day.  Undoubtedly a spot for locals with the former part of the phrase 'shabby-chic' best describing the décor it was to a luke-warm greeting from the restaurant's lone server that I was greeted on entry and invited to seat myself that was precisely what I did, a minimal amount of effort expelled in re-filling both tepid coffee and water making me wish these things, too, were do-it-yourself.  Eventually allowed to order, a pair of two-tops already well into their meals apparently too much for one to handle, it would not be long before my pastry arrived and proving far less impressive than the standard set by 4&20 most of the morning bun was discarded, a similar situation occurring in the strata - a mundane bellybomb of flavorless bread soaked in eggs with only the slightest bit of sweetness to be found.  Utterly disappointed in the experience thus far it was only the presence of a man I presume to be the owner at the register and his interest in my Interpol T-shirt that prevented me from walking away with empty hands but after our short conversation I couldn't help but invest in a few cupcakes, the carrot cake a bit heavy handed but all three of the filled $3.00 specials showing great flavors and innovation amidst cakes of a delicate crumb."}
{"text":"We live nearby and this place is delish for lunch. The atmosphere is friendly and fun.Their chicken burger is awesome! We stop in just for a bag of coffee beans or pancake mix sometimes too. I will say as others have said their cupcakes are a little dry... that is why there is a big pile of frosting on top - that makes up for it a little I guess."}
{"text":"Had brunch at Daisy Cafe & Cupcakery this morning. We went thinking we were in the mood for lunch but both my boyfriend and I ended up eating breakfast. I opted for the french toast strata. It was quite good! I really enjoyed the flavor of the dish. The side of potatoes was also really good as well but didn't go with the main so I moved those to my boyfriend's plate. Overall, we enjoyed our meal. 

I did remove one star because of how loud it was in the restaurant. The layout makes it impossible to not hear everything that's going on. Both my boyfriend and I enjoy a little more of a relaxing atmosphere. Don't let that stop you from going to enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"Just met a good friend here for breakfast. And it was great! We both had the egg sandwich..... Amazing. I had a Bloody Mary, which I wasn't too thrilled with. But everything else was awesome with the service and food."}
{"text":"We came all the way from Austin, TX to visit family. It was about noon but we were craving breakfast food. This place is so awesome! Great big portions, super friendly service and a cozy environment. Breakfast is served till 3!"}
{"text":"Never knew Cupcakeries existed before coming here. Great name, great food in addition to the cupcakes. The meatloaf in particular is awesome, and that's a hard dish to make good. Great breakfast menu too. Scrambles and frittata are delicious. You are almost obligated (oh how unfortunate...) to have a cupcake after meals. To say they're the best cupcakes I've had would be an understatement. They also get creative points for themed cupcakes."}
{"text":"This review is based on my experience going to buy cupcakes and not having a meal here.  The woman behind the counter was cold....when you enter a place known for cupcakes, I feel like the staff should be smiling, helpful and appear to have a sugar rush at all times!  

I ordered 4 cupcakes:  triple chocolate, lemon blueberry, strawberry rhubarb and carrot cake.   The cupcakes were......meh.....and small.  For $12 the cupcakes should have been more substantial.  When I go somewhere to buy baked goods, I go because they are supposed to be better than what I make at home.  The only one that I would consider better than what I would make at home was the chocolate cupcake.  I have to say that I'm not impressed and I probably wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"I was first introduced years ago to Daisy when I received a package of their delicious cupcakes for my birthday. Fast forward a few years, and I finally had the opportunity to visit a few months back for brunch.

I love the small cafe feel of Daisy and it's a nice change of pace from some of the larger brunch spots in Madison. You instantly feel very welcome and at home in the bright and cheery decorated restaurant.  We were quickly seated inside, and I have to say the service was great. On this particular day, I was extremely under the weather and barely had a voice. But, our experience made up for it. 

I really wanted to try one of the signature egg casserole dishes, and ordered the Crimini Mushroom & Gruyere Strata. Unfortunately, after placing the order our waitress came back to let me know that they had just run out of that item for the day. No worries. I had heard the egg sandwich was great as well so placed an order for the Award-Winning Egg Sandwich. It comes with fried egg, bacon, cream cheese, purple onion and cilantro on grilled rosemary bread and is served with oven-roasted potatoes and fresh fruit. Basically it's delicious. 

I also of course had a bloody which was good and some coffee to wake me up a little. After devouring brunch, our waitress brought us our check and to our surprise had taken fifty percent off my my particular meal because my original order wasn't available. Completely unexpected but also very kind of her! It's those little things that make such a difference.

I couldn't leave Daisy without ordering a couple cupcakes to go. They were almost all gone as it was later in the morning. TIP - They can quickly sell out of cupcakes. If you're planning on birthday orders or any pick ups I would definitely call in advance and plan ahead.

This is definitely a place you should try out. Prices are great and the food and service fantastic."}
{"text":"Interesting first try of strata. Had a strong but good tasting. The scrambles also look very tasty, and they have huge burgers as well. Kids are all crazy for their cupcakes!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Restaurant Week, summer 2017, and was extremely pleased. What a cute little place! Portions were just the right size and the menu had great selections!

Had the Grapefruit, Avocado, Fennel & Feta salad for the appetizer. The dressing was an orange-shallot vinaigrette that was extremely refreshing and tasty! I ended up picking around the grapefruit, but if I had liked the fruit more it would have been the most perfect salad.

For the entree, I chose the Two Fish, Two Ways option. This was two pieces of fish -- one was salmon topped with pesto and the other was cod topped with fruit salsa. I originally thought I only had the option of one, so when I was told I'd be getting both, I was pleased! Since the plate included two pieces of fish, they were on the smaller size, but no complaints about that because I was full by the end of the meal! The entree was served with sautéed vegetables & mashed potatoes as well, which were both very good.

My friend had the steak with Daisy's house-made roasted-garlic chimichurri sauce & sharp white Cheddar for her entree. She ended up not being a fan of the sauce, but overall the steak was good-sized and cooked well.

For dessert, we decided to get and split the House-made Lemon-Blackberry Cheesecake and the House-made Sweet Cream Panna Cotta with Fresh Fruit Compote. Oh man, both were SO GOOD (and both were gluten-free so yay for those who need it that way!)!!! Panna cotta is like soft, creamy jello... might sound weird but it's delicious. And the cheesecake was flavorful and lemony with a tasty blackberry sauce to top it off.

I NEED to come here again (multiple times) so I can try their breakfast and lunch/dinner menus! Everything looks/sounds so good, and I can't wait to return :)"}
{"text":"I really like the natural vibe of this place...and I like \"real\" food. I've stopped in quite a few times...usually to take something to go...the cupcakes are always a good treat, but today I tried a latte and a berry/cherry scone. The scone was a nice texture...light &  delicious, and the berries/cherries were fresh, and just the right sweet. I don't think I've had a better scone anywhere. The latte was really good, too. Nice people at the counter. Happiness."}
{"text":"Fully enjoyed my lunch there, had the egg sandwich with the oven roasted potatoes.  Putting cream cheese on the sandwich definitely put it over the top into greatness, and the roasted potatoes were excellent, soft and buttery.

Unfortunately the cupcakes left a lot to be desired.  I picked up half a dozen to bring home,  and we served them for dessert that night.  Not more than a few hours had passed, definitely not enough time for them to go stale, but when we tried to eat them, the cake part was incredibly dry, to the point of being unable to finish (and not finishing a cupcake is nearly unheard of for me).  On the vanilla cupcake I ordered for myself, I specifically asked if it was buttercream frosting, and was assured it was.  It was not.  Or if it was, it was the most flavorless buttercream I've ever had the displeasure of eating.  Since we had a red velvet left over as well, I abandoned my cupcake and tried red velvet instead.  The frosting was better, likely saved by the cream cheese, but the cupcake itself was again dry and tasteless.

All in all, I'd have lunch there again in a heartbeat, and even go out of my way to do so.  But I'll never get another cupcake from here."}
{"text":"I checked this place out by myself, and kind of got forgotten about.  There are few things as disheartening as grabbing lunch on your lonesome and being neglected by your server.  Service was kind of slow.  I dug the interior design, and sort of dug the food - which was fine, but nothing to write home about.  

I got a chocolate cupcake on my way out.  The cupcakes look better than they taste.  I like my chocolate cupcakes compact, with rich creamy frosting.  This was really oily, and the frosting was really heavy on the shortening and light on the chocolate-flavored goodness.  Not their fault, but a glob of frosting landed on my new shirt, which has retained an oil spot to this day."}
{"text":"What a bummer. The daisy cafe website says \"vegan cupcakes offered daily.\" I made a special trip to their side of town for a cupcake and when I saw their cupcake case, nothing said vegan, so I asked the girl working if their were any vegan cupcakes. She just looked at me very confused and said no."}
{"text":"There are donut people and then there are cupcake people. Some may argue that they fall in between the two and like both, but these individuals are most certainly lying to themselves. 

I am 100% a donut person, BUT that is not to say I don't like cupcakes. I would preferrr donuts, but I'll consume sugar in all forms, yep - even cupcake form. 
Daisy Café and Cupcakery (as the name implies) is a cupcake person. She lives and sleeps and dreams all things cupcake, and it shows because she sure knows how to make em. 

Daisy cooks up a mean cinnamon cream cheese and carrot walnut cupcake with citrus notes that, in the words of Guy Fieri, makes this cupcake outta bounds.

I've also experienced the cream cheese red velvet and the chocolate peanut butter banana pecan, and while everything was mighty tasty, the true star of the show was the pecan pie cupcake that I was able to try. I follow Daisy on Facebook and they'll periodically post some of the rotating cupcake flavors and this pecan pie one made the page, and seeing as I am absolutely obsessed with pecan pie I knew I had to get my hands on this guy. And I did. And it.was.GOOD.

Cupcake/donut nonsense aside, Daisy also masters the art of good breakfast food. 

When I ate in here I stuck with the traditional \"Pick 3\" of 2 sunny up eggs, bacon, and a pancake. It did not disappoint. 

We also ordered the Chorizo and Avocado Omelet with housemade pico de gallo, oven roasted potatoes, and fresh fruit. Super yum. Great portions and so quality and fresh.

Daisy is a great find in terms of breakfast spots and delicious cupcakes. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery from other Yelp folks and magazines that I dragged a whole group of folks up here one Saturday morning. After the meal I wasn't sure what I did it for. 

The strata was billed as their speciality so decided to go for the chorizo and pepper jack one. What arrived was a quiche with the different ingredients built in layers to represent strata. I found it to be average. The chorizo was good but not at all spicy. The strata was good but not outstanding. 

My wife got the huevos rancheros which was again average. We have had better but this wasn't bad per se. 

Since it was a cupcakery we got a chocolate mocha and blueberry lemon cupcake. Both were again good but not great. 

We asked the server for a to go box which she forgot about and we went up to the counter to pick up. 

Good part is that they have parking for about 10-15 cars  

Overall it was an average experience. A bit of a let down given the great reviews. Definitely not something you drag a group of people to."}
{"text":"So good it's hard to save room for the cupcakes!

Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery has been a mainstay of my family's holiday dining out for a few years now. The large variety of menu options and always delicious dinners and cupcakes ensures everyone leaves satisfied.

From their pasta to salads to my new favorite stew in the Wisconsin winters, Daisy has it all. During our most recent visit I tried the pulled duck and sausage stew which hit the spot perfectly. The duck was tender and juicy, but still flavorful and the sausage added a good touch of spice and saltiness while the tomatoes held all of the flavor together.

Of course I finished with a cupcake which topped off the dinner. Service overall was attentive and helpful when we asked questions about items on the menu as well. I'm sure I'll be back again next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY! Whenever I'm in the mood for fresh food, great service, and unbeatable prices (which is always) I head to the Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery. Their breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus feature a variety of food that are prepared with the utmost of care! I recommend this restaurant to everyone with taste buds and stomachs! 

Make sure to try the bacon chocolate cupcakes!"}
{"text":"A go-to place for my husband and me for dinner, but bfast is also awesome.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  The cupcakes may seem small in our supersized world, but they are delicious, rich and just the right size to complement their tasty food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped to get a cupcake, but decided to eat lunch while we were there. The food was great, I wasn't sure what to expect at first but it was all really fresh and delicious... On the other hand, the cupcakes were good, but not outstanding. We'll definitely be back for lunch again and we'll be trying breakfast here soon!"}
