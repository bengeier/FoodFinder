{"text":"There are days where I crave Peppi's. On the same day that Pittsburgh came out as one of the 17 best foodie cities in the country, I'm at Peppi's. And I am ok with that."}
{"text":"Freindly staff....good cheese....can't wait to try the aftermentioned \"#7\""}
{"text":"Best lunch in downtown! The service is great the sandwich are amazing. Much better then Primanti's. The frys are excellent"}
{"text":"Excellent service and my #7 Roethlisberger was amazing!  Fresh bread and perfectly cooked sausage!  The staff was very friendly and helpful in making my selection!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches (Ham & Cheese, Italian) were fantastic.  Cajun fries were addictive.  Prices were pretty reasonable.  \"Good for kids\" (Yelp filter) is probably stretching it since there were no kids items or portions, but they did have one high chair and I think Yelp says that about all restaurants by default."}
{"text":"I have been eating lunch here for 20+ years and an never disappointed. Their subs are bursting at the seams with goodness, and their Cajun fries with ranch are simply out of this world. Cant go wrong here, unless you are some wimp hipster that needs a sprig of oregano on your plate and chai tea spritzer to feel satisfied...that place is about a block away."}
{"text":"The Roethlisberger sandwich should replace the Primanti sandwich as the sandwich to eat in Pittsburgh. And Big Ben should do something about it"}
{"text":"If you don't love this sandwich you are straight savage,  every bite is like a mini explosion of delicious beef waiting to fill all your taste buds with happiness!"}
{"text":"Have always gotten the Italian hoagie but never actually stepped inside the restaurant.  Our NYC friend was visiting town and he wanted to see the Mattress Factory.  So we were both hungry and Peppi's was on the way and the atmosphere was awesome and fun.  While waiting for our food, an employee there also recommended us to check out RandyLand, which is also down the street.  Great Food and Great people!  Thanks Guys!"}
{"text":"Love a peppi's,  you'll never leave hungry,  great fresh cut fries,  sandwiches are great,  several locations"}
{"text":"Fast Food but right on delicious and their Philly Steak is awesome!!! Great for after a walk on the strip then out for a few beers to round off your day"}
{"text":"How much do I love Peppi's? TTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSS much.   So, I will say -- I am not big on their fries. They are hand cut and all that, but lots of skins and they sometimes aren't cooked enough to have a light, fluffy center. But certainly on par with say, Primanti's or Kennywood's potato patch.  But the fries don't matter. If you're coming here, it's for a tasty, delicious sub. I LOVE the cheese steak and Italian specials with banana peppers. The bread is just awesome -- chewy and moist. Tons of meat and cheese -- everything is fresh. I used to work nearby and would go there once a week to treat myself.   Bonus points for being a funky old 40's diner."}
{"text":"A staple of downtown work lunch. Excellent cheesesteaks, fresh fries, and a great crew of workers.  A Pittsburgh classic in it's own, Peppi's is a must-eat cheesesteak destination in the downtown area.  I've been to Peppi's in the Strip and the North Shore and unfortunately they don't quite stack up (still good though)."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a couple hours at the Heinz museum. Very good sandwiches! Would stop in again when visiting Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I'm not a tourist here to compare my \"beloved New England cuisine\" with the \"lowly Pittsburgh sandwich shops.\" I'm from Pittsburgh so I compare the food I get in this city with what else is available within driving distance.  As far as service, it's never been less than exceptional. Whoever is running this location knows what they're doing. The guys there are always smiling and laughing (in a non-girly, blue collar way of course). They deserve every penny in their Donnie Iris tip jar.  The food...well, I don't go to Primanti's anymore. The bread is always fresh and delicious. The flavors of the meats and dressing on the Italian sandwiches blend flawlessly. The fish sandwich boasts a big crispy piece of quality cod.  The decor and ambience of the dining area is perfect. It has a very nostalgic North Side feel and it's always clean. Plus the window is always there for people-watching.  Peppi's is a big reason why I love living in North Side."}
{"text":"I love their Southern Philly cheese steak. It is delicious and enjoyable. Unlimeted refills on all coke products = AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Nah, anyone with the ATM scam better have an awesome hogie and this one is just 'OK'   Put card in, get prompted to check balance. 3 bucks unless you know the scam and read the fine print.  2 bucks in their pocket to get money, 3 to the bank.  8 dollars to get money from a 'cash only' shop?  I take credit/debit cards and i dont even have a business."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and amazing sandwiches for a great price.  Onion rings and fries are spot on as well."}
{"text":"I received 2 hoagies (half-assed crap) from Peppi's in the Strip from my friends' daughters dance fundraiser just the other day.  I paid $6.50 each for SMALL 8\" or so - smushed bread, hardly any meat and wilted lettuce hoagies!!  Are you kidding me?!  What a rip off!! I have ordered hoagies from all over the place for these types of fundraiser functions as well as sold hoagies for years as a child. THESE HOAGIES ARE THE MOST PATHETIC hoagies I've ever seen or eaten!!  You should be Embarrassed and ashamed to even be selling these!!!  What a joke!!   I will NEVER be purchasing or eating from Peppi's ever again.  Horrible!"}
{"text":"Had a great cheesesteak sandwich at Peppi's. Wanted a good local, no chain place and Peppi's was great. Can't recall the the young man's name who prepared it but he was a great local kid. Excellent Pittsburgh experience!"}
{"text":"I was at the east end co-op and this was the closet spot to get food. It's a small diner which looks exactly like those in movies.   The fries we got was terrible. Probably because they were closing and we got what left. We were in the mood of fries, so we finished them anyway. I ordered their famous Roethlisburger and I really loved it. The minced spicy sausage made it so tasty (and greasy too)! To make myself less guilty for eating so much fat,  I made two meals out of one  sandwich.  I'll drop by again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I visited on a friday. Was busy for 4p.m. but was worth the wait. I had the forbes field sub and it was tasty!!! Had a milk to finish the meal.  Will return @later date...."}
{"text":"meh.  good selection of sandwiches.  had the regular italian which was chintzy on the meat.  you have to get the 'italian special' with extra meat for it to be what i would consider a normal sandwich."}
{"text":"Super friendly people fun atmosphere and delicious food at a fair price.  New to PA and this is my favorite sandwich place."}
{"text":"Damn - was that a good sandwich. The bread is soft, and chewy. There is a large variety of sandwiches to you will surely find something for yourself. Subs are served cold or hot. With your choice of topics and sauce. Cash only, so come prepared."}
{"text":"Charming north side pittsburgher joint with friendly service, reasonable prices and tasty food. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Peppi's on the Northside for over twenty years and it never gets old.  The only problem is sometimes they are so busy you have to wait a while, but I've learned to call ahead and pick it up.  My favorite is the Whiz - an extra large cheese steak with sauteed mushrooms on it.  Their fresh cut fries are awesome (but eat them there - they don't travel as well as the frozen, processed fries from other restaurants).  I also love the Italian Special which I have them add crushed cherry peppers to.  It's also good hot, where they throw it on the grill for a minute or two to heat it up.  In the warmer months they have an outside patio in the back of the building which is pretty cool.  It has an artsy vibe to it and it is a great place to relax on a sunny day.  Go there a few times and the owners, Jeff & Kim, and their staff will get to know you and make you feel welcome.  Chuck always makes me feel at home and John always has something funny to share.  Be sure to feed the meter sufficiently before you feed yourself or your parking ticket might be the most expensive part of the trip to Peppi's!"}
{"text":"2.0/5 - The 7 2.0/5 - Joey Porter \"bella\"  1.5/5 - Service was pretty slow, and people that came in before us got their food earlier."}
{"text":"Love Peppi's!  I always get the mushroom cheese steak (w/ lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, and banana peppers) on a wheat wrap...so good!  The cajun fries are sinful (dip them in ranch dressing) & they have a fun assortment of drinks.  The guys at the counter are sweet, always in a good mood and making jokes.  If the weather is nice, eat out back on their little urban deck ;)"}
{"text":"Great subs/great stories. I love this place and one of my go too places when I am starving and feel like eating a great sub. Lots of options. I classify Peppi's and Primanti's both in my old world Pittsburgh food places. Places I love to reminisce and places I'd love to always return. It may be blue collar but don't let that deter you (if you are that kind to be easily dissuade). Remember Pittsburgh's roots!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches! If your visiting Pittsburgh and want a great \"local\" spot- swing by this place. The fries are good too!"}
{"text":"Currently jamming to \"PYT\" by MJ and \"I'm Coming Out\" by Diana Ross while eating one of the best cheesesteak subs I've ever had. Stopped in for the lunch combo of the cheese steak (melted provolone and onions, and I added lettuce tomato and mayo no charge) with fresh cut fries and a medium drink for under $10. Delicious and filling! As soon as I walked in the guy said he'd be right with me. Good attitudes and good vibes. The cooks and employees were in a great mood (the music def helps) and they were kind. Service was great. Food is great. The inside is what you'd expect in your local downtown Pittsburgh sub joint. If you want to listen to good jams and fill up on good eats stop in Peppi's."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great and the staff is friendly, but the place is absolutely filthy. Your feet stick to the floor and the tables are dirty. Would strongly recommend a TO GO order."}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  The bread they used for the subs was so good.  If you eat here get the fresh cut fries, they're also amazing.  Nice lunch environment!"}
{"text":"Enormous sandwiches, delicious fries. We'd heard about the \"Rothlisburger\" from a friend who didn't even live in the city. Not brave enough to try it yet, but the Butcher (chicken) was fabulous. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love it. Had the Ultra cheese steak today with the cheese fries!  Delicious! Reasonably priced.  You aren't there for the ambiance.  Friendly service.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Update: My last two visits here, much better experience and I'd put them on or with the North Side location. Amazing subs as always, better experience with the staff.  I love Peppi's. For my money there's no sub spot in Pittsburgh I'd rather go. I find myself coming to this location a lot as the Strip District is convenient. That being said, I have several gripes about this location as opposed to the North Side one I also frequent.  (Redacted)  That being said, the food is still delicious. The location is just as \"rustic\" as all of the other spots. But if you want a more pleasant experience I'd recommend the North Side location."}
{"text":"I've been to Peppi's dozens of times, and I can say it's been a rare occasion that I haven't ordered the #7. Soft, delicious sub roll, spicy sausage, fresh lettuce and tomato - can't go wrong. I always load mine with a healthy dose of hot sauce as well.  North side location stands out on service alone, friendly group of guys working behind the counter."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious !!! Cheesesteak was so good ! I'm originally from Phildelphia , and I can't drive 6 hours for a cheesesteak , so Peppi's is my main choice right now !"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here twice when we were in a mood for a quick sandwich. We ordered cheese steak hoagies with fries on both visits.The fries are delicious, fried just right and not greasy. Today's fries contained a lot of little pieces which I just happen to love so that worked for me. Another diner might not like those little bits though. The sandwiches have great flavor with the fried onion crammed into an excellent bun. While we were eating a man came in to order an Italian hoagie. He said he had one from a fundraiser where they sold 2,000. It says something if a fundraiser hoagie garners a new customer.   I would recommend this place only if you are not choosy about decor. This is a diner that may be an original from the 50's. The cooks are very friendly and welcoming, but the cash register clerk is not. Today I asked my husband if he was as friendly as the last time we were here. He laughed and said maybe even more. I can overlook that though. The food is worth a visit."}
{"text":"About a half dozen of us ordered subs from Peppi's on the North Side. And we were all pleased. The bread is VERY good. Thick, chewy, crusty...bread's so good here in Pittsburgh. Most of us got steak hoagies and there was plenty of meat on them.  I personally got the capicola and cheese. I got it with extra onions and hot peppers and, unfortunately, they skimped on the hot peppers. The capicola wasn't hot, either. Still, it was a very good sandwich. They did not skimp on the meat. The dressing was very tasty...I could taste lots of basil and oregano. Everything was very fresh...crisp veggies.  They have a nice sized menu consisting of mostly hoagies. But there are burgers and salads, as well. I've heard that the North Side store is better than the one in the Strip, and I liked their hoagie enough to check and see. I'd recommend this place, especially to people working on the North Side."}
{"text":"Amazing subs. Incredible atmosphere. Friendly service. What more could you ask for? Get the Cajun fries with your order and dip those puppies in ranch! Peppis, get'cha peppis!"}
{"text":"Peppis .. well known sandwich shop in the burg.   I just started a new job in the North Side so couldn't wait to go back to Peppis.  I remember visiting the strip district location often many years ago.   I stopped in and ordered a steak hoagie.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Cash only - no credit cards.  There is an ATM in the restaurant just in case you don have any cash handy.   I was surprised at the very little meat on my hoagie especially by the price $6.75.  I might just order double meat next time.   Another surprise was that there is a burger called \"#7 Roethlis Burger\" which I love the idea although I have never had .. but ketchup brand offered is not \"Heinz\" brand.   I love the menu .. so many different types of sandwiches, salads etc. there is something for everyone.     These were just observances.. my steak hoagie was good and satisfied with the great customer service.    I just visited recently during lunch time at Noon.  As soon as I got there I regretted it but soon realized \"it was all good\".  The staff was so cool and calm and on the ball.. it was a zoo and the line was out the door."}
{"text":"Primanti Brothers is where you go for a cliche \"I went to Pittsburgh\" Instagram photo...  Peppi's...Peppi's is where you go when you actually want an AMAZING, DELICIOUS, HANDCRAFTED, WORK OF ART, DELECTABLE sandwich."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the decor in this place- their food is legit! I personally have had their cheese steak, hot Italian, and fries. Their bread is good, their meat is delicious, and their fries are FRESH not frozen. They're made to order, and perfection. Two people can easily share a small fry- the portions are generous. If you've got a hankering for a legitimate hoagie/sub, head to Peppi's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall, a friendly and fast environment. Great music always playing on the speakers during the lunch rush hours, marked by good service/communication by the employees to customers. Fantastic food at all four locations; is a great place to walk down to on your lunch break/late afternoon hunger. Reasonably priced food, with a 'chill' atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went in yesterday and it was a disaster. Something has changed. they were playing VERY loud rap music, I walked in and there were a bunch of frozen meats on the grill, a couple people were waiting and no one looked at me let alone smiled. I waited at the cash resgister while very unwelcoming people acted busy. Then I overheard the grill guy go to a customer and say \"We can't do this.\" What he was refering to was to put lettucce on her sandwich. He explained that the Health Department was there yesterday and until they get another tong, they cannot use their hands or the meat tong to put the lettuce on the sandwich. So while there was lettuce there in a little bin, they were not putting it on sandwiches. He grumbled more about the health inspection. I looked around and noticed it was filthy, the cutting board looked unclean and had traces of a bunch of sandwiches, the floors are dirty.   Finally the cashier looked up at me and I ordered a coke and left. Never to return.  I am NOT talking about the Strip location. The one near Wilkinsburg in the old diner."}
{"text":"You just gotta have a Peppi's hoagie...especially on your way to a Steelers game.  The guy stands under the bridge near Reedsdale shouting, \"Peppi's.....hoagies....\"  They are damn good.  Talk it into the stadium and enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Peppi's is a great sandwich place. I love getting a Philly style steak sub with a side of fries when I come. The portions of the sandwiches are generous and the bread is always fresh. The atmosphere is very casual and it's a good lunch spot.  The staff is quick and friendly. It's an order at the counter and then wait for your food to be brought out kind of place. They also take call ahead orders which is nice because it can take a few minutes to get your food as everything is made when you order. I've only ever been for lunch and it's always a bit crowded but I've never had an issue getting a table.  Only downsides are that it is cash only and street parking only. While I have not been to their other locations I would 100% recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"We go here any time that we are in this area. My kids look forward to doc appointments at Childrens so we can stop here . Their fries are fresh cut cooked well and I love the cheese steaks . No grease at all. They also have a great staff."}
{"text":"This is a great sub shop with an authentic Burgh vibe. Tasty sandwiches packed with the goods, walls lined up with local fanfare, and burly dudes who look like they know a thing or two about sandwiches are what make Peppi's unique.  Parking is on street but otherwise this place gets no complaints from me.  Peppi's is what Quizno's wishes it could be."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the one on the Strip, and the one on the North Shore across from Nicky's Thai.  Both are great.  All I ever get is the steak with American cheese with onions and mushrooms.  They ask if you want tomatoes mayo and lettuce.  Have no idea why, that stuff should never be on a cheese steak sandwhich.  Anyways, much better than Primanti's for a cheese steak.  primanti's you go to if you want say a steak hoagie (which is not steak but actually one of those rectangular seasoned beef patties on a hoagies roll.  Get that at Primantis with a fried egg, and fries and slaw, and you got a good sammy).  For a cheese steak, this is the only place in Pittsburgh to go.  Peppi's."}
{"text":"Visited Pittsburgh to see the Pirates game. Great pre-game meal spot. Ordered a turkey cheese steak style sandwich. We all enjoyed the meal and the baseball talk with the guys who run the place. A classic is you're heading to Pittsburgh sporting event."}
{"text":"The Roethlisberger is the reason to go here.  Quality every thing any time I went.  Consistent service and taste as if these guys are robots.  I've had lots of fresh cut fries but something about theirs that makes them stand out.  The whole experience makes this as important to eat at as Primanti's.  Remember to go to the one on the North Shore.  Excellent flavor and excellent service with options for your atmosphere."}
{"text":"You know that old saying? \"Opinions are like butt holes, everyone has one.\" Well it's defiantly true of Peppi's. Some people hate it. Some people love it. I am a part of the later group. Peppi's is a Pittsburgh institution that unlike Primanti's hasn't sold out yet.   This location is in a old diner and is rather divey but, who cares? Their food is as great as ever. F.Y.I. There is a small parking lot in the back. On this particular visit we all got cheese steaks to go. My wife and I both got New Yorker's. (steak hoagie with provolone and American cheeses, grilled onions and bacon and we added mushrooms). Our daughter got a regular cheese steak. Ten minutes later we were on our way. After smelling our hoagies during the whole torturous ride home we destroyed them as soon as we hit the door!  They were just as good as ever! We all tried to eat just half but, the other half keep calling us so we put them out of their misery and eat the whole thing."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in Pittsburgh as far as I am concerned....everything is always fresh and cooked to order and tastes really good!  The place is nothing special...I have never sat in the one downtown, but there is one more on the east side and it looks the same.  Small place, but clean and worth going just to grab a sandwich or fries!!!"}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped at this little diner on the way back from visiting Construction Junction one day. We just kinda liked the looks of the place - an honest-to-goodness Atomic Era diner.   Diner aficionados will love this beautifully preserved and fairly rare National brand diner manufactured in the 1940s. The stainless steel and dark-wood interior is glorious with its Formica counters, tile floors, winged clock, and Art Deco elements; it even has the original small bathrooms. You can sit at the counter on stools or in booths on the side.   Dad and I were blown away by the greasy goodness of our meal: cheesesteaks with super-fresh bread, tasty strips of steak and onions, and perfectly melted cheese, not to mention the delish fresh-cut fries! They are known for their \"Roethlisburger sandwich\" - sausage and hamburger with egg and American cheese. The rest of the menu is pretty standard diner fare: loose meat, cheese, and mushroom sandwiches; fries; and salads. Simple but oh-so-good.   If you are a fan of diner architecture and/or diner food, Peppi's is well worth the trip! I've also been to the north-side location, and the food is just as good, though the surroundings are not as cool (it's not a prefab diner but a regular restaurant with wooden booths). The north-side staff is fun and friendly, and the soft drinks are bottomless."}
{"text":"I ordered fries and and a cheese steak it was amazing! The cheese steak comes with lettuce and tomatoes, which the choice of onions. The bread went really well with the cheese steak, it tasted fresh and did a good job of balancing the strong taste of the chesse steak The fries were hot and crispy and they gave generous portions. The staff was very friendly. The wait wasn't bad at all, about 6 minutes, and they don't pre-cook their food so its fresh."}
{"text":"I love Peppi's! I always get The Amazing Siegfried. It is a chicken club type of sandwich with bacon, mushrooms, provolone and american cheese. It is delish! I would give five stars but, their delivery guys is always slow and by the time the food gets to me it's semi warm. They have really good fries too!"}
{"text":"Peppi's is my favorite sammich place in Pittsburgh, and, although a little biased as a native to the Burgh, better steaks than anywhere in Philly. The Big Wheeler is my choice most of the time. The Cajun fries are always my choice."}
{"text":"I give the steak sandwich (The Special) with peppers and onions 4 stars. One of the better in the city.  But the music they play here coupled with the good food moves me to 5 stars.  I'm a foodie and musician so this place warms my warm Pittsburgh heart.  Its also home to the Roethlisburger which is essentially a heart attack hoagie.  It's also cash only yinz so leave the plastic at home."}
{"text":"great place to eat and visit have the big ben sandwhich its awesome prices are great also//"}
{"text":"I found a short black curly hair in my basket of fries... and it was definitely not mine.  Needless to say, this completely ruined my meal. Thanks to Peppi's, I won't be eating anything that isn't ready-to-eat as is (like fruit) for the next few days.  Not only does the shop LOOK grimey, it IS grimey... Completely disgusted."}
{"text":"Peppi's and Pittsburgh = A winning tradition. The memorabilia on the walls, the pictures of athletes and local celebs, the names of the sandwiches; Peppi's is Pittsburgh. The hoagies are huge and delicious. The menu options are wide ranging. The service is fast, friendly, and awesome."}
{"text":"Hands down--The best hoagies in town! No one, and I mean no one, has better hoagies!! I highly recommend The Wiz or The Phantom!!"}
{"text":"Went to Pittsburg for couple days and the uber driver recommended this little joint in the middle of the strip district.  It is an old place with tons of flavor, i had the pepper steak hoagie... too much food for a soul with fries included.   This is a MUST to visit in this lovely city."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've heard a lot of good things about this place. And I wanted to like it!  But it was seriously bad. I very rarely eat somewhere and don't finish my food simply because I don't like it. But I couldn't eat it. I got the Shadyside and it was super greasy, and the flavor just wasn't there. My roommate got the Portabella and she wasn't feelin' it either.  The guy who served us was cool beans though."}
{"text":"If the old city mainstay littered with sandwiches-of-old, walls festooned with photos of celebrities with the owner, and the SAME things they have been doing since they opened ever go out of style, then I'll quit at life.   Peppi's isn't just a spot for lunch. It's a storybook opened to the meat of the climax of one incredible story. To say they have \"history\" would be a disservice. These guys wrote the book from what I can glean from the pictures sports memorabilia. I had the pleasure of visiting while in Pittsburgh this summer and was thrilled with the product and especially the service.   I had a group of kids with me, so I made sure they didn't have to do too much talking for these fast-paced guys. We ordered a bunch of fries, drinks, and a mixtures of mains. Some of the kiddos decided to go for comforts (i.e. chicken fingers. Lame) but a few of us went for some menu titans. Namely, The Big Wheeler. Holy cow. Quite literally. Steak and sausage with provolone. Pretty unreal. It was a massive sandwich, too. All of the flavors melded together were like the Blues ancients, all of the Steelers and Pirates players, and all of the Ohio riverboat captains together were giving me high-fives. It just felt right. Meaty, greasy, melty, packed with flavor, and delightfully heavy. I felt like more of a complete human after having this sandwich.   Though we were all famished from the seemingly manual labor we were doing, I could only make it through half of it in one sitting.   Also, the owner and all of the folks on the line were incredibly nice. They had grace with our group and made us feel incredibly welcome.   Pro Tip: Make sure you have cash for this location. They have an ATM in-house, but it'll speed things up if you have your own when you walk in.   If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, Peppi's will be a definite visit. Rock on."}
{"text":"I went to Peppis the other day for lunch and had a decent time. If I could, I would give my turkey sub 5 stars...it was DELICIOUS! The bread was amazing and I was very happy with the meal. The experience on the other hand was a bit rough. It may have been because it was lunch time and the line was literally out the door, but, this is one of those places that you have to know what you are going to get the second you step in line. No time to look at the menu.  I might have missed a sign or two, but I did not know that they only take cash...so I had to step out of line to get money from the onsite ATM, which annoyed everyone - including me. The waitress cleaning tables was a bit snippy as well. Again, I am not going to write the place off - the food was good. Maybe next time the experience will be a bit better."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and the food has never disappointed. This is tasty hot sandwich shop. My husband and I usually go here when we don't feel like cooking but don't want go out to eat. The wings are good too, but my favorite is the fries."}
{"text":"Simple, cheap, gooey and consistent. Can't go wrong with any of their subs."}
{"text":"Peppi's is delicious. I ordered the #7 (RoethlisBurger) which is blend of hamburger and sausage with american cheese and egg. It was fantastic.  This is exactly the type of sandwich I have been looking for in Pittsburgh... unabashedly unhealthy and irrefutably delicious. It reminds me of a somewhat better version of my favorite sandwich chain from Detroit, Tubby's. In fact, I intend to give Tubby's bottled dressing a whirl on my next order from Peppi's."}
{"text":"Peppi's did not leave me peppy.  The wait for a cheesteak sandwich was just too long.  I came here after the lunch rush and still waited around 20-25 minutes.  The sandwich was o.k.  I got the steak special which includes, beef, cheese, onions, peppers, lettuce, and mayo.  The meat comes frozen in a rectangled thin patty.  It is fried, then chopped up, and ingredients added.  Half of my fries were burnt and the other half was soggy.  The restaurant is a typical dive and has many Pittsburgh Steelers paraphernalia."}
{"text":"Short and sweet,this place is awesome.  Great food and atmosphere. Every time I come here, I get the Big Wheeler, or the number 7. Never left without saying \"wow, that was great\""}
{"text":"The cheese steaks here are amazing. I went with the phantom because i love eggs and peppers. Also paired it with the Cajun fries and a side of cheese. They offer free refills on drinks aswell. Im not one who usually goes for cheese steaks but i was fairly impressed with the quality of that sandwich."}
{"text":"I've had my share of steak and cheese... Peppi's just made the top of my list... fries are pretty damn good too!!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for to go hoagies. There was no meat all bread. Would have been good if they actually put steak on our cheesesteak. What a rip!!!"}
{"text":"I get the #7 roethlisburger every time I'm in the strip.  It never seems to disappoint.  There is tons of sports memorabilia and history in this place. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm a plain person I like ordinary hoagies but omg when I come to peppis I go all out with stuff I hardly eat! The staff here is funny as heck and cool and sometimes they'll give you a discount on your order. I love it. I come here every Chance I get. Wish they were open later though.   CASH ONLY BTW"}
{"text":"Spot on suggestions from the cook when we first arrived! We enjoyed the New Yorker and the Franco...with a side of well seasoned Cajun fries. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know if ya'll know but Peppis kicks the shit out of Primanti Brothers! I mean come on, they have a hoggie named after Big Ben   named after his own spec's for a hoggie after being a regular there for years! Big Ben! This is the House of Prime Rib of Hoggie spots!  Don't get sprung!"}
{"text":"This was easily the best cheesesteak i've ever had...Sorry Philly. It can be overwhelming when you walk in as its crowded and crammed. It has a sort of NY vibe when it's busy as the staff is in a rush to get you your order and paid.  That being said, as a 1st timer, I asked for some advice and they graciously provided it. I had the New Yorker (Cheese Steak with Bacon) and it was by far the best cheesesteak I've ever had.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Forget corporately-owned/sold-out/portion-controlled Primanti Bros. - Peppi's is more of the deal deal for PGH sandwich-y / greasy / drunk-y food ... The cheese-steak is decent ... Fries are pretty good ...  Word on the street is the North side / Western Avenue location makes the best sandwiches for whatever reason..."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way through PA heading south. It was a couple miles out of the way to the north shore,  but well worth it. Will definitely go back if we get the chance.  The staff was very fast and friendly.  The food was terrific."}
{"text":"I LOVE PEPPIS!!! Everything about their sandwiches is glorious! The guys behind the bar are always smiling and joking and just generally happy. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu because the subs are all so good! The place is a cash only establishment but they do have an atm inside.. Always enjoyable and left feeling full and satisfied. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan. But, can't have this everyday. The food is good. Great take out or delivery. They are busy, so know what you want when you order. The sandwiches rival Uncle Sam's locally. These are not your Subway sandwiches; they are MUCH better. The steak sandwich, chicken, burgers, salads are all good. Recommend for a quick lunch pick up for the office!"}
{"text":"Definitely a spot to check out when looking for a quality sandwich at a reasonable price.  The shop staff are very friendly and more than willing to accommodate any request.   Do yourself a favor and get one of the steak sandwiches off of the menu. They are amazing. The ultra is my favorite.  Also the Cancun fries are awesome. 1 order is for sue big enough to serve 2 people maybe even 3!   This is one of the Peppis that takes credit cards as well. Not all do FYI"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.   Definitely a greasy spoon joint. One time tor there and the staff couldn't be more friendly.   The next time you go in be weary of a older lady at the register couldn't be more upset that you walked in and interrupted her picking fries out of the warmer.  The food is pretty good if you are looking for a greasy cheese steak and fries type of meal.   Again just don't go here and expect to be said hello or thank you to.   The regular cheesesteak and Cajun fries are pretty good."}
{"text":"I had some friends rave about Peppi's that drove from Robinson office parks to get a sub at one of the city locations.  I never understood that until just now.  I had my first visit and lunch at Peppi's.  I ordered the #7, since I recall seeing it on TV before...maybe one of Rick Seback's shows.  It was hands down the best sandwich I have ever had.  On top of that, the customer service was excellent and everyone was very polite and upbeat..something that you almost never see in a food establishment.  I am now hooked and plan to do the challenge where you basically check off every sub on the menu."}
{"text":"Pippi's is a great Pittsburgh resturant.  I would highly recommend it to any out of towners who wanted to get a taste of the city.   They sale a sandwhich called the Pittsburger!!!   Peppi's is not for the calorie counter. They do not skimp on toppings either tons of fatty cheese, meats and mayo. With a couple of tomatoes for good measure.   So if you are watching your waste line you may want to stear clear.  I mean you can get a philly cheese steak with 6 oz of meat on it.  This place is worth getting a sandwhich and splitting it with a friend.   My favorite menu option is the cajun fries served with a side of ranch dressing.  Totally worth every calorie."}
{"text":"Godd#$*m delicious.  I am a major fan of the Cajun fries always fresh hot and completely covered in a smokey savory Cajun spice blend with a side of home made ranch that is so good at cooling your hot mouth.   On my last visit I got a tuna melt which did not disappoint.  The tuna salad taste like how mom makes and was served with the additional of lettecue, tomatoes and onion and melted American cheese."}
{"text":"This is a regular stop of mine because I work on the strip in Pittsburgh. I want to share that I have probably eaten here 40+ times so I have tried about 10 hoagies on the menu. I went with the regular Steak and cheese hoagie- grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo...add some hot sauce at the table, order of fresh cut fries and a drink. I get a work discount of 10% so anywhere you can eat lunch under $8 is awesome in any city.  My only complaint is that occasionally the meat to bread ratio isn't too great. Don't get me wrong I'm not expecting 12 ounces of meat but it can be disappointing. I recommend one of the more creative sandwiches then. Though the breads here are so fresh and enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was waiting my bus and starving. Than I came to yelp to check what I have near by to eat. And I found Peppis.. I entered the place and didn't get so much confidence but I ordered the subs.. IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! a local restaurant and Amazing food! I definitely recommend!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food = 5 stars.  Wait time = 2 stars.  Okay, I finally made it here.  My sandwich was amazing and excellent (more details below).  However, it took 41 minutes from order time until our two sandwiches came out, and it was just not that busy.  The service was otherwise very good - friendly crew, easy going and helpful, etc.  But the fries came out in 10 minutes, and it took 31 more to get two, standard sandwiches.  That's just a bit broken.  FOOD:  Excellent.  I got the No. 7 (a.k.a., \"the Roethlisberger\"), and it did not disappoint.  The bread is a standout - so fresh, so soft.  The meats were great - a mix of ground beef and spicy sausage, served piping hot and just delicious.  I was unsure about the egg part, but it worked - it's not really a fried egg - more like scrambled on the flattop, and spread out flat, so it forms another layer.  My lovely wife got a Pepper Steak, add mushrooms.  She rated it highly as well.  One note:  the cheesesteaks can come with lettuce and tomato if you're into that, versus without, as is more traditional for a cheesesteak.  I will try again, but the 40+ minute wait (I really timed it, yes) could be a deal-killer.  Let's hope it was a one-off.  If so, I'll be glad to update my review."}
{"text":"This is probably some of the best drunk food in the strip, neck and neck with Primantis.  I used to eat here a good bit working locally, but it kind of became too heavy to eat for lunch.  Their portions are fabulous and they have or at last had a great lunch special, Italian sub, fries and a drink for like 8 bucks.  Not bad, but you could seriously split it, because you will be sleeping when you get back to your desk.  Great stop on occasion, but too much for a regular stop."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because I wanted to do something other than the regular primantis or burgatory. I got a hot turkey sandwich and the bread is incredible (from mancinis). I actually ended up going back the next weekend.   For some reason the first time that I went there was an onion type thing going on in the air and my eyes were burning but the second time that didn't happen."}
{"text":"As a native Pittsburgher, I'm slightly embarrassed by how long it took me to finally try one of the various Peppi's locations.  But once I did, I went every week for a month.  I don't go nearly that often, but I love the friendliness of the staff along with the selection of mouth-watering sandwiches.  I don't know what they put on their meat.  I don't know how they found the perfect bread for subs.  All I know is that it all keeps me coming back.    I've tried several variations of the cheese steak and I've had the Italian sub.  The fries are average, not my favorite and no something I even feel is necessary with the Peppi's sub.  When visitors ask me where to get a good sandwich, I'll recommend Peppi's or Primanti's.  Though anymore I favor Peppi's for myself."}
{"text":"I survived off of Peppi's on Western Ave, for years as a student at CCAC Allegheny campus. After my morning classes had ended this was my go to lunch/dinner spot.    Any college kid on tight budge can assure you that there are days when only one meal is all you can afford.    Peppi's portions are huge and they don't skimp on either meats, veggies or cheese.  One sub can easily be eaten for lunch with plenty leftovers that can be eaten as dinner.   Typically for me I get the Cajun fries which are delicious cheap and you get a ton.  They are dusted with a spicy Cajun seasoning and served with a side of house made ranch.   Since transferring to college in Oakland I don't get to frequent Peppi's as much but I have nothing but fond memories. Of all the Peppi locations this is by far my favorite."}
{"text":"All I can say is they have the best cheesesteak that I've every had. I only get them here."}
{"text":"This is a great Philly and really as good as anything in Philly for that matter.  I recommend the Ultra if you like big and great.  The regular cheese steak is what I get these days though.  It is enough for me!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to come for lunch and dinner. It gets a star docked because it's cash only, but hey great place to get yummy sandwiches and tasty fries. The cajun fries are  particular delightful. Not only is the seasoning that they use fresh (not stale), but it really does give the fries a nice spicy kick that other fries do not have. The fries are also not too oily (yes, can other joints please learn this?) but are fresh, crisp, and not too soggy.  Bread is freshly baked & tasty and the meat used is gorgeously delicious. Recommend the Roethelisburger as a must-get sandwich, along with the Big Wheeler as a close second."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is good! Cajun fries is a must have! The only thing is they are cash only which is inconvenient. Didn't know that when I went there for the first time. But the stuff were very helpful and friendly. Highly recommend to anyone who loves cheese steak, who wants comfort food! Really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The only downside is the decor and worn out furniture. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly.  Been eating here for years but its time they update and invest in new chairs. They have a sandwich for all to enjoy and their cajun fries with ranch dressing is a diet cheat day dream come true.  The bread is a winner for bread lovers. Fresh and delicious so it makes leftovers worth saving for round 2. They have several locations and they're all enjoyable so if you're in the mood for a cheese steak this is a great stop."}
{"text":"As primanti's is to many Pittsburghers, Peppi's is to my boyfriend. He adores this place. We usually go to the one on the North Side (their back yard area is adorable!) but they were closed on the particular day we were planning to make a visit, which led us to the Strip. The seating is limited, so on a busy day, you may not be able to get a table. My mom, dad, boyfriend and I were able to find a table easily when we visited. My mom and I decided to split the Joey Porter \"Bella\" hoagie (steak, portabella mushrooms, swiss cheese and horseradish sauce) and added fried onions, lettuce and tomato to our hoagie. We also ordered onion rings and French fries as well. My dad ordered the Italian hoagie and my boyfriend ordered the New Yorker, which is his favorite.  My mom and I really enjoyed our hoagie, although we did find there to be a lot of bread on the sandwich. The bread was fresh and delicious, but made the sandwich extremely filling. The horseradish sauce on the sandwich was delicious and not very spicy. The onion rings were fresh and yummy and the fries were fresh cut! My mom and dad were first timers and really enjoyed their food.   One important thing to mention- the service was amazing. The man who took the orders was very patient with my family, while we tried to figure out what we wanted. He gave us helpful suggestions and was overall very friendly. At the end of our meal, he thanked us for stopping in, which was really nice.  Overall, I am not as obsessed with Peppi's as my boyfriend is, but I definitely enjoy their food. I don't think I will ever crave it like he does, but I don't think I could ever turn it down either!"}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend's favorite Peppi's location and I can see why. The staff are INCREDIBLY friendly. The food is always delicious, because it's Peppi's after all! The New York Steak is his favorite and I usually try something different every time I visit. The bread is always fresh and soft and the hoagies are always just packed with flavor. Yum!"}
{"text":"Try this place if you want a belly ache and need to pass gas. Place was disgusting! Workers were nice and pleasant but no one wore gloves. I also noticed buckets of fries pre cooked beneath the grill ugh how sanitary. I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Really solid place! I can't eat bread so I just ate the meat which was really good :) I liked it and will be back. My only complaint was slow service."}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmmmm...the bread is awesome, and the rest of the ingredients are fresh.  the staff is hilarious & friendly -- including the owner's 12-year-old kid, who works bussing tables on the weekends.  also, they have cherry coke as a fountain drink!!!  again: mmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Owner friendly. So is staff. You won't get \" Welcome To Moes!\" type greeting when you walk in, but that's normal for the area.    Sandwiches are huge, tasty and just a cut above the rest. Outdoor patio seating is nice, very urban, very clean.  I got the big wheeler per Jeff's recommendation. Epic."}
{"text":"Wow I feel so out of it... I didn't know about Peppi's all this time and I've been here for about 9 years. My goodness. Just recently found out about this place about a few months ago... and this place never lets me down. The guys work there are straightforward and quick with your orders. Me and my friends went for lunch on a Thursday and it was so crowded but thank god we found a table! I actually like it here much more than Primantis. Def will come back here soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Peppi's is a must if you're in the area. Don't forget your cash though! I live down the street so I try not to go as often as I want to because it is so good and you'll want to have lunch there every day! A great lunch spot or early afternoon quick bite. I always get the bbq chicken cheesesteak. The photo may look messy and it sure was but the taste is fabulous. Never a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Small but organized and fast. Food was good. I got the mushroom philly cheese steak and the fries. Fries were hot and crispyand idk, I guess I'm not a Philly cheesesteak fan. Nothing was wrong with it... Just should have gotten a burger or a salad... Everything was great. Cash only though(smart on their part)"}
{"text":"The best sub around. Fresh warm bread was awesome! The customer service made it even better. Everyone was so friendly and nice. I asked for a to go box and they told me to bring it up when I was done and they wrapped and bagged it for me. It's the small things that can take your experience from good to great. Definitely will be a regular stop!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch based on the recommendation of the guy manning the parking lot (and the guy that was pulling in to park) and it was the best recommendation we've ever received. I got the \"Ultra\" Cheesesteak and my husband tackled The Roethlisburger. We also ordered a large order of cheese fries. The fries seem hand it and the cheese to dip them in is the perfect mix of salty and cheesy. The real standouts, however, were the sandwiches. First of all, they are HUGE. They come with lettuce, tomato and mayo. My hubby and I are firm believers in not messing with the way people suggest you eat things so we got our sandwiches with everything they recommended. The meats on both sandwiches were so tender and flavorful. The cheesesteak was the best sandwich I've ever had. My husband loved the \"#7\" so much that he ate until he was over-full. It was a tiny bit spicy and so very good. Don't miss Peppi's. It is perfection"}
{"text":"Typical dive joint. The establishment is a little soggy but clean. The service is a little slow, especially during a weekday lunch hour, but friendly.  The cheese steak is good but not spectacular. The portion size is large enough. The fries alternate between crispy and soggy. Overall, it's not a bad place to go for lunch if you're looking for a basic hoagie."}
{"text":"Essence of a good hoagie is that fresh bread with a lil flaky crust and just the right crunch to compliment that gooey goodness it holds. Perfect bread..perfect amount of meat and seasonings..very reasonably priced. Not 5 star as the meat is a lil too salty..we tried the spicy sausage and sicilian ..both had meats that were a lil too salty to our liking. Craving a real hoagie hoagie??!!not that \"i am so fancy that I will leave you guilty yet hungry\" good for nothing sandwiches??i suggest head here."}
{"text":"My First Peppi  I have lived in the Pittsburgh, Burgh, D' burgh, you know an I hope you get it. Anywho, like the title of this review states. This is my first Peppi's experience. We got take out today, so this review will not reach to the decor vector.  Today, Big Jim, #Nickdoinbigthings, and DJ (aka, sakk) were all plotting our next move in the take down of the new kitchen hood system for our new Sandwich Shop, SpitfireZ. I know shameless plug but, I am reviewing what you would call a competitor. Again i ramble now to the hoagie.  The order was 4 Sicilian Italian's, and a Cheese Steak. The Sicilian is a typical Italian hoagie with extra Cappricola. The hoagie was not the best Italian hoagie I ever ate but was great 2 high quality for the price. The biggest quality of Peppi's is the price, FANTASTIC PRICES. Great hoagie for great price. I have know Idea how the Steak and Cheese was, for I am not a big Steak & Cheese. But I heard no complaints.   I will be back to Peppi's on a regular basis, on my regular trips to the city.  JEDI APPROVED"}
{"text":"You know, I Looooove Peppi's. Something about their signature subs just tastes soooo good. I suggest you check out the New Yorker with double meat. And they reheat surprisingly well too! I'd honestly suggest this place as a Pittsburgh sandwich icon over Primanti's any day."}
{"text":"The Roethlisburger sandwich is beyond delicious if you like Pittsburgh style sandwiches with more than enough toppings and sauces like I do!  I always go to the Strip District location. The staff there is young and more than friendly. I always enjoy a place with self-serve drink fountains since I am one of those people who usually pisses off a waitress since I'm in need of refill after refill during my feast!  You can read more about Peppi's on my blog at http://midnightguru.com/place.php?id=277"}
{"text":"Who needs fries and coleslaw on your sandwich when you have Peppi's? Eat the food because it's good...not because it was good 20 years ago...order a #7 and be truly amazed."}
{"text":"Peppi's 1, Pep Boys 0.  This place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!  Personal Experience:   I've only been to this location once... I ordered the usual (a Roethlisberger) and it was absolutely wonderful. I liked it just about as much as the other two locations I've been to. I'm not sure which one is my fave... maybe Strip District because (a) it was my first time and (b) it has the word \"Strip\" in it, and my gf usually does whenever we go to Pitt.  Just order a Roethlisberger (or anything really) and enjoy it. Let me know what you think. Service is lovely, sandwiches are enormous, and this place is twice as good as Primanti's will ever be. And it's real Pittsburghese instead of some kind of tourist-trap pretentiousness.  More info: Well, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it \"plus an egg\". The \"plus an egg\" thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.  Plus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... \"plus an egg\". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there"}
{"text":"Peppi's 2, Pep Boys 0.  Personal Experience: This was the second Peppi's I ever visited, back in the old days.  I absolutely loved it! It took about 10 mins to make my Roethlisberger, and the whole time, the guy was telling me about the shop, about the sandwich, and asking where I was from and how I heard about it. He was fun and interesting and interested in me. It felt like I had a friend. That's the kind of service which is hard to come by these days.  What's more, the sandwich was spectacular. It always is, but he seemed to make it extra greasy, and he put 2 eggs on there instead of 1 for me even though I only asked for 1. Some of the best service I've had anywhere, actually.  I would come back to this location, or the Strip District one, over all the others. I love it. Best service. Miles better than Primanti's.  And more info:  This place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!  Well, well, well.

This place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!  This place rocks, and it rocks the Roethlisberger. It's somewhere between 4 and 5, but they gave me free fries, and the RB is kind of addictive, so this Pitt institution gets a 5/5"}
{"text":"My mom's from Philly, and our standards for a cheesesteak are pretty high. They were met here! This is a yummy divey kinda place where you order at the counter, and your food is brought to you. The bread is great, and the quality of the meats is good as well.  The decor is really what kept me smiling here. Lots of vintage sports items, photos, and a ton of old Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head dolls! My family was entertained. They also play a great mix of old (Ray Charles) and new-ish (Green Day) music and it all flows together so nicely. We had family members ranging from ages 20-60 and everyone found themselves bobbing and singing along at some point. This was an enjoyable place, and if I'm on the strip again, I'm definitely stopping in!"}
{"text":"The REAL sandwich king of Pittsburgh.  This may sound blasphemous, but I really don't understand the obsession with Primanti Bros.  The bread is too small for the sandwich, the meat tastes weird (especially their 'cheesesteak'), and I just don't feel the love for a heaping handful of french fries stuffed onto a sandwich.  The taste of potatoes shouldn't dominate one's sandwich.  Peppi's is the creator of The #7 (nicknamed The Roethlisburger in homage to Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger).  It is an extraordinary combination of hamburger meat and sausage (and they use some of the best tasting sausage available) with American cheese mixed in on the softest of rolls.  Really, Peppi's uses the best bread for their sandwiches and that, in my opinion, is what makes a sandwich.    Located in the Strip District, you can shop your extra sandwich weight off after lunch by visiting any of a few dozen specialty shops in the historic district.    Yinz'll love it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Pittsburgh for hoagies. The bread is incredible. It looks as though it's a complete dive.... but as I know, this is when food is sometimes at its best. Everything they have is great. I usually get the Big Wheeler. It has ground steak and hot sausage with provolone. I get it with onions and lettuce also. Many of my friends go here and everyone loves it. I have never heard of anything bad said about peppi's. Good to sit and eat or grab it to go. You wont be unhappy, I promise."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for my first time, and really enjoyed the food. I had a New Yorker which is basically a cheesesteak with bacon. Between that and my cajun fries, I couldn't finish my meal and I'm a big guy so you know the portions are decent-sized. The employees were friendly and it's a cool old-school diner."}
{"text":"2 words- COLD ITALIAN! I have been getting these subs in front of the stadium for 3 years! They are awesome!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and we were referred here my a friend at work.  We walked in and the service was great.  We had some jokes with the staff and they made the experience fun.  The food was fantastic and the sandwich was huge and a great value for the price.  The decor was fun with old pictures and lots of Steelers stuff in the walls.  Also a ton of pictures to look at on the walls!   Great experience and great people and great food.   There are also lots of shops and fun things to do close by."}
{"text":"We had been checking out baby penguins at the Aviary, and we decided it was too late for a major lunch, but there was no way we would last until dinner. We looked on Yelp and found Peppi's nearby. I walked in and was SO happy with the whole set up- the space, the vibe, and the people behind the counter. Everyone was patient and pleasant as we made our decisions- the Santucci and the Cathedral.  We asked them to split them 3 ways, and they were very accommodating.  Had I just had the Cathedral, I would have been happy.  But OMG! The Santucci was mind blowing. The bread is great, the ratios were perfect- not too dry or wet- and the grilled vegetables kicked it to another level.  Would totally come back. Thank you for such a great sandwich experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Best place to go to get an amazing Philly cheesesteak sandwich!!!! Whenever I come to area, I always come here. Override a few different places but this place stands out amongst the rest!"}
{"text":"I feel like I need a shower after I eat a Peppi's sandwich, but in a good way.  Peppi's subs are so good I need profanity to fully express how good they are.  Go get a Peppi's sandwich bc you need one.  Not hungry?  Excuse not valid, you need one.  Did you know I can unhinge my jaw and swallow things whole?   I didnt either, until I had Peppi's.  Are you hung over?  Peppi's has HEALING POWERS and will cure your hangover!  Also, since I'm among friends here I will make a confession.  I do not care for Primanti's.  Somehow thats like telling people you didn't like the Godfather.  I do not like Primanti's, and Peppi's is my favorite \"Pittsburgh\" sandwich.  I've Peppi'd on the North Side, Dahntahn, and in the Strip District.  They're all good.  I get the Italian, and I love the dressing they put on the sandwich.  Now I want Peppi's and its only 9:30 in the morning.  Damn.  Just go eat at Peppi's.  You'll realize this review is just pure truth.  It's delicious, and greasy, and good."}
{"text":"I used to go to Peppi's all the time but hadn't been in probably over a year when I returned this past weekend. We were walking through the Strip and hopped in here because all the brunch places were packed.  The location is small on the inside, but I've never had trouble getting a seat. Their menu is large and the employees are always very friendly. My husband always gets the Rothelsburger and I rotate between their few vegetarian sandwiches. And we always get the cheese fries.  The food is consistently great, and this past weekend was no exception. Sometimes it takes a while to get your food - this past weekend they were short staffed, and it took a long time. However, they apologized and were very friendly about it.  I do wish they had some better vegetarian options. I feel like their veggie sandwiches are really close to being great, but kind of miss the mark - there's just some sort of flavor lacking. I can't quite put my finger on it. But the cheese fries always hit the mark for me!  Overall, love Peppi's and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Everyone in town raves about Primanti's. However, this has to be my more favorite place to stop while in Pittsburgh. They have an awesome menu (cash only) but you cannot leave and not get the Roethli\"burger\". Delicious. Yum. Heck to the yes. I love the small kitchen style atmosphere, and they love it when you tip. I mean, they go nuts when you do (Ala Cold Stone singing style nuts). Great people, even better food. Come hungry!"}

{"text":"Just had some great steak sandwiches at Peppi's. Called ahead and ordered and everything was ready when we got there. The cajun fries were out of this world!  The manager Jay and everyone was very friendly.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I finally tested Peppi's out last week in the Strip District on a Saturday afternoon.  Living in Squirrel Hill and going to school at CMU, I am a die-hard fan of Uncle Sam's subs, and I go there quite frequently.  I'm surprised that no one has compared Peppi's and Uncle Sam's because they are practically identical, minus Uncle Sam's throwing in free fries if you eat in.  I ordered a cheesesteak ($7.22 w tax), after all of the cashiers agreed that it was one of the best sandwiches on the menu.  As promised, it was a delicious sandwich.  The bread was nice and fresh and the steak was good.  Additionally, the people working there were very friendly as well.  The portion was huge, and I got a meal and a snack out of my sub.  If you are looking for a quick sit-down or to-go lunch, Peppi's is a great place in the Strip for just that."}
{"text":"The Roethlisberger was solid, but it didnt have that wow factor. It seems as if they use a \"special\" sauce reminiscent of Big Mac sauce.  Iv had better hoagies/sandwiches in Pittsburgh, including Spaks and Gauchos. Gotta love some fresh cut fries though. Overall its pretty tasty and huge portions, so i can't complain whatsoever"}
{"text":"You can't get a better hoagie.  The Cajun Fries are a must have!!!  My favorite is the Italian, the Carol Delight is my 2nd favorite and they even have options for our non-meateating friends with the Shadyside (delicious!).  You gotta try this Pittsburgh gem."}
{"text":"This one was on our list of must do's! We had 3 late 20's kids with us- last day of their stay we hit peppy's- it's a smalllllll little random sandwich shop in the strip district. You self order and wait for sandwiches on paper- NO FRILLS!! All three guys ordered the # 7 the Ben Rothesburger-- each one took the first bite and literally made a noise of joy followed by OMGOSH this is sooo good! Last Big Win for the kids food experience in Pittsburgh - full and happy as they left for their flight back Cali. Sandwiches are big - bread is amazing no matter what you order, if your on a food journey this is a must for lunch between shopping or early dinner after long day before you go rest -"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great with a good amount of meat. We also tried their Cajun Fries which are deliciously spicy."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The cooks were really friendly and the sandwiches were really tasty. It's a great place for some quick, tasty (but greasy) food. :)"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. Large portions. My sandwich needed something to make it better just not sure what. I'll have to go back and see what I can add. The place is clean but very small. They only take cash which I thought was ridiculous. They do have an ATM so you can get cash but then you have to pay all the ATM/bank fees. I would definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Really nice people, huge sandwiches, crispy fries. Gave it three stars because it was OK. Ordered a cheese steak and it had so much mayo on it, I couldn't finish it. The mayo masked the taste of the other delish ingredients. They have a huge selection so maybe I'll have better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Peppi's rocks! Why do I say that you ask? Let me explain..   I was walking down Smithfield during my Friday lunch, which is later than my lunch during the rest of the week & I'm realllllly hungry!  I head down to Peppi's after hearing so many people rave about it.   While walking into Peppi's I think I took a step back in time because every worker is literally jamming to \"Funky Town\" & I'm at a dive sandwich shop. All of the workers were extremely friendly & happy (what's your secret?! I need to know!)   The cheese steak was delish & I'm pretty excited that I can get grilled onions without an awkward up charge. A cheese steak, fresh cut fries & a drink comes to around $8-9.. extremely reasonable. I ended up only eating half of the hoagie & enjoyed the rest later in the day.   The staff were chatting & joking with me again as I was leaving. I must say for a lunch by myself I laughed a great deal during that hour. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am not a native Pittsburgher, and I HATE Primanti's. Yeah, I said it. When someone suggested Peppi's, I was less than excited. Afterall, Primanti's gets rave reviews and I just don't get it. Ah, but soooooo hungry. Ok...I'll try it.   AMAZING. The place isn't dirty. It isn't greasy. It's a sandwich shop people, I really don't know what you expect here that makes you dish out such harsh reviews. You're paying $8 for a meal, it's not going to be 5 star decor. That being said, it was clean, it was moderately busy but not very loud (no more than any other place), and the staff was cool. I tip. If you can't afford to tip don't eat out. And don't complain when they aren't as cool if you don't. I work for tips, but unfortunately I work for corporate America where I have to smile at you even if you are a cheap ass- BUT- don't expect me to go the extra mile. But I digress...on to the food.  It's good! Actually, it's better than good. It's sliced ribeye steak cooked fresh on a flat top grill with fresh cheese and veggies and what just may be the best bread I have ever had. It's got this nice crust, but it isn't \"cut the roof of your mouth hard\" like some places...ahem...Primanti's...and the portions are very generous. The boyfriend and I used to save half so we had a \"now sandwich\" and a \"later sandwich,\" but lately it's been all \"now sandwich.\" When we do carryout, they wrap it up for us just like if it were a take out order. Small deal to you maybe, but that's that extra mile I was talking about. I said, \"I'll just wrap it up myself man, no worries,\" and the guy behind the counter insisted on wrapping it up for me \"no problem.\"   The menu is vast for such a small shop. There are a lot of options, steak, chicken, even vegetarian. There are breakfast selections, spicy, mild, you name it. They have some pretty good fries too. They have a cooler with bottle drinks or fountain drinks and they have some good specials for lunch. Another small detail, they have a good variety in the drink cooler. Dr. Pepper, root beer, ginger ale, juices, water, and the usual soda suspects. I'm a creature of habit so I always get the same thing, and it always tastes exactly the same. That's another plus in my book, consistency. There is nothing worse than getting your favorite whatever at your favorite where-ever and it not being as good as the last time. That doesn't happen here. It's as good as the first time, every time."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak salad. The price was about $8. It was definitely not high-quality steak, but the taste was good for the price. The employees were also nice. They are cash-only."}
{"text":"Blazing saddle is my favorite and the Cajun fries are delicious. They are cash only but they have an ATM inside. There's paid parking on the street. Lunchtime can be busy so I would suggest ordering ahead of time."}
{"text":"Don't yinz native Picksburghers hate me nah, but I have to admit that I didn't find Peppi's that impressive.  I'm from DE, where we have Capriotti's (can you say fresh turkey and all the fixins on a bun?!?) and are near Philly (a sub mecca), so I have high standards for subs.  Also, I pride myself on being an exacting--yet fair--reviewer.  In light of these facts, I'm afraid that Peppi's failed to deliver the sub nirvana I was hoping for.  I visited on Sat. for lunch with a friend while cycling.  Our original plan was to hit up the food trucks at South Side Works, but she was tired due to some grueling rowing practices the previous couple days, so the North Shore is as far as we made it.  She suggested Peppi's, and I agreed, given that I'd heard good things and that I hadn't been yet.  Since I don't eat beef, I was limited to two options: the amazing Sigfried or the turkey supreme.  Both were very similar, consisting of their respective meats plus grilled mushrooms and onions and LT.  I opted for the turkey, probably because I'm so used to the turkey awesomeness on a bun that Capriotti's delivers.  My friend ordered the roast beef, and both of us had drinks.  Although my friend told me the fries were good, we decided to forego them because we thought it'd be too much.  When I bit into my sub, I was underwhelmed by the amount and quality of meat, which was a thin layer of deli-style turkey slices.  To me, the sub seemed to be more then 50% veggies, most of which was lettuce.  I also found the bun too light for my taste, since I'm used to thick, bready buns.  While the taste was decent, it didn't blow me away, and texture-wise, it wasn't super-interesting, given its composition.  While you get a lot of sub for your money and it's better than Subway, if Peppi's is the best PGH has to offer sub-wise, they have a ways to go.  At least Primanti's has a unique product!  I know yinz'll hate me for saying this, but perhaps you should go to Philly--or even DE--for some sub-inspiration, n'at."}
{"text":"I recently started working in \"Dahn Tahn\" Pittsburgh and have started venturing out at lunch.  This week some guys took me to Peppi's and I was certainly not disappointed.  The place is totally a dive and has tasty dive food.  I had the cheesesteak and really enjoyed it.  I'll certainly be back again.  Unfortunately when I compare this place to the Oakland Uncle Sam's cheesesteak.... well there really is no comparison.  So Peppi's you will certainly do when I am down town... take your three stars and wear it proudly."}
{"text":"Lived near here for years and never stopped in. Having it for the first time tonight and it's delicious. I got the cheese steak with extra cheese only. Same for my daughter. My boyfriend got the #7/Roethlisberger, which he's had before, and it didn't disappoint yet again. We also got the Cajun fries; SO GOOD. This place looks like your good ol' old-school silver diner, and it is, but it's hoagies, sandwiches and salads. I'm so mad at myself for not trying this before. It's cheaper, but no less delicious, than my local pizza shop and it's no further of a drive. Give em a try!!"}
{"text":"These are some of the best subs around. My other choice would be Uncle Sam's, though these two businesses have different locations in the city so the competition isn't as direct. I thought that the Roethlis\"burger\" was worth 5 stars in its own right, just because it's so interesting. The egg adds a lot of flavor and the meat is very tender. The \"ultra\" cheese steak is more standard, and that's pretty comparable with other places like Uncle Sam's. No free fries here, but the subs are so big that we didn't need them at all."}
{"text":"I've tried 4 of their sandwiches and have never had a bad one. So far, my favorites are the Pittsburgh cheese steak (forget the exact name?)  and the New Yorker. Having no loyalty to Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, I think the cheese steaks here are better at Peppi's. *insert gasps*"}
{"text":"First time experiencing Peppi's and it did not disappoint.  I love the whole feel and set up of  this place.  After ordering our sandwiches at the counter, we took a seat in the dining room and I immediately became caught up with looking at all of the people photos lining the walls and with reading some of the various business cards patrons have placed under the wooden strips along an area inside the dining area. Perhaps I will decide to give Good Fellas Remodeling a call...or maybe not!  The Phantom Steak hoagie was very enjoyable and filling.  I am looking forward to another go at Peppi's!"}
{"text":"Best hot sandwiches in the North Side! Staff is super friendly and it's never a long wait. Glad we found this place in the first month we moved here!"}
{"text":"I am driving from Virginia to Seattle with my two dogs and a trailer of my things. Needless to say, I'm exhausted and it's only the beginning. I told my friend I was excited to be coming up on Pittsburgh, somewhere I've never been before. I asked her what I should eat! She then recommended this place.  My first experience with them was awesome. My friend had already talked to them so they were expecting me (and knew about my long journey). Super friendly on the phone, ordered a cheesesteak. When I arrived, they had put up a welcome note (which I didn't see at first and passed like a million times! Hah) which totally made my entire week. They were so nice even with me being in my frazzled state! The people who work here... SERIOUSLY AWESOME.  And now the food... So bomb! I scarfed it down so hard. I WISH I lived here so I could continue to eat at this awesome place... But since I can't, you can eat here for me! Totally recommend this place to anyone who wants good food and awesome people."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and glad I stopped in for dinner. Great sandwiches and home cut fries. Very busy place and I have tasted why."}
{"text":"I took way too long to try Peppi's! I went with the regular Italian and asked for it hot. The bread, as most have noted, was delicious! Good quality meats, provolone, lettuce/tomato/onion and Italian dressing were perfectly embedded in the soft, incredibly fresh hoagie roll. I was afraid this was going to be another Primanti's, but it's not! I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Roethlisberger w/ bacon and pepper relish."}
{"text":"Walking along the strip unsure about what was going to be eaten for lunch. Delucas vs. Primanti Bros vs. Peppi's. Peppi's won probably because it was so simple.   Food: I got the Steak/Sausage sub with no cheese. It is called the Big Wheeler. The bread was nice and soft but it held the meat within (Pause). I was just eating that sandwich shaking my head because it was so damn good. I think next time I will just get a sausage sub because I think the sausage was the MVP of the sandwich.  Workers: They seemed like down to earth folks. We thanked them for making such good food and they seemed appreciative. No issues here.   Atmosphere: Small little spot. Nothing jumps out here but that shouldn't matter. The food is on point.   If you are around The Strip, please go."}
{"text":"Eating healthy all week! I had to cave in and stop at Peppi's. I have never tried the famous sandwiches and after spending the day cleaning and working out I deserved it.   I called for take out on my way home. I pass this place all the time. It has that old diner feel but felt like I would most surely be consuming pure grease. Today was the day! I picked up The Big Wheeler and a small FF.  The sub was warm and wrapped up tight. I sampled the fries first and they were limp and tasted like they had been made in older grease. The sub came with lettuce, tomato, mayo, a Philly steak, and sausage famous mix finely chopped then smothered in provalone. The bread was very light, and soft. The kind of bread that has that slight crackle when you bite into it. The meat mix was pleasantly seasoned with a little kick. Tender well seasoned meat with the crisp mouthful of lettuce and tomato while the cheese ran over. Mmmm. It was surprisingly good and I think J would love it! Maybe next time J will try the famous Rothlisberger, he likes egg on his sandwich."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, however, it is pretty greasy. Also, the diner isn't exactly cleanly. I noticed massive amounts of grease on the walls around the grill area....gross!"}
{"text":"The best place to grab a sandwich in Pittsburgh. A varied amount of sandwiches to try. Some unique, some normal, but all of them excellent. The bread is perfect, and compliments what is in the sandwich. Fry lovers will enjoy the crunchy fries in regular, or Cajun style. 10% off student discount as well. A must along with Primanti's if you are visiting the steel city as a sandwich lover"}
{"text":"Messy deliciousness!  That's the only way I can describe this place.  I had the cappicola sandwich and it was really good.  It was also MASSIVE so needless to say I could only finish half of it.    Also tried the fries and they were hot and fresh - just the way I like 'em!  So glad I tried this place and looking forward to coming back again to try some of their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Pittsburgh to get a sandwich. The cheese steak with mushroom is my go to. I always get some of the fresh cut fries as well"}
{"text":"Peppi's is great! You can call in and order before you get there. Granted it's not the most healthy but it's amazing. I love their turkey and the cheese fries."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday afternoon with my father for lunch.  I had been to Peppi's before but it was many years previous and at their North Side location.  This location has a counter where you order off to the left as soon as you walk in.  The rest of the restaurant is composed of a number of different tables and booths, lots of wood and earthy colors and has some decorations consisting of Pittsburgh sports and Peppi's regulars.  Both my father and I decided to get a regular Italian hoagie on this day and they were brought to our table within 10 minutes of us ordering.  The sandwich itself looked pretty good and consisted of genoa salami, rosa salami, capacola and provolone cheese all on a nice bun that was just short of a foot.  I also decided to go with the lettuce, onion and dressing that was offered to me but said no to the tomato. Overall I thought that the taste of my sub was pretty good although I wouldn't have guessed that there was two kinds of salami and some capicola in it.  The bread may have been my favorite part of the sandwich as it seemed to be rather fresh.  I could also see some people complaining about the bread to filling ratio here as there seemed to be a lot more bread than filling but personally I was ok with it.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  The price was right and my sub was decent so why wouldn't I?"}
{"text":"Cheese steaks with a little taste of Pittsburgh,  This is a very good downscale sandwich shop. the place is dirty and hot and not much for ambience.   I have been to the Northside, Smithfieild and the Point Breeze/Penn Ave in the old dinner.  Sandwiches are consistantly good.  Enjoy and try some of the specialty subs- Joey Portabella is a good one."}
{"text":"I always used to cut class and head over there for one of their delicious sandwiches. Always has been one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a kid and I've always been a fan. Anyone visiting Pittsburgh should get one of these hoagies (the New Yorker is to die for! Best in town!) because it's definitely one of the best places to get one around here. The fries are absolutely delicious & they give you pretty decently sized portions. It's a cash only place, which is one thing that heavily annoys me about the place. There's no reason in this day & age to only use cash, it's stupid. The staff is always awesome & I've never had an issue where I've had to complain about anything! It's just a good place to get some great food. Im not sure why people (usually not from here) say Primantis is the food you need to get in Pittsburgh because I never liked it. Any Pittsburgh native knows that Peppis is the place you go for some authentic Pittsburgh cuisine! I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"A family favorite for years. I get a plain steak with tomato, lettuce, and mayo. And of course fries - gotta put the Malt on top too.  It's very much a dive, but that's what makes it great. The history, the people. WHen it's busy be patient, it's well worth it.   Cash only."}
{"text":"The rothelesberger sandwich is a must. Hoagie roll with Parma sausage, cooked egg, and the rest. Really good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Each time I'm hanging out in the Strip District with one of my brothers and I ask about going to eat somewhere, immediately they suggest burgers. Peppi's has been the go-to for several reasons and we never leave disappointed.  As you walk in, there is a long counter that the chefs are behind. Then, walk down to the register and place your order. The chefs and workers have all been exceptionally kind, especially D. Each time I have visited Peppi's, D has made my visit and my guests visits both happy and memorable.   On top of the great service, the food is also delicious. My obsession with Italian hoagies can be temporarily satisfied with joy here. They serve the burgers on footlong sub rolls and my brothers think it's the coolest thing. If you are a vegetarian, they have options for you, too! Their cheese fries are amazing. Also, prices are pretty fair here. You can get away with a good meal for around $10, which is to be expected if you're getting a large sandwich and a pile of fries bigger than the Great Pyramid of Giza.  When you're done eating, you'll be heckled a little for not finishing your food, but a worker will wrap it up for you with a smile. Without a doubt we'll be visiting Peppi's again soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome Roethlisburger.  Lives up to the hype. May have to get another one before I leave town."}
{"text":"Wanted to go out to breakfast in the Strip but the lines at each diner were just too long. Worked out well because we enjoyed Peppi's for the first time at about 11:30 AM. Solid crowd at the tables but not packed and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  Straightforward menu, order at the counter where you get a great shot of the guys on the grill.  Take a ticket to your table and the runner brings your food out and calls your number. I got the New Yorker (steak, provolone, american, onions, bacon) and did not add lettuce, tomato or mayo and it was amazing. Perfectly melted and delicious. My friend got the tuna melt with LTM and had no complaints. $20 for both of us including drinks and a $2 tip.  Great local place, will be back again for lunch in the Strip."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Average subs. Avoid at all costs. There are a ton of better places on he strip."}
{"text":"Second time here. Came in for the #7 \"Roethlisburger\" and it didn't disappoint. My kids loved the environment and reading the stuff in the walls. My son recommended a sandwich and they said they might make it and name it after him. While we don't expect it, what a cool thing to do. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious subs! I always get the \"Santucci\" with the spicy toppings! Worth the trip! I've been coming to this restaurant since i started going to college at c.c.a.c."}
{"text":"Words just can't describe Peppi's.... just great food all around."}
{"text":"Everyone was incredibly rude that worked here. I asked for cheese wiz on the sub (I'm originally from the Philly area) so That's how I prefer it. They refused to do it but said they can give me a cup of it on the side. Took forever and was not very good. If your looking to get a good cheesesteak this is definitely NOT your place. Then at the end told me their cheesesteaks are better then any place in Philadelphia. Regardless of it being true or not just super ignorant. And it's not try which makes it even funnier!"}
{"text":"Was brought here by a local and overall it was good! Typically dive place - ordered The Cathedral and the Rothlisburger. Other then The Cathedral having too much salt on it, it was delicious! I asked them to fry the egg hard on The Rothlisburger because I don't like runny eggs and they were able to accommodate it. It did take a while for us to get our food - there seemed to be some confusion behind the grill."}
{"text":"I got a sub from Bella Notte just down the street from Peppi's and I will never do that again! Bella Notte puts about one slice of each kind of meat and a bare minimum of toppings on a lot of bread, while Peppi's absolutely stuffs their subs with meat and toppings. The best is the Franco, which is an Italian sub. It really hits the spot and is plenty big enough for two hungry adults to share. Bella Notte is for pizza. Peppi's is for subs."}
{"text":"Got the Joey Porter -bella? here a few weeks ago. It was alright, nothing special. It barely had any filling on it which annoyed me. Probably won't come back, there's plenty of other good sandwich shops around."}
{"text":"SETTING: Seems like a lot of Pittsburgh sub/sandwich/hoagie places have a similar ambiance. Peppi's is no different, but it separates itself from the rest with its SUB-stantial flavors. Wooden benches/booths and walls adorned with photos of interesting characters. Laid back place to grab a quick bite.  FOOD: First time here, so I decided to go with their most famous sub: \"The 7\". The description wasn't kidding when they called this sub a juggernaut. Loaded with ground sausage, egg, american cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and mayo, the \"7\"--aka the \"Roethliburger\"--delivered the perfect pass. A tight spiral down the chute and into my stomach. Touchdown, baby! It's THAT good, not to mention filling. Ain't nobody got time for SUB-par hoagie pokey.  The fresh cut fries are pretty solid too. Don't be fooled, the small size is plenty big. If you're here with another person, I would recommend sharing one sub and small fries. Yes, the fries are a bit greasy, but let's be honest...you're not here because you care about eating something \"delicious and nutritious,\" you're here because you want to devour a monstrous sandwich and have fries with that!   SERVICE: Order up front and you get a number that you put on your table. Seat yourself. In 10 minutes or so, your sub will be brought to you, and it will SUB-consciously change your life. Friendly staff all around.   IMPRESSION: I'd definitely come back again to try their other subs. Gotta be in the right mindset though. This is for sure a heavy duty lunch. As of now, my sub/hoagie ranking is as follows:  1. Peppi's 2. Uncle Sam's 3. Primanti Brothers   How many more SUB-liminal messages and hints do you need? Go get yourself a sub at Peppi's!"}
{"text":"I've been there several times, and I have yet to be disappointed.  Prices are very reasonable, and the food is excellent.  Service is prompt and the banter between the employees is an entertaining bonus."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a sandwich if you're in the strip district for the day. This place is a classic just like Primanti Brothers.   Fast quick and easy the workers are welcoming and kind.   I stoped in on a Sunday to get a sandwich with my girlfriend. We both got the Italian and it was great. The Italian dressing is made with balsamic vinegar which makes it a little different and unique. The bread is soft and fresh. I added mayonnaise to my sandwich and it gave it a great little addition of creamy to pair with the acid of the vinegar.   I personally prefer the original location in North Side. Although the strip district location accepts credit cards!  If you've not tried Peppi's sandwiches you've not had a true Pittsburgh experience. Their menu has something for everyone and you will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"New Blazing Saddle.... what a treat.   Lettuce, tomato, mayo? Grilled onions? I can hear the cook behind the counter saying it the same way he does every time I order.   Best subs in the city."}
{"text":"Quintessential Pittsburgh. A hit for our party of 5. I'm gonna say it- I liked it better than Primanti's.  Hearty, creative sandwiches made with love and likely to keep you full all day. Dedicated following of regulars. Seats are old church pews! Some seriously good French fries. Service with a smile - and speedy. The decor, photos of local celebrities and business cards of patrons, tells the story of this local institution.   What would have made it better: simple kids menu/pricing."}
{"text":"Mushroom cheesesteak with a Stewart's root beer for lunch today. Freshly made, toasted bun, all good! Friendly service."}
{"text":"Good quality, great value, in a comfortable laid-back environment. A must for lunch!  Tell Gisele I sent you in for the walk-in special."}
{"text":"Did you hear that?  Oh, yes....the cheesesteaks are calling my name.  Good solid Pittsburgh institution that's friendly and efficient and GOOD!  What more could you ask on a quick run to the Strip on your lunch hour?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while in the Strip District with my family. Had the #7 which was enormous. Ate half for lunch and half for dinner. Sandwich was delicious but I don't want to think about the calories. Service was good. Not a fancy place. Great stop if you're hungry and looking for a big sandwich for short money."}
{"text":"I absolutely love peppis. Where do I start?    The food is consistently good quality, with the right price. I regularly eat the bacon burger with cheese sub. Its probably my favorite sandwich there. The fries come in a nice big portion, perfect to share with someone. It's the same quality every time you go there. I love to eat on their back patio when the weather is nice. The interior has a nice mom and pops feel. Steelers decor everywhere, it's a true Pittsburgh establishmet. The amount of seating is ample enough for the amount of business they do. The employees are polite the orders come out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and we wanted to see if we could find a good Philly cheesesteak here. I think we've succeeded.  Yummy, soft hoagie, tons of meat, and onions caramelized to perfection. It wasn't the best I've had, but huge portions, cheap price, and the old rusty ambiance of the place made up for it.   Their fries were very good as well, plenty of crisp and flavor. They could use a bit more salt though, I almost never salt anything at the restaurant and these guys needed a little bit of love."}
{"text":"I haven't lived in the Northside of Pittsburgh for 19 years, so when I'm downtown and hungry...Peppi's always comes to mind and never a bad decision! From the guys that work behind the counter, the atmosphere, and the best cheesesteak around-I love it. If you haven't treated yourself to a good \"cheat day\" for a while, I recommend!"}
{"text":"Their cheesesteaks are the best. Tons of meat and toppings on a fresh roll. And there is literally a cheesesteak for everyone...so many options to choose from you won't go home hungry. Staff is always friendly and fast, too."}
{"text":"#7 is an absolute must try when visiting Pittsburgh!! The spicy sausage gives it an extra kick that makes you wanting more. Great bread, great flavor, and great ambience.  Very low key place that let's you enjoy your sub.  Highly recommend!!!  If we ever come back to Pittsburgh, we are definitely coming to Peppi's."}
{"text":"The #7 is HUGE!! And delicious. Service was good although a bit slow for not being crowded but then again this isnt a 5 minute sammich"}
{"text":"One of my most favorite places in philly over a sandwich!!! I love the New Yorker, it's def a favorite! Take that thing home and put some A1 sauce on it, forget about it.... Lol. Really great place though"}
{"text":"Great steak sandwich! They are kind of in a bad place due to road construction, go see them for take out great lunch!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in Pennsylvania and I suppose I was looking for more since Philly is so well known for cheese steaks and Pittsburgh is in the same state. I guess this wasn't the place but I was really satisfied with the service.  Got here around 3pm after lunch and the wait was about 10 minutes. The chef and server were very friendly.  The onion rings are huge and the fries are a mix soggy and crispy.  The hoagie was fresh and the cheese and steak both good. I've had better in California which is why I did not give it a 5 star ranking.  I might have to try Primanti Brothers.  I find it funny they have a #7 Ben Rothlesberger. The Steeler colors and jerseys are everywhere here."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh last weekend, this is the first place I had to try. Mainly because of The 7 aka \"The Roethlisburger\". I may not live in Pittsburgh or anywhere near it, but being a Steelers fan, Pittsburgh is definitely a part of me.   Walking in this place, you're greeted by at least 4-5 employees while you check out the big board/menu. When you're ready to order, you order, take a seat, and they bring out your food not long after. I ordered The Roethlisburger along with an order of Onion Rings. The sandwich came with american cheese, sausage/burger, and egg as the primary ingredients. I told them to put everything on it so it came with tomatoes, lettuce, and I believe a few other things.   I wish we had sandwiches like this in Louisville. From the bread all the way down to the smallest ingredient... the sandwich radiated freshness. The onion rings were fresh as well. Definitely the type of onion rings that have started disappearing over the years... the kind you bite into and with the bite you sometimes pull the onion out with your bite.  I could easily make this place a regular stop if I lived in the area. My only complaint & I won't take off a star is they only take cash. Luckily they have an ATM inside, but keep in mind that it's cash only. I understand why businesses do this, but if I was going to open a business... I'd take card, cash, bitcoin, whatever payment that someone wanted to give me.   Since I don't live in the area, I can't become a regular, but I will make it a point to visit everytime I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"There are no words adequate enough to describe how much I love Peppi's. The South Philly is my favorite. The bread is so fresh, the guys behind the counter are so so so nice, be sure you tip them! They deserve it!"}
{"text":"The subs were wonderful, full of flavor and just fantastic.  Don't let this little \"dive\" fool you.  Go in!  The food is great!"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are amazing. They fill you up, they're delicious, and it's chill place to go and eat. A must try."}
{"text":"I know there is that other sandwich shoppe peppered all over town which also starts with a P  *cough splutta cough* But Peppi's never lets me down. It's around the corner from my office and its not a chain so yea I hit it up for lunch with the partners in crime once in a while.   the Philly cheese-steak never lets me down, fries portions are huge and you can pretty much split one sandwich and one large Fries with two drinks between two people for around 14$ not bad on the wallet not bad at all.   Plus they have a poster of John Lee Hooker on the wall, plus other celebrity pics who have eaten there over the years.   Service is zippy but it is a cash only joint.... again there is ATM from 1986 sitting in the corner. It looks like it won't work then takes a confusing 30 seconds to spit your money out but it does work. If Peppi's took credit cards I would give them 5 stars.  Probably not a great spot for vegetarians. I don't know of many veg options on the menu. Definitely a Pittsburgh Classic lunch spot, and their sandwich did not give me tummyaches like that other P sandwich shop's sandwich did."}
{"text":"It's ok not great, they could really benefit from a refresh, it felt and looked dirty..."}
{"text":"Locals in-the-know say it's better than Primanti's. But for a visitor, it's just a good sandwich and great fries, not unique by taste to anywhere in particular - except perhaps the Roethlisberger."}
{"text":"Great casual place to pick up an amazing sandwich. Don't make the same mistake my wife made and order a salad!"}
{"text":"For years I had longed to take on the RoethlisBurger, but Peppi's hours aren't the most convenient for me. That is until a Saturday evening at Altar Bar with Icarus Witch and Kamelot caused Kay and I to track down dinner in the Strip District.   And there it was, Peppi's. And they were...open?  \"Yeah, 'til 8PM,\" a guy behind the counter said.   \"But the sign says...\"  \"Oh, ignore that. What'll it be, man?\"   Kay was frightened of the RoethlisBurger, so when I ordered it, she ran to The Clown across the street.   After the fellow took my order, I was given a ticket, and was told to sit down and relax. As I waited, I took in the surroundings, gazing at the sports memorabilia and photos of patrons both ordinary and famous.   Just as hunger pangs assailed my belly, there it was, enveloped in a paper plate in front of me: A homonculous of loose meat a la Maid-Rite gone malevolent. Ground beef, hot sausage, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, scrambled eggs, and 'Merican cheese were all packed into a bread that was as flaxen as a Valkyrie and as airy as the morning mist. Upon doing some research I've found that it is called a Portuguese Roll, and it is pulchritudinous.   This behemoth of a breakfast sandwich dazzled my tongue with its spice, filled my stomach amply with its bulky, chunky  proteins, and soothed me with its fresh, fundamental vegetables, all of it held together with that amazing roll of rolls that threatens to make Italian bread passe via its sublime texture alone.   'Tis the greatest sloppy joe to ever emerge from a steaming flattop.   P.S. I found nothing \"shabby\" or \"greasy\" or \"dirty\" or \"loud\" about Peppi's. The service was friendly, the restaurant itself was clean, the atmosphere was quiet, and the sandwich was triumphant. If Primanti Brothers has a true parallel, it is Peppi's."}
{"text":"Ben Rothelisberger is known for many things. Some good. Some very bad. But I think the top thing has to be this sandwich named after him. Definitely much bigger than the whole Super Bowl thing.   The place is located in the north side on a nice block not too far from Heinz Field. The staff was chill and easy going. The sandwiches are delicious. I would have to say it's much better than the sandwich chain, which I refuse to name, that most people traveling to Pittsburgh head to.   This is where you need to go if you want a great sandwich, which may take a year or two off your life. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"First time to Peppi's.  Hard to believe after all these years that I have never been to a Peppi's.  Read the menu on the counter because the chalkboard is confusing; even the staff said so!   You order at the counter and they delivered to your table.  It did take a little longer than we expected but not to long.  Enjoyed looking at all the photos while we were waiting.   Ordered the Franco, an Italian with a little extra salami.  Probably did not need the extra but the sub was very tasty and to large to finish, so I have lunch for today too.  While not the best Italian sub/hoagie that I have had, it was very good and better than most sub shops that have popped up everywhere. The staff was super friendly and thought busy did stop by our table.  If you are in the area and looking for a pretty good sub or sandwich, Peppi's is a good stop."}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich place! They use the softest Mancini's rolls and grill up your order fresh. I always get the pepper steak. The staff is friendly. Make sure to get there early because this place gets busy quick!"}
{"text":"wife brought back sandwiches from Peppi's. I had a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato. I was expecting a regular size hamburger on a bun but instead got this huge hero. The hamburger hero was good but not the best ever. The fries were a bit greasy and not that good. I would order from there again but I would try something else i here they specialize in steak. I give it 3 stars for now if I try it again I will do an update. I can not judge service or anything to do with location as I said i did not pick up food."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! Delicious hoagies, awesome Cajun fries (you must try these), and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, as a middle-aged Pittsburgh native, this was my first time to Peppi's. I had the steak and cheese sub with fries. My sub was piping hot and perfectly dressed; and, my fries were fresh and not greasy at all. I will say that even with a slow lunch hour, service was pretty slow. But, overall, the food was good and the price was reasonable for lunch. The experience, much like the interior of the restaurant itself, was exactly what you would expect from a small diner vibe."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I ever have had. Always heard raving reviews about this place before going to Pittsburgh and had high expectations but when I took a bite of the #7, the Heath, and the Porter, all expansions were blown away. These sandwiches are something I wish I could live off of. Service is great and even after ordering 6 sandwiches with my dad and uncle, they were able to prepare them quickly and within a few minutes. If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh PA, it ain't a real trip there until you stop by Peppi's"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were delicious. We had the #7 and the cheesesteak. The sandwich is generous size and so yummy."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! Not only is the service amazing, the food is fabulous. Visiting from SoCal, it's a treat to eat someplace the locals rave about. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This cruddy diner is definitely a dive.  Nothing wrong with that, but for the prices they're charging they could clean it up a bit - maybe wash the floors occasionally?  The sausage they use on their subs is divine. I'd get any sub with that sausage. Hell, I'd eat that sausage off the dirty floors."}
{"text":"The food is just as great as the Penn Avenue location, but it gets an extra star for being CLEAN.  This time I tried a sausage sandwich.  Not as good as the Rothlesburger.  The fries are awesome."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and it was good! I got a cheese steak with fries and drink. It's was pretty standard fries were kind of bland. I liked the cheesesteak tho! May be returning!"}
{"text":"OMG... drove through Pittsburgh recently and decided to have lunch at Peppi's and was glad we did! This place has some awesome sandwiches!! I myself ordered the New Yorkers which had steak, cheese, bacon, grilled onions, and lettuce. It seemed basic but the taste of the sandwich was phenomenal. The portion was huge and I also ordered the fries which were fresh and even though they were a little greasy they were great with the sandwich. All of my other friends ordered different sandwiches and everyone devoured their food. There was a moment of silence when we were all eating/enjoying our food so there was minimal talk at our table (lol)   I am seriously considering another roadtrip to New York next year so I can drive through Pittsburgh and stop there for another sandwich!! Def recommend this sandwich icon if you are ever in Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Got the Whiz with extra fried sweet peppers.  Son got a plain steak. Both were great. Best cheese fries. Fresh cut crispy and Cheesy.  The guys behind the counter are always very nice."}
{"text":"Really tasty sandwich and a good amount of fries. I had a great time and got food quickly."}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong here, unless you're looking for a healthy sub.  Peppi's is a chain in the Pittsburgh area, home to a bunch of the usual Pittsburgh fare.  Fries are great, as they're the fresh-cut style, and the subs are huge, so go hungry.  I've eaten here a few times and can't say I've ever had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches, especially at this location! I always enjoy the mushroom cheesesteak and their French fries! A great, laid-back atmosphere as well! Definitely one of my favorite stops when I'm home in the burgh!"}
{"text":"My kids make this a must stop when we're visiting Pittsburgh. The staff are friendly and the food was great and greasy! We ordered the \"Big Nate\", \"The 7\" and \"Pitisburgher.\" We will definitely stop by again when in town. Unfortunately, I had to take 1 star away for the cleanliness of the tables and floor."}
{"text":"By far my favorite location. I always order the cheesesteak and while it's not Philly it's still pretty damn good. Love the back courtyard for eating sandwich ok a nice day. Service is fast, accurate and friendly. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Such a fun place and the food is pretty good. I didn't realize Peppi's was a chain and just happened to stumble upon it on one of those lists on thrillist. The item that was featured in that list was the santucci sub. It's a hot mess Italian sandwich with double meat, double cheese, grilled peppers, mushrooms, and the like. HUGE. I got one and turned it into three meals. They also sell coke products..and that includes barq's red cream soda, which I hardly ever see like, anywhere.   Anyway, the sandwich was a ton of food, as mentioned and all quite tasty. If you eat a lot of sub sandwiches, you may find this place pretty average. I don't actually think that the components stood out for any particular reason but the sandwich as a whole was really good - also I don't eat that many sub sandwiches so I don't have much frame of reference to compare to.  In addition, the staff is so fun! As I was debating ordering a drink to go with my sandwich, we had an argument about coke v pepsi (to which the answer is pepsi, duh) and the guys were joking around the whole time that my friends and I were waiting for our food.   This particular location had a small seating area behind the ordering / prep station but we took our food to go. I'm not sure if all locations have seating area..I didn't actually realize this place was a chain until quite recently.   I don't know about parking in this area. Probably not great since it's downtown. If that deters you, try another location. There are several around and those probably have better parking options."}
{"text":"Sept. 1st 1939 Germany invaded Poland. In as little as 23 days the country was defeated. I once wondered how that happened then I figured it out. Poland had probably left the country itself to go to Peppi's due to it's delicious tasting Subs.  You figure with waiting at the airport in line at security, delays in a flight schedule and actual flight time itself... the numbers start to add up. One might make the argument that 23 days is still too long of a time for one to take to fly from Poland to Peppi's and back, well I beg to differ due to the downtime one would have after eating there.  Little known fact, while Germany may have gone to war with Poland, you can be sure that a Peppi's sub will go to war with your stomach making you feel well...defeated.   They will throw just about anything on one of those subs which taste amazing but tends not to agree with you as much as you may like. It's a cash only joint much like every place in 1939.   If there is a sporting event taking place, make sure to check out this place, it will in fact rock your very socks off despite any hesitations you may have"}
{"text":"I normally love this place and go to the Western Ave normally. I happened to stop in this location on Saturday night at 730 and had the worst service. The man cooking was either too high or drunk to understand the order and didn't seem too happy about cooking yet another order. We waited an exceptionally long time for just two sandwiches and at this point were the only ones in the place. We finally get our orders and one of them were wrong and the other had so much mayo on it it was a sopping mess. I will never come back to this location again. Guys at Western Ave have their act together . This guy was the worst ."}
{"text":"Highly recommend stopping into this local jaunt. Diner style, friendly and great authentic atmosphere. Go with an open mind and enjoy all the 'character'. We ordered 2 of the hot subs - best we have had in awhile. Giant loafs of delicious flavor. If you're looking for something 'local' this is the spot.  Maybe pricey for subs but for the size and taste well worth it."}
{"text":"Pepper steak, everything you could expect from a good cheese steak, bursting with flavor. No disappointments in this place. Staff is friendly, and will serve you with a smile."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I was brought in by the claims of how large the \"RoethlisBurger\" is by vendors and other shoppers in the Strip District and I had to see it in person.    Peppi's has a dive-y sort of place but in a good way.  The flat top grill is behind the counter in the front and the back of Peppi's has a couple tables and booths with Steelers paraphernalia on the walls.  I wasn't too hungry so I ended up ordering \"The Phantom\", which was a cheese steak with grilled mushrooms, onions, and a fried egg.  My companions got a mushroom cheese steak and the famed #7, the \"RoethlisBurger\" itself.  All the sandwiches come with the basic fixin's of lettuce tomato, etc. and are a foot long.  The Phantom was a little smaller than I expected, but the flavors of the ingredients in the sandwich melded together wonderfully.  My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more meat.  After some searching online, apparently all their steak subs only have a quarter pound of steak.  For some reason based on the picture of the RoethlisBurger in the window outside we thought it was going to be a lot bigger.  I guess camera angles can be deceiving.  It's a mix of chopped burger and sausage with American cheese and a fried egg.  Overall I would have liked it a bit more if the sandwiches were served a bit faster (some people who ordered after us got their food first) and a bit more meat.  Anyways, I'm definitely going to be back to try the RoethlisBurger since now I view it as a potentially tasty sandwich as opposed to just a ridiculously impossible food challenge."}
{"text":"I've tried several sandwiches and fries and never left disappointed. The different combinations you get on a sandwich makes this place certainly uncommon and interesting. I had the hamburger, sausage and egg burger and it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch while walking around and it was amazing!!! I'm from out of town and the woman at the counter was super nice. She helped us choose what was a great item to try on the menu. If I come back to Pittsburgh I will definitely come here!!!!"}
{"text":"PERFECTLY NOT FANCY...great fries and sandwiches. GREAT Music playing (throwback ). Fun place to eat with our teens."}
