{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Food is so flavorful and portions are great! The price is fair for the outstanding quality you get! My favorite is stuffed scrod and red clam pasta!!"}
{"text":"I'm not joking when I say I think everything my husband and I ate tonight was the best we've ever had. Best pasta with in house made sauces, best pizza, best wedding soup, best bread and dipping oil with sun dried tomato and basil. Who knew this gem would be hidden away in a small strip mall? It's amazing, do not pass this place up."}
{"text":"We stopped by last Saturday night for dinner.  While the two of us got the last booth in the bar area, others were waiting 40 minutes for a table for four.  The bar was very noisy and crowded with patrons who appeared in their late 50's and early 60's.. Our server had trouble getting through the crowd to take our orders and deliver our food. My wife ordered the ham and lima bean soup (very good), I had a house salad (great -- the greens were very, very fresh and the dressing homemade). We ordered sandwiches (pretty good) and split a toasted almond cake for dessert (good).  Don't expect anything on the culinary cutting edge - this is a Pittsburgh red-sauce Italian place, and they do it pretty good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the South Hills!    The food was great and the portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice, small Italian restaurant in the Lebanon Shops strip mall on Mt. Lebanon Blvd. I'm glad I stopped by for dinner.   I was dining solo and was glad to see that they had a real nice lounge in the restaurant with  comfortable seats around the bar and also some tables in the lounge area. The lounge is in a separate room at the front of the restaurant. The dining room is on the side and back.   I had one of the daily specials, Chicken Florentina, which was very tasty with a creamy sauce and melted Asiago cheese and tomatoes. You have a choice of pasta, potato or vegetable as a side and I got green beans almondine, which was excellent with a garlic taste and some slivered almonds. You also get soup or salad with the dinner and I had their excellent wedding soup. Servings were large, as noted in other reviews, so I think at $17.95 the dinner was well worth it.   They had a nice house Cabernet that I ordered and the price was reasonable, just $5 for a glass.   This was a very comfortable place to sit and eat in their lounge. There were a couple of screens that were tuned into the evening news when I was there in the late afternoon. The bartender was friendly. I'm glad I finally tried this place in my neighborhood and plan on coming back when I want a good meal."}
{"text":"This place never makes a bad meal. The chicken parm is beyond fantastic and plenty left over for the next day. The salads and service are to perfection as are the desserts. This is by far one of the best Italian restaurants in the South Hills."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times for both lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed.  The shrimp scampi is amazing, calzones are huge and delicious.  Love it here!"}
{"text":"This place was quiet, The service was prompt,waitress was nice,large food selection. So many chicken,Italian dishes. It was difficult to choose. I had the Chicken milanese. A chicken dish that had a wine and lemon sauce. My husband had a monster hoagie. Both meals were very tasteful. I definately will be back to try more Italian dishes."}
{"text":"So far, so good.  I've only been once.  I'll go again and post an update.  The food is decent.  I like the house salad (fresh, has more than just lettuce and a cherry tomato).  The table bread (slices of white, Italian bread) is fresh and soft and tasty, and the dipping sauce (balsamic and olive oil) is good.  My pasta dish was good but not amazing by any stretch.  The noodles were a touch overcooked, but not bad.  The marinara sauce, a staple of any good Italian restaurant, was a little disappointing.  It was too sweet for my taste.  I assume it's house-made, so maybe this varies by batch-of-tomatoes, so I'm willing to give it another try.  The service was good and met my expectation for a sit-down restaurant of this price point.  Overall, I had a good experience that matches Yelp's description of 3-stars.  Please give this place a try and post a review.  Yelp on!"}
{"text":"One star for Erin our waitress and one star for the food.  A party of 6 of us waited over 45 minutes last night.  We were told it would be 20 minutes....Ok--you never know... All we expected was courtesy and maybe an apology for the wait. Not sure why they couldn't push 2 empty tables together or offer us a glass of water while we wait (we were the only ones waiting) OR a \"Thanks for your patience\". Instead we had a waitress tell us she hopes she doesn't have to wait on us...seriously - how rude -- and what felt like we were being a pain in their ass for being there. I wont make this mistake again."}
{"text":"We had dinner here again last night hoping for a repeat of the great dinner we had a few weeks ago. The woman at the desk when we came in was sourly and acted as if seating us was a huge problem. The dining room was empty. Our waitress was really more interested in chatting with the other waitress and kitchen staff than paying attention to our order. We ended up taking the food to go and it was lousy. I'm very sad as this restaurant was looking to become a favorite and now I doubt we will go back.      We had dinner here on Saturday night...service was fantastic..our waitress was friendly and patient. We started with mussels in garlic wine sauce...delicious!! Then the wedding soup-yum! My boyfriend had the Delmonico with a Bernaise  sauce and he ate every bite and I had Angel hair with meat sauce and meatballs ( which we ate for 3 days the portion was HUGE!!!!) sauce and meatballs were great and when asked for extra sauce they did not skimp.we left with Tiramisu and a caramel torte and both were amazing. We will definitely be back and often. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian! The chicken Marsala came with choice of pasta/veggie/potato, soup/salad, and bread. I went with the pasta (penne w/marinara- very good!) and salad. Definitely get the dipping sauce for the bread! Lots of dessert options- we chose the cheesecake and had raspberry sauce added. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The best Italian in South Hills, maybe Pittsburgh.  We have been faithful customers of DeBlasios for years but they can't touch this place!  Chicken is sooo tender like they've been pouncing it all day! Food, service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for a long time and been to a lot of different places. This is the best Italian restaurant I have ever eaten at. Hands down. The cheese garlic bread is amazing. The pizza is outstanding. The sun dried tomato oil and bread alone is good enough to make a meal of. Do your self a favor and come here. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend who has a disability, the staff was so polite and accommodating to her! The bill wasn't too bad for the enormous portion size so I will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem on the edges of Mt. Lebanon and Castle Shannon, I think. The food was very good as well as the portions and the price was very reasonable. The staff was very friendly and the food came out quickly. The room where you are seated is alittle dark and not very large, so large party (I would say more than 10 would take up a good portion of the space). I definitely would definitely recommend swinging by here at least once."}
{"text":"I stopped in this restaurant while traveling through town, and was pleasantly surprised. While it is located in a strip mall, it is very quaint, pleasant and clean inside. The staff was extremenly nice and treated me like a king. The food was served promptly, and was hot, fresh, and VERY good. This is a perfect place to go for good food, and good service at a very fair price. Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant hands down. Every aspect of the menu is great. First of all, awesome sauce; like grandma used to make! The chicken and fish is top quality too. I really enjoy the whole menu. Although it I had to recommend one item of the menu I would suggest the chicken parm. It's the culmination of everything that's great about this place. Good atmosphere, and awesome staff. Give it a try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered this neighborhood gem tonight and while devouring our meals, started talking about what to have during our next visit!!!  He started with the homemade wedding soup and it was delicious.  I went with a tossed salad and the homemade Italian dressing.  This amazing dressing may have just ruined me for all other dressings.  For main courses, I had the lemon chicken (no icky mushrooms) and he had the delmonico steak.  Both dishes were INCREDIBLE!!!  You can really taste the love and care put into every dish.  Our whole experience was beyond fantastic.  The service is attentive, fast and more than you expect nowadays.  We have definitely found a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"I dined with a companion on Friday night, 5 February 2016.  We were provided the last booth available: comfortable.  Our food was excellent.  If there is a more beautifully-presented or delicious calzone in the region, I do not know where it is.  The tiramisu was artistic and delicious with drizzled caramel on the plate. What is always lacking here is any attention or a kind word from management/ownership: surprising to me.  I would settle for a smile at this point.  If management ignores or is sullen to customers, will they continue to come back?  Management should go to Atria's Peters Township or Red Tea House at Virginia Manor Shops to see how responsible owners/operators go out of their way to welcome the customer and make him or her feel like king and queen."}
{"text":"It was one of those rainy cold nights and was looking for some comfort food.  Found it a Piacq.  A bar in the front so the dinning room is not real large and seemed a little dark, Ok maybe ambiance, nah, maybe it was just a cold rainy night.  Crowded with families and some older couples...many seemed to be frequent customers and knew the wait staff.  Our waitress called everyone dear and was kind of lackadaisical...did not ask if we wanted a drink, just \"what would you like\".  Oh yea, everyone was called \"Dear\".  Heard the other waitress and she asked about drinks, told that table about the fresh soups of the day.  Oh Dear!!!!to have the better waitress would have been nice; but actually we were fine.  Waitress was prompt in bringing out some fresh italian bread with dipping oil with sun dried tomato's, it was so delicious, could have just eaten the bread with the dipping oil.  Food came out relatively fast and was hot.  Ordered the Chicken cacciatore and it was good and came with a side of pasta that was OK.  Really hit the spot on a cold rainy night."}
{"text":"I had the gnocchi.  It was yummy...meat sauce is good. Delicious wedding soup. Pizza crust is too soft for my taste, but it was decent. Very friendly staff. This place definitely doesn't get enough buzz. I grew up in Dormont and I frequent that shopping center often and have never tried this place until now. Wish I would have tried it sooner."}
{"text":"This was the most 'wonderful' Italian experience we have had since moving back from California!  To find the beautiful dim lighted ambiance, along with no 'blasting' background music, thus enabling a quiet enough experience to comfortably hear one another was a beautifully 'rare' moment we embraced with much joy.  The delectable food was 'screamingly' authentic with their personal charm, accompanied by excellent customer service ... WHAT A GREAT DINNER ADVENTURE!  Extra kudos to this family-own jewel of a restaurant ... don't EVER change :-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night for dinner and had a wonderful experience! This is probably our third time in the past three years or so. I ordered the lemon chicken, side of meatballs, and we split the raspberry cheesecake. I couldn't decide between ordering the chicken parm or the lemon chicken. Everything on the menu looked delicious! I enjoyed the chicken, but I do think it could have had a bit more lemon flavor. Next time I will probably get the parm. The meatballs were fantastic! I almost forgot we had wedding soup (how could I do that haha) it was some of the best I have ever had. Amazing! Don't pass that up. To top it off even though we were stuffed, we split the cheesecake and it was amazing as well. They had a great dessert selection to choose from. Our waitress was great and a pleasure to have as well. We can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
