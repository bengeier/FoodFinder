{"text":"Since moving to Ajax a few years back I've been searching far and wide for the best food. It's hard to find in Durham region but there are gems tucked away if you look.    I've finally found the best falafel and shawarma and they're from this little hole in the wall (seriously) called Crown Pita. I've driven by this plaza many times and missed it and I never found it on Yelp since it didn't have many reviews. That changes today.   The wraps or plates are topped with fresh salad, tabouleh, cabbage, onions, pickles, and tomatoes.  You also have your choice of garlic sauce, tahina, hummus, and homemade hot sauce.  The falafel balls are fried fresh and are incredibly moist and flavourful. The wraps are made with thin pitas and are toasted in a panini press to just slightly crispy. Outstanding!   Be sure to check out this place when you're in the area. I think it's as good if not better than Liberty Shawarma downtown.  The place isn't beautiful but the people are nice and they offer outstanding cheap eats in Pickering."}

{"text":"This is a bit of an odd place. It's located at what appears to be the back of a building. Although there are signs on the sides of the tiny building and on the door, it could easily be mistaken for the service entrance to one of the other two businesses occupying the building. Despite my reservations, I entered and walked into a tiny space that actually had seating for 6-8 diners. The really odd thing about this place, it has no windows!  There was a very young fellow taking orders at the cash and two adults who I'm going to assume were his parents. I was the only guest at the time and I was looking over their menu on the wall above the counter, deciding what to order. None of them offered any suggestions and actually didn't say anything unless I asked a question, you know, like \"What do you recommend?\" Silence. No points for customer service.  Noticing the two vertical rotisseries, I ordered the dinner plate to go, which included a choice of beef or chicken shawarma, rice, potatoes, and salad. I chose the large size for 11.99. The medium was 9.99. No price shown for small.  It ended up being a lot of food crammed into a styrofoam box. And then he asked me if it was \"for here or to go?\" It was already in a takeout box! I had no desire to sit and eat in this tiny little closet.  Anyway, there really was a lot of food stuffed into the box. The salad was delicious. I'm not sure what all the components were but  it tasted really good. The fries had gotten a bit soggy but they were still okay. The rice was tasty and plentiful. I had gotten a combination of beef and chicken shawarma and both tasted good but the serving was a bit small compared to all the sides, making it not so great value for the price. But it did taste good.  If the atmosphere and customer service were more inviting, I would probably go back but there are too many other places to consider."}
{"text":"This place is small and not the most visually appealing, but the food is pretty good! There are a few seats, but most people coming in here do take out. It's not exactly the type of place you'd take someone for a date, though.  I ordered the Crown Combo for $9.99 + tax. I inhaled the shawarma (well-seasoned meat!), and couldn't stop eating the garlic fries despite them being a little on the soggy side. I'd come back. :)"}
