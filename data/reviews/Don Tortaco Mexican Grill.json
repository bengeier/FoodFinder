{"text":"I had the Carne Asada plate and it was very mediocre. The Carne Asade was greasy and a lot of the pieces were very gristly. I will try again but it will have to be busy, perhaps I got all the scraps at 0630 hours on a Monday. Y"}
{"text":"Fast and good enough to make it worthwhile. Not gourmet then again the prices reflect that."}
{"text":"Food is hot and it taste so real. Do NOt go to Robertos there food sucks. I have tried almost everything on there menu and I find it really satisfing with Don Tortaco Mexican grill. The prices are not bad at all. Friendly staff. Open 24 hours!!! It is a must try place . You won't go wrong"}
{"text":"Cheese was not melted, taco shell tough and chewy. Very little meat in taco, which did not taste good to me. I was very disappointed"}
{"text":"Generally this place is pretty good depending on who's cooking and who made the salsa, lately the red salsa has been perfect it reminded me of an old famous Mexican joint called El Cholo's from years ago here in town. Service has also been excellent everytime I have been there which is usually at night. They need to go back to the original taquitos they had when they opened though they went to a thinner cheaper product but its still ok."}
{"text":"Tired of the breakfast sandwich routine, I stopped at this Don Tortaco location on Saturday morning to get a breakfast burrito. It was very filling and exactly what I expected. It was massive and filled with eggs, cheese, sausage and potatoes. Piping hot and very satisfying. 

The menu isn't as extensive as other similar places but they have the typical taco shop goodies. The place is very clean and the salsa bar is well stocked. I love that they have an agua fresca fountain which has HORCHATA. Mexican food + horchata is the way to go. I don't like having to go up to the counter to ask for a refill so this is definitely a plus. They get an extra star for that. Check out their specials board for some great deals."}
{"text":"Sucks sucks sucks can I say it sucks, I'd rather eat dog food, don't waste your time or money in this dirty place."}
{"text":"If I could give less stars I would. The worst taquitos I have ever had in my life.  I would have preferred to microwave some boxed ones at home.  Do yourself a favor and go to the Taco Bell right next to that place instead."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have better review stars. Very good Mexican food near us. We go super late and they always come through with great meals. I recommend the carne asada quesadilla and their tacos."}
{"text":"This place is good. And Im saying that as a San Diegan who loves Mexican food (and has been to pretty much ALL the good mexican shops in Diego).

My brother took me here once and I just kinda disregarded it bc I figured LV wouldnt compare to SD... how wrong I was... Had it one time, and literally, FEINED for it while I was back in SD (got some as soon as got back to LV!) 

I always get the adobada burrito and have them add french fries to it (the lengua burrito is really good too... thats beef tongue for all you people who dont know wassup) ... They have a great salsa bar with green and red salsa, lots of lime, green onions, and the pickled carrots/jalapenos... I like to mix 1:1 of the green and red salsa... so delish....

Not sure this place is worth the trip if youre staying on the strip, but if youre nearby and want a good burrito at a reasonable price, this place is worth it!"}
{"text":"My experience here was not all so great and friend of mind suggested I try their food,  I tried their steak burritos and it was not to my liking the may tasted like it had been sitting on the grill all day but I was still trying to think positive about eating this not so tasty steak but when 1 hour past my stomach didn't agree with the meat so I spent about 5 hours letting it out threw the back door. Lol. The chips and salsa was the best for me."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the service and the beef burrito I had was the worst burrito I have ever had. It contained some beef with peppers & onions. No cheese or sauce!  Will never eat at a Don Totacos again."}
{"text":"I would never eat at this place ever again,!! My family of (6)and my self came in and order a whole bunch of food. As we are waiting for our food my 2 year's old daughter had to use the bathroom . as she's about to sit on the toilet a cockroach came from behind the seat. On top of this  the toilet had what looked like dried up blood on the side.  I can only imagine what's going on in their kitchen. Please DON'T eat here . this place is disgusting! Some one call health department , Or tell me how!!"}
{"text":"Always a bad customer service! I would never recommend this location to anyone. I was waiting to place an order for 10 minutes and their were 3 people working that night and not 1 even bothered to help me. They were more focused on the drive through."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. It's well worth the drive, even though I have at least 10 Mexican restaurants within a 2-mile radius of my house, including another Don Tortaco's a block from our house.
First off, this branch has people that actually listens and understands my instructions, in English, and most of them also speaks English fluently especially the girl at the cash register who is usually on duty at night. I've been to multiple Mexican places because I eat a lot at odd hours and there aren't much choices late a night, and only a few of them actually cooks my carne asada well done (even with Spanish translations etc.). Most of the time, they don't bother cooking their half-cooked carne asada before they put it on the bun, or they overcook it like it's burned. This place knows how to do it right, so I've been here for the past month almost every night.
The carne asada also tastes like it's actually been marinated, unlike other places where the meat tastes like it's just plain meat.
The horchata is also really good. It's very creamy and sweet, not watered down like most places. The first time I was there, I was wanting an ice cream (which they also have on their freezer) for desert, but after tasting that horchata, I forgot my ice cream. Refills are also free.
My husband also likes his burritos and sometimes he likes it all-vegetarian, so he can specify and add only the ingredients that he likes.
Customer service is good, the place is also clean and has really nice tile tables and decor, and added to the good food that is done right, I drive farther now when I get a craving for my favorite carne asada torta with horchata."}
{"text":"I've been suffering from food poisoning for the last 2 days after eating one taco from here for lunch."}
{"text":"Walking in you'll see great and beautiful decor! Everything is really nice from all 4 corners of the building. But the food wasn't that great. It wasn't anything different from any mexican stop i've been at except one thing. We ordered the beef steak special & carne asada fries. The beef was EXTREMELY dry, chewy, and hard. We couldn't even cut it into small pieces so we had to ask the cook to chop it for us. The carne asada was okay, its a smaller portion than what I usually get from other mexican restaurants but it could do. Its quiet in there too, no TV going on (even though theres 2 on the wall), and no radio. So if you're going to go here, go here when you're hungry and do not care what you're going to eat, good luck!!"}
{"text":"This use to be a Robertos Taco Shop and as Robertos was one of my favorite Mexican Food paces in Las Vegas. Not very far from my house and the food was great. Now it is a Don Tortaco . Since the change in name the service has really gone down hill. I made one trip a while back when they first changed their name and two recent visits. The last two times I was handed my food in a bag as if it was a to go order. Don't hand me my food in a bag, what am I not welcome in your restaurant? 

Anyway, I ordered the Carne Asada Chimichanga the first trip. The thing was over cooked a bit but passable. It didn't have as much cheese as the Robertos item and wasn't quite as good. The second trip I order the two beef taco combination plate and my taco shells were way over cooked. I had to wait for my drink while the cashier decided to take another order. On top of this the rice and beans that come with the combination plate were just very bland.

I'm not going here again."}
{"text":"Food was fresh. It was hot. Exactly what I ordered. Taste was great. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love that they are open 24/7 and that they will give me a burrito without the tortilla.  Their Carne Asada burrito sans the tortilla is a plate of meat, guacamole, and pico...so good. 

If you can eat carbs, which I don't, go for the cheese enchiladas. I miss those.  They are quite tasty!"}
{"text":"We live about a mile away from this place and just recently discovered that their carne asada tacos are pretty good.  For my taco loving family, Don Tortaco is exactly what you want in that pinch of a moment when you are craving good tacos but want to avoid the ff chains and restaurants.  Each of their tacos is filled with a LARGE heaping of meat - no skimping here.  The fully loaded tacos on corn tortillas are my favorite.  The crunchy shells are a bit too fried and crunchy for me, but my husband likes them.  We prefer the carne asada over the chicken, but still eat them both.  Their house hot sauce is delish!  Their rice is delish!  Overall, this is a great neighborhood taco spot and we will continue to eat there!"}
{"text":"Food- inconsistent but good.  (Chicken is disgusting)

Service can be frustrating, I don't bother going in if they have more than a few people in there because it could take 15 minutes for a taco.   The staff generally gives you the feeling they don't  care, especially the males."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service . First time I called ahead and ordered in hopes of saving time on drive to work . Showed up told cashier I was there to pick up.... And that's when they started cooking.... Last visit very rude cashier, ignored customers Til she was good and ready then just hands receipt for signature no thank you or anything. I'll make the longer drive for robertos instead"}
{"text":"Here it goes...I was driving by today and decided I would stop in for some carne asada nachos. I got them to go. When I got home, they really didn't look that great but I was starving so I decided to eat them.. Halfway through I had to stop eating them because they were so greasy and tasted horrible.  Later on in the night I started feeling so sick to my stomach. I will never eat there again.  Very disappointing considering I ate there frequently.  I do not recommend this location to anyone...."}
{"text":"This sucks that I even have to give this place one star. I don't know how many times this place got my order wrong. It doesn't matter if you double check your order with the order taker. They will still get it wrong! It definitely sucks when you order take out and when you get home to eat your dinner with the family and it's not what you ordered."}
{"text":"What!!! My review was removed??!! Why, because  no one spoke english!! Why do people hire them!!"}
{"text":"Ummmm... Noooooo! This spot isn't very good at all. I've been twice since I've moved here on 10/24/14. I don't even know why I went back a 2nd time after the 1st. Don'ttttt dooooo itttttt..."}
{"text":"On 12/12/16, I went in this store. Don't know why, they always screw my order and I take them to go. My total purchase was $ 24.00 for 3 meals. MY order was the chicken taco and the chicken enchilada. I am so mad at myself for not checking. Sure enough, I got home and my order of chicken taco & chicken enchilada turned out to be BEEF TACO WITH A CHEESE ENCHILADA  ????????   THE FOOD IS OK, BUT THE LADIES AT THE FRONT ARE SOOOO RUDE, MAYBE BECAUSE I AM WHITE, AND NEVER GET THE ORDER RIGHT. I MEAN NEVER. There is a new one opening at Durango & Blue Diamond. I can't wait to try them. Screw this location on 8060 Blue Diamond.  btw, have you ever seen the floor of the kitchen???"}
{"text":"Always clean, friendly staff that remembers us and always gets the order correct and prompt!"}
{"text":"I was a frequent costumer here at least once a week. I can't believe how downhill this place has gone. Tacos are fried a head of time and sit for who knows how long. Chile reaños don't exist anymore apearently and everything I get is cold by the time I'm home..... I live on durango and blue diamond. I will never be going back to this sorry excuse for a restaurant. There is a place in the Sinclair gas station on rainbow that is amazing for anyone reading this and the Mexican food is 10000x better that here. I will highly suggest you drive the extra 5 mins for a better meal. Hopefully this review will make the lazy cooks get there stuff together in don tortaco"}
{"text":"Their food is just fine, no true complaints there. My issue is with the fact that they have a 24 hour sign lit up every night and when I come by the door is locked. If you are open 24/7 then stay open, if not then take down your 24/7 sign."}
{"text":"I would have given this place zero stars, but since I had to give at least one...here it is.

The place was not busy but it was loud with the cook in the kitchen chopping the hell out of something..not sure it was meat as I didn't find much in my tacos. The TV's were blaring, making it hard to hear the person sitting next to me.  

I ordered 2 hard shell tacos - buy 2, get one free..now I know why.  The shells were either under cooked or old...tough and not edible.  The tacos were more like  lettuce tacos - it had an abundance of lettuce - little of anything else.

I found a hair in the radishes at the salsa bar which finished off an already bad meal for me.  The salsa bar appeared to be rather dirty..lots of drips and spills.

The girl taking our order asked if it was to go or eat in...even after stating we were eating in, she packed it to go...whatever.

Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"I came to Don Tortaco expecting it to be a slightly better version of Robertos. I was wrong. The decor might be better, but the food is a notch below. The carne asada fries lacked flavor and had chunks of fat in it. I've never seen such large chunks of fat in any Robertos I've ever had.  The meat seemed to lack flavor, didn't remind me of the carne asada fries that I love.

The staff is a whole other story. Hard to find anyone to order from. Lady at the front desk is extremely inattentive and will literally run away from you to the back so she can play on her phone and play music. My girlfriend walked up to ask for a cup of water, after the cook sees her, he runs off to the side and starts chatting with the cashier. Most unacceptable behavior I've seen anywhere in a long time.


There are too many Robertos nearby that are much better for the same price. No reason to ever come to this place and their insultingly rude staff."}
{"text":"I like this place next time you're looking for delicious greasy Mexican food this is the place!"}
{"text":"The food here is one of our favorite places to grab Mexican...except when it's busy. Don't come between 530 and 7 pm."}
{"text":"We saw this place on our way home and decided to give it a try..
The place was spotless! Great vibe upon arriving. Staff was excellent and very attentive! We ordered a plate of nachos  and the  #2(enchiladas with a beef tacos.) The tacos shells are amazing! Loved the food. My daughters new favorite place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Came in for a late dinner and I guess the cashier was in the can so the cook came over and rang us up. He was very friendly and got our food out quick. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Some of the staff isn't so friendly a woman who works there always gives me a hard time. The food is okay, you dont get your moneys worth thats for sure."}
{"text":"i did not like this place. the only thing i think it had going for it was the red salsa at the salsa bar. i ordered a plate of adobada and that shit was BURNT. i'm not saying it was well done, that would have been fine. what i'm saying is, i didn't have one bite that didn't taste like charred bullshit. i had to drown my shit in salsa. they did give me tons of onions and cilantro as if to say \"here, we know we messed up. put this all over your food to make it better\". the rice was flavorless and mushy. the beans tasted old and had hard spots in them. bummed out. i've never trashed a place in a review before, it doesn't feel good."}
{"text":"The quesadillas are to die for. Food is fresh and great all day and night. Usually night time is when we go. We went for over a week straight. Still not bored."}
{"text":"California burritos are bomb and done correctly by sautéed pico de gallo. The breakfast burritos are huge"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming to this taco shop. The staff is friendly and will grill leeks from the salsa bar for you, if you ask nicely. They have clean and spacious seating area."}
{"text":"We put in some work here! Asada nachos are yummy! Tortas weren't so great for this place being named after them. Overall it was good & we will be back."}
{"text":"Usually love traditional Mexican joints in non traditional neighborhoods. Impressed with the salsa & accompaniment bar but when my chicken torta arrived I was really disappointed. Boiled chicken on a dry bollio roll. Little flavor & messy. No mayo, avocado or any flavor binder. Bf had chicken taco- not good flour tortilla fried. Made for difficult biting. Enchiladas were good. Nice staff but until the food gets better we will be seeking out Roberto's"}
{"text":"Had lunch here last month ordered the shredding beef taquitos combo. The Beef was bland and tasted old the only edible items were the rice and beans. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I thought it looked a little sketchy at first. It is good food at a very good price. I would agree with Vanessa N. that it is probably best buzzed but sober it is still good. It is also a great place to eat while you are getting other things done along the mini mall."}
{"text":"So good! Chicken Quesadilla with double guac! Nice largr pieces of white chicken. Veggie bean burrito! Chef is definitely taking extra care to make your meal rxtra good! Always fresh and the employees are always so friendly! Super clean and easy location! Would HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Don Tortaco was pretty impressive and they certainly can't go wrong for the price. I had got as much as I could to see what was made the best and they passed with flying colors on every item I got. Which was the carnitas plate, pastor plate, the enchiladas and taco plate,the burrito and enchilada plate, carne asada burrito,beef tacos chicken tacos and everything tasted home made. I even had so much left over I had dinner the next day with it and it still taste good. The food is in large portions. The only thing was I believe they we're overwhelmed by the huge order the almost for a few things..lol .. This place is a step up from the regulars and can for sure compete with the restaurants."}
{"text":"Here the food is not so good I try the torta de jamon and they put a big piece of ham but  is really ticked and the avocado is black"}
{"text":"good food, but the cashier guy needs to learn english.... he screws up the order 1/2 of the time!"}
{"text":"Use to come here a lot, and was always decent.  Just left there and so upset,  had to send part of order back wasn't close to what I ordered.   Seemed like the cook knew only one way to make the food.   The cashier was the only good part of experience"}
{"text":"Great food, very flavorful and well prepared! I had Robertos recently since someone requested it and Don Tortaco definitely makes Roberto look like a punk."}
{"text":"Don Tortaco/Roberto's they're both the same: Really fast and good Mexican food. Never let down by the quesadilla or the nachos. Add red sauce to the meal and a drink of horchata and that's some great food."}
{"text":"I found this place looking for a Roberto's Taco Shop. Apparently some of them have changed to Don Tortaco's.

This place is open 24hrs, 365 days a year! I went on Christmas morning around 4am after a visit to the strip and found they were the only place open for miles!

The food was phenomenal, cheap and big servings! I had a lengua burrito that was fairly big and my wife had a chicken enchilada plate with beans and rice. All of their food is fresh, and super tasty.

I highly recommend them even if it's in the middle of the night on a holiday, chances are they will be open."}
{"text":"We popped into this Roberto's (located on Blue Diamond at Buffalo by Rounders and a Child Care place) at like 1am after a concert. Few drinks down and we were ready for fourth meal.

My husband insisted we order the Carne Asada Fries. I thought we needed more than just that so I ordered a Bean & Cheese Burrito as well. OMG was I wrong! Those fries were huge, and L.O.A.D.E.D! We devoured them and took the burrito home for lunch the next day.

Surprisingly I've only been to Roberto's a handful of times. One other time I had a Carne Asada Burrito that was delicious and huge. One time I had Rolled Tacos (aka taquitos) another WINNER!

I will say that there is never a shortage of food with your order. This particular location was clean and the girl taking our order was kind. I'm sure we will be back since this location is right by our house."}
{"text":"Ordered rolled tacos and there was a toothpick hidden inside the taco. I feared for my safety and almost was forced to call an ambulance. Please ask for them to remove toothpicks. Other than that, my friends and I had a grand time. :)))))))))))"}
{"text":"Loooove this place and it's great food.  Prices are good and the service is always fast!  Late night cravings for rolled tacos, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"CALIFORNIA BURRITO!!!!!
This is great comfort food. 
I never have to wait longer than 5mins for food either and I order a lot cause I'm a chunk."}
{"text":"Shit service....

7:15pm 12/9/16 

Sheeit service.  The girl up front has issues.  She has no communication skills and shes rude.

I had come to order a carne asada fries.  I asked for no cheese and no sour cream.  but later i had asked her to put some nacho cheese into the carne asada fries.  She said yes.  And charged me 92 cents.  I opened the box and got regular cheese.  

1.  You charged me for something i had asked not to put in.  She then went ahead and said there is no nacho cheese.  You fucking sell nachos there and you tell me you dont have nacho cheese?  Ill be calling the owner about this.

2.  And if you fucking put in something i had asked t take out in the first place why the fuck would you charge me 92 cents to put it back in

Also i asked her whats in the carne asada fries.  She didnt tell me there were veans in it.  If you dont fuckin know whats in it.  Turn the fuck around and ask the fuckin cook.

Its over.  You dont fuck up and blame the fuckin custimer for your fuckin mistake."}
{"text":"Now I do love Mexican food... That being said, the food was ok. It is a lot like Roberto's in food options and taste. The place was clean and about average in noise at one of these places. The girl operating the register was friendly and was happy to answer any questions we had about menu items. Having eaten at a large number of Mexican restaurants I can get picky. Here is what we ordered...

Carne Asada burrito: size was good. I could not finish all of it. The meat itself was good in flavor and tenderness but the burrito was dry. I was surprised that there was no sauce on or in it.

Carne Asada chimichanga: It's a good amount of food, my wife couldn't even finish half of it. She liked it. It came with sour cream and guacamole on it. 

Horchata: One of my favorite drinks. This was a little too sweet. Might need to make an adjustment to the amount of syrup in the mixture."}
{"text":"I got the carna asada fries, all I can say is that it was better  than Roberto's but not omg good. If they just put more effort into their food I would consider going back?"}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place seeing the 24 hr sign and never caring to stop until tonight. Around midnight I went into this unsuspecting building to find a great taco shop. The inside is not your typical surgical lights and dirty tile motif. Its very tastefully done inside and  I was greeted by the guy running the counter fairly quick. I saw the grilled chicken special and couldn't pass it up. Only *6.99 for 2 pieces of very well seasoned and marinated chicken breast served with rice, beans, and fresh avocado, tomato, and your choice of flour or corn tortillas. I was very happy with the beans and rice too very flavorful and well seasoned once again. I got the green and red salsa and have to say they are some of the better green and red sauces, very good with the food and adequately spicy. I also got a bean and cheese burrito for tomorrow and everything on my bill came to less than $10. Great job for midnight, 10/10 will have again."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good & service as well the problem is u can't get a Menu from this location without going in can't get anything ( would be nice to see what u want before going in. SOMEONE GIVE THEM PAPER MENU's please."}
{"text":"The best carne asada tacos I've ever tasted. They don't need any sauce, salsa, anything. Packed with flavor."}
{"text":"The bacon breakfast burritos are delicious! Eggs, potatoes, cheese and bacon are inside the burrito. You also have the option to add pico de gallo. Ham and Machaca are also other options for breakfast burritos. The \"green\" sauce is good and not spicy. We've had pretty much every else on the menu and all have delicious so far. 

We've been coming to this place when it was \"Roberto's\" and at least 2-3 times a month. We've not had a bad experience with customer service or food.

Tip-If your a regular or become a regular call ahead to place an order."}
{"text":"This place is basically Roberto's but slightly better IMO. They always hook me up with large portions and tons of stuff on 1 plate for the price -- So far, I've had the carne asada nachos (the star there) and the beef (machaca) plate -- both were good. I have late night cravings for this when I get the munchies -- Stoner Joint"}
{"text":"Every Don Tortaco seems to be slightly different than the next. This one advertises buffalo wings and they actually have them. I had a big Fiasco with another Don tortaco where they were advertising wings but everytime I ask for them they said they were out of them like five different occasions. This one had buffalo wings but they did not use traditional buffalo sauce it was like your red sauce the lady running the register seem like she hated her job"}
{"text":"After being stuck in the strip for what felt like eternity  this morning after bringing in the new year, all I wanted were some tacos. I js moved here and wasn't sure on where to go, but this place was the closest thing to me still open. Didn't expect the greatest since it was 4 am ..but he cooked my Carne asada tacos right there in my face. They were fresh and delicious  and has been all I've been thinking about since. I believe I found my go-to spot."}
{"text":"A good 24 hour spot. Food is prepared to order so comes out hot and food flavor. Nachos and shrimp platter are always good."}
{"text":"Their California burrito is delicious!
Add some extra avocado and you will taste paradise. This place is also very clean and service is great."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place but the food and the customer service is horrible. I think the guy who takes your order has to run back and cook the food as well. He is not pleasant at all!!! There used to be a lady who worked there that was soo nice, thats when the food was fast and GOOD. Not anymore! The tacos are dripping with grease, the bean burritos tortilla was burned, rolled tacos were so over cooked we couldnt bite them without breaking a tooth and they even burned thru the styrofoam, chips are old and reheated and I won't even go there on the salsa that came with the chips(looked like pico but brown from sitting too long). Gave this place too many chances...Needless to say, not going back!"}
{"text":"A little more home style compared to Roberto's and Fausto's. I had the Steak Special for their Grand Opening offering of $3.99... Great deal! Steak came whole as opposed to the Carne Asada plate version and half the price. 
Ordered two beef tacos and was pleased with not only flavor, but size as well. A little nice touch with the tacos was the mix of Mexican and Cheddar Cheese.
I'm looking forward to trying their weekly specials in the future. If you like Roberto's and/or Fausto's give The lessor known Don Tortaco a try."}
{"text":"This is based on service because the food is usually on point.  Don't ask for radishes when your at the drive thru because they will not give it to you. I was told it was only for customers who dine in. That's like getting an order of French fries and saying ketchup is only for dine in guest. I don't get it."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another chance and again ordered the carne asada nachos. I asked for the meat to be well done because of last experience with cold meat on nachos. What I got was burnt, grilled grease madness. This was not well done it was burnt meat. With it came the scrapping from the griddle as if they were cleaning it and placed all of that black grim on my nachos. Obvious someone was upset with my request and made it known. Then my cheese was just as burnt and that too was added to this madness. Literally burnt to a crisp nachos. I had no choice but to throw it away."}
{"text":"Great place, food is inexpensive and so good. Always fresh, you can see the cooks back there preparing. Always greeted with a smile and they are so patient, as I never know what I want right when I come in. My family all love their food here, great job!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least 2 times a week, when not busy exploring other culinary options around Las Vegas. This place is a legit grab & go Mexican food - Decent quality grub, friendly staff, and consistency, which is lacking in similar franchises (Roberto's Tacos - Are you listening??).

I tend to order the combo plates & carne-asada tacos with cilantro/onions. Sometimes my order can get a little lost in translation because of a slight language barrier (staff speak fluent spanish, and decent English - I however, can only speak English). Custom requests & substitutions are easily done, altho some employees might be hesitant at first to accommodate your request. Being a regular now, its fun to go there, try different things and load up on their spicy salsa :)"}
{"text":"I was at the Horizon Ridge location this am..other locations offer chilequiles for breakfast if you ask... Not here..other locations have \"taco Tuesday\".  $1 tacos.. Not here, I asked.. The cook said different managers, different specials....settled on a plato of chicken taco and chicken enchilada..with drink about $9. Food was lukewarm. But it was 9 am and since they are not 24 hrs...(like the others) and don't be fooled by all take out menus that claim 24 hrs...I guess the rice, beans, and chicken did not have time to cook.  I have been to other locations and will return to them...not going back here."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly here, but the food is mediocre. I had their beef enchiladas, which did not have that much meat in it and was very oily. I also tried their beef nachos; the beef they used on it was tender and flavorful, and they used real cheese instead of nacho cheese which made it good. But the guacamole was average and not that seasoned and their was an over abundance of beans on it. The plus about this place is that it is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food on the go!  This place makes Robertos look old & dirty."}
{"text":"I only signed up for yelp because I was disgusted with a simple bean and cheese burrito they sent me home with..... Really?  Wow stiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnggggyyy place, why didn't you just say you ran out of cheese and beans? I would've just ordered something else....I always give a business a benefit of the doubt but this takes the cake"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much like Roberto's but the reason I give it three stars is because I got the carne asada plate and it was full of fat! Gross! Anyway it's pretty similar to Roberto's"}
{"text":"No jalepenos at the drive thru!

I have been driving thru this place for months now and I can never get jalepenos when I do drive thru. Apparently, the jalepenos are on the other side of the counter as what I have been told when I asked why.  I know they have them! 

On one of my drive-thrus, I saw them on the counter and asked for some. The guy looked at me as if he were thinking \"Fine!\" 

On tonight's drive-thru I asked again (I always ask) and the dude just shook his head no and the automatic window closed. Why is it so hard to have jalepenos in the kitchen for customers who want them.

Anyways, the food is pretty good for Mexican fast food. They have good breakfast burritos for $3 and some change. 

I still want jalepenos when I drive thru."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Food has bad taste. They charge for chips to go with the salsa. Food is microwaved. There so called carne asada isn't flap meat but a cheap cut of round steak or something similar but charge for flap meat this is my first and last time here I will be calling the owner tomorrow to inform him of my experience and my dissatisfaction of his restaurant"}
{"text":"Ok this is review is for calling in for take out. First I have to say, HOW RUDE!!! Please tell me you don't understand and get someone that can help. Then to top things off, I call back and the phone rings and rings. No one answers. I call back on another phone and what do you know! Only because we moved to Buttuckey, our choices are limited and driving farther down wasn't an option after a long day. Hopefully when we give them another shot, it'll be a little different. Crossing fingers because this spot is so convenient!"}
{"text":"Love this specific location! Everything comes out fast and on point! There is a big diff from their competition from the way the meats are cooked to the decently priced menu! So long....Roberto's!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed to have soggy tortillas for my tacos and soggy nachos from there Pico de gallo. I had to ask for replacement tacos definitely not going  back. Roberto's is way better !!!"}
{"text":"These guys have no customer service skills whatsoever. And then they have the nerve to hang a tip jar on their drive thru window.... No wonder it's always empty. As for the food it's just as shitty as Roberto's which is right across the corner. Typical Mexican drunk food joint."}
{"text":"This place is bomb....only restaurant worth going to on this side of town if you want Mexican food"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times.  The quality of food really depends on the cook.  I can say that we have had items that were pretty good, then order the same items on another day and have them be awful.  For instance we ordered a quesadilla,  easy right? Well it was soooooo greasy and covered in oil I couldn't even eat it.  The carne asada fries have always been a hit.    



!!!WARNING!!!!!

       DONT EAT THE MENUDO!!!
I just ordered it brought it home cracked it open ,   im so pissed of and dissapointed right now.  There is absolutely no hominy in it! Wtf!? This just shows the lack of care from the cook.  

Overall, yea the place is good , just be sure to thoroughly examine your food before taking it home ."}
{"text":"Their sign says 24 hrs and they weren't open when I walked in at 8am. The lady didn't even tell me when to come back or when they were going to be open again. Please update your business hours on here so others won't waste their time coming here when your closed."}
{"text":"Excellent Chile Relleno and the best Chorizo burrito I've ever had!"}
{"text":"It looks like Mexican food but is very bland. I asked if I could get a plate with just one item and was told yes. Which is why I was surprised at the expense. It was pricy because I got a two item plate. I don't know if I'll try it again. Of I do, I'll do another review."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before and I usually get the Carne Asada Fries/Chips. They are the bomb when you're drunk!

Today I stopped by to get a Carne Asada Burrito. The cashier asked me if I wanted everything on it. I said yes. I asked her if it came with cheese and sour cream. She said no, it comes with guacamole pico de gallo. I said everything and I want to add cheese and sour cream. 

I get home and start eating the burrito. It only had carne asada, beans and cheese. I guess I was suppose to ask for rice, but they did forget my guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream. 

I should have just ordered the Carne Asada Fries/Chips like I usually do."}
{"text":"Really you're a Mexican eating establishment and don't don't have F-ing limes ????  I don't care how expensive they get. Ridiculous !!"}
{"text":"Girls that work here are very pleasant. I enjoy myself every time I come dine in. I can actually read here. It's peaceful. The food is always good."}
{"text":"Closest thing to \"authentic\" Mexican food,  service is good,  they are always friendly.  This place is always clean.  Menu is similar to Robertos but this place is cleaner and food taste so much better."}
{"text":"Came here after the 5 blocks away could figure out how to use the credit card machine. People were nice but turn on the A/C in the place. It was cooler outside than inside. That's the only reason it got 3 stars. It would of been higher but they just had the door open."}
{"text":"This is Roberto's without the hype. Extremely well made food to order.  Asada burrito and chicken taquitos were delicious. The salsa bar had dozens of perfectly ripe and cut limes which I enjoy. The only negative I had were the spicy carrots weren't crunchy - a bit soft for my liking. I will never go to Roberto's again!!"}
{"text":"The wife wanted Mexican food tonight as we were driving along Horizon Ridge, I suggested Don Tortaco's. It happens to be located in the same complex as a Taco Bell...Taco Bell, yuck...I'd only eaten here a couple of times, it's alright. Pretty comparable to Roberto's,  the menu's are very similar.

My wife got the Adobada plate and I got the Carne Asada fries (what a gut-bomb, right?)...she said she likes Roberto's one better, better flavor and more meat. The Carne Asada fries are disgustingly delicious...beef piled on melty cheese, sour cream, guac, pico and handfuls of French fries. What's not to like? It's your perfect late night go-to if you need something to soak-up all that alcohol you've consumed...

So what have we learned here...if your craving some late-night Mexican food, go to Don Tortaco. Or else, go to Roberto's, or Fausto's...don't go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This place was very tasty and very inexpensive. I can't wait to go back and try their chips and cheese. We had 2 hard shell beef tacos and a chicken burrito."}
{"text":"Traveling from out of town and wanted food that was not \"Vegas\" just good Mexican food is what I was craving and that is what I got!  Service was fast and pleasant and the woman working the counter was extremely friendly. Prices were great and the food was amazing. And oh my goodness the salsa I could drink it!! Would recommend for sure!!"}
{"text":"I must admit that the only item I get here is the Carnitas burrito with everything. I simply love this burrito and this location makes it tasty regularly. The carnitas are shredded and mix well with the guacamole, the whole burrito just melts in your mouth. It is not a fat free choice, however, if you love yourself, you should try it too. I am also nuts for their pickled carrots and the red smoked chili sauce. The only way to make the experience better is with a cold Budlight. They do not sell beer, so you'll have to do with a Jarritos soda."}
{"text":"I've been going here since they first opened, and even after their name changed from Roberto's to Don Tortaco, the food still tastes great.  

I love their warm, authentic mexican tortillas!  I usually always get a burrito, but every now and then I get a chicken taco from here too.

There are 3 things that make me very happy about this restaurant:  1) you can custom design the ingredients of your burrito, and it still stays cheap;  2) their chicken is shredded and marinated with a light broth, which keeps the chicken meat moist and tender;  and  3) I like their self serve salsa bar, lots of variety of add ons:  sliced radishes, cilantro, onions, jalepeno & carrot mix, limes, green onions, and even diced cucumbers.

Having this location nearby and open 24 hours are added perks for me!"}
{"text":"Worst service imaginable. I called in a new order. That took 15 minutes just to overcome the language barrier. But fine. It's OK, the food will be worth it. I walk in 15 minutes later to pick up my to go order and THEY HADN'T STARTED IT YET. The waitress says my order again  to me and I asked why they didn't make it? She said that's the policy. WTF? THEN WHY CALL IN. ASK FOR MY CREDIT CARDS!!!
Never going here again"}
{"text":"Went in late thinking grab food and then head home no mess. Two different orders first order came out friends are. People behind us orders came before ours. Then when ours came we were given to go and told to leave. They are closing. Signs all lit up showing 24 hours and were told they changed due to new location opened. 

Got home enchiladas were cold, they rolled them three sauce lettuce s d then cheese. They never even baked them to melt or combine enchiladas.

Tacos were all thrown in box and meat so wet the tortillas fell apart

Very dissatisfied"}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating at Don Tortaco but it really aggravates me when you wait for 15 minutes to order, then being told that it will take another 30 minutes for a carne asada taco salad, unless I change my order?!?! Why I ask? Because it's busy....smh?"}
{"text":"This place is dirty! Watched the girl in the back dicing tomatoes and goes straight to the register to cash out customers without proper hand washing. The only thing she did was wipe her hands on a rag and cleaned the rag out behind the cashier counter. I got curious and took a peek at it from the soda station and it was only a bucket of water! Not sanitary!!! I would give this place no stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I think it is about time i give up on this place. The food has never been that good and the customer is blah. After several times of them forgetting things that i would pay extra for. I came back for one more time since the location is covenant. But this time the food made me sick  I definitely wont be back after this."}
{"text":"Great place that they used to call something else. But hey... Whatever. Doesn't matter to me anymore. This place is great. Close to the house and fast. Always open is a plus as well. So it is definetly convienent for people that has late jobs like me."}
{"text":"Solidmexican restaurant on the corner of Bermuda and Silverado ranch. Ol donnys is what me and my buddies call it cause it's a great spot that needs a name! I get the adoba plate but just tried the chicken taco salad and that's legit."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I have a Don Tortaco a quarter of a mile away, especially since Robertos are everywhere and The Don is hands down much cleaner, about 1000% less greasy, and they offer delicious desserts too. This is my last minute meal headquarters and they almost always deliver quality taco shop food. One star demerit for being one of the only taco shops I have ever seen that closes at 10pm."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place of business on a couple of occasions the food is ok but I'm always extremely dissapointed by the lack of costumer service.The people that take your order are always in a bad mood and they appear as if taking your order is a favor they are doing you. The Mannager their I believe she is with the short hair is always condescending the last time I went their my order was messed up and she didn't even offer to fix it!!!Her manners where poor and she just stated at me and then mouthed a I'm sorry......Sometimes that does not cut it.I know as you read this you think why would I go back after the first time my experience was bad right? Well I believe in second chances yet to be dissapointed worse than the first time.I will never eat their again I can go else where my business is appreciated. I feel bad for the owner who has worked hard to have what he has to have employees who don't care about what impression people leave with because at the end of the day it's not their business.
Don't eat here spend your hard earned money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Open 24 7 and they have tacos Lengua? I like this place already! Food is good and so is the price!  Ordered the special combo 2 Taco Lengua rice and beans drink included for $6.25 that's cheap! Portion wise plenty enough.  

Yum Factor- 3.7/5 its tender but Taco y Taco is better seasoned (shhh) but hey it's all good 

What's Cool - the tropical soda fountain drinks see pics below. 

Staff - friendly, even cook engaged in chit chat. They speak both English and Spanish. 

Open kitchen.. You can see it's CLEAN

Dining area clean, modest furnishings has seating for 24 but is spacious 


Location - tucked in corner of strip mall where that  gymnastics school is .. only noticed this place at night from their neon sign and the banner on Horizon Ridge. 

How is it compared to the other Mexican fast food 24 hour place down the street? Well.. first thing I noticed the clientele late night aren't a bunch of drunk fools. So much rather come here for sure. 

Disclaimer: This review was done on my phone on the fly. While eating no doubt. So don't go grammar police on me. 

.. and there you go... my first review using the new Yelp app feature for Android users.. About time!"}
{"text":"Altamente recomendado 
Lucy la manager brinda un excelente servicio y tiene una actitud extraordinaria."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and the venue is clean, the staff is kind and quick to attend to you. The food takes a bit longer than expected to come out but I suppose that is a good thing since it shows they are taking a little bit of time to prepare this food."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the cashier stole a dollar out of my change. My total was $8.91 or something and I was only given back a $10 bill and some pennies. Didn't realize this untill I finished my food. Make sure you get your receipt before you walk way. I didn't feel like fighting for a dollar but this left a bad impression of the restaurant being it's my first time I ate here."}
{"text":"Not the bees-knees or the best taco place as stated in other posts. Basically a second-rate Roberto's. I talked my friend in to going here because she wanted PePes---big mistake!  Terrible customer service. Cashier was reluctant to take our order let alone answer our questions or react to our comments. She yelled across the room, while holding up the tray and staring out direction, \"food ready\" like we knew she was speaking to us. By the time we realized she was yelling at us, she seemed thoroughly annoyed (because walking the food to our table is not convenient). The food was not tasty; tacos greasy and chicken dry.  Wouldn't recommend. Go to the chains, at least you'll get consistency."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place several days ago while on the hunt for a replacement to Roberto's since their prices have almost doubled as of recently, I'm so glad i found Don Tortaco's.

First off when they say 'beef' on anything whether its the nachos, tortas or chimi's they really do mean it, You wont find ground beef in any of their food as they use authentic shredded beef which is well seasoned and cooked amazingly.

I ordered the Super Nachos - Beef and a Beef Chimichanga, To me at-least i felt the Chimi could've had a bit more filling as it felt soggy and empty upon first cutting into it however the Nachos were delicious i would even say they're right up there with the best I've had in Las Vegas thus far. 

Food was amazing but i really enjoyed the drinks on tap and the brand of Horchata they have tastes pretty authentic despite coming from a fountain unlike the 7/11 one, They also have a variety of flavors from Pina Colada to Coconut and even Guava i was shocked. 

Hopefully they'll work on stuffing their Chimichangas a bit more but other than that they have won a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they know how to run a restaurant anymore. Took 40 mins for a California burrito? This place is falling off.."}
{"text":"I have gone to one other don tortaco other than this one. I thought the food was far superior to Robertos but the service was terrible at this location. 
My boyfriend likes his burritos with meat, bean and rice. No guac and no pico. They wanted to charge him more for ingredients that cost less. And said they can't do that for him. They just lost a customer. Ended up going to Robertos."}
{"text":"I'm gonna throw up it's just like robertos DISGUSTING it's so friggin hard to find a good taco shop one day it's ok the next you get sick eating soggy disgusting food the search continues cross this one off the list  HORRIBLE !!!! And I even tipped a buck .... bastards!!!"}
{"text":"I work at a Farmers Insurance Office in the area. I eat lunch on that corner everyday. 

Excellent place to eat. On Tuesday you can get the chicken tacos for $.99. $2.99 Breakfast Burrito. 

I was at the Cane's drive-through on Monday and saw the sign that said $.99 Taco Tuesday... I thought to myself, \"I'm going to try that tomorrow.\"

I met a friend there the next day. The Burrito platter he ordered looked excellent. Now I'm going to have to try that next time. 

Clean restaurant, fast friendly service, two soda fountains (big selection) and a great condiment stand. 

I would definitely recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Sorry Robertos. ... this may be my new spot!!! The carne asada nachos were amazing!! They really hook it up with all the toppings and add so much meat! The taquito were far better then others I have had in a while.  Also, the burritos were good and jam packed!  It really is a great deal for how much food you get!!!"}
{"text":"Kind of like Roberto's. The food is pretty good as far as semi fast food Mexican goes. it's a much better alternative to Taco Bell that's for sure. The best part is that it is open twenty four hours to crave those late night munchies or when your wife sends you out at two AM for a food run. The prices are very reasonable too. I'll usually order a Carne asada tostada which only cost $3.80. Sometimes the even have specials on tacos buy two get one free. Throw in the little side salad bar with radishes, cucumbers, and marinated carrots with jalapeno and you got a rather large meal four under for bucks."}
{"text":"DONT DO IT!!
I went to this place for 2 California burritos with al pastor and everything carne Asada fries. They finished my order in record time, but they were so thin I had to open it and take a peek inside. I'm so glad I did, I would've been so pissed off when I got home. There were more fries then meat for sure. I asked for a refund and the lady got all defensive, she said you opened it, I said it doesn't matter you can't sell it to anyone else anyway. Then there were more customers in the place so she relented and gave me my money back. I just went to Lauritas it's so much better, hell even Roberto's is better than Don Tortaco and they are ridiculous with their lame ass no substitutions rule. Roberto's won't even let me order a California with al pastor even if I'm willing to pay extra for the al pastor. I don't even go there, how they think they can dictate my burrito they crazy. So to Don Tortaco and Roberto's, I say, good luck! Comparison photos are included, you decide."}
{"text":"Love this place! The beans and rice are the best I've ever had. All the food is always hot and fresh, made to order. Way better than Robertos."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just visited this location for the first time this morning. We wanted to fuel up on something fast and tasty before a full day at the DMV. Don Tortaco has a full menu available 24 hours -- so we were able to feast on tacos for breakfast without question or judgement! Woo!

My favorite part about the whole place is the Salsa Bar. They have two salsas available (a green and a red) and offer a plethora of other toppings as well: whole scallions, diced white onion, cilantro, crushed red pepper, fresh sliced cucumber, quarters of lime, and on and on. I'm a saucy broad, so I really appreciate the ability to go to town on sauces and toppings - for free! 

The green salsa was vinegar based, with a nice tang and a bit of heat. The red was smoky, spicy, and thicker in consistency. I preferred the green; my boyfriend loved the red. 

As far as the tacos go, we ordered two each of the carnitas and carne asada. Both of us favored the carnitas, which were crispy, hot, and flavorful. The steak was great too, but we were wishing for more carnitas at the end of our meal. Both types of tacos were covered in a guacamole sauce, diced white onions, and pico de gallo. The tortillas tasted fresh and flavorful. 

All in all, great breakfast at a great price! As I type this review from the DMV, where I have been standing in line to reach the information desk for nearly 2 hours, I am SO GLAD that we stopped by Don Tortaco this morning. I would be a hungry, cranky monster without those tacos. And that's the truth. :)"}
{"text":"The difference between Don Tortaco and Roberto's?

Virtually nothing at all. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out the owners of the two similar franchises were siblings just competing against each other.
They use practically the same ingredients and all the foods taste/look/seem the same, just claimed by a different franchise tag.

Blindfold me and bring carne asada fries from each place and I won't be able to tell you the difference. Just like Roberto's, Tortaco's meats are mediocre. Way too grilled and doesn't even take like authentic carne asada. I'm not Mexican but I lived on Mexican food so I know what my asada and pastor tastes like~

Despite its annoying similarities, it's not bad. It's worth going to here and then but nothing special. I would go maybe if I was intoxicated enough and since it's close to me."}
{"text":"If you are desperate for Mexican it might be worth a try. I have had take out and dined in with my wife several times in the short time this location has been open. The first couple of times were without incident. Decent food. The service a bit slow but no real problems. 

The next time we went for dinner  they were out of forks. So we had to eat our enchiladas with spoons. Annoying, ridiculous, but not the end of the world. Next time we intended on eating there no fountain drinks were available. Why? I am guessing nobody knew how to switch out the co2 canisters that we're in plain sight. Okay so we got our food to go. 

Now this brings us to tonight. Again I went there with my wife and we got a decent sized to go order including two orders of cheese enchiladas. We looked in our bags before leaving and everything seemed to be in order. Unfortunately this was not the case. When we cut into the enchiladas they were chicken not cheese as ordered. 

We were annoyed but understanding and agreed to pick up the corrected items when we called. Assured that the order would be ready in 10 minutes we went back only to find that they forgot to remake the items. They tried to say that they were waiting for us to get there so the food wouldn't get soggy. But that's not what they were saying in Spanish, which my wife speaks as well. 

So why do all of these problems happen? I have an opinion on this. The owners of this chain decided to open several new locations in a short time. There are only two employees working at a time and they seem to lack both the training and experience that should have to serve customers correctly. I don't blame these clueless employees. I blame the ownership for not knowing and or caring enough to do things the right way. 

Adios Don. We won't be patronizing your establishments anymore."}
{"text":"We choose this place over Robertos every time. The rolled taquitos are always great! The only item from the menu that's not great is the chicken quesadilla. They put chicken fajitas in it. But overall good substitute to Robertos."}
{"text":"Pretty solid. This is now my goto fast food mexican place. Everything is always quick and hot! 24 hours as well!

I've had the beef burrito, which had big chunks of beef as opposed to ground beef, as well as the breakfast burrito. Both good!

Both the salsas taste weird though."}
{"text":"Identical to Roberto's in every way I can distinguish.  Not great, but not bad either.  I usually go for a chimichanga or asada fries.  Both are constantly good.  The restaurant is clean and has plenty of room for eating."}
{"text":"Went here because the taco festival was a big flop! This reminds me of Robertos , food was good."}
{"text":"Wth? I've been coming to this place before it switched over to Don Tortaco... Getting one of two things. The have a buy two tacos get one free deal that they've had he entire time. So tonight I order two tacos and I only received two. So of course I inquired why not three and pointed at the sign. He said I didn't mention it. Is this a new rule? I can read and it's in plain view. Why should I have to mention it? Then he talks to the cook and tells me that she says it's a special only on Tuesdays but she's going to make it for me. Hmmm... On he door when you walk in there's a piece of paper stating on Tuesdays tacos are a $1. Since my total for two was $4 (and some change) I'm sure that doesn't qualify. I'm just upset that I actually tipped them a dollar (like always) and if I didn't check my bag, would've been cheated on my B2G1 deal! Cmon! It's not rocket science. Don't turn around and then say it was my fault for ordering without mentioning a sign right above your head then say it's a Tuesday deal. Own up to it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good cheap Mexican food.  Basically the same as Roberto's Taco Shop which is more widely known in the area, but most of the items I like are cheaper here."}
{"text":"Not good at all!! The meat was flavorless and the salsa was water down.  I didn't care for my meal and it upset my stomach. I will not go back to this place. Poor quality in food!"}
{"text":"Ordered my food and waited like almost an hour before I got my food. Worst place to ever go in my opinion."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries was delicious! They even placed the toppings on the side. My son really appreciated that!

The carne  asada was enough for 2 or more to eat. (Or for lunch the next day!) My son and I truly enjoyed them.

My daughter ordered a shrimp burrito.  She said that it was fresh, delicious and filling also. 

We love that they are opened 24 hours and that there are digital coupons that you can use/redeem if you go to their website!

We now have a new late night eatery."}
{"text":"This is the closet to Roberto's I'll get in my neck of the woods. It is what it is but what it is is different, but then again I think a lot of jumbo burrito places like this have all changed just a little from what they use to be in their glory days. 

I remember driving home at 4 in the morning after a long night of partying and stopping by the 24hours taco shop to get these amazing fat I mean FAT burritos and carne Asada tacos withe tons of flavor and now they are all just meh. Enough to sad tidy your craving but not what it use to be.

This place is just like that. Like other locations the carne Asada is never crispy and a little on the salty side like I like then and the Asada fries....I am forming a sad face now the fries no matter how many times I ask them to fry the fries just so it's more crispy it still comes out soggy when they serve it, with now taste. I think they should salt the fries a little before adding the topping. 

Anyhow the chimichanga is good like everything else they serve it's all good just not amazing. I come here a lot because I so like them although the size of the burrito seems more mans more smaller them Roberto's. 

I wish they would be consistent!"}
{"text":"there are a lot of roberto's places in vegas.. yet all aren't the best.  this particular location is clean and the service is friendly and fast.  I love the carne asada nacho or fries..  and the carne asada California burrito!  

I like to call in and place my order on the phone if I'm not eating there... and if u do eat there, you'll definitely pick up the scent!  [it won't smell yummy like your food!]

a definite plus:  24 hours.. and they're on top of it at any hour!  roberto's is definitely a quick fix for my mexican food cravings!"}
{"text":"Worst Lengua I have ever had, poorly cooked, where's  the salt? Guac also missing salt. I couldn't even force myself to eat it and I eat almost anything. My hubby said his torta was ok, I tasted it and was not impressed. Run away, run far, far away."}
{"text":"I came in on a Tuesday. I ordered the breakfast burrito the bacon one. Very good taste great I also ordered the 99 cent chicken tacos that they have on Tuesday and took them to one of my friends they were very very dry definitely not what I expected definitely will not order the chicken tacos again here. But they do have a wonderful selection on burritos"}
{"text":"Decent local Mexican food chain: menu has plates, tacos, burritos, and chimichangas. Menu isn't much different from Roberto's but this location is a little less casual- shares space with a PT's next door.

Fish tacos are tasty, though the chunk of fish is a little smaller than other comparably-priced tacos in town. California Burrito is just about $6, which is decent pricing for a massive portion. Three-piece rolled tacos are extra crispy- a bit too fried, actually. The upcharge for adding guac gets you a ton, though. Too bad it isn't fresh, seemed to be a premade mix which is tragic for a Mexican restaurant.

Service was friendly. Outdated tube TV in the dining room. Lots of seating, including on the porch. Entrance is weirdly placed, go all around the patio by the Marie Callendar's entrance."}
{"text":"Similar to Robertos, but I think the food is better is. They have the traditional taco shop staples on their menu: tacos, burritos, rolled tacos, etc. 

They serve deep fried crunchy tacos, which are greasy (obviously) but delicious. The soft tacos are larger than the traditional street tacos, 2-3 of those should fill you up.  I personally like the carne adobada plate- marinated beef served with choice of flour or corn tortillas. The flour tortilla is really large! It's a tasty alternative to your typical taco shop fare. 

As most tacos shops, you order at the counter and self serve salsa and pick up order at the counter when called. Available salsas are red and green as one would suspect.  

As others have mentioned, there is a drive through, although it could be time consuming as it usually takes 5-10 minutes for them to prepare your food. If others are ahead of you this might be time prohibitive. It's likely faster to order inside rather than drive-thru. I usually go on my lunch hour. From start to finish we can finish our meal on 30 minutes dining in (driving not included)."}
{"text":"Everyday for 2 months straight I came here... 
In my opinion they are just that good! 
From having pocket friendly prices, to always having fresh ingredients and being opened 24hrs. Cant get any better than that.

Id get off work at 6am and come straight here for my sausage, potatoe, chorizo and egg breakfast burrito... \"HEAVENLY\"!!! 
Then lunch would hit and then Im back for my carne asada chimichanga with enchilada sauce. Lol. The service is always on point and Id give 100 stars if possible. Ill never walk into another Robertos after coming here."}
{"text":"I am in search of a taco that is at least edible.  I ordered 2 tacos and tossed 1.5 tacos.  Not even close to a street taco in So Cal or Mexico.  And they were more than $2.50 each.  Highway robbery for a terrible taco.  People here were really friendly though.  Only reason they got a 2 and not a 1 was the people in the building."}
{"text":"This was our second visit and the first time we ordered chili rellenos one was good with cheese the second one was burnt and had no cheese. Today we ordered the rolled tacos plate and the only thing hot was the beans 
The tacos were not hot and they tasted stale 10 minutes after we left there my husband got so sick that he threw up. :-(  I fortunately did not order any thing this time because I did not feel confident in their food handling.  I  tasted enough from his plate that I only got nauseous."}
{"text":"My biggest complaint about this place is a lack of consistency with the beans. The beans will either be bland, too salty, or once, entirely inedible due to a soapy taste. 

I coke here frequently enough, I like the food, service is fast and decent. I wish I could count on the beans, they're my favorite. I'd be too scared to order a bean burrito from here."}
{"text":"I guess, judging by all the other reviews, that I was a little late to get the decent tasting food. To be fair it was only like 2:30. There should have been some left.

This was gross. Not to be all rude about it, but bad food is bad food. And, baby, this was HORRIBLE.

So, I ordered the #1, which was four rolled tacos stuffed with shredded beef topped with guac and then cheese along with rice and beans. How you can mess this up is beyond me, but I'm about to tell you.

First, please don't spread the guacamole all over the tacos like it's a sauce. It is not. It's a side. Then, don't even think about putting shredded cheese on top of the guacamole like the picture illustrates on your drive-up menu board. I will gag.

I thought I was fixing the problem until I bit into the first rolled taco. What's another word for 'where in the heck is the moisture in this taco?' Oh, that's right, DRY. If you deep fry something and then stick meat with no moisture into that, it will be no wonder that I feel as though I've been driving down a freeway going 80 with my mouth wide open. That's pretty dry, FYI. Also, covering it up with guacamole may help, but what a scam. By the way, the guac was the only decent thing going on here.

Please tell me how you can mess refried beans up. No, honestly, I had no idea there was another way other than scorching them to death. These were so heavy and filled with more cheese (they apparently love their cheese here) that I couldn't even eat them. They didn't even taste like beans. Please take 'mexican' out of your name. I'm embarrassed. The rice was the same thing. Just heavy, not light. Weird.

I can't do this place ever again, I wish  I'd just kept driving past it day after day. Foul."}
{"text":"I hate to simplify things...but it's basically Roberto's with Mexican Coke."}
{"text":"I moved to Henderson about a year ago and was looking for a good Mexican take out. Most recommended Robertos, but I wasn't very impressed. I discovered this place and really like it. Food is good, service is fast and the staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"Had terrible food poisoning from my dinner last night from here. I had the crispy tacos and 1 chicken taco. Everything seemed ok, but there was a weird taste in the rice and beans. Didn't finish them. Will not be returning and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Their corn tortillas are old and too chewy to eat. The refried beans looked old too. I ended eating my chicken fajitas alone the entire meal. I didn't want to wait for new ones since they took too long to bring out the food in the first place. Will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you're going to have a Mexican restaurant make sure at least one of your employees can speak English... Rude male cashier as well. Also your tip jar is spelled incorrectly so that's probably why you don't have any tips."}
{"text":"I love their chicken tacos! Especially on Tuesday because they're so cheap. You will see me here every Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Yar, Roberto's be a chain restaurant specializing in Mexican delicacies.  They usually look the part: bare walls and unimaginative fixtures.  They're strangely similar to prison chow halls.

This one seems to be upgraded for the area it's in.  Southwestern colors on the walls, tables and chairs that aren't bolted to each other, and an overall aura straight out of the Qdoba playbook.  Staff ability is limited in the English department, but they make a damn good carne asada burrito and rolled tacos topped with guac and cheese.

I want that in my mouth all the time.  Period."}
{"text":"I hate cold food when it's suppose to be hot. We placed a pick up order and they messed it up from the get go. I asked for sour cream on the side and not on the food itself. When my wife arrived home with the food and found out there was sour cream all over the nachos and worst part is that the sour cream isn't soft it's like a bit  hard in texture. And the food was really cold. What in the heck?? To top it off she didn't get the drink order I also placed while putting my order for food. Apparently she cannot take drink orders until time of pick up. That just boils my bubble and will never consider going back. I just wasted money on food that is not edible, cold and not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"The nachos are BOMB!!! Very clean restaurant too which is great compared to some of these nasty fast food Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place is here. Similar to Roberto's. Everything is always hot fresh and great tasting."}
{"text":"I wish zero stars were an option!! I'm only writing this review to warn potential diners of the horrible service and mediocre at best food. I drove thru the lady ''maribel'' was rude as possible I ordered two combos one rolled tacos BEEF with extra cheese and guacamole on the side. When I got my food she gave me one of each little salsa and I double checked by asking her that my rolled tacos were indeed beef not chicken. Then I had to ask for my side of guacamole again which she made obvious was a real hassle for her. Get home chicken rolled tacos with barley any cheese. Don't waste your time and money Maria's taco shop is right across the street."}
{"text":"Not open during the poster operating hours. I have had this issue many times with this location closing early especially on the weekend!"}
{"text":"The food is ok... Sad got home they didn't put the salsa in my bag they act like salsa is gold at this place"}
{"text":"idc what anyone says, these guys have the best quality don tortaco, it beats roberto's by far. but this location specifically is the beat don tortaco. especially if you go there past midnight. the late night worker there is the best. he cares about the job and makes every meal how it should be. everything done neatly. the graveyard worker there has to be the best employee there."}
{"text":"I just went there for dinner on a Sunday night at 6 pm and had the Chile Verde plate. I saw the cook microwave the chile verde and it was room temperature when I ate it in the restaurant. 30 percent of the pork chunks were all pieces of fat too. I ate about one third of my plate and had to stop. I went to wash my hands in the bathroom and then discovered there were no towels left to dry my hands. Worst Mexican meal I have ever had in my 40+ years.

The last time I went here I said I would not return. I am saying it again and hopefully do not forget."}
{"text":"The food is actually very good however a woman named Maria isnt the most helpful. She isn't friendly or kind. Just rude."}
{"text":"I can't give this location ZERO stars!! I really should have looked at the Yelp reviews before going, but I was craving a burrito and didn't wanna drive to Pepe's (my mistake). It started when I asked if I could add rice to my burrito, the cashier said No. I thought that was odd but oh well. I asked that no guacamole be placed on my burrito. My order was placed on the counter without them telling me it was there. I had to ask for my drink cup, and low and behold......guacamole on the burrito!! BYE DON TORTACO  NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"This will be My First And Last Time ordering in this place! 
I ordered a Bean/ Cheese Burrito over the phone.When I took a bite,I heard a crack sound and I got scared! Thought I broke my tooth! I checked my food and found a Rock!!! 
I went back to show them the Burrito w the Rock in it!!! And the employee with a Broken English had the nerve to ask me if I want another Burrito? Seriously??? I turned around and left as fast as I can!!! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Was a bit hesitant to try since the reviews were inconsistent. Glad I gave this place a try today. Went through drive thru today at off peak time and was pleasantly surprised by the service and the food was great. I did wait a bit for the food but I don't have a problem with that since it let's me know that they made my food fresh. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"People writing reviews about this restaurant not having the most proper of presentations and the allure of fine dining can go ahead and get their heads out of their asses now. This Roberto ' s (let's face it Don Tortaco is a silly name) is one of the cleanest and better maintained of the chains. 

People who give this place 2 stars and below because of how loud the place was or how poorly the cashier understood their English are obviously oblivious to the fact that they are not at the Aria's Sage. Don't expect a server that explains your every meal and pairs your horchata with a certain type of meat, that's not what they are, that's not their appeal. Their target demographic is wasted partygoers who cannot function well enough to eat with cutlery and a napkin on their collar. Their goal is to offer food to those at home who can't think of anything to eat and that goes out on a whim (wearing probably  shorts, slippers, a baseball cap, a shirt from target, and a pair of sunglasses) just because greasy fatty food is better than a serving of microwaved leftovers which 's nutritional value has probably long hit the road.


tldr: Kathy P got pissed off about the sound of the COOK chopping FOOD in the KITCHEN, and I had to write a positive and insightful review to counteract her overdramatic and over exaggeration of the negatives of this restaurant.

P.S. DON'T TIP WITH CARD, THE OWNERS SNAG THOSE, WORKERS DON'T RECEIVE ANY OF IT. W T F RIGHT??


Update:
Their service has gone down drastically. I used to frequent this place but now I seldom consider it an option. One of their newest hires is the most bitter and cold-spirited persons (yes that word does exist) I've seen work anywhere in a while. 

Don't get me wrong, I would dread the job as well, but I wouldn't hold the customer at fault for providing the business required for her job to have existed in the first place. I feel like every second I spend deciding what to get as I walk into the door she gets more and more vicious looking. So menacing. 

Anyway, food quality has tanked as well. I was generous with the 4 star from my previous review, and I'll be generous yet again and put it down to 3 instead of the 2.5 I believe they deserve. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Good but not amazing.

Super cheap Mexican food that it's the spot when your budget is tight (as is ours having just bough a house), and when you need something fast but not fast food. Tired of fast food typical options my husband saw this and offered to pick it up on his way home. 6 bucks for me 4 rolled tacos with sour cream guac and cheese.. Rice and beans. The cheese made it a little too greasy but the beans were very authentic tasting. 

My husband got the asada burrito. He loved it but was bummed it cost extra to add beans and rice."}
{"text":"I have to reduce the rating cause lately they haven't been a great as in the past.  I usually order the need super nachos, which are usually loaded with a bunch of huge chunks of meat and lots of guac, cheese, sour cream, etc.  The last time I ordered them they were quick at making them, like ridiculously fast, I placed the order, paid, turned around went to the condiments counter, and less than 30 sec my order was done.  I thought awesome, special treatment for the Duke at the time. I asked and they confirmed it was my order, so cool.  Went back to work, opened it up, and noticed that they it wasn't my order.  It had all these extra ingredients that it usually didn't come with it, it was very soggy, cold, and had very little meat. I only ate what I could manage to eat and tossed the rest. Yeah it sounds like they gave me an order of beef super nachos that no one else wanted and was sitting around before I came there.  Come on.

Other times I've seen their condiments area not filled and their limes always seem old.  Another time their tacos were burned and meat was completed dry.  But their California burrito was good, only place I've good for California burritos.

They still make pretty good Mexican food for cheap and I always still go here so I'm still a fan but service and quality has just got a little down lately."}
{"text":"Took forever to get our food while it was slow at the time we ordered. Had to wait even longer to get remainder of the order which they even forgot to give us the tortillas. Restroom was completely trashed and filthy enough it couldn't be used. Will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Of all the Mexican food I've had, this is one of the worst! The food is tasteless and is not fresh at all. The service was slow, the restaurant was dirty and the salsa bar was sad. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Pros: staff is really friendly and usually pretty helpful

Cons: food is inconsistent is always very good in flavor but the quality and quantity depends on who's working"}
{"text":"I am a bit disappointed. This location isn't as decorative as the Don Tortaco at Eastern and Warm Spring.  I also had their version of beef nachos, very small in comparison to what i usually get at Roberto's i just hope the ones at Eastern and Warm Spring is better. Their carrot sides were also very salty.

They were quick and friendly, and a have a good menu at cheaper prices. Also anything open 24 hours is a good thing."}
{"text":"Staff friendly.  Dining area comfortable.  Ordered 2 beef enchiladas.  They had very little beef and a whole lot of vegetables.  

Had to eat out of styrofoam with plastic utensils.  

Too bad this was unpleasureable. Live right down the street. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Literally, across the street from my living domain. I won't lie, the only time I come here is to fulfill late-night drunk munchies or to grab something to help cure a hangover the next morning. I either go for the carne asana friends or carne asana tacos- boy does it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Went to because of the drive thru the food is not really good at all I would have been better to drive across the street to Del Taco they are no comparison to Roberto's I would rather pay a little more to have better food I will not recommend going to this place all the food taste Bland the hard shell tacos almost broke my teeth the taquitos was soggy asada fries are no good at all everything I ordered was not good"}
{"text":"Most tasteless place on earth!!!!  it's like eating air a disgrace to the Hispanic community horrible food. If you like this place you clearly have no taste buds."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat fast food Mexican at, hands down. You haven't lived till you've tried their carnitas fries! Great food, awesome service, and the good atmosphere is a plus. Also dig the fact that they're 24/7."}
{"text":"I love the carne asada fries, chose those instead of a burrito. Im glad i did!
Gotta love the horchata free refills, the cinnamon and strawberry churros which were cooked after request. To add to that, the prices are muy bueno, and its open 24/7. 
Talked to a few people there and they preferred it over Roberto's. I agree 100%.
They're pretty amazing. Nobody can complain that its too late to get some good food! 
With those reasonable prices and nice portions, ill be back"}
{"text":"Yum!  Authentic greasy Mexican joint when I'm looking for a guilty pleasure.  We've  been to these types of Mexican places in CA, Tucson and now here in lv and this place is right up there with the others n its close to my place. Score.  The burritos are big my favorite is carne asada as well as care asada tacos which are packed with pico De gallo n guacamole, they are pretty big also.  Fast service and polite ppl."}
{"text":"Disappointed to order carne asada nachos to get home with no carne asada. I'm not sure how it happened when there were six people working and I was the only customer!  This location is the same distance as the one on rainbow so that's where I'll be going from now on."}
{"text":"I gave this place three stars because they have a drive-thru and it is convenient. Normally, the food is fine. My average rating is due to the cashier. She is friendly at times, but she just won't bend. Every single time I come here, I ask if they can please just make me a Mulita. It is just a carne asada quesadilla with corn instead of flour tortillas. She refuses. I even begged her to just swap out the flour for corn in case she didn't understand and she said she wouldn't do it. I don't understand why such a small, easy accommodation can't be made for a paying guest when there is really zero extra effort involved. I'm not trying to be difficult; I am just allergic to wheat flour. Roberto's has no issue with this. I just like not having to get out of my car. I feel like this lady should be given some form of customer service training."}
{"text":"Unfortunately due to missing my Tamales ; my feelings were hurt, lol. Seriously though I wish I could have tasted it it sounded so bomb. Although the food was good ...  Guess I'll be back to pick Tamales up also to try their tacos.  Also no jalapeño s.. sad face. Spice lover over here. The cashier was patient and kind."}
{"text":"Woohoo another Don Tortaco on my regular route, located in the same shopping center as Bank of America and Wal-Mart neighborhood market by Bermuda and Silverado Ranch.  I've been waiting for this location to open for awhile, now that it's open I should be here more often. LOL

Grand opening special $3.99 for either their grilled steak or grilled chicken plate which comes with beans and rice, dirt cheap. Best part is that I don't have to wait for midnight, when Coronado Cafe at South Point offers their cheap steak and egg special, Don Tortaco is 24/7 and right around the corner from South Point.  I'm hoping this location keeps this $3.99 special up for a few months just like the other locations did, it's usually $6 and some change. 

If you check out their website they offer some good coupons. http://www.dontortaco.com/dontortaco/DontortacoLocations.html

Dinner time."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever. Greasy, no taste, just plain awful. I think I would rather eat Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Surprisingly really good. I liked the nachos I got the most and it all tasted fresh and it was made relatively quick. Excellent service as well. I had a hard time deciding but they were patient with me"}
{"text":"Used to cater graduation party and was blown away by the generous portions, high quality of meat and over the top accompaniments provided.  Outstanding value!  Will use for future events."}
{"text":"Its Robertos... basically.... its ok...i usually go here when i am weak..... i usually regret my decision a few minutes after eating"}
{"text":"Pretty chill.  Dudes actually cooking my Carne asada fries right in front of me.  Nice... 
SALSA IS A Bit MESSY.  But for the price all is well.  Good shit don  tor."}
{"text":"25 minutes for a luke warm Bean and Cheese burrito and 3 mediocre Chicken Taquitos? The place was not busy at all. The Rainbow / Cheyenne store is way better. The cashier dude took forever to take the ladies order in front of me as well as mine. No hustle in the kitchen at all! This place blows."}
{"text":"Love the food but the Cashier named Oscar....needs a little work  standing in line giving my order for at least 10mins. I usually come late at night (2-3am) when i get off work and it's excellent service but lunch hours are the worse."}
{"text":"I've recently been coming here because of the convenience of the drive thru and since Robertos just jacked their prices up. The food is usually good and the staff is real nice. Today as I drove thru I asked the womam working the window if she could please give me pickled carrots along with my salsa, she stated that I would have to get my own carrots. She could only give me salsa. I stated that its never been an issue before. She refused again. This defeats the entire drive thru concept. The salsa bar is literally five feet away and I was the only customer! I thought her actions were lazy and unsatisfactory. Please train on customer service."}
{"text":"5:10 pm the cashier messed my friends order up 5 times and gave us another customers food.   To go items wasn't made Togo orders weren't made. And the rolled tacos had toothpicks rolled up in them.  Not poking through the side. Very hazardous."}
{"text":"When is this place open!? Lol i went by tonight because it said open till midnight but it looked closed."}
{"text":"Well, I'm not sure what happened, but Don Tortaco used to be Roberto's . The menu and food are exactly the same, so it was only a name change. Another Roberto's opened up across the street by Home Depot shortly after the switch, so go figure. Nonetheless, Don Tortaco (btw.. I'm still trying to figure out what a Tortaco is and how can I order one!) is still pumping out really good cheap Mexican food. It puts me in the mindset of Taco De Mexico in Oxnard which is truly a great So Cal Mexican spot.
        I can't honestly say I have had one bad thing on the menu. This is one of my faves for sure. The asada burrito is a must just ask for rice and beans inside because unlike California Mexican joints it doesn't come standard. They kinda give you a funny look when you ask for rice, beans, and pico de gallo inside the burrito ( almost like they are saying... \"You sure about this?\")
         Some other faves of mine are the enchilada plate, California burrito, & asada fries. Tortaco's enchiladas are awesome! The red sauce makes it happen. Whether you go chicken, cheese, beef or whatever ... you will not be disappointed. The California burrito is a more recent discovery of mine that I kept overlooking on the menu for a few years until my curiosity finally got the best of me. This burrito includes asada, a good amount of pico de gallo, and fries .... Yes..... I said fries! It's really good, however I'm  still not sure why they call it a California burrito. Lastly, the asada fries are a complete juggernaut! The fries are drowned in tasty asada meat, pico de gallo, and cheddar cheese. The portion size is generous, definitely something you may want to share with someone. Parking, customer service, and prices are all good at Don Tortaco. Btw... they are open 24 hrs-so go get your Tortaco on!"}
{"text":"Less than one star! This review is to compare this location to other Don Tortaco locations. I asked for a chorizo breakfast burrito with cheese, potato and egg, but when I opened it everything was missing except grease, egg, and meat even though I paid for everything else. The  meat tasted EXPIRED and the tortilla had been left open to air so it it was dry and crumbled. On top of being served an inedible burrito the lady taking my order was incredibly rude and very slow. When my order was made she took forever to hand it out to me because she was on her phone instead of doing her job. I've never had an experience like this at the other Don Tortacos I've been too, but because of this I won't ever be going back!"}
{"text":"Drive by this place daily and decided it was finally time to give it a try. 

They offer about 5 lunch specials, I went with the beef Sopes. 
Two beef Sopes served with rice & beans and a soda for about $7. 

The beef was shredded beef, some still in tender chunks that was very flavorful. It was on top of a sope then topped with lettuce, tomato, cheese & sour cream. The only drawback was the sope was very tough, you couldn't cut it with the plastic knives they have... 

The beans and rice were typical. Everything tasted very fresh and the portion was so large that I had to take some home. 

If you're looking for a quick fix on Mexican food, this place will have the cure!"}
{"text":"Came here by my daughter's friends recommendation.  The tacos were good but the shells were too crispy to the point of being hard.  They tasted good though.  The bean and cheese burrito was REALLY good though!  The taquitos were good as well."}
{"text":"The girl that works there at 1am is extremely rude. We told her that she messed up our order and she said she didn't care. That we didn't order right. Ummm excuse me, I'm Mexican... How can we mess up the order?! No, you didn't understand the order!! And you didn't care. Talking so much shit inside to the cook. I called the manager and he was no better. His name is Apolinar Ibarra. He said he didn't care if the customer wasn't happy. 
If that's what you want when you order, eat there! We will never eat here again and I told a lot of people already and they said they would never eat there again. The owner said he didn't care about that either"}
{"text":"Huge letdown. Nice staff, but the food is terrible. I took my first bite of a taco and immediately rushed to the counter to buy a Gatorade to wash it down. Tried to finish it as I didnt want to waste my money, but those tacos are just not good. Maybe there are other good things on the menu, but my stomach deserves better than this."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing price and the service is awesome I love this place people here are so nice and the best Mexican food ever everyone should eat here I'm not joking it's incredible"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick fix of Mexican food. Can't say it's the best or the worst but it's cheap, close, and satisfies my hunger! 

The portions for carne asada fries big and it's only $8. The adobado & carnitas plates are also descent. I'd stay away from the rolled tacos and tamales as they weren't that great. 

Just remember, this place isn't world class dining...it's just fast and cheap!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time because it was open 24 /7. But the last two times I went, I have decided I won't be back because my burrito was so wet and watery that it totally soaked through the wrapping and dribbled all over the place. I do believe they have a different staff who works there at night than before. Someone needs to show them how not to make a burrito not so watery and to drain the ingredients . It's a shame because it was a great place to stop at at 3 a.m. on my way home from a late night. Prices are reasonable and service was always very fast."}
{"text":"We love this place, but we always order the same thing, the carne asada nachos. We go there for their breakfast burritos too. They are so big they could fee two women, but a man would probably eat the whole thing alone. I see a lot of mixed reviews, it must depend on who is working when you go there. Luckily, we've never had a bad experience. Sometimes a little wait, but if you compare it to Chik-filet, it's nothing!"}
{"text":"Their Carnitas burrito with rice and cheese or some Pico De Gayo is my jam. Don tortaco in Silverado Ranch shopping center is right near my house and they're open 24 hours a day which is kind of cool but it seems like in the middle of the night they don't stay very busy but apparently they stay busy enough to stay open 24 hours a day so that's good enough. The workers are not very good at speaking English so be patient and articulate so they can understand what's going on, that is if you're committed to getting exactly what you want and what you ordered."}
{"text":"The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't that flavorful either.  I ordered carne asada nachos and they were just meh."}
{"text":"Not so great first impression from this joint. My boyfriend ordered a carne asada burrito with meat, cheese, beans, and rice only. Of course, we get all the way home and it has onions and guacamole on it. He's pretty fortunate that I tried a bite of it first, since he's allergic to onions! So we took it back to them and they acted as if they expected it to be wrong. It was really kind of weird. Got a refund and went to Faustos instead."}
{"text":"Chips- yes
Guacamole- no way- no flavor
Rolled tacos-yes- crispy and yummy
Beans-no way- taste like they are straight out of a can
Chile relleno-no- barely any cheese and a ton of seeds
Carne Assad fries- lacking flavor- fries are good"}
{"text":"So, I tried it once and was not very satisfied. The beans were cold on my Asada  Burrito. So instead of just writing them off I decided to give them another try. The second time I  ordered the Chicken nachos and I was impressed with how fast my order was ready but again my food was cold. The cheese was not even slightly melted and the beans were barely luke warm. I won't waste my time or money for a third try."}
{"text":"I'm personally not a fan on the food, just not enough flavor for me. The only positive of this chain is the quickest of getting the food. This location directly does not have the best customer skills. 

 Stay away from the guacamole!"}
{"text":"I was entering the restaurant and held the door open for a lady that worked there as she was bringing in the trashcan after disposing of the trash.  We ordered our food and afterwards we watched the same lady put trash bags on the existing trashcans in the kitchen.  I expected her to wash her hands but instead she put gloves on and started cooking the food.  We left in amazement because the lady taking our order had a tag on that displayed the Clark County Health District.  I thought wow now I can't eat that.  Fail for Don Tortaco and The Clark County Health District.  Obviously these employees didn't learn a thing."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite before going to work. I was in a rush so I called the order in and they had it ready in 10 minutes! AWESOME! I ordered the ham breakfast burrito and added jalapeños to it. I've had breakfast burritos from other places and this has to be the best one. Not sure if it was just because I added jalapeños, but the flavor was on point! It had eggs, ham, potatoes, and CHEESE. And of course the jalapeños I added. Super super yummy. I love spicy so it was perfect but if you don't like spicy don't add the jalapeños. 

My husband ordered an adobada burrito and he loved it! Said it had lots of great flavor. We will definitely be back and love that it's right by our office!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up and it is awesome! I had a burrito de asada and it was super good and their horchata tasted like they actually made it there (not like those powders)."}
{"text":"For 4641 Blue Diamond Rd  #100 location. Late Night entry into Vegas lead the five of us here...bad mistake. Two employees, one on register Viridiana that seemed to not know menu items or ingredients. Other was cook and spoke no English...the food was the most unappealing mess ever... inconsistency in preparation and presentation. My sister's ordered, paid, & waited...they completely forgot to cook it. My order was Chicken Quesadilla, but all I got was a slimy cheese one. Chips and cheese was not a dip, but just chips with shredded cheese on top. My order was melted cheese, my friend's was not. Never will I return!!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Don Tortaco tonight on my way home from work. I ordered the #5 2 tacos with rice and beans. I asked for the tacos to be on a soft shell. I recently had some dental work and the hard shells are too hard to chew. The cashier confirmed that I wanted soft tacos. She gave my order to the cook. 

My order was ready quickly and I walked out the door. When I got home and opened the styrofoam box I noticed the tacos were on a hard shell. Grrrrrr! I decided just to deal with it because I was home and already in my PJ's and it's 3am. While trying to power thru the tacos, I noticed that one of them had a stick imbedded in the shell! I had to break the shell to get it out. It's a good thing I just got off work instead of just coming home from a night of drinking because I may not have noticed and I could have choked on that. It was very sharp!  I am very disappointed in the food. I will just go to Roberto's down the street instead."}
{"text":"Ok so went here tonight signs says open 24 hours then little sign on the door says closes @ 10pm.  Well 9:30pm. The doors are locked.  Had the people standing inside open the door and make me food. . Sure enough fryer was shut off.  

If you have a restaurant and signage that states that you are open then you need to honor this and give quality to every individual that walks into your establishment up to the time that you close.  I really enjoy not being able to get what I wanted.  Thank you so much and I hope you do well.  

Now time to find a different Mexican food please that honors the hours of operation."}
{"text":"This place used to be Roberto's .  It seems like alot of them got bought out and is now Don Tortaco.  We stopped by for a late night eat.  Same menu, same food, same price... new name.

Pros:
 * Asada Nachos are still killer!
 * well-kept Sauce stand... It seems like their green sauce was a bit spicier than what I remembered at Roberto's... Score!
 * I don't know if the standards at Don Tortaco are higher than Roberto's, but this location seemed to be really clean.  
 * I liked the selection of drinks.. self serve soda with Horchata and Jamaica too!
 * Lengua and Cabeza on the menu... oh yeah!!!!

Cons:
 * I stated No sour cream (even on my receipt), but low and behold, when my order came out, Escrema was present!
* No Agua De Fresca 

Verdict:
  This place is good for late night eats.  We ordered the Asada Nachos with No sour cream, but they failed and piled sour cream on it anyhow.  Nonetheless, I gave this place a 4 star because it didn't fail to satisfy my late night cravings for cheap Mexican food.  I also had to get some Lengua tacos.  2 tacos and Asada Nachos was more than enough to share amongst 2 other people. 

Tips:
 * I know Lengua doesn't sound too appetizing, but seriously you can't knock it until you try it.  It's amazing!"}
{"text":"This is flavorless Mexican food... It should be just called Don Dortaco's \"Food\"!  Tasted like nothing."}
{"text":"The food is good, not great and the prices are cheaper than Roberto's on somethings. I would have given a higher rating but every single time I have been here they have messed up my order. The first time I ordered a carne asada chimichanga and I got home to crack open a chicken one. The second time (this time) I ordered chicken rolled tacos and I got home to bite into beef rolled tacos. No matter how good the food or price, no point in going if you not getting what you ordered and paid for."}
{"text":"I am going to class that is up the street from this place and I don't finish until 9 PM.  I always drive by this place.  One night I sitting in my seat with a pain in my stomach.  I needed to eat something.  The only problem was that I wasn't in the mood for a fast food burger or I didn't want to wait a long time for some good food.  It was then, that I remembered this place was open 24 hours.  I had my mind set the last 45 minutes of class all I could think about was a burrito.  

I pulled up and decided to walk in the restaurant because I read they had a salsa bar.  When I walked in the place was pretty clean and bright.  What I noticed right away was how familiar the place looked.  I noticed the menu with the pictures of the food and even the way it was organized.  I had to go back outside to make sure I was in the right restaurant.  I had a bad case of deja vu.  Let's just say this place very closely resembles another restaurant that serve similar food and their name is Spanish for Robert.  

I ordered the Carne Asada burrito.  I saw some pictures of it on Yelp, so I was excited.  I was really hungry too. It only took a few minutes to get my burrito.  This bad boy was HUGE!  I was happy because I was really hungry.  I wanted to get home so I waited to eat it there.  When I got home I inhaled this piece of heaven wrapped in a tortilla.  to be honest it was just a regular burrito but for some reason it tasted really good.  This is place is legit.  If you are in the area then you definitely have to check Don Tortaco out.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yay! I am definitely a fan!

After waking up craving a breakfast burrito, and coming across a long ass line at Lauritas, we decided to finally check this place out. 

I opted for that breakfast burrito w/chicken(egg, potatoe, cheese, and chicken), while my friend opted for nachos with carne asada. We both were impressed with how tasty all that food was....and there was plenty! I love how they aren't cheap with the meat here....HUGE portions!

The service was friendly and the place was really clean. I don't think a long winded review is really necessary. It's a taco shop, but a really good one! I can't wait to try more items on the menu here! Being less than 5 minutes from where I live, I will be back often!


a solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Definitely a huge step up from Roberto's! Order anything with steak and you'll get something yummy! I always get the carne asada fries just because it has everything I want, but my mum always tries something different and loves every bit of it! 
Seriously, the steak, man.... ooo, it's so good! 
AND 24 hours! It's the perfect night good! 
Pricing is totally worth it for the HUGE portions and freshly cooked meat! I always have left overs for the next day.
I loveeeeee Don Tortaco in general, but this location is especially great. The staff was so sweet and catered to our wants."}
{"text":"There are literally hundreds of other taco shops to choose from in the area. Your customer service should be on point when you realize this. Giving non-Spanish-speaking customers attitude because they don't speak Spanish in this city is bullshit. You might have the best tasting Mexican food in the area but that ain't going to cut it when your attitude is like that. I literally left to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We ordered rolled tacos chicken and beef. They were pretty authentic. The restaurant is clean and good service. I think it's 24 hrs"}
{"text":"Worst carnitas fries I have ever had out of all mexican restaurants. I had out 2 huge pieces of fat in my fries and maybe on good piece of meat in half of order. I have never been more dissapointed in my life. Ridiculous. How could a cook even think to serve us such shit. I would not even serve this to my dogs. Disgusting!!! So dissapointed!!. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Food here is a down graded from Roberto's I've given it multiple tries thinking maybe I am being too hard but the truth is there food is garbage I feel like I'm paying for scraps the only good thing I can say is that they have a third party Company that makes their desserts and those are delicious. The tres leches cake is my favorite but other than that I don't recommend it at all!"}
{"text":"24 hours my butt. How are you gonna advertise your a 24 hour taco shop and lock your doors and not let people in with employees inside saying it's closed. It's 7 in the morning, breakfast time. No excuse or note saying why they're closed. Just so disappointed ?"}
{"text":"The food was ok they didn't have queso sauce they just threw some cheddar cheese on my chips, I could've done that at home. The nachos were just ok. They had too many onions and I just miss queso from Atlanta no Mexican restaurants have that in Vegas. I won't be back and I wasn't that impressed."}
{"text":"Don Tortaco is my late night addiction. That's probably why I'm currently the duchess. They are so quick and easy. I usually walk in and out in 5 mins. My go to order is chicken tacos. They currently have a special when you buy 2 you get 1 free. I cant eat all three but a taco in the morning can't be a bad thing. I also steal a lot of their green sauce. It's delicious and I use one cup on each taco and a few for my chips if i get any. Sometimes I just want to stop in and get chips and 6 sauces.. And I do. It's a weakness!! I'm a huge fan of the carne asada nachos. They are so big and delicious but I can't order them a lot. It's too much food for me and day two isn't as good. I usually order them with a group and make people get ratchet with me. Still 5 stars for being open 24hr and always being there when I need a late night meal or taco fix. Thank you Don Tortaco."}
{"text":"Love Don Tortaco! My family and I eat there at least 1-2x a week! I recommend walking in to order as their drive thru speaker is horrible and makes it hard for the employees to hear the order. The staff is super friendly and the food is great, quick & cheap! We love the carne asada nachos, bean and cheese burritos and chicken Tortas. The California burritos are soooo good, but sooooo huge!"}
{"text":"Visited the location on Warm Springs and Eastern. The food was absolutely horrible! We have been going to this location for several years and never had any issues with the food. I called and spoke with the cook and offered a refund. He passed the phone to the cashier and they informed me that the new management changed the menu and location of where they purchase the food. I informed the cashier that we will never go back if this is the new standard of quality of food."}
{"text":"It sad the food is really good, customer service is terrible. And make sure you check your bags if you order to go. Every time I have ordered from here they are always leaving out an item or two. You never really know what you are paying for because they don't give a receipt either. The food is good, but the service is so bad I will not be going back after the 6th time of not getting all my food and having to drive all the way back I give up on this place. 

I am rerating this place because the last couple of times I go in they are so helpful and friendly now maybe they have a new staff because I don't know anyone but huge improvement"}
{"text":"I went here today since I was waiting for my car to be fixed next door and I must this place is quiet and a great place for killing time. The seating area cleanliness is definitely a 5 star here. The side veggie bar was very organized, clean and well stocked. Plus, I've never seen a cleaner women's restroom at a Mexican restaurant until I visited this one. :) I ordered my usual Carne asada fries today and I'm not sure if they are using a different type of beef than the other locations, but this one was very tender beef which was just amazing with everything else on my plate! I should also mention this place seems to focus more on their drive-thru customers, but still my order came out in 5 minutes tops for in dining."}
{"text":"We really liked going to Don Tortaco for the tamales, but no more the tamales lately have been all meal and very little meat.  The sauce was okay.  I always like to get the chille relleno, but it always hit and miss.  Sometimes it is good and other times it is terrible.  The one I ordered today was okay.

It is a good place. To go late at night if you are looking for something quick to eat."}
{"text":"Just had a burrito at don tortacos and the employee told me he didn't have time to cut the burrito in half for my friend and I. Luckily they had plastic knives and I spent the 2 seconds required to cut the damn burrito. Unfortunately, I had already tipped him."}
{"text":"If you like spicy food, you should try their camarones al diablo.  The portions are pretty big.  I can always make two giant burritos out of this meal.  Sooooo good.  I go there often."}
{"text":"More than disappointed in this place. We finally broke down and tried this place over Faustos, and I will not be back again. The food was lacking in flavor, the hot sauce was hot, but had no flavor, just heat. I was more than let down."}
{"text":"I am 48 years old and have been to restaurants all over the USA, and until last week have never been in any kind of restaurant that does not offer you a free cup of water with your meal. But now I have.

I bought a couple of tacos and asked for a cup of water with it. I was told \"Sorry.. we only sell bottled water. We don't give free water cups to our customers\"

Needless to say, I will not be going back. I can afford a bottle of water, but it's the principle of the matter.. we have decent drinking water in Las Vegas. No reason to buy a bottled water."}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite place to go. We see the same cashier and same cooks, they are always very nice and have our orders correct. The salsa bar is always stocked and the front areas are neat and clean. Never disappointed with this Don Tortaco location and only go to the one on Craig/MLK."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life the staff unfriendly tonight nobody in there to eat all I wanted was a chicken taco in a chicken enchilada enchilada was cold Taco was crappy service suck Loretta's is just down the street the food was terrible I will never ever go back !!!!!"}
{"text":"It is very frustrating to be leaving such a bad review.  However, I had a terrible experience here. The two times I have come here I have waited for 30+ min for my food.  The lady at the counter will let the food sit on the counter for a good 5-10 min calling you or making any attempts to let you know your food is ready.  Watch out for the grumpy, heavy set cashier lady .  She is very unpleasant.  There is a Don Tortaco down the road.  It's worth an extra couple min drive.  You will still get home 10-25 min earlier"}
{"text":"First time coming here. Place wide open alot sitting the manu is very similar to Roberto manu. I ordered the chicken tostadas. I asked cashier what came on the tostadas, and they didnt quiet have all the real ingredients for a real Mexican tostada. I was being optimistic and went ahead and ordered it. It was very plain not much flavor and I asked if I can get rice on the side and I got beans instead... the price was reasonable not bad the service is very good, the music playing was truly mexican. Likes it alot  had me on Memory Lane of my childhood lol.  they had
 (Ficente Fernandez) back to back. Overall I Don't know if ill try it again...  probably won't come back."}
{"text":"All I ever eat is the Carne Asada Fries.  Every time I go near Don Tortaco I crave them like crazy.  The horchata is always a delight and I have no complaints.  I could say I will branch out to try a new plate in the future but I think a better idea is to rename the store Carne Asada Fries.  It's hard to see in the picture but there is guacamole and sour cream as well."}
{"text":"Great mexican fast food & Friendly staff. Similar to robertos but betterrrrr & better quality in my opinion. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious and open 24/7. This place is legit!

*They have a salsa bar with unlimited red sauce, green sauce, cucumbers, the carrot mix and limes. 

*They speak English 

*It's clean and beautifully decorated inside 

*If you are a rolled taco person they roll them and cook them fresh to order chicken or beef. 

So far my favorite is the Carne Asada burrito, but since I don't want to look like a double wide trailer I've only had it's goodness once. My lifestyle is low carb so I get the grilled steak platter with no rice or tortillas. It comes with beans and a side salad with fresh avocado and a tomato slice for $3.99. I'm completely satisfied. 

Everything I have tried has been pretty damn good. I just wish they offered the free warm chips like the place before."}
{"text":"Great food, great selection, and very authentic.  I will definitely frequent this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad. It's under new management and owners. Fresh food and goes head to head with Laurita's. I'll give more details but they are open for business."}
{"text":"Big and good breakfast burrito for 3.00 before 11 am everyday. 

Haven't had anything else there. Just breakfast only."}
{"text":"1st time at this location yesterday am... should've turned around as we approached the door(dirty windows) anyway, 2 women..one took orders, older lady, and one cooked in her mid 40's. Ordered simple and received  food that had pieces of burnt scrapings.... didn't even look appetizing. I expressed my concerns and the older woman says \"you didn't tell me you wanted cook differently\"??? Wth??? I came into the establishment to eat and in hopes my food will look like the picture but NOT! Took a picture and threw $20 worth of food. These women were just laughing at me but the joke is on you. the 1 rating is far too nice should've been a negative 1."}
{"text":"One star for cleanliness, two for the $1 off digital coupon and three for it being 24/7. Minus one because the meat was fatty and somehow over cooked so that chewy toughness was in every bite. Paid for sour cream and guacamole that seemed to become a blended liquid-like sauce instead of beautiful white and green cream. But what I hate is when a 24/7 establishment leaves one guy to cook and run the register and I have to wait 10 minutes to order."}
{"text":"It was good, but not great. We got chicken tacos, and a carne asada torta. The chicken was dry but everything that came on the taco made it better."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have eaten here a few times. Now so thought I should write a review. The place is nice and clean and has a decent salsa bar. We have taken our food to go both times and I appreciate that you can pack up your little containers of salsa and limes in plastic baggies so you don't have a big mess by the time you get the food home. They also do a nice job wrapping the tortillas up so that they are still warm when you eat. 

Now onto the food. Not being a fan of Roberto's I was hesitant to try this place but was pleasantly surprised with the carne asada plate I had the first time. The meat was tender and flavorful. The rice and beans are decent, they just need a pinch of salt and a dab of salsa and they are a good side .  The only thing I didn't like was the massively ginormous flour tortilla that came with it. I thought it would be 2 smaller more manageable ones to roll and wrap.  I ended up tearing it into smaller pieces and was good to go. 

This last visit I ordered the pork carnitas plate and had the corn tortillas. Again nice tender meat and the tortillas were very fresh tasting. Hubby had the adobada plate which was amazingly delicious. I know what I will be ordering next visit. Very seasoned flavorful meat, guessing it is pork. At any rate when we are in the mood for fast Mexican food this place hits the spot."}
{"text":"I am really surprised at the poor ratings for this place.  I was in the mood for some meat one morning for work and I stopped by for a machaca burrito (egg and shredded beef) and some rice.  The rice is perfectly fluffy and so tasty.  The burrito was so good because of their flour tortilla and unlike your chain spots, it is not stuffed with a lot of carb fillers (rice, potatoes, etc).  It was meat, egg, and cheese.  Perfect and so delicious.  It's also good sized - I had half for breakfast and half for lunch.  Last night I went again and got the cheese enchilada/chile relleno combo and my daughter got the rolled tacos with guac.  The rolled tacos were SO good I had to keep myself from having more than a bite and forcing her to eat cereal for dinner.  They weren't all tortilla and little meat like some places.  They also weren't so hard you'd break a tooth unlike some places.  My plate was good - my only complaint was that I don't care for beans and asked for no beans, all rice, and they messed that up.  This place is now my favorite taqueria and I will go out of my way to go there even though I probably pass three other ones on my way there."}
{"text":"My BF loves this place. They are open 24hrs. Always the same quality. Generous portions and friendly service. If you desire to have something prepared different they are happy to do it and it's just as quick. I only gave them 4 stars due to health issues. I've witnessed peeping with nail polish on and pouring cucumbers into a bucket with bracketed dangling in. Cell phones being used in the kitchen too.  Hand washing not following a text. Enough hot sauce and you're probably fine. Lol."}
{"text":"Food was okay, service VERY slow. Staff joked around s lot, and spoke about customers in Spanish; not about me but others. I speak Spanish, but still--not very professional, especially at the expense of wait time when folks are hungry. Salsa bar in disarray, and not during peak hours. Restrooms could use some attention."}
{"text":"I recently went to don tortaco this past weekend and I can honestly say that this is by far one of the most disgusting places I've ever ate at. It is not a good representation of Mexican food in anyway. The food was reheated, refried. The food tasted old and flavorless and you could taste a hint of residual flavor from the oil salsas were watered-down as well. The best thing I had  was a fountain drink, everything else is was garbage. For all you people who want quality Mexican food I recommend you go to taco y taco. it's all fresh and cook in front of you and it taste pretty good. but as far as this place goes I would just avoid it I'd rather eat Taco Bell and to go back to this fucking place again."}
{"text":"Visited Wed. afternoon 1st time.  After ordering noticied employee finishing her break, but not coming back and clearing tables, which almost all were dirty, and it didnt happen before we left.  Ordered beef tacos only,but 1 came with chicken, not sure how that happens.  Taco shell went from chewy to hard, and meat had burnt pcs. in it.  I think they prepare stuff once in the am and dont make any effort to keep it fresh.  It was tasteless.  Rootbeer was watered down.  The constant loud mexican music and background talk, tells us they prefer hispanic customers.  Never again."}
{"text":"Maybe I got something terrible last time, but I'm upgrading Roberto's to 3 stars since I've had a few more things here.

The chorizo burrito, shrimp burrito were fine. The chicken burrito was very meh; standard line chicken, no flavoring. A chicken burrito was \"just lunch\" if you get my drift. IF YOU'RE PICKIN' UP WHAT IM PUTTIN' DOWN, 'NA MEAN?

The chorizo burrito and shrimp burrito I enjoyed. Maybe it's because I had some hot sauce. I don't know. My toilet also liked the burritos, but then again, what doesn't make me shit these days? I'm getting old. Or getting Crohn's disease. Mexican food makes a toilet holocaust. Burritos from a 24 hour taco shop makes for bathroom salsa. I could go on.

Overall: Solid, quick, cheap, tasty enough for the price, solid B."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve a star at all I ordered a carne asada burrito but minus the guacamole and rice and the lady had no idea what I was saying very rude about it and she said we don't make that burrito but I've been going there for a long time so I think they should hire people that know what there doing -very poor service"}
{"text":"Customer service it's  horrible, I asked about the chicken burrito what's in it and the lady who works  in there with the short hair was upset she doesn't want to explain she keep saying what, what and say the menu is  over there, not professional at all"}
{"text":"Decent food, I mainly order the carne asada nachos because there so tasty. This place is a good place to go when your looking for a quick bite to eat, but there's really nothing fancy about the food or the place itself."}
{"text":"Dont even know where to start, going through the drive thru we had horrible customer service no hello or thank you when ordering or giving the total and on top of that the wait just to order the food and they had no other cars pulling up to the window the cashier was still rude gave us our food and once and no thank you was in such a rush couldnt ask if we need anything else which we did she didnt put napkins nor forks for something that would need it i was very upset with the customer service there. We spoke up and she said it was her first day so if that's so she should get a better trainer. Sorry but never will i go back"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a minute already and the fact that today Im been very upset with the service they gave me today the fact that two girls come in after me and my husband got skipped with our food and they oreded the same thing just because your staff couldnt pay attention and on top of it we dont have a complete meal we paid extra for a meal and all we get is a dam burrito no rice no beans all i have to say is ill never back cause it was the worse service ever very disappointed"}
{"text":"This location on Horizon is amazing! Always clean, great service, food is great!
Also the masa for their tamales is spot on, which is very hard to find."}
{"text":"Terrible place. I went there because their other restaurant on Tropicana at one point was descent. However, this morning around 7:30 a.m. I got served the worse breakfast burrito ever. It was drenched in oil, so much so that I took one bite and threw the rest away (please see attached picture). DO NOT COME TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT UNLESS YOU LIKE SOGGY OIL SOAKED BURRITOS!!"}
{"text":"Horrible!  Starting with the drive through \"service\", this place was bad!  The Lady in the drive-through speaker spoke so fast I couldn't understand what she was saying. And the kid at the window seem to have no clue as to what I was saying. We were charged an extra $.92 or sour cream which I think should have come with the meal.  There was also a tip jar hanging out the drive through window  I have never seen that at a drive-through before except maybe Starbucks.  But that's coffee not food   Taco Bell Burger King Wendy's McDonald's or panda express etc. don't have tip jars hanging out there drive-through window.  We live three minutes away and when we got home the food was barely warm. The quesadillas were so greasy they were not edible.  Over all the food lacked flavor and substance. There was barely any chicken in our chicken enchiladas. We didn't even bother to finish it.  Later all three of us were in the bathroom half the night with terrible stomach aches. Highly do not recommend and will never eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is way better than Roberto's - There food is more authentic and they cook real meat compare to Roberto's which I never recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The only way this place could get better is with a drive thru! Standard Don Tortaco/Robertos food. Greasy, cheesy, fattening goodness. They girl up front even remembers our usual order. Maybe we go their too often... It is clean, fresh, yummy, friendly, cheap. What could be better?"}
{"text":"Love that they moved for this corner with drive trough. My favorite food there is taco salad. I just got one today. They don't show on menu, but you may ask for it."}
{"text":"I just love to hate this place, every time my order comes out wrong lol. But the food is decent."}
{"text":"Don Tortaco is in my neighborhood so stopped in to get the tacos #1 and the burrito #6. The food here is good. The burrito is large with a lot of meat.  Like some of the other reviews it is the customer service that needs help. The lack of customer service. I am going to repeat another reviewer \"The people that take your order are always in a bad mood and they appear as if taking your order is a favor they are doing you.\" Pay attention Don Tortaco and improve your customer service skills."}
{"text":"Food was better than expected! Most restaurant tamales are dry, but these are amazing! Also the chimichanga was amazing and huge! Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Last resource for fast food, but did not deliver, 3 stars for costumer service 0 food."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place, down the street from my house and authentic Mexican dishes. The inside is nicer than most street taco places or hole in the wall Mexican restaurants. Seems like it might be under new management which has pushed me to write the review, the changes show and I am impressed. Food has always been made well and flavorful. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars is their salsa bar is always out of limes.. What's Mexican food with limes ;)"}
{"text":"Finally got to trying this place. I usually frequent Fausto's but I got a mailer for this and decided to try it. I was pleasantly surprised. The food is great. The place is super clean. And the beans... amazing."}
{"text":"I waited 10 mins for my food. I got home which is right down the street. My enchilada was ice cold and my cheese was not melted."}
{"text":"I found a rubber band in my burrito and my husband and son ordered burritos and they were cold, cheese was not melted."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly staff, huge portions. Not the best Mexican food i've had but it hits the spot when i've got the craving. I always tell myself that I'm only going to eat half of what I get and save the rest for another meal. It never works. I always stuff my face till it's all gone. That stuff is addictive."}
{"text":"This is not real Mexican food. The menu is only for American people. 

1) Chimichangas, burritos are no Mexican.
2)  Mexican food never eat at all with sour cream and yellow cheddar chease.

Place is clean and personal are nice"}
{"text":"Bruh!!! As a Roberto's fan boy, i love some carna asada
The good reviews made my stop by and try this place out. The food is really good. Salsa bar is clean and fresh and the soda is good! Plus the little fiesta machine has horchata by the gallon!"}
{"text":"This place is never busy, which is a good thing when you're in a rush. The staff are also friendly.

I usually get their carne asada fries which are very good. It's a huge portion and everything is cook properly. I've tried their bean and cheese, which wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Do Not Eat Here!! It smells like rotten eggs as you walk up and inside. They are not very friendly and do not cater to food allergies. The bathrooms are extremely dirty as well. They don't really understand English either. I ordered a quesadilla and my cheese wasn't even melted. Wow! Not a happy customer and they didn't even care!! Stay away from here everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. The food is authentic (as you can watch them cook it fresh) however, some products seemed as though they could have been microwaved. I still say it's better than Roberto's :)"}
{"text":"Great spot, never too busy. I've gone here literally 50x since it's opened. Never had bad service, or bad food. Also open 24 hours so sometimes it's the only thing to eat around me. Thankfully it's always good. Used to be Roberto's but changed about 6 months ago. Same people work there and the food tastes the same. 
Also, the breakfast burrito's and churro's are freaking awesome !!!"}
{"text":"I've only had one item on their menu, but it was great. I recommend the grilled chicken special. It comes with rice and beans, lettuce, tomato and avocado. It also comes with tortillas, but I skip them. This location smells like smoke from the PTs next door. Otherwise I'd give it one more star."}
{"text":"This is a ONE step above Roberto's....IF not the same.
Quality is generic and flavorless. I noticed the female staff have quite the attitudes towards the customers.. But today I finally had enough of the attitude. I work next door sometimes..convenience is never key. I'll just go drive down the street to an actual authentic taco shop where the food is actually good and so is service."}
{"text":"Don Tortaco? More like \"Don MORE GUAC-O on my chips & guacamole order, please. Took a girl on a first date here and was super embarrassed by how little guacamole they put on her chips. I highly doubt I'll see her again. Thanks a lot, guys (sarcasm)"}
{"text":"Terrible...I gave them several chances, they never have anything, and I'm talking 7pm, and are rude on top of that...why stay open 24/7 when u only have 2 items after 10pm. Hope to see you guys close soon so we can get a better restaurant in your place."}
{"text":"Great Carne Asada burrito and beef rolled tacos!! I have eaten here several times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried this place out for the first time at around noon on Friday. There were quite a few construction workers there having lunch. Many were speaking Spanish so I figured it might be good food. I was right.
     I was in the mood for salad, so I ordered a taco salad. I got carne asada which is beef. It comes with sour cream and guacamole, lettuce, pico de gaillo and beans, some cheese also. Very tasty indeed. The flour tortilla shell was fried in fresh oil, so it didn't have any after taste. To drink I got a Sidral Mundet, it is natural apple soda. I later ordered a Coke. Both are bottled in Mexico. This Coke is special because it is made with real sugar.
     Overall I would say that I will be returning here to try other things on the menu. This restaurant has a drive thru. What I like about here is that the food had hardly any salt added. That is a big plus for me, that and they carry my favorite sodas."}
{"text":"We stop by Don Tortaco's a lot at night when other things are closed.  It's basically a Roberto's: cheap, greasy food.  The food is generally pretty good, and they are quick.

The downside to this place is that it's really, really inconsistent in terms of pricing and the way the food is made.  If you want rice and beans in your burrito, some people charge you $0.55 each, and some people charge you $2.00 (the combo price).  And the amount of extras is always different.  Sometimes it's like a tablespoon, other times it's overflowing.  It's all just really inconsistent.  So if you like to order the same thing and expect to get that same thing every time, this is not a place for you.

Also--the service here is always crappy.  I wouldn't expect much from a place like this, but I feel like it needs to be said.  The cashiers are usually pretty unfriendly."}
{"text":"How rude and what a careless mistake!! You seriously wrap my broken up taco this way and expect a customer to be happy?!? Forget it!! I will drive a little further to Fausto's next time!"}
{"text":"Its fair, the food and the prices. They made a mistake on my order, and refunded me my added fixings cost (I added chicken, bean rice- I bought a vegetarian because it had lettuce and other fun stuff). I opened my burrito and it was only what I purchased extra, nothing else was in it. So the lady at the register was kind enough to reimburse me for the extra money I had given. Fair, in price and value. Just be sure to check any special ordered meals, because it can ruin a good meal when you don't get what you ordered. I wasn't too happy about my burrito, but felt better when the lady didn't hesitate to offer a refund and an apology :) ? Hey, that works for me!"}
{"text":"We eat here average 3x a week since they opened quality and service is going downhill quick. The drivethru was convenient for us but i will not be going back to this place after the way i was treated tonight and my burrito had way more tortilla than anything else."}
{"text":"I don't recommend the menudo here the worst I've had so far,and being called a borracho by the cook for ordering isn't cool either. The one thing I do like is their tortillas. Never coming here again I was better off going to robertos taco shop. Must work on costumer service!"}
{"text":"Rude! Rude! Rude! Went there this morning to get a breakfast burrito. Right when I walked in there were 2 employees on the register ignoring me let alone taking my order. Four minutes later I left."}
{"text":"Can you say SALTY?! I thought it was just the salsa that was too salty. But the food was mostly salt. Price is fair."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito has shrunk. Loved them before perfect size but I think the tortilla is more of the burrito than the egg, bacon, cheese and potatoe now. I was a extreme regular.   Might be done."}
{"text":"good breakfast burrito, not great but nice to have one opern 24hr near by...updated 11/13/12 they have gone downhill since opening."}
{"text":"I love this little place. They took over for a pretty bad taco shop that was originally in the building and their food is light years better. I'm a huge fan of their carne asada and carnitas. And their staff is always super friendly and not many 24 hour food choices in this part of town."}
{"text":"Tacos are awesome. 
We will have to review again after we try something else. 
We like the tacos so much that's all we have tried. 
 Nice and clean. Good prices."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location frequently since they opened because we loved it. The food used to be excellent and it was always clean and the people were friendly. The last few months it has gone downhill rapidly. It is now usually filthy, including cockroaches during out most recent visit. The food is now just adequate because the cook keeps changing so you never know what you're going to get. ."}
{"text":"Great go to restaurant way better than Roberto's the Carne Asada burritos and Carne Asada fries our the bomb. They cook everything fresh and are happy to make changes and substitions."}
{"text":"Great Food! Great service! I love these guys. I always get the same level of service and the food is super good here! I usually order asada tacos and I love them here! I highly recommend this place :-)"}
{"text":"Don provided me and my fellow C-130 crew members savory breakfast burritos at 1am following a taxing air campaign against the Coyote nation.

'Merica."}
{"text":"It's nice that they are 24 hours especially since they're connected to Pts. The staff is very friendly and the shrimp Diablo is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night grub. The food was decent. I ordered carne asada tacos. However, the staff was a little rude. I didn't care much since I didn't dine in but the lady didn't seem like she wanted to be there."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. The wait in the drive thru is absolutely ridiculous and the food was cold when we got home (we only live right around the corner).  Also, we've noticed that they have cut down on the meat they put into the meals and replace it with cheese. We used to get food here a couple times a week but the last 2 visits have been terrible. We are very disappointed and will be spending our money somewhere else. The food quality lately has been garbage."}
{"text":"This is great authentic Mexican food.  It's kinda funny that Taco Hell is located in the same parking lot.  From the chips to the tacos to the burritos, it's really awesome.  The restaurant is nice but sparse. The salsa bar is really great too!  I love the pickled carrots & onions.  Sauces are fabulous  I can see why the locals eat here.  I'd rate it #3 to Amigos at Fiesta Casino & El Pollo Loco.  

Only thing I would change is fixing up the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Food was good I recommend the chili  quilas. They have an awesome carrot , cucumber, lemon bar, open 24 hours, nice friendly service, and clean inside."}
{"text":"Came in to get a breakfast burrito and waited 5 mins while 3 employees were trying to figure something out with the computer and no one acknowledged us, even as we walked out the door. It would have been fine had we been acknowledged but it was as if we weren't even standing there. So rude."}
{"text":"The lady at the register doesn't understand English, you have to repeat your order at least 3 times. 
And it'll still be wrong when you check your food. 
They don't put enough meat in the burritos. 
You ask for extra meat and they charge an arm and a leg for it. 
Better off going somewhere else to be honest."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy my meal ... In fact all for of us didnt. The enchilada sauce was watered down. the tostada shell was  burnt and soggy . Possible. Very nice people and a clean restaurant. But would not go back."}
{"text":"Infortunetly I had a really bad experience going on there. Usually when I go I don't have a problem. This time there a new girl who was taking my order and I asked for the beef rolled tacos. She told me that there wasn't any left. And I ask how the chicken rolled taco was and she said it was good but I wasn't feeling like eating chicken. So I look at the menu some more  and by this time she had her phone out scrolling through you tube. I though that was kind of rude and unprofessional but I brushed it off and just ordered a chimichanga carne asada. So when I get home I start eating and notice that it was a chicken chimichanga. CHICKEN!! Even when I told her I wasn't feeling chicken she put in a chicken chimichanga. So I was going to call and tell her that she made a mistake on my order and possibly make the correct one. But when I did call and no one answered. But this pint I was angry. So I drove over there and told her that she messed up my order and all she can say was \" I thought you ordered chicken\". Well she would have been able to get my order right if she wasn't browsing though my phone. By then I was done and I just wanted my money back. She never made one apology and now I'll never go back there"}
{"text":"Yearning for a burrito I stopped by Don Tortaco for a chicken burrito. I got what amounted to chopped and torn chicken rope in a cheap tortilla...no lettuce, no cheese, no rice, no beans.  I hadn't read the small print and was informed that this is all \"extra\".  \"Extra\"?  Isn't that what a burrito IS?  It's like ordering a BLT and finding out the B, the L and the T are extra.  When I brought that up the girl at the counter I got that epic shrug that let's you know they just don't care.  

All that aside the quality of the ingredients was so poor and suspect that no amounts of condiments or other ingredients would have disguised the fact that that chicken had been running marathons in the desert before ending up in that burrito.  
A seriously a grim experiment in Mexican food."}
{"text":"I recently went here. I was so sad after i was eating my carne asada plate , the pico de Gallo had some kind of piece of some pepper in it and my whole throat went numb for about 5 minutes . After drinking a bunch of water it slowly was going away but I couldn't even finish my food. Neither could my boyfriend and he got the beef nachos. We are both so disappointed and won't be back! Thank goodness are throat are all good now !"}
{"text":"I am pretty disappointed in the lack of homogeneity of items between locations. I ordered a beef quesadilla at one place and it came with just the beef and cheese so that was my expectation for  the item at a second location .  I was distraught to find that there were other things thrown in there with the beef and the cheese, things i cannot have. If I had expected something different I would have asked for the contents of it prior to ordering as I do at any new place that I visit. I would think that if someone were trying to form a chain they would ensure that their restaurants make the food the same way at all locations."}
{"text":"Ate in, decided to leave so we could take our food home and microwave it since it was ICE COLD! Ended up throwing away all three entrees because it was terrible!! Don't do it, eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"This was formerly known as Roberto's.  This is my favorite taco spot!  This specific location only!  I always get the same thing here and that is the Carne Asada Fries with everything but beans.  They usually make the fries crunchy but not burnt, but today some of them were soggy.  I am a big fan of their food here."}
{"text":"Discovered this Mexican restaurant while out running errands. Anytime is a good time for Mexican food. This location is perfect for all my Mexican food needs, since it is so close to my house plus it is open 24/7. One cannot go wrong with that. 

The service here is very good with the staff greeting customers as they enter the door. While I was ordering the cashier made eye contact with me and continued this throughout the order process. She repeated the order back too for accuracy. When I did finally receive the food it did take the cooks about ten minutes, but I was in no hurry. The pursuit of greatness cannot be rushed so, if one has the time I say let them put that extra love into your food.

I ordered one of there many combos; the number six which is a Beef Burrito and Cheese Enchilada. Also ordered four tacos al a carte that were beef and cheese. The beef and cheese tacos were very delicious and they had mass amounts of cheese. The beef was delicious with just the perfect flavors and seasonings. The cheese enchilada was my favorite with the sauce being so rich and yummy. Plus the abundance of sauce covering the enchilada is wonderful to dip the beef tacos in. Was very excited to find 24/7 delicious Mexican food so close to my residence and with awesome service and prices too!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Very affordable and you get a lot of food for what you pay...  love there tropical drink.. The piña colada is a great summer drink to beat the heat and enjoy a quisine for you and your family.. I definitely recommend the #1 chicken or beef rolled tacos and there burritos are muy Buena!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was because we were all super extremely drunk but the shrimp burritos were bomb.com"}
{"text":"Came by last weekend while I was in the area as I wanted to try this place out. There is a location much closer to me, but I wanted to try Don's out at a new location and this location just recently opened up. 

I came fairly early around 10:30 am and the place was empty. I quickly looked at their large menu before deciding on getting the chicken burrito. My guest got the #6 Beef burrito & cheese enchilada combo but made the burrito a bean and cheese and they aren't really into so much meat. This combo cost just $7.01. We also got a regular drink which cost $1.87.

While we waited for our food, I looked over the inside and took pictures for Yelp. Everything was clean and new looking. All the drink stations were clean and filled as well as the salsa bar. The floors were clean and free of all trash. I didn't notice if they have a restroom for their customers or not. 

Food came out quickly and was fresh and hot, probably a little too hot. Had to wait for my burrito to cool down some just to be able to pick it up. I don't usually get burritos at fast food Mexican places, but the chicken burrito sounded really good. The chicken had a lot of flavor to it and was very moist. My complaint about the burrito was the fact that the chicken had a lot of juice and it made the tortilla soggy so quickly. Also, I didn't realize it would just be chicken. I like other things like rice, beans, or even some lettuce and tomatoes added as well. Would I get this burrito again, probably not as I don't like soggy burritos. I, however, would come back again and try something else. 

They have 99 cent Taco Tuesdays which I will definitely try as I love tacos!

The employees were very friendly and smiled a lot. They made conversation and actually acted like they wanted to serve their customers."}
{"text":"Unfortunatly we didn't get to eat here. It's supposed to be open 24/7, but when we went at midnight on a Friday night they were closed."}
{"text":"It never fails. Every single time I want to order something other than carne Asasda nachos , they put onion in / on my food !!! & I am constantly saying NO ONIONS !!!! & here go the massive amount of onions on my food .... & they don't even put meat in their. Food ... pretty stingy with that part. I'm done giving them a chance, I didn't want to give up since they are so close to my home .... but at this point I am happy I am not dead from the onion over load."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food, and huge portions! I ordered tacos thinking they were tiny street tacos and got these huge carne asada tacos! Was not disappointed, just ordered too much food. The rolled tacos we had were also excellent! Would try again when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I would say I am at usual at this location, visiting on average of once a week. Recently (by recently I mean a couple of months now) there has been a new staff for the later night shift. I usually visit between 9pm-11pm and there has not been a single time where I have gotten my order 100% correct. The girl who is the cashier is not friendly, doesn't ask if you want sauce, dosent even ask basic question about the food (such as if I want corn or flower tortillas with my order). When I don't get my order correct she argues with me claiming she is correct. I usually don't complain especially because I work the food industry and have personally worked a drive thru before in the past and know how difficult it can me, but after about 2 months of going and constantly getting upset about something I thought it was about time I spoke out. I would say a big part of it (but I could be wrong) for my experience going poorly is usually the cashier who I honestly believe dosent care at all about her job. I believe if she knew who I was and how upset I actually am, I don't think she would hesitate in spitting in my food. I love the food but lately the portions (specifically in the bean and cheese burrito) has been shrinking but I would say this is the least of my issues with this establishment right now."}
{"text":"This place is normally good. Not outstanding, but good enough to eat when you're too lazy to make something or go somewhere fancier to eat.... Anyhow, we ordered a bunch of food ranging from burritos, tacos and nachos. I had the carne asada nachos and as I was taking my second bite, I noticed there was something that was lodged into the beans. It looked like a condom and I immediately stopped eating and wanted to throw up. My cousin took it apart and it was some type of plastic wedged into the food. My cousin called and the lady working said we have to see it. So, we drive back to bring them all the food and they only wanted to credit the nachos. Nope... None of us wanted to eat any of the food we bought. Other customers in there were looking at the food and started to feel leery of what they just ordered. Needless to say, I will never eat here again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Better than Robertos. Feels like it's a cleaner eat. I wonder if they skip the lard like most taco shops. I don't feel as sluggish and lazy after eating there. Their prices are really decent. I can still get a burrito for less than $6 here. The rolled tacos aren't greasy at all! They offer chicken or beef which is nice. I've had the plates as well. Good prices for the portion. And they're open 24hr!"}
{"text":"The lady who took my order was very friendly. The value for a meal is good. I thought the food was authentic and tasted good. I would continue to eat here."}
{"text":"So... I'm usually really picky about Mexican food. I grew up to homemade authentic Mexican food straight out of my families kitchen. But I liked how this place was opened 24/7. I had two beef tacos and a horchata. Only thing I wasn't impressed by was the bland shredded beef. I loved that the tortilla was cooked in grease and not like the shells from Taco Bell. But the beef needs more season to it, more flavor. Other then that I'll keep going there I'll just add more flavor onto my taco lol."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit to DT's. Was our first time there and was really impressed. Everything tasted fresh and had very generous portion sizes. Next time I'll definitely hold off on the taquitos and stick strictly to the tacos. They are delicious. I just wish the taquitos came with sour cream. Maybe half guacamole half sour cream option. Overall great visit, clean and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Torta is good, but I was not crazy impressed by this Roberto's style taco joint. About 10 pm my girlfriend and I rolled up through the drive through. I ordered carnitas pork plate, a carne asada taco and my girl got the carne asada fries with extra quac. The portion was great, nice fulfilling meal! My issue was that most of my carnitas was pieces of fat and the amount of fat/oil in the to go box was sickening. As you can see from the picture, it was pretty fatty. The carne asada taco and fries were good and filling an the guac is great! All in all, it's a 24 hour fast Mexican joint. The food tastes good but I'm sure the cuts of meat are not great quality. If you are a healthy eater you may have issues with this place. If you don't care, or have a stupidly fast metabolism like my girl- try this place out. They give Roberto's a run for their money."}
{"text":"I just recently found out about Don Tortaco and happy that I did. I'm the kinda girl who randomly gets Mexican fast food cravings at midnight so this is a perfect spot for me since they are open 24/7!!! 

I absolutely love nachos and have to say there chicken nachos are pretty dang delicious. They marinate their chicken with green peppers, onions, and other tasty spices and flavors and then it's shredded on the food. I'm not a fan of cubed cut chicken that you find at fast food places so i was sold when I opened up my box. 

They have the salsa bar where you can find green/red salsa, green is my favorite and I practically drink it. It has cilantro and onion chunks in it to boost the flavor. Then you can choose from green onions, pickled jalepenos/carrots/onions, cucumbers, and limes.  

Nachos are my go to item but I have also ordered the crunchy chicken and beef tacos that were good. Every flavor churros is a win! Can't go here without getting one of those. They have other desserts on the menu but honestly they didn't look that great so I'd just stick with the churros. Can't go wrong with those deep fried bundles of goodness. 

This place also has unlimited refills of Horchata!!!!!! A definite must for me. I usually drink half of it before my order is even ready. I'm addicted, what can I say. 

The lady who usually takes my order doesn't speak English very well. That's not a problem for me we communicate just fine and she's super nice. Any of the staff that has taken my order is always very polite. I usually give them $1-$2 tip from my left over change and they always hook me up with extra guacamole or chips when I do. 

Overall great place when you have that random Mexican food craving. If a regular customer over here now."}
{"text":"This place is just ok.  They have a drive thru which is cool, however the people always seem to be rude over it.  The food is just alright, nothing to have a craving over."}
{"text":"Real deal mexican food. Chips and salsa...amazing. Tacos, burritos, enchiladas..delish. Wish we had this restaurant in California. I love it!"}
{"text":"Their carne asada torta is the booomb! Wish their bread wouldn't fall apart so easily but other than that,its delicious. Their burritos are the bomb too. That's all I've tried here other than their horchata as well,but I'd still recommend this place,authentic Mexican food..."}
{"text":"Love the bacon breakfast burrito and the beans!!!! Rolled tacos are yummy too!! Their salsas are good too!!"}
{"text":"NOT another roberto's taco shop rip off! same menu, same pictures, not good on the quality, two stars because they were friendly, food wasn't good, steak wasn't cut up like they advertised... cheap rip off... stick with Roberto's"}
{"text":"So this new place has a great promo for a complete meal for 3.99; beef or chicken with rice and beans.  Not a bad deal.
I have had their tacos and rolled tacos; both were good. 
I liked the atmosphere; it's casual and laid back.  Good salsa bar as well.  Good addition to the neighborhood"}
{"text":"I think if this place was located in San Diego they would only get 3 stars, but the competition in Las Vegas isn't as fierce.

Everything is well priced.  They currently have a carne asada platter special for $4 which includes rice, beans, a slice of avocado, lettace, and meat.  It also includes a large tortilla.  You can basically make yourself a carne asada burrito and rice/beans while saving yourself more than a buck.

The nachos were pretty good.  They didn't overload it with beans like most places do.  They did overload it with carne asada though!  Could have used more cheese.  Additionally it would have helped if they nuked the cheese for a few seconds so that it was properly melted.

I also had a quesadilla on one trip.  Very cheesy and buttery.  Unfortunately, like most Las Vegas taco shops, the tortilla is more on the rubbery side than the flakey side.

Anyways, for Las Vegas this is a pretty great taco shop for the money."}
{"text":"Just as good as the Don Tortaco on Eastern and Warm Springs.  This place used to be \"Taco Tio\" which was an abomination of a taco shop.  Don Tortaco on the other hand is one of the best chains in Las Vegas.

Carne asada chips are pretty much perfect.  Good guacamole.  Not too many beans.  Competitively priced.

Quesadilla is one of the best I've had in Vegas.  Very cheesy and very buttery.  The tortilla could be more flakey though.

The last time I went in they were having technical problems with the cash register.  I stood around in line for over 5 minutes without even being acknowledged.  A simple \"sorry, we'll be with you in a moment\" would have gone a long way.  I ended up walking out.  Even with this bad experience, I'll still be back though.  The food is that good."}
{"text":"Not going to this location, poor excuse for staff. Bipolar hispanic girl that takes the order made me lose my appetite. Just do your job and do it right without a bitch face. Is it too much to ask for these days? Proper customer service?  You don't enjoy your job? Well get the proper education to better yourself."}
{"text":"Great food. get the carne asada burrito and 3 roll tacos.."}
{"text":"This place was good! La carne de asada was delicious, the lady was very cordial, parking space was a little tight and thats it! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went  first time on Saturday night.  Wait was at least fifteen minutes after the guys in front of us in the drive through got his food.  Ordered extra cucumbers for our shrimp, but got extra shrimp and was charged for it.  The manager actually asked for our food back so he could remove the shrimp.  What a health code violation.  Refused to give us a refund on something we did not order and a mistake on their part.  Window person was difficult to understand and she had a hard understanding us..  To me  service was zero and food was ok.    But probably won't go again  because I can get the same quality food elsewhere with people who are a lot more service oriented and customer friendly with a lot less wait."}
{"text":"It seems like maybe some Don Tortaco locations have a bad reputation for whatever reason, but I've only had good experiences at this location since they opened. The staff has always been nice, they actually say hello when you get there and thank you when you leave. The restaurant is fairly new and super clean. The only issue I've ever ran into here was that their soda machine was down for a week or so but they had cans to supplement.

A couple of my favorites here are the beef chimichanga, which is a great value. The rolled tacos are always awesome,  the carne asada burrito and the super nachos. I usually go to this location a couple times a week. I hope they keep up their quality!"}
{"text":"Ordered beef tacos. Home style tortillas that seemed a little well done, as in you will have to be careful while you chew. Beef was shredded not ground and was pretty good. More lettuce than a rabbit would know what to do with. The salsa verde was flavorful with no kick to it.

Not a bad place, way better than any of the chains."}
{"text":"Went here once and will never be back... I'd rather go to Fausto's. Food was ok, not great. They didn't have any cucumbers and the pickled peppers weren't iced. 
We were there on Saturday night after 7pm and the restaurant was empty. There were 2 workers sitting and watching a soccer game while one was taking the drive-thru orders. They got up and took our orders then went back to sitting and watching the soccer game after our food was served. 
I can spend the same amount of $ somewhere else and get better tasting food."}
{"text":"I come here when I can, they make great breakfast burritos and the red sauce is nice and spicy. My favorite of all of the Don tortacos in town that I have been to"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours my ass. This is one of the few places i can eat at in a pinch with my dietary restrictions. I am a student with a job. I get off late. I expect a 24 hour place to be open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Coming in on a slow Sunday night was probably not the best timing, but the food was still okay. It fit the bill for a to go order to satisfy my Mexican craving. 

I had the Chicken Taco/Chicken Enchilada combination plate. The price was low for large portion. The chicken taco was tasty, but the meat was dry. I attribute this to coming in at a slow time. I'm sure everything is fresher during busier times. The enchilada was appropriately loaded with enchilada sauce. The rice and beans were good and there was enough cheese on everything to make me happy.

My husband had the Machaca plate which came with even more food than my meal. He loved it. This dish came with several large tortillas and guacamole. I'm pretty sure we could have split this one meal and it would have been plenty of food.

The restaurant was clean and the gentleman that took our orders was friendly. He prepared everything quickly, we barely had time to get our salsas from the salsa bar which is a good thing. You can't beat the price for portion sizes either."}
{"text":"The best breakfast burritos and cheap too!  It's nice that they are open 24 hours.  Breakfast burritos are nice in the morning or anytime of day.  Reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"Don Tortaco is decent mexican food on a good day, but this location is just plain bad and I wouldn't recommend it as food for your dog.

I tried out this new location last week and ordered (2) orders of 3 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole and (2) Carne Asada Burritos with everything (and added cheese as well). 

After ordering I showed the girl on the register my phone for the Don Tortaco coupons ($1 off any order) and she said that I needed to print them out; no biggie (although the other locations don't make you do this) - a dollar off my order wasn't really anything since it was almost $20 anyways.

It was late, maybe 11pm-ish, my food took what I would consider too long (prob 10-15 mins); especially since when I got the food and went home it was cold... not cold because it took a while to get home, cold because it was cold to begin with. The cheese on the rolled tacos was not melted at all; the cheese in the carne asada burritos wasn't either (it was cold and still shredded pieces). The flavor of the carne asada was meh. 

Honestly I was excited to have a 24 hour mexican place open up near us, but I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Not sure If the Mexican food chain Robertos Taco Shop Changed its name or this is a new chain. But regardless there used to be a Robertos Taco shop here. I came here during my lunch for some Mexican food thinking I was going to a Robertos to find its now Don Tortaco. Well I didn't care It looks like its a newly renovated Robertos. 

Food: 3/5 The food was delicious, a lot of meats, a huge glop of guacamole and ton's of onions, tomato's, cilantro, and lime on top. I noticed that the flour taco was very flimsy. Maybe it was over loaded or something but it ripped easy. Which is a big no no.. made my meal pretty messy. 

Price: 5/5 The price was very chip it was Al la carte per taco $2.35 for Carne Asada. My meal came to $5 and some change for 2 fully loaded Carne Asada Tacos. 

Service: 3/5 It's a very fast food type like Mexican restaurant. Other than ordering its pretty much self service after that."}
{"text":"If you advertise that your open 24 hours you probably shouldn't lock your doors at 1145p. 

I would love to be able to give an actual review."}
{"text":"I am beyond disgusted. I absolutely love this place, I recently moved so I thought I would try a new location. BIG MISTAKE! It was about 10:30 am and I ordered two beef tacos. I was sitting in the drive thru for about 15 mins. In my mind I was like \"ok cool, I'm about to get a fresh batch of food.\" I was very wrong. So I get my food and I'm driving back to my house. I smelled something very foul and I didn't want to believe it was coming from the bag of food. I get back to my house, I sit down and start eating. I get through my first taco and it was good. I get to my second taco, take a bite and instantly spit it out. It felt like mush. I smelled the taco and it had the most rancid smell I have ever smelled in my life. That was what I was smelling inside my car. So now I open the taco. The meat looked so disgusting. I smelled the meat directly and I gagged. That meat was rotten for sure. I'm going to put in a couple pictures I took, you can tell how mushy the meat is. I will not be coming back here ever again. I will stick with Robertos from now on."}
{"text":"One of the best bean and cheese burritos ever. Great salsa verde. Drove through after work two nights in a row (after the first night I was hooked.)

I was skeptical at first, but they are friendly folks who know authentic Mexican cuisine. 

Super bomb burrito! I bet the rest of the food is pretty darn good.

Only downside-limited English so if you have a lot of questions or need custom orders you're kinda screwed."}
{"text":"Had take out from here yesterday- food is ok, not as good as Robertos in my opinion-it took them forever to get two burritos and a quesadilla and then they forgot my churro - so I had to make a second trip, I will try again and give them a second chance"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. This place shorted us on food and they wouldn't fix the problem. They said it was correct. I will NEVER come here AGAIN!!!! Don't COME HERE!!! Inconsistent in serving! Don't waste your time or money!!!!!
I would like to update on our experience. They actually fixed the problem and our order and the manager apologized. He gave us the food for free and it was excellent! He took all the charges off my credit card. I had to tip the server because she was very patient. We are now a family that loves their fresh food and great service. 
Whenever I don't have time to cook we order and are always guarantee freshness."}
{"text":"Besides language barriers...it was a fast to order in tonight for my family(just can't wait for them to get their grub on)"}
{"text":"The food is better than average fast food. I especially liked the burritos and beef nachos"}
{"text":"This is not open 24 hours it used to be when they first opened but apparently active business has closed them at night"}
{"text":"disclosure i am drunk off my ass.
BUT
Don gets a high five!  I stumbled on in and i couldnt read the menbu so i asked dude behind the counter what was his favorite.  whatever it was it was 6 bucks and hella bomb.  i don't kno why pprl trip on this place.  it good. don't expect authentic HELLOPOPOOOOOOO, but excpect good. don't trip."}
{"text":"I am originally from San Diego where there are good Mexican food places all over, but have moved away.  So when I visit a large city I always look for some good Mexican food.  I found it here at Don Tortaco.

The carne asada was good, cut into small pieces for easy eating in a burrito or quesadilla.  I had a California burrito that was great and reminded me of my favorite place in San Diego. Portions were good sized also.

I think the salsa/hot sauce makes or breaks a small Mexican restaurant like this one and the salsa here was very good.  There was a salsa bar with veggies and multiple sauces. 

An added bonus was the free wifi that is faster than Starbucks.  This place is a definite must visit each time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"My husband loves this place! We pretty much get the same thing every time. We both enjoy their carne asada nachos, always perfect whether it's dine in or take out. Their rolled taquitos, shredded beef nachos, as well as their shredded beef chimichangas are awesome too!! Staff has always provided great service, one of our to go places on the weekends when we are craving delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"I wouldn't suggest going to this establishment. When you have repeatedly ask for no onions on any of your food and they do the opposite . And let's not mention how they forget to give you all of your food and when you go back in they look at you and avoid ypublic for as long as possible . I also stood there and watched them use their non gloved hand while handling another customers food! GROSS!!! Their food is overpriced as well!!!"}
{"text":"Even with the bad reviews, I figured I'd give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  Drive thru service was great.  Food was excellent.  Refried beans were a little salty, but all in all, it was tasty.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Food was good as always, but it does depend on who is working that's day.

Erika took my order today but was not making the food, but her personality and friendliness was amazing.  

She loves her job and the customers and makes you feel welcome when you walk through the door.

Because of Erika, I would go back to this location plus the fact they have specials every day and if you go to their site through Yelp, there are specials and discounts which is another plus for this place.

If you have not been to one of these locations find one a go.  Most are open 24/7, this location closes at midnight."}
{"text":"I went here last night and it is ok.  They fry their taco shells before preparing the taco.  It was something different from the others and overall I say this place is ok.  It is close to the house, the prices are good and they are open 24 hours.  If you are in the mood for some decent Mexican food, this is not a bad place, give it a shot and give your opinion."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Awesome service and great clean location. Not really much else to say other than go try it. It is way better than Robertos. Fresh veggies and delicious cheese on everything !"}
{"text":"Eh. Dry and dry.  And they gave me the wrong order."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since it opened and was such a fan of the carne asada and breakfast burrito but this time our food was cold. They have a real hard time understanding our order over the phone unless you can speak Spanish. Once there they seemed to work on differing orders one at a time so they were so disorganized. We hope this is just an anomaly and am sad to rate them low this time around."}
{"text":"Stopped here to fulfill a mid-afternoon snack craving.

Based on my experience at Tacos El Compita, I expected tiny lil things.  I ordered a carne asada taco and a lengua taco.  I did not realize the asada taco came with guac, so I ordered a side of guac for 75 cents.

While waiting for the chef to cook em fresh, I grabbed salsa, limes, and some radishes and cucumbers from the salsa bar.  What I noticed is the cleanliness of this place (the dining area, the bathroom and the kitchen), and the interesting decor.  There is a green theme for sure (green painted wood, green tiled tables).

The food came out fast and the tacos were huge!  Each served on a corn tortilla that wasn't all soaking wet, and my side of guac was the same size or slightly bigger than Chipotle's and costs less!

I had the asada first - it came with guac and pico, but I added a squeeze of lime and tomatillo salsa.  It was yummy.  Then, the lengua.  It came with chopped onions and cilantro.  I added the extra guac and the tomatillo and lime, then dug in.  The flavors were great, and the tongue was so good!  Such comfort food.  To be honest, I could probably have had just one taco and be full, at least for snack needs.

They have lots of specials.  This week there was a special listed for 2 tongue tacos, rice, beans and a drink for just $6.25.  If I had been in the mood for that, that is a great deal.  They also serve tortas, tostadas, menudo, and other tasty treats.  The staff is bilingual and they take cards for small amounts.  I would definitely go back and it is 24 hours!!"}
{"text":"This new spot just open across the street! From its original place on Bermuda and Silverado ranch I'm here at midnight . We can't order chicken taco . I can't use my debit card then try using my cash ($100) they can't even take that! Next time why don't you guys post up what you can and can't do so I don't waste my time coming here !!!"}
{"text":"Drive thru took forever and my rolled tacos tasted freezer burned. The guacamole was dark green like it had been sitting since morning and the green salsa was watery. I will try a different dish from here before deciding totally against it though. From this experience I would rate Robertos 100x better."}
{"text":"The best looking Roberto's I've ever been to. 
Very clean and done up. 

I used to think Robertos as low rate (appearance wise with no ac) restutaunt with good food.

When I stepped into this location I was amazed! 
The appearance of the resturant was very surprising to me.
Even the the bathroom shocked me. 
The food was good and the place was VERY clean.

The only thing about the bathroom, there's no mirror in the womens lol and the door will seriously slam shut and if your hand or finger doesn't move out of the way just in time, Roberto's be careful, theres some shady people out there.

When in the mood for Mexican food, Roberto's on Blue Diamond I am there."}
{"text":"Came in here the other day since I'm in search of my NEW favorite Mexican to go joint since my old one now sucks and this place isn't my new favorite or even close to it BUT it's honestly not horrible either. 

The customer service sucks when you walk in their door, No smile or what can I get for you, Just  kinda a blank stare and off ya go with your food. No thank you and come again, But they do have a tip jar!!  Ha ha. I guess that these guys haven't figured out yet that you need to have decent customer service skills for people to want to give you FREE money for nothing....  whatever. Anyway. 

The carne asada on a scale from 1-10 is about a 5 or 6 as there is no flavor. They don't marinate their meat overnight properly like some other places do and let the beef absorb flavor from the seasonings to taste like something other than a chopped up leather belt!!  

I'm from so. Cal and almost all the Mexican taco shops know you have to marinate to get flavor. I'm wondering if these guys even know that you have to remove the seasoning from the bottle and add it to the meat to get the beef to taste like something? I'm thinking maybe they think that since they bought the seasoning and as long as its in the same vicinity as the food that it'll MAGICALLY season itself!?  Ha ha 

The salsa bar IS good though. Lots of jalapeños and carrots and onions and it has good flavor. 

The red and green salsa has good flavor and you can tell it's NOT canned. 

The tacos are mediocre at best. Their just flavorless beef with guacamole (watered down guacamole) and pick de gallo. As long as you cover it in lime juice, salsa and salt than it's good but nothing close to south of the border and these guys English isn't so great so you'd think they could make better tacos but they don't so whatever. 

The breakfast burritos are ok and fairly priced. 

The taquitos are pretty much just rolled up corn tortillas with VERY little meat. 

If you're craving Mexican and you're nearby than try it for yourself. The restaurant is clean. The prices are ok. But don't make a special trip from the other side of town or you'll be disappointed. 

Still in search of that GREAT Mexican to go joint but still haven't found it but I will!!

Also there hard taco shells are BEYONG hard and almost shatter your teeth and are like tearing a piece of leather to break a piece off because I think
The shells are fried dats in advance"}
{"text":"Usually this is the place I order from. Never had a issue but last night I ordered the same food every single time... but this time my wet cali burrito had guacamole in it! Never does.. it was gross so I wasted the money because it was trashed the guac was brown because of the hot wet sauce on top.. Disappointed  for sure when you are starving..."}
{"text":"This place takes forever..even when you call in your order ahead of time for pickup  (I still recommend doing that). 
Don't come here for the customer service; they always seem rushed, busy, possibly understaffed, and don't say much..
BUT that's ok because the food is usually worth all the nonsense.  
The rolled chicken tacos are perfection (I add guac)- not all thick or over-fried totilla.
I highly recommend the chimichangas- huge, tasty, & full of meat! 
Wish they had better Horchata- maybe it's just me but it seems wayyyy to thick & sweet."}
{"text":"So I've been coming here for quite a while the carne asada nachos are usually pretty good.
And like everybody else if there's a chance to save money I'm going to try to find it.
Well Don tortaco has a website encourage everybody to take a look at it but it crashed today while I'm in the drive thru.
So I pull up their regular app to have printable coupons and a girl at the window says oh we don't except those anymore that's what my manager told me.
So all I can say is buyer beware just because it's on their website doesn't mean it actually exist and once you've been sitting in the Drive-Thru for 15 minutes for one car in front of you that's how you find out... I call b******* on that one and also just a message to the store owner / manager / whoever the h@$! supposed to make things happen... if one person in the Drive-Thru has a huge order make them pull around and wait for their order don't make everybody else wait."}
{"text":"been coming here for awhile just for its chile relleno and I get this on an order of three piled in one container instead of separate containers like always and no cheese. Inconsistency and especially human laziness is always the root of nothing good! Check your cameras and do some remedial training with the lazy ass excuse of a human responsible for this. A lazy ass will always be the bacteria infection to the success of any business."}
{"text":"I swear everytime I order a chicken or beef enchilada its cheese only what the heck. How come they can never get my order right? I will never go to  this place again off to faustos or Robertos I go"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food is good. I've had the carne asada burrito, the carne asada fries, tacos al pastor, and a torts al pastor and they were all pretty decent. The reason I gave this place 3 stars is because I feel that there is room for improvement. Especially with their tortas. I've had tortas at other places and they usually come with some beans, sour cream, and a little bit of guacamole. The tortas at Don Tortaco come only with meat which makes them seem a bit plain, and not to mention,  hard to eat. When you're trying to eat it, the meat falls out because their's nothing in it to hold everything together. My suggestion to the cooks is that they add at least some beans and sour cream to help keep the meat in place. Until they improve the way they make their tortas, I will not be ordering it again. Besides that, I think that the meat tastes good and the service is also pretty good. I will continue to go, but no more tortas for me. I think I'll stick to their tacos."}
{"text":"Can't follow the simplest instruction. The salsa station was filthy, The nachos are loaded with so much sour cream and onions and not layered. They become soggie immediately. No onions I asked for and of course I get extra onion. Give me my money back and will not go here again."}
{"text":"Came in here. It was empty. I also asked about the 24 hour service, and the guy says no one comes by after 10pm so they close. Half the stuff we asked for wasn't even available.

All the tables were dirty so we took the order to go instead. When we opened the bag at home, the order was incomplete! Frustrating. That's what I get for trusting the cashier who doesn't even speak English to get it right. grrrrr..

The young kids at McDonalds give better service than this place.  

Not coming back here again. I'll spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Breakfast taco was ok, chicken taco shells were overcooked.  Not as good as Roberto's."}
{"text":"This place is near my house and great for a late night Mexican craving. Nothing special about the food but pretty awesome that it's 24 hours.

Pros: 24 hours, convenient location, decent food.

Cons: Service is always poor and unpleasant. Quality isn't consistent.

Will eat here again when I get the late night urge."}
{"text":"This review is for the location on Decatur & Cactus. I went through the drive thru to order a carne machaca burrito & when I got home, I did not have carne machaca in my burrito. I had shredded beef (wet). Carne machaca is a dry, finely shredded beef meat. I went back to ask for my money back and the girl at the drive thru told me that there was carne machaca in my burrito and I got into a short argument with her. I told her carne machaca was DRY and she rolled her eyes and closed the window to go tell someone else. Another lady comes to the window and asked what the problem was and once again, I start arguing. She claimed that anywhere I went, I would get WET shredded beef as \"carne machaca.\" Which is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous because I have had REAL carne machaca at the Roberto's on Buffalo and Charleston. My whole family is from Sinaloa, MX & we know what real carne machaca is. Don't claim to have carne machaca on your menu when you DON'T! 1st & last time I ever go here."}
{"text":"Went around 1AM on a whim for a late night food run.

The place was dead and was being manned by only 1 person.  No worries though, the server/cook/cashier was quick and banged out our chimichanga in no time at all.

Chimichanga was cooked nicely and the outer layer was a nice balance of being very crispy but not oily.  Topped in guacamole and cheese, the chimichanga really hit the spot.  Additionally, the rice that was served on the rice was prolly one of the best rices I've had a Mexican joint.  Super impressed for a quick meal.

5 stars for the horchata on tap tho.  Neverending horchata???  Come on, this kid will come back simply to exploit the wonder-machine spitting out the cinnamon-milky goodness."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good small Mexican place to order a good chile relleno burrito and I found the place. Really good food!"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken plate is the best. Also, the chocolate flan is amazing when you're drunk! haha"}
{"text":"I visited this place looking for a fast affordable lunch. I ordered the taquitos (accompanied by rice and refried beans). I liked how the food was served promptly and everything was under $7. 

The food per se was pretty good. Maybe I visited during a good day because the food I had did not reflect the negative reviews this place has. For the $, you can't really ask for more. The food was well seasoned and it was not greasy. It was also made to order to it was warm and fresh. 

The only drawback about this place it that it is not maintained clean. The floor and tables were dirty and it was hard to find a good spot to sit without having to clean someone else's mess. I think this place is perfect for drive through or carry out. 

Overall, good experience, good food for the $ and fast service."}
{"text":"Was only 2nd in line, and still waiting now close to 30 mins. Only ordered 2 quesadillas & a #5 - 2 tacos w rice and beans. Never waited this long and any better place. Will not come back here ever again."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times. Food is always good. However the staff in never friendly. Even after I leave a generous tip I still get treated Ike I'm nothing. I politely order my food and politely handover my money and the The lady working the front counter is completely rude."}
{"text":"Ordered the carne asade and its bomb!!! People are pretty cool and the amount is awesome..."}
{"text":"Decent fast Mexican food. I asked for a cup of water and they said they don't have a cup of water that they can give me and I had to buy a bottled water. I've never heard that from any restaurant in my life. Food is still good though."}
{"text":"This fish tacos was amazing! So perfectly cooked! And the rolled chicken tacos are so BOMB! Definitely recommend that! The California burrito was a little on the smaller side though but still pretty good! I'll be going here  for fish tacos now"}
{"text":"Don Tortaco always comes to mind whenever I'm hungry in the wee hours of the night. And surprisingly enough, I'm always craving this place while I'm 100% sober.

This is your go-to place when there's little to no options at night giving you good food at a reasonable time with a reasonable price... For Mexican food. My four stars is strictly based on my usual order: rolled tacos, regular tacos, carne asada fries/nachos and quesadillas.

If I want burritos, I'd go to Phat Phranks off of 2-15 & Decatur (they're not open 24/7 though) but I'll get into that in another review. As of right now, right around the block type food, this is the place. And it's right next door to a Neighborhood Walmart making your late-night errands run smoothly."}
{"text":"Good size portions for the price. I had the chicken and steak tacos with a bean and cheese burritos. Pretty good. A fast fix if your short on time. Open 24 hours, always a plus."}
{"text":"Well... I guess I'll start with.... I will never come back here. And I will never refer people here. It's incredibly rude to not let your customers finish talking while placing an order. Turning your back to your customer while they are placing their order to laugh and socialize with the cook is also not ok. It's also incredibly discouraging that your chile relleno  is MICROWAVED. Seriously? I can understand pre stuffing the chile and refrigerating it. But to not be capable of and egg wash and heating? It's honestly so sad. And I really didn't want a soggy gross microwaved chile. Sad, I'm sure if made right it would taste so good. But I didn't come here wanting microwaved food. Back to the rude lady taking orders... she was upset that corn tortillas rang up 4 for $1 and said \"it's a mistake, but I'll give it to you\" the cook said \"no it's right\" you don't say those things to the guest.... just saying. she also made a comment about \"not having customers\" maybe you would have customers..... if you weren't so rude. A lot of reviews say the same thing- \"rude\" I'm not expecting a fine dining experience, I'm simply expecting good customer service."}
{"text":"Good place for late night cravings and if you want to avoid the usual burger drive thru late night foods. There's many options, including an all day breakfast menu. It's cheap, fast and filling."}
{"text":"Everyone in Vegas raves about Robertos carne asada fries but don tortaco has the best in Vegas!!! My brother showed me this place when I first moved out here and it is amazing! The quality is really good especially for the price. I never stray away from my beloved carne asada fries but I've had their burritos and they are amazing too. Also they're 24 hours (at least this location) so late night munchies are a must here!"}
{"text":"The portions are big I had the chicken chimichanga combo with rice, beans, guacamole and sour cream. It was good but a little bit to heavy for my liking. If I'm starving and in the mood for mexican food I would come back. This place reminds me of Roberto's. They also are next door to a PT's so that's a plus =)"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, the staff was very friendly and the food was fresh. I had a vegetarian burrito and my wife had a chicken enchilada but she hated it. This is authentic mexican food and probably appreciated by those looking for real Mexican spices and herbs and not American Mexican food like taco bell or del taco. Still not the best Mexican food I ever had but it's up there"}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible after I ordered my food in the drive through the girl came to the drive thru window and didn't say anything no hello or no nothin greeted me with a look like I need the money and that's it lol I'll just take my ass back to Ricardo's I love that place"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Don Tortaco location. This is the one near Rounders. One time ordered taquitos which seemed to be ready pretty quick. Arrived home and they were soggy, cold and undercooked. Another time I paid the cashier. Then watched her use her hands without gloves putting the lettuce and cheese on my tacos. Ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"We decided to get a quick dinner and we were craving Mexican. This location is not far from our house so the husband and I decided to get it to go and went through the drive thru. The speaker is horrible! We couldn't understand anything the guy said! So we placed our order and hoped for the best. He actually got our order right! We ordered a chicken tostada and beef tacos. They were actually very good with a lot of meat in the tacos. The only downside was that the shells were on the greasy side. The tacos were 1.99 each which we felt was reasonable. We will definitely be back next craving. I want to try the carne asada burrito!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chile relleno burrito and steak plate. Everything was cooked to perfection and the staff was very friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty average. Starting with the bad, the salsa was very runny, probably a 2. We got a few different things off the menu that ranged from 2.5 to 4. Shrimp burrito was a 2.5, pretty dry. Cheesy steak fries were probably 3. The steak tacos were pretty good tho, maybe a 4. The staff seemed pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Being from So Cal, I've always taken good mexican food for granted because it was so accessible to me. Since moving here 3 months ago, I've been craving carne asada fries for so long but just didnt know where find one here in Vegas. Then one day making a wrong turn, I bumped into Roberto's Taco Shop which was 2 blocks away from my house.  My life just took a step up in being satisfied.

They are not selfish with their servings here. I ordered a carne asada fries and burrito and let me tell you, they did not miss even a millimeter of space in that box!  Not only were the servings big, but it was pretty good too.  Man that hit the spot! Best thing is that they're open 24/7 and I hit the gym around 1am so this is the new spot I will definitely be hitting up after my workouts.  Yea I know its a bad diet but I'll work out even harder to make up for it.

Service here is nice and very clean environment. From what I've been reading on yelp that other Roberto places arent as nice as this one.  Best thing is it's mexicans making mexican food unlike another place i went to where it was asians making mexican food and the other way around.  Biggest fail was a Pho restaurant ran by filipinos and let me tell you, their Pho was Phocking nasty! Keep the menu within the race and you get my thumbs up.

Friends are telling me to try their Lengua as well. Don't know what that is but i'll be sure to order that next."}
{"text":"I always settle for this place because I live near here, but I think I'll drive the extra couple minutes for Robertos from now on.
They have twice now messed up my order of chicken enchiladas and made them cheese enchiladas. Not only that but they were not even cooked it was like cold tortillas with unmelted shredded cheese.. then when I complained after the second time they were like oh we'll give you a discount on your next order only to give me 50 cents off"}
{"text":"Everything was missing seasoning and just tastes very bland. My rolled tacos had junks of pork, so once I took a bite all the meat came out and I was left with a empty taco. The rice was missing flavor as well."}
{"text":"I ordered a basic bean and cheese burrito and a large drink to go.  The burrito was very heavy on the refried beans, which were too bland, and not enough cheese and as a result the burrito was too bland and did not have much flavor; however, the beans were not as dry as some other Mexican places I've been to and the tortilla was very soft and fresh tasting.  I took some green verde salsa to go and even that tasted bland.  The drink tasted flat.  What I can say positive about the location is that the cashier was very pleasant and professional and the store is clean.  A nice touch is that they have sandwich bags out by the salsa bar so that you can package up the assorted condiments neatly without leaking.  If I go back I think I'd like one of the other burritos or will request sour cream and extra cheese and a little less on the beans.  Definitely worth another try."}
{"text":"I have replaced Robertos with this place... they never get my order wrong and the food is always on point. Jessica is the best!!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Don Tortaco but it will do. The food was tasty enough for cheap eats but the Pepsi kept going south. The girl behind the counter yelled when it was fixed but alas it went back to clear water with carbonation. 

I had their chicken enchilada with a chicken taco. I really wish Don Tortaco would cook their chicken in spices and possibly some tomatoes and peppers. Their chicken is bland, as in boiled in water and nothing else bland. Their rice was good with a decent amount of flavor and it was fluffy. Beans, I never eat them. No frijoles is my go to phrase. 

The restaurant was clean and my food was served in about 7 minutes. It's a middle of the road experience."}
{"text":"I think I just ate the largest Chimichanga known to man that should have been featured on Man vs Food. This place was wide open with only 5 other patrons in the building but the food was solid. Their chimichanga had slow roasted beef in it in a nice crispy fried tortilla. 

The fiancé had a carne asada burrito that was not only big but a delightfully flavorful asada which plenty of spice and depth. Dinner for 3 was about $20. Super cheap, tasty and efficient. We'll definitely be back again since it's between Walmart and Smith's. There is a video bar adjacent to it which we might try out next time."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican fast food chain...similar to but seemingly more flavorful than it's Robertos cousin.

This is the kind of food that tastes 100x better late at night or inebriated lol.

We ordered the Carne Asada Tostada ($3.80). Good flavor...HUGE portion lol.

Al Pastor Torta ($5.15). Surprisingly good considering it's not rotisserie style pastor. A bit on the dry end though, but the seasoning was tasty.

Chorizo Breakfast Burrito ($3.80). Chorizo didn't seem fresh and had an odd taste. Filled to the brim with scrambled egg and potato.

Solid late night choice for greasy drunk food :P"}
{"text":"my favorite place in all of nevada to get tacos i love authentic mexican food and this one hits the spot"}
{"text":"Wow.... Great value and open 24/7...the food is so good... Doesn't seem like many people know about this place tho"}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican places around this side of town. 

Location: It's located near starbucks and lee's alcohol, and gas station plaza on windmill and Maryland.

Vibe & layout: I go here almost ritually for my breakfast and late night snack and it's ALWAYS clean. The place is small, but it's never really packed.

Customer service & food: Always greeted by a smile which is nice, and my food gets out in a very quickly time. Their bacon breakfast burrito is dankkk 15/10. Super cheesy, super eggy, super stuffed. 
Chimichanga: Huge and on point.
Carnitas: Can be a little small at times, but it still taste good.
All in all I've never had a bad experience here.

Protip: They take orders ahead of time!"}
{"text":"We ordered a few items to-go this evening and were very disappointed with what we received. Hubby ordered a chimichanga plate, it was OK, but not great. The beans were salty and the rice was dry, but the chimichanga was tasty. We also ordered three beef tacos, chips and cheese, and a burrito. We got three chicken tacos, chips with no cheese, and a burrito with a torn-to-hell tortilla that fell apart when unwrapping it. I used the chips to scoop burrito filling, since we didn't get the cheese, so it wasn't a total loss, but it was not what we paid for. Not at all."}
{"text":"Tried this spot, had the carne Asada fries. The fries are quite thin and small. The meat was l seasoned and overall everything else is pretty fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food cheeper than Robertos and just as good.. I love the Carne Asada fries...the staff is always friendy and good food.. The breakfast items are great as well."}
{"text":"Looking for some late night grub, we stumbled across this taco shop chain on Blue Diamond.  The employees seem a little tired or lifeless, but what do you expect at a 24-hour joint!  Regardless, we were content after our meal, and had a great morning sleep.

Out of all the items we ordered, my least favorite...even though I devoured the whole thing...was the taco de lengua.  Tongue lacked some flavor and wasn't tender enough. The taco was bigger (in size and cost) than what I'm used to.   

Their chicken taco (crunchy shell) was a lot better....with a peppery taste and loads of cheese.  The Horchata was just okay for me...I had better.  But why complain when the Mexican drinks are bottomless like the other fountain drinks!?

My favorite was the Carne Asada nachos, with a mountain of flavorful asada, cheese, cilantro, tomatoes, guacamole, and beans (we opted for no sour cream).  It was so good (and greasy), we ended up ordering another \"mountain\" to go. 
 
Up next....Carne Asada Fries!"}
{"text":"I attended a dance workshop on Sunday at the Rock Center for Dance, and when we broke for lunch, I decided to walk over to Don Tortaco. 
I've never eaten at one before, and it was close, and cheap.

I ordered the 2 cheese enchilada combo.

Service was polite, and the location was clean. 

The food was just \"meh.\"  The cheese tasted funny, the tortillas didn't really seem done all the way...I didn't care for the rice at all.  

I'm not really a fan.  I will take Roberto's any day of the week over Don Tortaco, if given the chance.  It wasn't awful, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada  nachos I've ever had! (And I've had a lot) 4 stars for the food, 5th star. Because it's connected to a PT's Pub where you can bring your food into the bar and eat it. They'll even deliver it to you while you wait and sip in a cold one"}
{"text":"We went here for enchiladas. They were COLD. Not just cool, actually COLD. Also, the building has some very unfortunate waste management issues and it smells like a sewer. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Well...I actually thought you might have actually 'loved my tip\" and stepped up your customer service but it turns out you were just being ignorantly sarcastic...
I went there again and got even worse costumer service as the first 20 or 30 times before. This time the counter person/zombie just stared out the door while I was standing at the counter to order. So (not that it matters to you obviously) I will never step into your place of awkward type of business again. 
Keep up the GREAT WORK!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. I love this place but I don't like one of the ladies that work as a cashier. Her attitude sucks and she doesn't get orders correct. They charge extra for everything. Overall the best I've had here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love their carne Asada fries!! Lots of flavor, quick service. I always call and order ahead and food is always ready and still hot."}
{"text":"Started out comparable to Robertos, but has gotten gradually worse.Super nachos barely have any meat on them!! I'd rather make the drive to find Robertos."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!! I had heard so many good things about this place so I decided to go in there and i got a torta de milanesa and they gave me some meat that was so burnt black and hard like a rock it was horrible I would've broken my teeth if I would be a lil older I will never recommend this place to anyone ever and this is why:  I call back and I talked to a young lady named lupe new employee (2days old so she said ) that tells me to come get a new one... r u kidding me I've been working all day it's a 20 min drive to go back I'm not even hungry anymore and she said she doesn't even know what the manager name is really!!! She said there's really nothing that she can do for me and that there is no manager at the time to come in tomorrow! WFT THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT!!!"}
{"text":"So this is the first time at this location and it's pretty good. We had their version of Robertos chicken tacos and these were more like a taco salad. Where was the chicken?? On he other hand, their asada fries were really good. Oh bring a sweater if you are always cold, the a/c is bumpin in there lol."}
{"text":"My hubby and I got food poisoning from their carne asada burrito. I tried to contact the manager but kept getting the run around..."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant! Quick food & the staff is always friendly & my food always comes out perfect. Love their shrimp ceviche & it's 24 hours! 

When your buzzed & starving, the food here is so much better than Del Taco or Jack in the box :)"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and had a bad experience with the food. The chile relleno was the oiliest one I ever had. I don't know what else was on the plate but it seemed like an empty tortilla, the two tacos we ordered were carnitas, they were decent but I've had better, the Menudo was so gross that my girlfriend couldn't even eat it, pretty sad considering we were told this was a good spot, all around let down. The best thing was the salsa bar, if I knew that I wouldve stood there and ate for free lol. But I'd say I would be willing to give it another try, but if mexican food is on my mind, I'm sure id go elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. 

I usually frequent this location for taco Tuesday and ALWAYS get soft tacos for 99 cents. I decided to bring my family in today and could not get a worst cashier. No greeting, but instead a hand gesture telling us to wait and then she disappeared to do other things without even a greeting. When ordering, she was rude and outright insolent when SHE made a mistake while taking my order. I left without ordering. Want a good Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood? Go to the Choice gas station on Rainbow."}
{"text":"I think this places food is great!! The salsa is fantastic. I've never been inside, just drive thru. But it's always been great. The only thing is the wait is pretty long in the drive thru. 5 minutes for a bean and cheese burrito. But, foods good so I'll come back. Better that Robertos."}
{"text":"Different name, but still the same still of food. It is greasy, salty, and one of those essential eats after a drunken night. Beef rolled tacos with guacamole or the California burrito hits the spot when my head is pounding and my stomach is churning. That is right, no eating healthy when you might have alcohol poisoning. Instead just give your gut another punch.

With every purchase, you are welcomed to pack as much from the salsa bar as you wish. I end up eating a bag and a half of the spicy veggie mix. Although the carrots lost their crunch and the seasoning is not hot, it was still a nice accompaniment to the Mexican food. I also prefer the green salsa to the red. Make sure to pick up some radishes and limes to cut the grease."}
{"text":"This place was horrible and disgusting.  I love Mexican food but this place is the worst.  I ordered through drive thru and that great. When I got to the window to pay, I asked the cashier if the food was fresh and if the food they made was greasy? She said that the food was not greasy and the food was fresh. My order was sixty dollars and change, so yes we were expecting great food. It took a while and we understood the wait, that wasn't our complaint. Once we got the three bags that completed our order I noticed that something had opened, was heavy leaking or it might of been a mistake. We opened the bag and it was grease spilling out three burritos. It wasn't just like a teaspoon like but a lot. Exaggerated like and it was so disappointing to see that. So we opened the other two bags and the food looked so greasy with grease sitting in the to go plates. I got the cashiers attention as I was still by the window.  I asked her and showed her then her response was to get the cook.  The cook came up and said the meat is in water (its juice) and of course it's going to come on your food.  He said he can drain it but can't remake it. Told him that we wanted a refund and said that all sales were final. We argued a little then drove off, couldn't believe we just wasted $60. and change. Went to Roberto's and reordered and got a better product. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Pretty much exactly what one would expect from a taco joint like this one. Visited here at 5:00am due to minimal open restaurants and a slight craving for some tacos. I ordered their breakfast burrito and a few carne asada tacos. 

The meat quality in the tacos was very poor and bland, the cilantro/tomato and other veggies inside the taco tasted like they were left in room temperature. The lack of fresh veggies and grade F meat combined for a mediocre taco at best. 

The breakfast burrito which consisted of steak, cheese, and eggs also disappointed on the same level as the tacos. The taste was extremely bland and the steak had qualities more align with rubber than it did beef. One pro is the size of the burrito which was bigger than a burrito from chipotle. Although, it's a bit ironic because who wants to eat more of something they don't enjoy...

This would be a 1 star review but it is 2 because of the good service that was provided by the single man running the entire place. The order also came out surprisingly quick given that one man ran the register and prepared the food. 

Unless it's a lack of options, I will most likely not return."}
{"text":"Food is always fast, fresh. Service is great & always friendly. Top places to eat alone or w/ the fam"}
{"text":"The worst service ever!!!!!! OK food. And don't expect your food to be ready even if you order for pickup. I only go here because it's close to my house. I'm seriously considering driving a mile further to go to the next Mexican fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"One star for these guys only because the food is ok !! But what set me off is I called for a to go order 20 min before I arrived    when I got there they didnt even put in my order so do yourself a favor dont call in to go !! If you are making a To go order call roberto's instead it's up the road"}
{"text":"Not bad! I pass it all the time but had never been. Noticed they had a drive thru so I popped through after a long day at work and I didn't feel loved like cooking. Not to mention I was a little hungover and needed something with some substance. This was exactly what the doctor ordered. I ordered the chimichanga and it was HUGE and quite tasty.  It also came with a healthy portion of Mexican rice and re fried beans. More than enough to have as another meal. The chili sauce on the side had a nice amount of heat and a really flavorful smokiness to it. Very similar to Roberto's. I will go another time to see how their breakfast burritos compare. Because of the proximity to my house, large portion and the convenience of the drive thru I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Horrible service . A few fiends and i came
In to get something that should have been quick to
Eat ! It turned into us being there for 45 minutes cause they let Somone take off with a friends order . The manager didn't know how to refund the order which made no sense . On top of the the food is disgusting ! I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Quick and yummy!  Make sure you check for coupons and daily specials on their website.  This business is in the parking lot as Taco Bell.  Why would someone chose Taco Bell?  They are practically the same price.  Everything is yummy!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. We have tried many different things on the menu. I have to say we have not been disappointed at all. We usually drive all the way to the north side of town for some good Mexican food, but this definitely does the fix. big plus so close to home."}
{"text":"Great food, always fresh and very clean. Love it! California burrito with no pico add guac...is deeeelicious!!"}
{"text":"I walked in nobody was there I waited 5 minutes started to order repeated my self three times
She than turns around to get the chef lady she didn't ever wash her hands she used gloves also used gloves to ring up a guy that walked it
Terrible service food was ok
I have 2 videos that won't allow me to post
Anyways dirty girls over priced food"}
{"text":"Food is OK, not as good as Roberto's, so we usually drive the extra few minutes to get there. But we stoped by the other night and the single employee on duty was telling everyone \"cash only.\" How inconvenient, we don't often carry cash. We went to Roberto's."}
{"text":"After my last visit and check in here, I realized that I come here a lot. It's convenient, especially if my lunch hour has been cut short for some unforeseen reason. It's cheap and I can be filled up for under 10 bucks. The staff is always friendly and they get me in and out pretty quick. Everything is clean and spotless so you won't get that stomach churning feeling as you look around like you do in other taco shops.

I like coming in on Wednesdays where their special is a carnitas burrito and drink for $4.99. The pork is crispy from the flat top combined with their pico and guac, and some horchata, it makes for a nice little lunch. They also have a chicken taco special on Tuesdays along with specials that run every day which include a breakfast burrito special and some other combos.  I have no complaints with their tortas or tostadas also. Portions are just right for a volume eater like myself and every protein I've tried has not disappointed.

I think this place is a step below other nearby places like Roberto's or Fausto's because of the larger menus, but the drop off isn't that much. The convenience factor, because of lack of waiting times, and service are the main reasons I come back. The food is typical and expected but I don't see myself stopping from coming in, especially if I'm pressed for time."}
{"text":"The worst Don Tortaco ever the portion way to small, To go we as for no beans we got just beans on our nachos asada and our carme asada burrito  it's was so f**** bad and cold too"}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing  tonight very flavorful, staff very courteous. Made us feel like part of the family. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Food is usually always good. I'm just getting tired of calling an order in and them not even starting it until I arrive. What's the point of taking a to go order if you can't ever come through with the time it will be ready over the phone?"}
{"text":"meh-

Carnitas was super duper fatty and crispy in other parts b/c it was like refried. So not very healthy at all.  Like I was picking through parts of it to find the edible parts in my opinion. guac was good, pico de gallo was good, tortillas were good. 

I don't think I'd run there anytime soon and probably would opt for Del Taco across the street if I was craving Mexican that badly.

My favorite mexican place is still Border Grille at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"I don't like doing these types or reviews but this is absolutely unbelievable. My husband went next door to get dinner since we have a new baby at home and don't have time to cook. He ordered the carne asada nachos like always. And brought it home. We were busy with our other 2 kids and didn't get to eat until just now..... This photo is what he sat down to. I don't understand why this would be acceptable to anyone especially the one who is making it. Mind you, no food was eaten from the container. It is messy from the transportation home."}
{"text":"Wow. Just... wow. Never again. This place is a rip-off. It was dead-empty when I walked in, which was cool because I didn't have to wait in line. I immediately ordered some carne asada \"super\" nachos, which cost me damn near $10 (the price of a large supreme pizza or a movie ticket). They made my food in a timely manner, but it was about a 1/3-1/4 of the size of the carne asada nachos from Roberto's. I figured it would at least be a lot better tasting. WRONG!!! The steak was chewy and grisly, the cheese was barely melted, and the pickled carrots from the salsa bar were mushy. I ate my food as quickly as possible and left never to look back. Roberto's' version of this meal may be incredibly greasy and make you hate yourself after eating it, but, most of the time, they at least hook it up and give you what you pay for.

Go to Taco Y Taco instead. There, you get great service, delicious food made from fresh ingredients, and it doesn't feel like a cut-rate wannabe Roberto's. I'm looking at these other positive reviews and it makes me question the state of mind some of those people were in when they wrote them (probably drunk and/or stoned out of their minds at 3:00 in the morning and needed something to quell their munchies)."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever! The quality of the food served is truly gag-worthy. Not huge on writing bad reviews but I am for sure huge on honesty and this place blows. #twothumbsdown #betteroffwithricearoni"}
{"text":"My boss and I celebrate taco Tuesday every week. Our usual is Roberto's, but every once in a while we will do Tacos El Gordo. We decided to really switch things up a couple of weeks ago and try Don Tortaco. 
It's bigger than the Roberto's that we frequent, and cleaner! 
Don Tortaco has one thing that the other places don't, CARNITAS!!! 
We fell in love with their carnita tacos! 
My only complaints would be that the beans are not as smooth as others. The red salsa is burn your face off hot. 
And they need more locations!"}
{"text":"This place is equivalent to Robertos, but not really. It's like a better version of Robertos if that helps. Also, if you go to their website they have mobile coupons like a dollar off, buy one get one 50% off, and a couple others. 

I've tried their Carne asada nachos, taco salad, chicken taco with a chicken enchilada plate. Meanwhile, lover man has had their carnitas plate. Each visit the food has been tasty and FRESH! Pork isn't something I order when eating out, so having the husband do the dirt for me works out. Our last visit the carnitas tasted like it was straight off a pig that has just got done roasting. It was so homely. My favorite part about is was there was a crisp to it, yet, ridiculously moist and tender. 

There isn't anything extra spectacular about the dishes I've had. Like I've typed...this place to me is like an upgraded version of Robertos but nothing that you can't find elsewhere. Each time their salsa bar has been fully stocked, restaurant has been clean, and the food being cooked with effort. Never had an old and dry experience. Customer service can be kinda iffy because out of all the times we have gone we only had 1 instance when the cashier greeted us immediately and seemed actually content working.

Overall, I could see why folks may give it 3 stars, but I felt with our food experience...gotsta give it a 4 because it personally has been a far better option than heading to Robertos. Plus, those online coupons sure make it more worth going. But hey...Nothing to drive across town for if you got a good neighborhood taco shop.

We don't got alot of 24hr taco shops in our vicinity so if you're tweaking late at night and got the Mexican jonez, annnnd wanna head somewhere other than Robertos...this is your place.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly. But the 1 highchair that was available for us to use during that time...the buckle doesnt buckle. Hell, one of the teeth to the buckles are missing. Nothing like holding your taco on one hand while holding your toddler down with the other so he doesn't start doing the cupid shuffle on his highchair. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I work right down the street and decided to go for a bean/cheese on my lunch break, and compared to faustos & robertos this place isn't very good at all. I went again cause I was hungry and I'm pregnant so maybe I was just extra hungry and got the chicken chimichanga which is my favoriteeee!! And it totally sucked the beans had no flavor to them, the rice was good and the chimichanga was so watery. It was disappointing"}
{"text":"Pretty good place over all.  Husband had the nachos and I had the asada torta.  Only suggestion is please clean up the place a little.  The outside of the trash receptacle was disgusting.  I didn't even want to touch it to throw away my trash.  Looked like it has never been cleaned."}
{"text":"The food here is better then ok but the service sucks ass. There rude and they make you feel like your bothering them when ever you ask a question. Not going to this location again. Its worth it to drive a couple more minutes to the other location."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE. I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas combination. I waited around 30 minutes for my food and i understand some thing take longer to cook than others, but i saw people walking in and out the door. I went up to the counter to ask how long it would be and then they proceed to hand me my food. I check it and it turns out they're 2 cheese quesadillas. First of all, I never ordered the quesadillas. Secondly, it doesn't take 30 minutes to even make quesadillas? I begin to tell the girl that this is wrong and she argues with me and says she heard quesadilla, which doesnt add up because my boyfriend was with me and heard me say enchilada clearly. People make mistakes I get it, but she didn't want to fix the problem. I'm willing to pay the difference, but then she starts speaking bad about me in spanish to the chef? I know that I appear caucasian, but I am actually hispanic myself and speak spanish fluently. Then they throw together 2 cold enchiladas in less than a minute and i didn't even get the combo which I asked for in the first place. I left unsatisfied with nasty food. Never coming back again. Ever since they changed owners this place has gone down hill."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. We were the only ones in the drive thru, ordered 3 orders of carne asada fries but it took about 20 minutes for them to make them. When we tried them, they had beans in them... Yuck! I'm from San Diego and they never put beans in their carne asada fries. What were the people from this place thinking?"}
{"text":"This location has gone down hill and now there's a toothpick or some wood in my Bean cheese burrito. Bit down and hurt my teeth."}
{"text":"Don Tortaco is within spitting distance of my place and that's really the only reason I've been here a few times. 

I'm pretty sure this place is exactly the same as Roberto's. Are they owned by the same people? I have no idea, but their menu is identical.

The few times I've been here, I ordered the same thing that I get at Roberto's: chicken nachos. It's a few coins under $7 and is definitely enough for two people... or one person who is down with leftovers. 

I don't know, there's something that is in these nachos that always kinda cramps my stomach so I generally don't eat here unless it's a food emergency and I'm legitimately starving. They're open 24/7 so... it works in a pinch.

It does get insanely busy because they're next door to some sort of school-type tutor place, so be prepared for a wait at certain times."}
{"text":"Called this place around 7am to order a breakfast burrito. Called 3 times to no answer. It's right around the corner, so I drove there in 5 mins. Two people were working, one cleaning the chairs and one the kitchen. No customers. So I figured they just didn't want to answer since they didn't want to have make food. I ordered anyway, since they are open and getting paid to serve me. They took my order and I tried to pay win my card. The cashier turned the card reader off, I watched it, then swiped my card and immediately looked up to me and said, \"Sorry, we can't help you. The card reader isn't working.\" Not asking if I can pay with cash, just \"can't help you.\" They REALLY did not want make any food! Very annoying! Just don't be open if you're not going to serve food. Stop wasting people's time. 

Food is pretty good when they serve it though, so I'll give it two stars. Service is horrible."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! I just stumbled upon this place. Great food. PLUS they have dollar taco nights (Monday & Wednesday)"}
{"text":"The food was standard Don Tortaco food. The dinning room needs repairs for sure. There wasn't one table that wasn't broken. All the chairs were in need repairs as well."}
{"text":"Went in on taco tuesday and recieved tacos with  chicken the equivalent of 1 chicken nugget on my tacos wtf is this atlease Robertos gives a nice chunk of chicken on there taco specials im not sure if its a race thing at this place or is everyone elses chicken tacos are fun size portion please let me know this is horrible and I will never pay this place again for these I should say lettuce and cheese tacos with a teaspoon of chicken if I find out im the only 1 who gets bite sized tacos then I will take further action."}
{"text":"These are hands-down the best Carne Asada fries I have ever had the seasoning on the Carne Asada is amazing it was hot fresh and I almost want to call to tell the chef he did a good job but I'm going to finish eating my Asada french fries first LOL and you know they're amazing because they're already halfway gone lol"}
{"text":"I was elated to learn there was a Don Tortaco drive thru opening nearby. They have appetizing eats when you're craving mexican fare. A few of my favorites are carne asada fries, chorizo and egg entree, and chicken enchiladas. Also every time I've ordered at the drive thru, the customer service has been fantastic. Welcoming every time. The menu is huge for a little place, and everyone is sure to find something to satisfy their south of the border craving."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here! You will have a brief wait since everything is made fresh to order.

The corn tortillas are extremely fresh and soft. My meal order is selected just to get these tortillas ... They are that good.

It's very clean and the staff are pleasant."}
{"text":"Warning... This place is addicting. The food is fabulous and the people are friendly. Don't be surprised if you make a midnight stop or 4:00am drive thru stop. They're open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Ok so I give them between 2-3 stars. I went ahead and gave them 3 here.
I like things and I dislike things about this place... What I LIKE and why I came here twice was the food is actually REALLY good... Better than the other Don Tortaco I live by. This location makes better Vegetarian burritos. They make REALLY good carne asada tacos, the corn tortilla they use is bigger and like homemade. Chili relleno burrito is SoOoo GooD!  Both times I went food was great...As far as I can tell the people who work there are very nice too.

Dislikes: They take forever!!  I have waited like ten minutes in the drive through and I was the only car. I wouldn't care if they took their time and the order was right but the second time we came we waited HELLA long , drove all the way home to find no cheese quesadilla... Drove back. Really annoying. 

Otherwise, the food is great. I don't mind waiting for it. Just get the order correct and I will feed from this place like a kitten suckling guacamole from its' mother's green tic-tacs."}
{"text":"So far so good!
Every time I order they make no mistakes, everything is fresh, hot , cheese is melted.  They listen and do it right
I really like the vegetarian burritos they toast the tortilla its very good! I also get the  regular cheese quesadilla.
My bf gets the tortas and the lengua. Both good.
I like the DIY drink area, and of course the self help salsa bar.
They keep the place clean and the food correct. That is all a returning customer asks for.
Keep it good guys!"}
{"text":"EWW No. 

I don't know what happened to this place.

I got to 3 different Don Tortacos...So i know when something is off or bad. So far the other locations make GOOD food and have GOOD service. This one is laking in BOTH.

Todays event is was what made we write this. 
Went there around 2:30. Ordered some food. 
When I got home and took everything out of the bag, there was a CLOUDY GREEN puddle of liquid at the bottom..  The one burrito was saturated with so much of the liquid that the wrapping paper would not come off. It was MELTED on to it.
I was so pissed I had to drive all the way back, leaving my guest to wait for me to eat.

I figured the girl in the front counter would offer something different, but when I showed her the smothered wet burrito her reply was \" oh thats the cheese.\" 
Really? 
Your cheese is green and wet and drips from the burritos? Fantastic!... Not really.

She didn't offer another substitute, she didn't even offer to help, or suggest to make something else. 

I just asked for my money back. I didn't want anything anyways. Not from this place ever again.... The DIY salsa bar had rotten radishes in it, so rotten they were curling. The limes were brown as well... They seem to not care about anything here.
Their guacamole was slimy and watered down. The worst Don Tortaco in Vegas.

My boyfriend came here before and had the same experience ,when one of his items was left out of his to go bag. She forgot to put it in his order, he has to sit and wait while everyone else got their food, till his one item was done that she forgot. He was the first customer there and last to leave. 

I hope management sees this, and recognizes."}
{"text":"Food is GOOD price is NOT.... Everyone seems so unhappy at this location... makes me not want to go back :(

Update: the place changed ownership and the cooks are awful!!! Nothing taste good like it used to... Burnt or dry.... So sad !!!"}
{"text":"bueno! quick easy friendly classic bomb mexican food. i work in the area and choose don tortaco for my breakfast burrito needs and/or chicken nacho fix. well loved by me and my coworkers. freshly made. great green sauce"}
{"text":"Do not go to the blue diamond location. The service is awful. I felt like I unwelcomed. Their cook was told to make chicken nachos for my order. However, when I got home, I had beef. It is too much of a hassle to go back in there and deal with them. So I'm just deciding to stay as far away from there as possible. It also smelled rancid in there."}
{"text":"If I could give you a 0 I would. Not only do they have the wrong number listed so you can't call them. They charged me $10 for 2 MEATLESS tacos. I make up my own taco because I'm a vegan. You should have at least 1 vegetarian option. And the lady had a attitude. You shouldn't overcharge like that. I will NOT be back or recommending ANYONE. The SW locations suck. All of them and they have terrible customer service"}
{"text":"I went and got the cheese enchiladas. First of all I asked for no lettuce in them, and they came out with lettuce. Whatever I just picked it off. Enchiladas were ok in the end. The Spanish rice and beans were very bland. I could tell salt was needed and maybe something else. I feel like this is one of the places that are good on certain days. Did not have the best experience, but did not have the worst. We came around 11 PM.



... update in the end 15 minutes later I threw it all up, never again"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 chili rellenos from this place with a side of rice and got this instead. I specifically  stated i wanted NO bean.  Im vegetarian and can't eat them.  I wanted rice.  And got double beans and no rice instead. I get its Mexican food , but English is still the national language.  If you don't know it you shouldn't be working on a job that requires you to speak the native tongue. I paid money for this bean covered mess. 10$ to be exact."}
{"text":"Nasty chilakilles one of the worst i had 
Went I got home uoss to late..

Clean place 
I was there b4 for a burrito and was kindda ok ...

May come back to that location ..."}

Plus egg under cook .
Well at least was real eggs..
And the girl on the counter was nice...
I think she was the only one there ...
Better deal on other taco shops"}
{"text":"FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!
They don't take they own website coupons
Nasty attitude by the lady boss
Not the pour new cashier lady she was nice but clueless"}
{"text":"Food was not worth it . Food tasted like it was from a can . The meat in my burrito was greasy and they rolled the burrito in a way that you're eating mostly tortilla. I'm Mexican and will never go back ."}
{"text":"I live across the street and wanted this place to be great so I could stop in for a late meal or a random lunch. In my humble opinion its average at best. 

Food is almost bland no real flavors as I think they want you to dump salsa or peppers all over it. 

Taco Bell is right across the lot if you are desperate but you will have to really have a taco craving that cant be satisfied for that."}
{"text":"Walked here for a late night snack. Always so friendly. Ordered bean burrito with grilled veggies. So good!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! I always get the chicken tacos with just cheese and guac, no lettuce. Or the chicken rolled tacos. I like this place better than the competitors!!"}
{"text":"Should of known this would suck when I saw how watered down their salsas were. Everything I got was sub par. Everything. The rice, the beans, my taco (almost no beef), my enchilada (no cheese), and the rolled tacos with guac. ( little guac and beef). Pretty much everything I ordered was watered down Mexican food. Feel ripped off."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  I was glad that thos Don Tortaco's had someone that spoke English but the breakfast burrito I have gotten at least 5 times. (at other locations) Was higher prices by $2 bucks.  I stopped going  to Roberto's because they raised their prices and bow Don's too?  Well idk if it was just this location but the breakfast burrito although good is to small for $5."}
{"text":"I've been to Don Tortaco before and it's great, especially for late night food. This one, however, was not open 24 hours even when it clearly says it's open 24 hours on the store front. I'm never up late eating food like this, but if I am up, I want something to be open without any issues. I walked up to this place and it was completely shut down. No lights, no staff, nothing! It was all shut down and I was literally standing next to a sign that said 24/7 while standing in front of the restaurant. I would definitely make sure you know when it's open or closed so you're not wasting your time like I clearly did."}
{"text":"Decided to give my neighborhood taco shop a try.The older women that works there is a complete bitch & gives you a hard time.the salsa bar was a mess with napkins on the floor.They're food has no favor !!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food but horrible horrible customer service. I called in to make a phone order and halfway though my order, placed on hold then was hung up on. I called back and was immediately asked if I still wanted my order and I asked why did you hang up on me; he said he said hello twice and nothing so he hung up. I cancelled my order. This is not the first time, I've had horrible customer service but this is the last time I will go back. I do speak Spanish so there was nothing lost in translation!"}
{"text":"GOOD GRUB

I recommend this taco shop.  You get a mountain of stick-to-your-ribs grub. 

The clinic next door opens at 8 a.m. Get there before it opens and you can get right in.  After 8, the waiting room fills up quickly.  

The aromas wafting from this eatery will get to you.  I had a machaca plate to go.  The cashier was spooning avocado meat into a bucket.  Fresh guacamole--Great! How long before the guacamole is ready? I asked.  About 10 minutes.  Good.  I'll wait.

The cashier gave me a container of sliced avocados instead.  She charged $2.25--more than guacamole.  Why the hell was she giving me sliced avocados? I took 'em and kept my mouth shut. Sometimes it's OK to let things slide.  Why let a technicality spoil the mood?  Feliz Navidad and all that.

\"She probably didn't understand English,\" Lucinda said.  \"Since when is guacamole an English word?\"

I used to be a great Mexican food enthusiast.  Now that I'm an old geezer the food is very heavy on my stomach.  We came here strictly on impulse. 

I have never liked eating or drinking from styrofoam, so that's a drawback.  But you know that going in.  I put the sliced avocados in the fridge and forgot about 'em."}
{"text":"Horrible- Unclean, rancid, foul odors, unkempt, and poor service. The restaurant was nearly empty, and the cashier didn't even look up to say hello as my husband stood hungrily grinning at the counter. Needless to say, I talked him into driving up the road to the other location. This one is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have driven passed Don Tortaco on Horizon Rdige several times. Being lunch time we decided to stop in and try it out. I figured it was like Roberto's but it turned out to be much better! 

Luckily, we arrived just before the lunch rush. The prices are very reasonable and we asked for suggestions from the friendly cashier. She recommended the carne asada nachos which we ordered, along with the #4- two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. For around $15 it was a lot of food. 

The nachos were HUGE. Loaded to the top of the container with steak, two cheeses, sour cream and beans it was really good. Usually with nachos you run out of toppings before chips, but this was not the case at Don Tortaco, it was almost the opposite! The cheese enchiladas were good as well as the rice and beans, just not as great as the nachos. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food here and very reasonable prices. I would  definitely return again."}
{"text":"I must say, this place is fantastic!  Real authentic Mexican food.  You also do not get a small portion of food for what you order. You still can have leftovers.   Prices are great!  Taste is fabulous and a must keep going to eat place,"}
{"text":"My second night in a row. Great food after a night out if your craving for greasy food. My ultimate favorite, Carne asada nachos. This is good food that \"I'll regret eating the next morning\", a very good reason to hit the gym the next day.

This spot is clean, the staff is friendly and every time I go, somehow I meet new people, I guess the customers are friendly as well."}
{"text":"Good food and great customer service when ever I come here. Close to my house and convenient parking.  My go to place for Mexican food"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this particular location has horrible service and the food is never good... do yourself a favor and go to the Don Tortaco literally less than a mile up the street."}
{"text":"I just can't get pass eating off of Styrofoam or paper plates. It ruins any experience for me unless it's a picnic, BBQ, or at the beach. Otherwise, give me a plate and some silverware! I ordered the cheese enchiladas and the cheese was not melted. I did enjoy the shredded beef burrito I had to go the next day."}
