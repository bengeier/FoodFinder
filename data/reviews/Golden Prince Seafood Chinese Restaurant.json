{"text":"This little gem located in a small plaza on brimely and 14th. At first i saw the pictures and reviews on yelp. But oh boy i was wrong to take a chance at what seemed to be a good restaurant. The menu is all in chinese, no english. There are some words we noticed on the menu. They took advantage of us not knowing how to read chinese and overpriced the food we ordered.  When the bill came that just one item we ordered it went from $15.99 to $50 something. We asked why, they just kept insisting with no reasoning. They lied also about the type of items they served, a 1 pnd dungenous crab became a (2.5 pound dungenous crab), even though it was the size of just one hand it was $60 on the bill. Terrible service, only cash and will take advantage  of anyone.

I sure ate my money that  night, my time. I felt i was sucked by a vampire afterwards."}
{"text":"I came to Golden Prince on a weeknight with my parents.  Being a regular weeknight, we didn't feel it was necessary to make a reservation.  Our confidence was almost our undoing - the place was very busy!  We managed to snag a table and I never noticed a lineup, but the restaurant was at capacity during the prime dinner hours.

The owner works as part of the service staff and is extremely friendly.  I think she cares quite a bit about her clientele.  She knew that we were new customers, and she could identify the regular patrons.  Pretty impressive considering the number of people that must come through here.  The restaurant itself looks like a typical Chinese restaurant: seafood tank, non-descript chairs and tables, and paper signage plastered all over the wall.  If you can't read Chinese, consider this your warning: you will have difficulty here.  There is not a word of English on any of the menus.

For dinner, we ordered the sweet and sour pork, shreds of chicken and pork neck with vegetables, egg omelette with oysters, and a hot pot (not the kind with boiling broth, but just a really hot pot) of offal with green onion.  They claim that their sweet and sour pork is the best, and it certainly is very good.  It's not as red and sickly sweet as other versions.  The chicken and pork neck dish was the best of the night.  All components were perfectly cooked, and the amount and size of the neck pieces were generous.  The egg omelette with oysters was unfortunately way too salty, requiring a ton of rice to battle the salty effect.  The hot pot of offal with green onion was also a tasty dish, if you are into eating innards.  The complementary tureen of soup was clean flavoured, but not that exciting.  Overall, the food was good, and decent value for the price.  

The one major slip up of the night was in the service.  Absolutely nothing happened after we put in our order, to the point where tables seated well after us got food before we did.  When we brought this to the attention of the owner, she made sure we got our food next, but considering our table was in an area where many servers (including the owner) passed through, I found it surprising that nobody noticed and nobody checked in on us.  I'd like to think that this is a rare occurrence, but it has to be mentioned, unfortunately.  

I think that Golden Prince, if I came on a day when they were firing on all cylinders , is capable of four stars.  But I can only go with what I know, and the egg omelette and being the \"forgotten table\" can't be ignored.  It could be worth going back just for the pork neck, but then again, there are lot of Chinese restaurants in Markham to try!"}
{"text":"This place is very hidden but definitely worth the hunt. Good food we ordered some sweet fried oysters and sweet and sour pork, along with some over food but those two stood out. 

Really friendly staff, they even gave us a free entree. 

Decor is very HK tradition style so don't expect super fancy."}
{"text":"We use to be regulars here since it's so close by and the food is pretty good too! We love the sweet and sour pork and they make amazing fish dishes. I have yet to be disappointed with any of their fish dishes.  

Service is fast and the staff are really kind! Parking is always a breeze since it's such a small plaza that no one really goes to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hidden in a small strip mall in a quieter area of town. Which is a good thing because it means you don't have to fight for a parking space unlike another strip mall around the corner. Don't judge by the outside though, which is covered with pictures of sea animals and kinda weird looking. I would never have walked into this place if not for a recommendation from a friend and subsequent visits from my parents. 

The menu has the usual Chinese restaurant fare, which means you order several dishes to share with the whole table. The serving size is decent and flavors are good. They make a great sweet and sour pork, if you look around the place, every table has a dish of it on their table. The chicken is good also. The star of the dinner tonight was definitely the king crab. We went simple and just asked for it to be cooked without seasoning to really get the authentic natural flavor of the crab. The crab meat was delicious and crab shell was broken down in a way that you could easily access all the meat without a big struggle. I will take recommendations from yelp for the next family meal and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty hidden. located in the strip mall at 14th Ave and Brimley.  If you just walk in without pre-order any dishes, you won't understand why I like this restaurant.

My favourite pre-order dishes are:
 - King Crab with what-ever they recommended cooking methods
 - Taro Duck
 - Ask them what kinda fish is fresh, then just let them surprise you.

All the seafood are so fresh and delicious!!

Sweet and Sour Pork is also very good, and this item is on their regular menu, no need to pre-order.

When we make our reservation, we will pre-order our dishes at the same time.  Ask them what kinda ingredients are fresh, and we go for their recommendations a lot.

Staff are nice, of course, and very helpful.

The decor is a bit old, but I don't care.  I only come here for the food, not their decor."}
{"text":"Food is a 3 star but I give a 4 star for effort.
The place has a bad location but still manages to survive. Its located in a small plaza with nothing much there to attract people to visit. 

Once seated we were given menus but noticed right away that there was no English. Not sure if there was any English menu but my dad was doing all the ordering so it was okay for us. We decided on the $68 prefix meal which came with a steamed fish, mixed seafood/veggie, half a chicken and sweet and sour pork. We added an eel cooked two ways for $38 (deep fried with light breading and other with sweet sauce). 

Once we finished ordering the lady serving us who I can only assume was the owner said we really didn't have much veggies so she said she would give us a veggie dish free. Meal starts off with a soup which I can best describe as being seafood mixed with eggs. I know I'm not describing it right but just look at the picture.

The rest of the food started arriving very shortly. While we were eating the owner starts to chat up my dad asking which area we live and asking us to come back more often. I guess this is how she gets return customers because throughout the night other customers came in and the owner would address them by name like they are regulars. And this didn't just happen once but with several other customers throughout the night.

I thought she was very kind and genuinely asking and almost begging for business. 

The food itself is typical Chinese food you can find anywhere else. The eel for $38 was way over priced and tasted decent only. The meal ended with tofu-fa which was really good and with another effort to retain us as regular customers the owner gave us some extra tofu-fa in a container to take home. 

So counting all the extra effort this lady put in I really have to give it an extra point."}
{"text":"This place is the typical Chinese family restaurants you grew up to if you are born before the millennium - dated decor, quite run down, dirty washrooms but good simple food.
Menus are mostly in Chinese and features are hand written on the walls.
A lot of their dishes are good. Their \"house chicken\" is crispy like the Chinese wedding fried chicken, but still very juicy. Seafood is fresh. Stir fries are also good, especially those with beef tenderloin or pork cheeks. Everything is on the very flavourful side, to the extent it's too heavy handed with the salt. I don't recall much that isn't satisfactory here for dishes.
Staff is polite and friendly, but definitely tries hard with upsells.
Their prices have gone up over the years and the diners have gotten fewer by the visit...such a shame."}
{"text":"Golden Prince is a local Chinese restaurant located in the small plaza of 14th Avenue and Brimley Road. It is one of my favourite go-to restaurants because the quality of food and service is always up to par! Food is fresh and delicious (????!), staff is friendly and quick... even the food comes out of the kitchen really fast!

Before I start on anything else, I must say that they have the BEST sweet and sour pork in town! Golden yellow pork nuggets, lightly battered and fried to add a bit of a crisp, then mixed with a very light but delicious sauce. It is definitely NOT your typical red and doughy battered ones like you would get at Manchu Wok lol. And for many years, I still have not yet found another restaurant that can top this one! #mustorder #nokidding

We have come to know Anne, the owner, for many years since we frequent this restaurant at least once or twice a month. She is always cheery and friendly, very accommodating and hardworking. She often comes up with new menu items to wow her customers! She guarantees all the food ingredients are always fresh since she does the food purchasing everyday,  and sometimes she grows her own herbs and veggies in her own backyard too!

Anne leads a great team of staff from front of house to back. This place definitely needs to be recognized :) Keep up the great work! Oh and be sure to make a reservation, this place can get a bit busy even during the weekdays. #supportlocalbusiness"}
{"text":"Golden Prince is your average Chinese restaurant.  It's tucked away in a little unassuming plaza on Brimley and 14th Ave.  
The restaurant is small with a back private room for parties.

They are a little understaffed at this restaurant and that's why the garbage is 150% garbage even in comparison to other HK restaurants.  They will literally walk past you and not acknowledge that you just asked them for something and then come back 5 minutes later asking what you needed.  

The food was honestly pretty good though.  They had decent size servings and it was mostly all delicious.
- vegetable fried beef
- pork neck with celery
- 'free run' chicken
- their specialty fish with steamed egg white (this is a pre-order)
- taro duck in a pot - this was only the meeeehhh item just because I've had it better in other restaurants

Getting the cheque honestly took 100 years.  

I'm definitely going to come back in the future for the taro duck that's fried and everything else I've ordered above (minus taro duck pot)."}
{"text":"This place is hidden. I won't know this place until my friend recommend.

 The deco was very \"regular\", not fancy and don't expect anything. Service was great, very friend and nicely. 

The menu wasn't special compare any other chinese restaurant.  The special dishes are not in the menu, you need to call and place the order 1-2 days before. 
Which I like the Taro duck, it's hard to find in other place. 
Seafood, we pre order the kingcrab.  The lady serving us told, she got the kingcrab from supplier same day to keep the food quality. 
The kingcrab, was cooked 3 ways, it's really fresh and yummy"}
{"text":"Golden Wok has changed their English name to Golden Prince but the Chinese name stayed the same.

They even kept the old menu but with new additions added. Most of the specials only written in Chinese on the wall.... For sure this is NOT a friendly restaurant for non Chinese reading customers!

We ordered 2 dishes to share. One is beef with fresh mushroom/soy curd and chinese cucumber with dried sea scallops/shell fish. (Hard to explain them in English!)

They both nicely cooked. More like something that are homemade and they are not too salty.

The dessert is sweet potatoes soup with tons of sweet potatoes inside... that's a really nice ending to the meal!

They no longer accept credit cards, CASH only!"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars way back... must have been 5-6 years ago. They were famous for their sweet and sour pork, which is still pretty good! 

My family and I came here for lunch on Saturday, and boy was this restaurant, not busy... there was only another table with us. This restaurant hasn't changed since the last time we were here... this was many years ago. 

The restaurant is very old looking, you will see with my pictures. A lot of construction workers come here. 

My family and I ordered, sweet and sour pork side of rice, garlic pork chop with fried rice, beef and Chinese broccoli fried rice noodle, and Cantonese fried noodle. I believe two were lunch specials, which are around $9.00. Not sure how much the fried noodles were - it was not on the menu. Their menu is very, very limited for lunch. It is literally two pages. 

The food was typical, nothing special, and very small dishes. Probably will not be back, maybe for dinner just to try it out."}
