{"text":"Called in a pick up order for a large pizza.
I was told to pick it up in 20 minutes.
When I went there 5 minutes prior to the pick
Up time, i stood there for a while.
The pizza took 30 minutes. I guess the guy was too busy wichatting with another customer and on the phone. 

I wasn't too impressed with the quality of the pizza either 
The chicken in the pizza was very weird. It was like Indian spicy chicken which really didn't compliment the pizza. The kids didn't enjoy much 

Will I go there again? Probably not"}
