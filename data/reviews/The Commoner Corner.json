{"text":"A Cuban sandwich is understood to be a hot pressed sandwich. I received a cold uncut sandwich on dry white bread. Not pleased."}
{"text":"Would have been an enjoyable brunch had our waitress not totally ignored us.  We had to ask someone to find her so we could order second drinks and took 20 minutes then to get them.  Wish I could say it was because they were busy but not at all.  Food was decent and a good thing since no one checked on us.  Seemed to be a lot of staff standing around who could have helped.  We are here for a wedding so our drinks later will be at another spot!"}
{"text":"We were late getting to breakfast in the main dining room, so we headed up here to get breakfast (it is just through the dining room, on the far side).  Small space, but efficiently used.  We got a mix of sandwiches and scrambles - all good, bacon was crisp, tasty sausage...eggs and potatoes needed a bit of seasoning, but nicely cooked.  I would go with the sandwich in the future.  Perfect latte.  Shakes were raved about - I got a teeny sip of each child's shake...delicious!    A really good option for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Very attentive service and attention to details. Aaron the General Manager and John and Deanna were fantastic. We had a group of 24 and all the details were handled smoothly. Food is excellent, lots of great appetizers and main courses. Drinks and wine list extensive and well executed. In particular the scallops and steak were a favorite entrees as well as the appetizers - dates wrapped in bacon, crab fritters with a hot jelly sauce, meat and cheese platters with varied items and grilled bread. Good veggie sides. Atmosphere is very cool, warm woods, marble tables, very clubby. Kimpton restaurants are always great. Unique and easy menus, great device and decor."}
{"text":"Prompt service. Good portion size. Very good quality. Only having brunch but will return for breakfast selection. Though address lists establishment on Strawberry street, go through the entrance inside the lobby of the hotel."}
{"text":"I come here more often than I'd like to admit for the killer breakfast sandwiches. It's right next to my office so it's convenient! The classic sandwich with two eggs and bacon is amazing as is the Ligonier. Service is always friendly at the corner as well."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to stop in and grab a sandwich at the commoner corner for a while now. I am always passing it on my way to Simpatico from my office. I finally stopped in and will be definitely going back. i ordered a hot beef sandwich on an onion roll with cheddar and garlic mayonnaise. it was really good. Jeremy made the sandwich quickly and was really wonderful to talk to. The sandwich was a little pricey, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. But it was overall delightful."}
{"text":"Your corner stop for breakfast and lunch!  If you're in downtown Pittsburgh, there aren't a ton of delis hat you can stop into and grab a sandwich. The Commoner Corner has a variety of options (premade to grab and go) or hot sandwiches/meals for whichever you have time for.  For breakfast, the Commoner Scramble is your best bet. It's delicious and filling, including bacon, eggs, sausage, and old bay dusted potatoes. Hold the toast!  Lunch is a toss up, but don't forget to ask for your sandwich to be cut in half! My favorite premade 'wich is the Southside Chicken Salad and hot is the Pastrami. And you can't go wrong with a grilled cheese on a cold day.  I've stopped here in a pinch way too many times, but I'll be back to grab more!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes this restaurant was amazing ...Matt was the best! yes I've been here three nights in a row and I am here for a conference and I have not been disappointed ...The cookies are to die for... in the middle of the night the leftovers are great!"}
{"text":"They need to rethink their menu portion sizes. Their buckwheat pancakes were HUGE and my wife and I split them along with our other smaller meals and we couldn't finish it. They had very weak flavor and were much too expensive as well.  The staff were nice and the place is cozy, but it's not for us - the value and taste is just not there. Hopefully they will get a chance to review and rethink their menu portion sizes and rework their recipes a bit."}
{"text":"Don't know where the negativity lies in reviews for The Commoner..Good service, , interesting menu. They definitely don't overbook for the staff scheduled. I.called for a reservation and could not get one as late as I would have preferred. It was definitely not at capacity, but I appreciate not overbooking.  Nice, attentive staff, fresh food--what's better on a Saturday evening?"}
{"text":"I work in the USX Tower and stop here nearly every morning on my way into the office. The prices are comparable to others in area but the difference is the size of the portions. I'll grab breakfast and don't eat again until dinner. Filling large-sized pancakes, breakfast sandwiches and so much more. I've had lunch here a couple of times as well; I love the beef sandwich. It's melt in your mouth delicious and also filling. Great little part of the main restaurant. The walk up window is awesome when I'm in a hurry. The coffee is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Don't order a smoothie, apparently. I stopped by at about 8:50 to get a carrot cake smoothie. They open at 7:30, so one would expect them to be moving like a well oiled machine by then. A woman was at the window and when I asked for my drink, she took a long pause and said she didn't know. She was the chef but would ask the barista if she can make it. She told me she would be back in 2 minutes. -Insert face palm emoji- Like really? You don't know if your establishment is able to make an item on your menu?? Why the heck are you even at the window taking orders? Sigh... so then another woman comes up and says \"did you want something?\" Not anymore Commoner Corner. Not anymore. I'm not paying $7 for crappy customer service."}
