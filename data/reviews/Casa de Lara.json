{"text":"There is nothing better than spending a Saturday with a good friend, good food and a margarita to spice it up! ;)
My friend Ale had never been to this restaurant so I decided to take her there. After I gave her a quick tour through the menu she decided to order the steak (rajas) which comes in a red chile sauce (pasilla and ancho chiles) with the steak, poblano chiles and chihuahua cheese on top, it was presented in a cute iron skillet. My friend liked it. I ordered my favorite one, plato caribeno (chicken), small chicken pieces with red, yellow and green bell peppers, the sauce it is sweet and tangy with pineapple undertones, the accompaniments are rice, black beans, small piles of salad with diced pineapple and sweet plantains. I loved the combination, it screams Caribbean! For me it's a piece of my dear country in my mouth because this restaurant is not 100% mexican, it has some Caribbean influences. I recommend this place, it has a homey feeling once you are inside."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were good.  We had 2 dishes, one was good, the adalita was tasty.  The Verde Burrito wasn't, absolutely no heat and very little flavor.  I has the verde burrito (as recommended by the waitress) with pork, it had very little sauce, it just wasn't worth eating."}
{"text":"I love Casa De Lara because I have never had bad service there.  That is really important to me.  The people are always friendly and I can count on it not to be too busy, usually.  It is a nice place to sort of \"duck away\" from the business on State.  I always get the nachos, and they are good, but I can't really speak for anything else."}
{"text":"Great for downtown Madison. Walked by this place a billion times and finally decided to try it. I assumed if it wasn't on Park Street, it wasn't going to be good (ethnic food-wise). Sure enough, it really was. Now, I'm not saying this is the most authentic Mexican place (do they have cheddar cheese in Mexico?) but they are relatively close in many respects. Multiple sauces and they really do a fantastic job with making things flavorful. They have some great specials and their margaritas were very good. I didn't find it to be that expensive. Plates were $8-15 (most around $10) and drinks weren't horribly over-priced. The ambiance was nice, as was the service. If you are seeking a good dinner in the area, I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. I ordered the special of the day, expecting a deal, and instead got a house special that was overpriced for what it was. The service on the other hand was some of the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. It took 20 minutes for our appetizer to arrive, and even longer for us to receive our check after we asked for it. It seemed like all we did was wait, and it was not that packed when we were there. However, what really got me was that when the bill came, the gratuity was already included in our total. Apparently there is fine print on the back that says gratuity will be included for parties of six or more. Though we sat at a table of six, my bill only included three. I tried explaining to our waitress that I did not have a party of six, and that the service was DEFINITELY not worth the $8.60 included on my bill along with the other gratuities of the other members of our table. She was rather rude and actually got mad at me when I inquired about why my bill was so high for such weak service! I will never go back and do not recommend anyone dine here. There are plenty of other places around Madison with much better food, better deals, friendlier staff, and an overall better experience."}
{"text":"Casa de Lara is an average Mexican style restaurant. The seating is nice, food is fine, staff is alright. They have always had seating available. I'm not sure I would say the food is worth the cost. Overall not bad though"}
{"text":"I added a star because of the thoughtful touch of actual veggies in the veggie burrito.

Other than that: I ordered delivery. $11 for guacamole? Uhg, I've had two glasses of wine already and I'm hungry. Ok, ORDER. What arrives? Two puny tiny little plastic cups of guac, and about 15 tortilla chips in a small paper bag. The cups were about the size of the sour cream side that came with my burrito. And, nothing to write home about either. Pretty bland food all around. My husband got the enchiladas with mole, which sounded pretty kick-ass from the description (pumpkin seeds! cinnamon! five different peppers! omg yum!) but it turned out to taste kind of like it looked: brown and runny. He was also feeling pretty sick about half an hour later....

Way overpriced. I've had much better Mexican food for much less money elsewhere. If this is what passes for good Mexican food in Madison, boy are we in trouble."}
{"text":"YUM!  My boyfriend and I frequented this place when we used to live in Madison.  Their food is probably the most \"authentic\" Mexican food you'll find in the downtown area.  I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food (it usually makes me sick) but I always enjoyed the things I've tried here.  If you knew me you would know what a credit that is to Casa De Lara's food.

Pros: You get an bottomless basket of tortilla chips and salsa before your meal.  Great margarita deals!

Cons: The verde stuff is so hot it'll burn you mouth and you won't taste the rest of your food."}
{"text":"False advertising.  Although their website lists $6.95 \"lunch specials\" M-F, the server told us that they discontinued lunch specials but hadn't updated their website yet.  The entrees were mostly around $10 and up, which is more than I want to spend on lunch.  So I tried to use a coupon I had for them.  They said \"no,\" it was only valid at dinner (although it didn't state this on the coupon).  

The food was OK, nothing special.  There are so many awesome weekday lunch specials downtown, I will likely not be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've just had dinner here once, but it was a great meal. I had the mole enchilada, which was wonderfully cheesy and chocolaty without being sweet, and a side of the spicy cheese curds. The restaurant was packed, might have had something to do with the karaoke contest we heard in the bar, but the staff seated us, got our food, and moved us through like a well run machine."}
{"text":"So incredibly disappointed; we've been here before and enjoyed it, but after tonight, we won't be back.

We had reservations for the Comedy Club just up the street, and thought this would be a good spot for dinner.  We were seated fairly quickly, but after that, things slowed up considerably.  While there were several tables, it was by no means crowded, for a Friday dinner service.  I think our waitress finally arrived to take our drink orders after 10 minutes.

We'd noticed an item on the menu that reads (note the tense used here):

Friday Special Only
Mexican Style Fish Fry 
Beer Battered Fish Fry. Served with White Rice, Black Beans, Potato Medallions & Mango Slaw. Garnished with Tomatoes, Fresh Avocado, Cilantro & Ranch Chipotle Dressing..... $11.95 (taken from their web site, which is identical to the in-hand menu we were given)

It sounds good, so 2 of us ordered it.  It took long enough that we asked for more chips, but our entrees arrived at the same time.

The dish on our plates bore little resemblance to the menu; we were hungry, so we began eating, but commented that it seemed different.  I looked the menu up on my phone, and compared it to the plate in front of me.

1: The fish was actually crusted in sesame seeds, rather than beer-battered
2: NO potato medallions or Mango slaw (the 'slaw' on the plate consisted of the standard pile of lettuce with a few tomato chunks that always seems to show up in Mexican restaurants)
3: No Dressing
4: Spanish rice, rather than White
5: Came with 2 fried shrimp

The black beans and avocado slices were the only items to make it to the dish we were served.  While the only hot items on the plate were the shrimp and the somewhat dry piece of fish (owing to their having been deep-fried), at least it tasted ok.

However, since this was not what we actually ordered, we tried to find our waitress to ask, but she was nowhere to be found.  I got the attention of a passing waiter, and politely explained our confusion and showed him the menu online from their own web site - he said he'd find our waitress.

I should point out that we were more puzzled than angry; we just wanted to know if we'd been accidentally served the wrong dish.  Our waitress arrived, we explained the situation (and showed her the online listing of the menu) and were essentially told \"Oh Yeah, the new owner changed it - it's not the same as on the menu\".  Since she obviously knew of this beforehand, we asked why we hadn't been informed of this when we ordered it; she seemed to acknowledge that it had been a problem before with other customers, but didn't offer any explanation.  She mentioned a discount for our meals, which was fine, but didn't really address the problem.

She then disappeared again, and we finished our meal.  After 10 minutes, we wanted our check, as we had reservations to meet; again, our waitress seemed to have disappeared.  We again hailed the poor waiter to ask for our check, and he said he'd check with our waitress.  She came out in just a couple moments, and informed us the entire meal was comp'd, including the entree of our 3rd companion, who had no problem with his meal at all.

While I do appreciate that (I'd have been more than willing to pay a reduced price for the altered dish), the overall experience has ensured that I won't be back anytime soon.  I've since noticed that their 2nd location in Fitchburg is closed, and can only wonder if similar problems contributed to its demise.

Casa de Lara is convenient if you're downtown (though not if you're in a hurry), but there are far better Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Their horchata tastes like caca. That is all I can say about this establishment. It tastes like melted vanilla ice cream with cinnamon, rather than a delicious refreshing Mexican drink. Will never order again."}
{"text":"My group ended up at Casa De Lara because every other restaurant near State Street was packed on Friday night.

It was a gamble that paid off as the free chips and salsa were good and the meal of burritos was even better.

We also met some \"tricks\" at the casa who we later hung out with at Brothers Bar and Wando's... we got numbers. What can I say. Thanks Casa De Lara.

Notes: Beer was a little expensive, food came out quickly, restaurant is upstairs. Also, this is the second-best Mexican eatery I have been to."}
{"text":"The food is pretty standard gringo fare, but nothing wrong with it!  The sauce on the cilantro enchilada really was pretty tasty, and the daily margarita special made that a deal.  The best part was the service: with a group of 22, we were pretty distracted by our conversation and wanted separate checks. The server never even missed a beat. He kept us all happy and didn't even seem to think it was odd. It was State Street in Madison, after all, but I still appreciated the seamless service."}
{"text":"Decent chimichangas and good margaritas.

Honestly, I probably wouldn't remember Casa de Lara enough to warrant a review if it weren't for the spiders.  It was a warm September night and we ate on the back deck, where a surprisingly large spider population clung to the nearby building wall.  They weren't close to us or threatening, just there."}
{"text":"Starting off rough!!  Decent chips and salsa to start, but......... ummmmmm, is anybody taking our order?  And I guess I'll just have water? 

Ok, fish taco(s) came... one of them had no fish, so does that make it a solo fish taco?  They are definitely American style:  heavy cheese and tons of lettuce.  NOT authentic Mexican.  Ick.

Meh.  Edible- yes.  Service... WAY below average.  Was it busy?  It's Madison on a Saturday eve at 7pm.  

Go to Qdoba across the street

Btw.. BFF and I shared a shrimp special.  Both of us sick allllllll night!  And only one bathroom in the hotel room, this was NOT great!!"}
{"text":"After moving here almost 2 years ago, we've eaten here several times. Have enjoyed the food up until this past Saturday when my son and I both got food poisoning after eating the chicken burrito and enchiladas. We were sick all day Sunday and when I called the restaurant Monday to report it to the manager, the girl on the phone said there wasn't a manager to speak with, so I told her and all she said was \"okay, thank you\". No I'm sorry, nothing. I will not be going back ever. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good, standard Americanized-mexican food.  I almost equated it to Azteca (if any of my Seattle fans are reading this).  However, their service and food went above and beyond what I expected!  I got the combo and everything had that great, non-microwaved taste.  Score!

Their strawberry margarita was not boozy enough.  The lime margarita, however.... YOW!"}
{"text":"You those restaurants that just use really subpar ingredients for everything? Well, Casa de Lara is one of them. While their food is not terrible, it is very expensive for the cost. Which, I should clarify, is not even that high. It is just that subpar.  Frankly, I could get a better burrito down the street at Chipotle for a much lower cost."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. We had a reservation for 10 and they wouldn't seat us because they were too busy."}
{"text":"In Madison for the weekend and found this place on Yelp. Located in the heart of State St. On the second floor, nice, clean, and family friendly. Ordered guacamole which was great, horchata was good as was everyone's entrees. Not fancy, but if you want good food in Madison, I highly recommend. Service was very good, and it was reasonably priced. Would for sure recommend and will come back next time in Madison."}
{"text":"I used to date a girl who went to UW.  I always dragged her to this place.  She was only \"ok\" with it, I loved it.

The margaritas weren't the best you could find, but they were definitely good.  They got you drunk fast, except for when they were the drink special.  Then they weren't as fast.

The food?  Oh god, the food!  It was delicious.  I'll never forget the burrito suizo or the chimichanga from this place.  It was just... delicious.  And filling... I never had left overs from here.  It was just too good to not eat.

The restaurant itself looks very upscale.  By that I mean that it's a very nice looking restaurant, but doesn't have a snooty feel to it.  The decorations are authentic Mexican, yet it still retains the \"American Trendy\" look.  The waiters and waitresses are always super nice and make great recommendations.

I highly recommend Casa De Lara!"}
{"text":"This place is worth it for their Mexican-style Friday fish fry special. I usually don't like very bready batter, so I thought I was taking a bit of a risk when the menu said \"beer battered.\" But, I was really in the mood for fish and Casa de Lara pulled through. Crispy, fragrant, fresh, under $12, and lasted me two meals. Also came with fresh avocado, tots (?!), and well-seasoned rice and black beans.

To round it all up, their salsa and chip basket was fresh and refillable. Their Jose Cuervo 32 oz margarita pitcher special for $14.50 was strong enough for three people to responsibly enjoy and two people to less-responsibly enjoy. 

I'm almost glad I have to be on State St. every Friday now that I know this option exists. Al menos los viernes, la Casa de Lara es mi casa."}
{"text":"I like Mexican food, so I would search for it from time to time. This is a eatery kind of place. Their Beef Enchilada is very good. However, i like Qdoba much more."}
{"text":"We stopped here after a 10 hour road trip on a Friday night. Great house Margaritas, great service from our waiter Gio and the food was exceptional! Very authentic Mexican flavor. If you are in the  Madison area and hungry for Mexican food, this is your place."}
{"text":"The burrito suizo was good, but not fantastic.  We loved our server, she was the only one and dealt with everyone in a quick and polite manner."}
{"text":"I LOVE Casa de Lara Fitchburg. It's better than the downtown Madison location when it comes to service. They have great margaritas, great food. My now-husband and I had our first date here and it was a regular stop while we lived in Madison. Grab dinner and then go to the nearby Star Cinema for a movie - it's a great Friday or Saturday date night!"}
{"text":"NOTE: For this review, I'm getting in touch with my roots as a Madisonian, not a transplant to \"Mexican Food Heaven\" Phoenix, AZ.

Casa de Lara can be a little pricey, but the quality of the food and drinks are definitely worth it.  I am a bigger fan of CDL than Frida's up the street (which is also decent) because I love the unassuming exterior and the authentic feel to the restaurant.

The food choices are very much within the lines of an Americanized joint, but it's prepared immaculately and every dish is full of flavor.  When visiting, I usually take the opportunity to deviate from traditional food and grab the Western Burrito which is HUGE. I usually finish it even though I feel like I'm about to explode.

The margaritas are surprisingly strong - especially when you split a pitcher with someone special, and they usually have reasonable prices if you stick with the olde school Lime on the rocks."}
{"text":"Good Mexican, lives up to the other family restaurants (State Street, others in Milwaukee).  

They have some of my favorite chips and salsa.  Burritos are good."}
{"text":"Myself and two co-workers had lunch here today. It was the worst Mexican food that I've had in a loooong time. The food was over-priced, burned and poor quality meat. My coworkers and I gave the server our feedback in a constructive manner. He apologized, but didn't tell the manager or do anything further. We won't be back. There are soooo many other great Mexican restaurants in town, don't waste your money on this one."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch with my mom just last week. I got the sirloin steak with peppers and onions and 2 eggs. Come with guacamole salad, refried beans and mexican rice. 

Servings were ample, service was quick, food was very good with a nice kick to it. Salsa they use taste fresh and spicy, just how I like it. 

Mom got the chicken burrito with rice and beans and salad. I finished half her burrito which surprisingly had only chicken and cheese. No fillers with rice and beans like most places. Not sure the refried beans ate fresh or canned. I like real refried beans much more then the canned crap with lard added. 

Overall a very good meal with quick service and a good price to boot."}
{"text":"Tasty,  however I had the steak fajitas and I was bummed that there were VERY LITTLE steak or peppers, just a lot of tomatoes."}
{"text":"This place was great. Being from Chicago I was skeptical of Mexican food in Wisconsin, but this place delivered. The flavors were spot on. The only thing missing was the heat. I had the enchiladas verdes and the little chile on the menu meant that the meal was spicy, but it wasn't. Maybe it was Wisconsin whitey spicy, but not authentic Mexican spicy.
Overall, very pleased"}
{"text":"Super underrated!!! Every time I have been in here the staff has been super nice. I have always loved my food (I usually get fajitas). Last time I got the Carnitas and they were amazing! The food is very authentic and the prices are extremely reasonable. This place should have higher than 3 stars! People are so critical. It's not some super fancy restaurant, but you get great authentic food for a great price!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here today at 6:20pm. with a party of 8. I have to say that I experienced the worst service that I have ever had. We were waiting to be seated for around 4 minutes as the hostess appeared to be preoccupied with something in the rear of the restaurant. We were seated and given a menu. 15 minutes later! Our server arrived. We order our food at 6:45, and we're served at 7:45. An entire hour to cook and serve tacos, enchiladas, and Nacho's!!! This was by far the worst experience I have had for sub par food! Please do not take your business here so they can go out of business and be replaced by a better establishment!!!!"}
{"text":"Its a 3 star place. Fajitas had good portion for one. Nice to have an option of corn or flour tortillas. Good location on State Street. I agree with others that initial service is a bit slow but picked up once order was placed."}
{"text":"Good, solid Mexican-American.

I had the Verde Enchilada, which was rated on the menu as a 7 for heat/spice. I would disagree with that, and call it closer to a 3: not much heat at all, and a little bit of spice, but definitely not a 7/10. I was surprised by this, because another reviewer claims that the verve dishes are really hot. No way, Jose. If it tastes like burning, I want it, so I was disappointed that it lacked real bite.

That aside, the portions were manageable (not too little, not too much), and the complementary chips and salsa were delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, but pretty overpriced. Dinner for two with one round of margaritas was $50. Enchiladas Verdes had a really enjoyable amount of heat, but I'm not sure I'll be able to justify the cost again.  Warm in there too--in June--like they didn't have the air on."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome menu!  Chips and salsa is pretty much expected, it was delicious. We also had the shrimp ceviche.  I would have that again!  I couldn't decide between the black bean soup or chicken enchilada soup.  I took the servers recommendation, it was ok...too salty.  Our steak and chicken fajitas were amazing!  Bathrooms were clean.  Passing by the kitchen? We had to peek.  Immaculate!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Mexican food at its best. The restaurant atmosphere is family friendly. Great place to dine before or after badger games. The staff is friendly and attentive. However, when the restaurant is full of badger faithfull, you can bet you will need to be patient. It gets loud with excited fans ready  to munch on some delicious mexican food. I love the enchilada verdes with a side of mole. All the burritos re great and they cater to vegetarians and vegans alike."}
{"text":"Great! A must-stop between Ohio and Minnesota."}
{"text":"Dislikes: Food (I got enchiladas), it tasted bland and so did the beans and rice with my meal (and I thought Mexicans liked spicy stuff), and the waitress was not the best (I don't judge because of language barrier, but I do judge a cold attitude.) 

Likes: If you find this place on Google Maps, then you can also check out once you get there better other places on State Street, such as Soga Shabu Shabu or Moo-Yah. (What I mean is don't go here.)"}
{"text":"Worst experience from start to finish. Came in the day after Cinco de Mayo. Place was trashed. No one greeted us at the door. Finally someone came. Took forever to get the food (It was 5pm & only 2 other couples in the place).Food was luke warm. Waiter never came around to check. Plus I had order the Plato Caribeno. Wanted it cause it came with plantains. Received it. NO PLANTAINS. Told waiter he responded \" yeah were out of those\". Didn't care to mention that when ordering. Manager never came out and when we got the check they only too $0.50 off the bill. It was a $15.95 dish. Could of at least taken half off or all. Nothing like my parents remembered it to be. Ian's Pizza here I come."}
{"text":"I've been going to Casa de Lara for years. It is my fall back restaurant when I find myself on State Street. The food is always well prepared; and the wait staff is efficient but not very personable. I like really hot salsa. This restaurant serves fairly bland salsa, just like 99% of the Mexican restaurants in Wisconsin. It seems to me it used to be better and has dropped off in the years. Still a place to find decent comida de Mexico."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Air conditioning not strong.  Our dinner guest was a roach crawling on the chair next to me. Felt like being in Mexico."}
{"text":"I went in on my lunch break and the waiter seated me right away. I knew I wanted to be quick so I didn't ask for the menu. Told him, before I even sat down, that I'd like one chicken taco with a glass of water. Shortly after he seated two other families he brought free chips and salsa while I waited. When my food arrived it was beautiful and I used the salsa from my chips to put on the taco. He brought my check and the taco was reasonably priced. I left cash and a sizable tip. In and out in 15 minutes. Very happy customer! The taco was delicious and I will be returning again and again!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that a friend of mine chose this for our \"double date\" night. I've driven past here several times, and never thought to try it. I wasn't crazy about the chips here, but LOVED the spicy pickled carrot slices that came atop them! My dish was fabulous. I ordered the Fajitas Cozumel, made with shrimp and tilapia, this dish is fresh and fabulous. Not to mention HUGE, I took home almost half! Next time, We'll definitely go back--hopefully on a day that it's not POURING rain(as it was when we went), because I'd love to sit outside! So nice."}
{"text":"Stopped through on tour. Always wanna get tacos. Left stuffed! Good food. Quick service. Loved the rice!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I have had in Madison.  Pork tasted like it was on its third day in the crotch pot.  Food was a bit cold.  One star only because the service was good.  So was the Corona :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes you're better off with a happy memory of something than the reality of how things are in the present. I haven't been in Madison for a while, but remember how much I liked the food and service when I was a starving student and they were pretty much the only place on State Street that wasn't serving Gyros, Burgers, or Pizza. 

Our party arrived around 7PM, midweek. It wasn't crowded- there were maybe three other people in the restaurant. It took ten minutes or so for anyone to greet us. When we were seated, our tables hadn't been bussed and we had to ask for someone to clean them and bring us some menus. Things picked up when we finally got a waitress to notice us. The food arrived fairly quickly- I had a combo platter of soft tacos, with mole on the side. The tortillas and fixings were good for the most part, but the beans and rice were dried up to the extent where I wondered if it had ever been cooked completely, or just sat out somewhere for a few days. After getting our food, the waitstaff vanished. No water, no follow-up, no nothing. We actually had to look around for someone to give us our bill. Well, someone else's bill. We did get things straightened out, but sheese, how can you not want to get paid what you're owed?

I probably won't ever come back again if they're somehow still in business next time I'm in the area. All in all, a very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"The theme of my last casual stroll down State Street ended up being \"go to places you haven't been to in years and years and years.\" While out and about we decided we wanted margaritas to help stave off the cold and windy afternoon and so I suggested Casa de Lara. I remember liking them in college and that they usually had some sort of decent marg special. 

When we went in, it was dead - there were two other people in the whole restaurant. Our waiter started out very attentive, but as our time wore on he got more and more backed up by being the only person outside of the kitchen. 

My gent and I each ordered a margarita - pineapple for me, orange cream for him. I'd never seen either of those flavors as margarita choices, and was excited to give them a try. My pineapple marg was fine. I couldn't really taste any pineapple, which was a bummer - if you had blindfolded me I'd have just guessed it was a house lime. The orange cream was very different - it literally had cream in it so it was rich and sweet. Next we sampled strawberry (probably the best of the bunch) and tamarind. I've only had tamarind candy before, and this was quite a bit more bitter than that - it had the same bitter quality that citrus rind has. 

We didn't get food on this trip, but were given chips and salsa immediately upon being seated. The chips are topped with pickled veggies and sprinkled with spices. The salsa had a nice kick but was the thick, sweet variety that reminds me more of tomato sauce/paste than salsa. 

For four margaritas with tip and tax it came out to around $35 - not terrible, but for the quality and ambience there are better places around town both in taste and value."}
{"text":"Queso fundido is something you might not know to ask about, but Casa de Lara's was a big hit, shared around the table with our group of three families. Queso fundido is different at every restaurant, but this one is really nice. -- Give it a try."}
{"text":"I discovered this magical place my freshman year - almost 8 years ago. I'm not in Madison anymore, but every time I come back I have to come here (if I am financially stable to do so at that moment in time). That being said, please do prepare yourselves! Both for the excessive amount of spending and eating. Huge portions = huge chunk of my wallet. This place is pretty expensive, BUT it's well worth it for unique blend of american and traditional Mexican food. You will not be disappointed. I've gotten almost every dish here and I have never regretted any once. They take a much longer time than an average restaurant when getting food out - which just goes to show that the food they prepare is fresh and detailed. You can taste that in the food. My favorite dishes? The Rajas, hands down. If you're looking for a mix of sweet and salty go for the Beef Caribbean Plate. Those are the two that I get most often. Among the other dishes there I'd also recommend the Plato Azteca and Carnitas."}
{"text":"Locally owned by a great family. The owners are almost always there-waiting on tables. The service is fast and courteous. Restaurant is clean and brightly colored with lots of traditional Mexican artwork and decorations. 

Well stocked bar with lots of kinds of tequila and great margaritas. Great happy hours

Food is good. You have to love the bottomless bowl of chips with salsa and escebeche carrots that comes to your table as soonas you sit down. My friend purchases extra carrots to take home. The salsa is great. We think that it is mild but our friends find it a little too hot. 

I have had more than half of the entrees but my favorite is Nopalitos con queso -  A mix of chicken & shrimp with nopalitos and a great red chile sauce served in a small iron skillet with choose of flour or corn tortillas. Outstanding and very filling. 

Another favorite is the Plato Cozumel - a chicken enchilada covered with red sauce and shrimp served along side a large piece of thin grilled skirt steak. Served with yellow rice & beans-almost everything comes with the duo-they are OK-not my favorite.

Great posole. With huge chunks of pork and hominy. A wide variety of seafood dishes-Pescado y Camarones en Tequila-is very good-shrimp and fish is a orange and tequilla sauce-great.

They have the expected like gringo enchiladas, chimis, burritos-these are good but not great-go to Pedro's for those-try the unique dishes that is what Casa De Lara does best."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time. I hate to be negative however...horrible service. The waiter did not get our order correct but we could not tell him because he did not come back to our table until we were done eating. When told of the mistake he said, \"Oh you ate it.\" We said yes we did after not seeing you we decided to eat it.  We were looking for $1.50 off for not giving us the steak. That was all. But no apology. No nothing. I've never been to a place where they don't come check on you. 
You cannot beat the location.
The food is average.  Chicken was good though. 
Service terrible.
Decor is a joke.
I really wanted to like this place but it just isn't possible. Go to any other Mexican place in the area but avoid this place."}
{"text":"Madison, WI is not necessarily known as the epicenter of great Mexican food. However, Casa de Lara is a solid option if you are really craving some. While the service won't knock your socks off, everyone is nice and the food is pretty darn delicious. 

Insider tip: Try one of their margaritas. Then have another. Repeat this process until you leave with a smile on your face."}
{"text":"I love the food here...I just brought my husband and he loves the food too. I am Mexican/ French  and the food is authentic and tasty. The restaurant  is romantic and cozy. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The prices are fair when you consider how expensive a combo is at McDonald's. We drive 2 hours to go to Casa De Lara and we have never disappointed."}
{"text":"Consistent. That's why I like this place. Once you've been here once, you always know you're getting pretty good food at an affordable price. The servers are always friendly and warm. I like that it's on the second floor because it makes it feel a bit more like a hidden gem. I do recommend"}
{"text":"Was craving Mexican and glad we gave this place a try. Waiter was so friendly and quick, margaritas were delicious and food tastes great! Got enough to bring home for a second meal as well. Definitely won't be the last time we visit."}
{"text":"My compadres and I were looking for a place to catch dinner before Freakfest that wasn't full for Pre-gaming Badger Football Fans.  We settled on Casa de Lara.  As we thought, it was very quiet (maybe three other tables).

Our party of five were enjoying our chips and ordering margaritas.  Most of us just have the classic lime (which is delish!) the others had flavors I don't recall.  Our waiter was pretty attentive at the start.  We all ordered a burrito dish but one.  She ordered a soup.   We were all pleased with our choices.

By the time we finished, we were the last ones in.  We didn't get checked on very much at the end but we didn't really need anything.  It is a nice place to go on State Street if you want to avoid heavy crowds."}
{"text":"The place was empty except for a couple leaving when I came in Monday night.  I asked what the couple recommended as I was an out-of-towner and he said the fajita wrap, she said the taquitos.  So I tried the chicken taquitos and they were wonderful.  They were covered with lettuce, tomato and black olives with rice and beans on either side.  The rice was perfectly seasoned with a perfect amount of veggies.  The cheese on the beans was perfect and made a great dipping sauce for my chips.  

The chips come with salsa and some pickled jalepeno/carrot slices - so traditional!  Great to see this as it's a rare find.  They also have some kind of seasoning sprinkled on them - I forgot to ask if they are homemade but they are very good.  I was too busy chatting with the waitress about how to say olive in Spanish - I truly appreciate when I get a little language lesson with dinner.

Very nice people and wonderful food.  If you're in Madison, you'll eat good here!"}
{"text":"We visited Casa De Lara on a Saturday evening for dinner. Got there at just the right time (around 5:30-6:00) before it got too busy. We did not have a wait and there were plenty of empty tables yet. By the time we finished and left, there was a line of folks waiting to be seated. 
I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas with rice and beans. I thought it all tasted good. Not mind blowing, knock your socks off kind of meal, but better than acceptable. The tortilla chips and salsa that were served before the meal were tasty, and love the pickled veggies that comes with them. They've got a little spice kick.   
My dining party all pretty much agreed that the refried beans were bland. I thought they were fine, but I have had better. 
I won't rush back here, but wouldn't necessarily be opposed to going again, if in the area and someone suggests it."}
{"text":"Point of clarification regarding Jen's review, Casa Del Sol (as it is now known) has no legal ties, nor has it ever, to the Casa De Lara downtown. It's likely the decision to change names had a lot to do with this fact, although I'm not certain.

I'm a big fan of authentic Mexican cuisine, and for the price, this place was outstanding. We were started off with a small basket of spicy tortilla chips and an authentic salsa with just enough kick to let us know the kitchen here doesn't fool around and won't be placating weak gringo palates. Along with our drink order, we took an order of guacamole, served in the traditional stone bowl. DAMN! that was good! It had a perfect texture, not excessively blended nor impossibly chunky, and a fresh flavor that I wanted to savor as long as I could. I ordered the Carne Asada a la Tampiqueña, but I could have ordered literally anything on the menu and have been just as satisfied.

We came on a Friday night and were sat immediately. This place is a sleeper. By that I mean, you'd never know the food was as good as it is judging by the dinning room furniture. This food is easily of high enough caliber to be served at a far more expensive joint. It's not an ugly or horribly cheap dining room, although the atmosphere may be holding there success back a bit. To get that coveted 5th star, I suggest replacing the metal (yet, comfortably upholstered) chairs and matching tables, with handcrafted wooden furniture. Anything to separate this experience from La Hacienda's cafeteria-esque appearance will be a step in the right direction.

The only (minor) complaint I have is that when I ordered a Negro Modelo, I got a Dos Equis Amber... our conversation was so engaging, I didn't notice until it was time to go."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were okay. The chips seem more on the stale side but the salsa was excellent. Decently priced, our meals came our quickly and the ingredients were freshly cooked to a very hot temp. The restaurant has a neat atmosphere with a variety of bright colors. I would come here again for lunch or dinner."}
