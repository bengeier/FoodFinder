{"text":"I have only ordered pizza via phone as well as chicken wings. Frankly, they have lovely fresh pizza that never failed my expectations. Their chicken wings are always a lovely treat. 

very flexibale over the phone specially with customized orderes. Maybe a little bit on the pricy side but well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer here for years for their cheap delivery deals, but the quality has been declining over the past year.  Today (my personal 'last chance' for these guys) they told me the pizza would be an hour, and I called after an hour and a half to find out what's going on.  The person on the phone was rude, blamed the drivers and an oven failure (which is somehow beyond their control?) and repeatedly told me 'this is not pizza pizza'.  

My food came eventually, and was solid.  I complained about the delay to the regular driver (a super nice guy) and received a sympathetic call, and the promise of a free pizza, from the manager the next day.   I'm hoping this was a one-off and that the guy on the phone was a busy cook having a bad day."}
