{"text":"My wife and I were in the square not planning on eating, but the smell of The Smith drew us in.  The decor inside is very farmhouse chic with beautiful walnut slab tables.  We ordered brunch.  After much deliberation, the entire menu sounded great, I got the Oh Charleston and my wife the Sweet Carolina.  Both were fantastic.  The service could not have been any better and we can't wait to go back to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I came here a day after they opened with my family for brunch. I got chili which was great. Has a nice smokey flavor. My husband got biscuits and sausage and gravy. It may have been the best sausage we've ever had! Our server was great, and one of the smiths actually came out and explained to us what the sauces were and whatnot for my dads pulled pork. All in all really liked this place and the prices were decent!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just wanted to take my 95 yo mother for a nice brunch.  Checked Lake and Geauga counties for something different.  Smith's Restaurant came up with a 4* rating, and 2$ pricing.  Perfect.
I called Saturday to see about reservations,...no need.  We arrived exactly 10:00 am Sunday and we're seated immediately. 
We ordered the basics; a couple eggs each, hash browns, toast, French toast (me), bacon, and sausage.  Drinks; nothing fancy coffee for my Mom, tea for my wife, and OJ for me.  
Btw, when we arrived there was ONE table of three who were eating, and two other couples who had arrived just before us.
The waiter seemed very frazzled that he had SO many customers to deal with at one time.
After about 10 minutes, he finally came to take our drink order.  No problem with my Mom's coffee or my OJ, but for some reason they don't have hot water for tea, OR a microwave to heat it.  Strange.
My wife's tea finally came about 5 min after our drinks, and was literally tap water hot.  
We ordered brunch at that time, then waited another half hour for the order.  There were NO new customers during this time.
Brunch finally arrived at 10:55.  It consisted of three plates with eggs, and a \"trough\" (the waiter's word) of the remainder of our order.  The \"toast\" was some type of oddly sliced warm multigrain bread.  The sausage consisted of two large hockey puck sized \"mystery meat\", which tasted nothing like any breakfast sausage we've ever had, and it was \"just\" warm.  The \"hash browns\" were toasted 1/2\" square nuggets of hot grease.  
To be fair, the eggs were well cooked.
Despite the fact that we had a knee container of milk on the table for the coffee and tea, a half dozen cooked eggs, and some type of bread, our waiter informed me that they were out of French toast.  Huh?
He also indicated that the \"chef\" had been catering to some \"high falooten\" customers in the bar side of the restaurant.
NEVER AGAIN!  
This restaurant deserves the same fate as it's predecessor.
They are asking for a \"star\" rating. Unfortunately I can't leave a -5."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, & atmosphere. The Smith is definitely a welcome addition to the burton circle!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  My son and I were planning on a quick breakfast stop while passing through Burton.  JCs was the plan as we weren't looking for anything special, just coffee, some eggs, sausage, hash browns...typical greasy quick breakfast.  Fortunately for us, JCs was packed with no parking place in sight.  We circled the building and settled for a parking space in the lot of an adjacent building.  Purely by chance, we noticed that this building also housed a restaurant.  We weren't even sure if it was open but took a chance and walked up.  What we found inside was an extremely pleasant breakfast experience with warm, friendly service and absolutely outstanding, made from scratch food. (I had beef brisket hash and eggs which was totally new to me and outstanding!!)  During our meal, we actually discussed how lucky we were to be eating here at The Smith Restaurant rather than eating typical, \"right off the Sysco truck\" food next door.  
The Smith Restaurant is now one of my go to/ destination restaurants for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  I can't wait for the opportunity to make it back to Burton."}
{"text":"Enjoyable lunch with my husband. We stumbled upon The Smith restaurant. Nice rustic decor and friendly bartender. My husband enjoyed his Carolina pulled port sandwich served with potato wedges and fresh made coleslaw. My chicken breast was perfectly cooked. To me the sizes are perfect. Not too large and pricing is good for the quality of food. I feel our meal was a good value and would return upon our next trip to Ohio from Florida. Try The Smith restaurant and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food and the service. It was early evening and we were the only ones in the place. The sweet potato gnocchi was so greasy you couldn't taste the sweet potatoes. The chicken and dumplings needed more garlic and onion. And I have a hard time calling those small pebbles dumplings. Very small portions for the price. The ambience and music is good."}
{"text":"Love this place for Brunch and Dinner - Food is amazing (they really know what they are doing) and drink prices very fair but there always seems to be a staffing problem so prepare to wait, or not be waited on at all.
Also, definitely make reservations since it is small and they fill up fast. The bar is much more inviting than the dining room... Almost seems like 2 different establishments. Turn down the dining room lights!"}

Quick update. I removed one star because the consistency of the quality is not good. 


So, I was very skeptical about trying Smiths. Having lived in Nashville, TN for 10 years I've had access to outstanding bbq. And the lack of visible smokers outside the restaurant did not help my attitude. So that was my mindset going in tonight to have dinner. I was pleasently surprised. The decor is great giving the place a really good date night or dinner out with friends vibe. The staff was very friendly and informative giving us the back story on the restaurant and what it's inspiration is. They do have a high end smoker in the kitchen ( I asked the waitress). They bring a bit of Burton into their dishes by infusing local maple syrup into their butter which goes great with the savory southern style cornbread they serve you while your waiting on your food. They also use the local maple syrup in thier sweet house made bbq sauce. I had the 2 smoked meats and 2 sides and chose brisket and ribs with slaw and Mac and cheese. My wife had the pulled pork. They bring all the meats out dry and then bring you 3 sauces to add as you want. All 3 are made in house and are based on Carolina style sauces. The sweet tomato based sauce with the local maple syrup, a apple cider vinegar based sauce with a nice kick of cayenne pepper and a mustard based sauce that the waitress described as amped up honey mustard. All 3 where very good but my favorite on the ribs was the sweet sauce. The vinegar based sauce went really well with the pulled pork. The brisket was amazing. Great outer crust with just the right amount of melt in your mouth fat layer before you get to the super tender meat.  No sauce needed for that. The slaw is carolina style and was awesome! They only disappointong item was the Mac and cheese which compared to everything else was just ok. Not bad but nothing special. In addition to smoked meats they had several other items on the menu including fried chicken and pan seared trout to name just 2 that stood out to me. I will definitely be going back to try the other items starting with the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Four of us went for brunch on Sunday morning. Service was friendly and prompt, decor was kind of elegant farmhouse. The coffee was good enough to be remarked upon, I very much enjoyed my spicy Bloody Mary, and my sister says the pomegranate mimosa is not to be missed. Two of us had the Oh, Carolina, which I think is among the top 5 breakfasts of my life. Another of us had the Traditional with sausage, and he was very pleased, especially with the sausage. The only miss was the waffle, which my husband found a bit dry. Lucky for him, my meal was plenty to share. Can't wait to go back for dinner- hope they will be very successful!"}
{"text":"I was surprised, in a good way.  I am not from Burton but had a customer lunch.  Nice place around.  Waitress had her opinions of what to get and not but she was correct....  Nice place"}
{"text":"I never knew that this place existed until today when I stopped in for brunch. I'm so glad that I found this quaint, delicious addition to the burton town square. 

The interior is modern, but not overwhelmingly so and gives off a bit of a cute industrial vibe that really sets the mood for the barbecue and smoking that is the focal point of the menu. 

My brunch experience was fantastic and I definitely will be returning soon to try their lunch and dinner offerings. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the best options on the menu. 

I had coffee to drink which was surprisingly quite tasty and to eat I tried both of their signature brunch options, one with brisket and one with pulled pork. Both meats with delicious, especially when paired with their homemade biscuits and eggs which you can request prepared any way. Each dish was topped with a complimentary gravy or hollandaise that really molded all the flavors together. This was an absolutely delicious meal and I loved the whole thing experience, will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and love the awesome food and great atmosphere. Turns out that the owners are great people and that spirit gets passed on to the staff. I cannot wait to come back into town and enjoy the great food and atmosphere here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Saturday afternoon lunch with my wife. She ordered an Angus Burger medium and it came to the table well done. I had the Dijon Mustard Chicken Breast Sandwich, when I asked for no tomato the server replied the chef puts the menu together and he doesn't remove items from them. That should have been my clue that this lunch was going to mediocre at best. I can't see a real reason to go back and try anything else. The chef did offer a free dessert because the burger was well done instead of medium. We declined so I can't tell you how dessert taste."}
{"text":"Just left the most amazing little restaurant. Never expected something so nice in burton. 

Our waiter Jonathon was so far above amazing a new word needs to be invented and the biscuits were insanely good. 

I couldn't possibly give this place a better recommendation"}
{"text":"I really tried to appreciate this place , we are friends of the owners and they are the only place in the area with a quality craft beer on draft, but  about a year ago they changed their portion sizes. Quality is good but when the portions changed the price did not. My wife ordered a full dinner salad and got what  was smaller than most side salads. Expect to buy 2 or 3 appetizers if you want to leave full. This is the third time and the last that I'm leaving broke and hungry..."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today.  I had the ribs....horrible and fatty...biscuits, tasteless and hard. Waitress we had...yikes...My husband asked how big the burgers were and she takes her hands and said this size, making a circle.  I told her I wanted to start with a salad...she brings everything out at once....If you want good smoked ribs, chicken ect, go to Maple Taps in Chardon on Rt 6.   A neighborhood tavern with absolutely no frills, but their food is 100 times better and less expensive."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Burton food scene!

Burton is rapidly becoming the center of the food scene for central Geauga County. In addition to longtime favorites JC's, Coffee Corners (the area's best wine and coffee bar), and the recent romantic hot spot, Warren's Spirited Kitchen, we now have the area's best Barbeque/American restaurant, The Smith Restaurant. 

Housed in the building that has previously held several breakfast/brunch restaurants, The Smith Restaurant seems destined to break the \"curse\" that has taken down the Burton Family Restaurant among others. For one thing, The Smith Restaurant doesn't try to compete head-on for the early breakfast crowd that inevitably goes to JC's. Instead, they open on Friday and the weekends with a full Brunch/Lunch menu starting at 11:00 AM. So, if it's noon on Sunday and you're looking for lunch, while your family wants eggs and bacon, don't go to JC's (they seem content to only do breakfast until well into the afternoon) instead head to The Smith Restaurant.

The restaurant has been nicely redone with a lot of woodwork and a revamped porch. The addition of several beautiful flame heaters should make the porch usable for most of the year. My only quibble in the refurbish was the choice to have bare wood floors, painted walls, and a tin ceiling. Since there is nothing to absorb the sound, the space is incredibly loud. My date for the evening and I had to shout at each other to be heard over the din. Others were having the same issue and the resultant sound was much louder than it needed to be. My other hairsplitting beef with the place is the tables were small and crowded together. Getting in our out of your seat needed some careful planning and gymnastics to prevent dumping over a glass on your neighbor's table. 

I've only been here once (so far) and can only report on the BBQ Brisket. But it was easily the best I've had in Ohio. Moist, juicy, and flavorful with a deep smoke bark. From the ribs, chicken, and pulled pork I saw being delivered to the table next to me (and from the happy sounds of people eating) I think the other smoked meats will be just as good. 

The sauces are definitely good but don't quite match the high standards set by the meat. There is a mustard based sauce, a vinegar based sauce, and a traditional tomato based BBQ sauce. Of the three, I thought the traditional was the best, although it had some unusual overtones of Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke. Again good, but nearly as flavorful or bold as the BBQ sauce at Morgan's Place Smokehouse in Chardon (clearly my favorite in NE Ohio).

People were friendly and service was good, but still inconsistent between waiters. We were able to get in, order, eat, and pay the bill before the table next to us had ordered, even though they came in only about a minute behind us. I felt a little guilty eating while getting \"the eye\" from the person still waiting for the waiter to take her order, but not so guilty to stop me for eating the delicious brisket. Since the place is so new, I would expect these issues to be quickly resolved.

I would recommend The Smith Restaurant to anyone wanting a great Barbeque experience!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and WOW, I was impressed.  I ordered the beef brisket sandwich and the meat was superbly smoked and was served on an amazing bun that was lightly salted.  The fries are incredible and full of potato flavor.  Their homemade BBQ sauce is a perfect condiment; extremely tasty and flavorful.  The staff is exceptional in service and have a very friendly personality.I highly recommend you visit The Smith whenever you are in Burton or nearby.  It's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"First time and last time. Deep-fried bacon had zero bacon taste. Tasted like they had changed their  Oil in months.  Burnt and tasteless. Watermelon salad. Lettuce was warm and wilted. Tiny amounts of watermelon. Waste of money. Ice tea so white in color it could've been dirty water. Beef brisket  was 60% fat and not edible. Peach cobbler was OK. Macaroni and cheese had under cooked pasta and watery sauce. Coleslaw had hard chunks of cabbage and watery sauce with zero taste"}
{"text":"First what a beautiful Sunday late sept morning in Burton. We sat outside and had the best waitress, she was funny, quick, helpful and knowledgeable. The 8 of us we're all well treated and well fed. We all ordered something different for brunch, but nobody had ordered the cornbread waffles, so the chef sent out enough for all 8 of us to try , we had no idea. I was so full, my fried chicken and eggs, was incredible. This will be a monthly stop"}
{"text":"Very nice place, very clean and friendly service. We started with some delicious biscuits with smoked butter and jam then ordered the pulled pork sandwich and fries. It was outstanding. The barbeque sauce was delicious and the Cole slaw tasted great as a topping over the smoked pork if preferred. Went well with our sweet tea but we didn't have room for the peach cobbler for desert, maybe next time. Great southern bbq. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great food greater drinks  the greatest  host nice establishment pleasant  atmosphere definitely  would come back.. did say great drinks"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had!  Smoked brisket on caraway encrusted bun. Omg. 7 stars!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Doug, our waiter, did an excellent job. Pulled pork was great even without sauce. The sauces were tasty and added to the dish. The biscuit was terrific. Greatly recommend the Smith Restaurant. We will be back."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. The waiter let us in 20 mins before they opened, which was super nice on a cold day. My only complaint is that they were out of 2 main meats (chicken, brisket). We all ended up getting their pulled pork, which was very good. Loved all of the homemade sauces too! Will definitely stop back again."}
{"text":"New to exploring Burton so we thought we'd try the Smith. Come to find out they were apparently new as well.
Firstly, service was great- I wanted a beer for brunch (sitting in the sun and all, don't judge!) they were out of the one that I requested, but brought out samples of others until I found one that I liked. Nicely done!
Food Wrap up: biscuits and gravy for me was a no-go, but I narrow it down to a taste preference rather than just bad food. It was well presented and looked good. I would have taken a pic but I went crazy on the pepper and didn't want people to think it was served that way. The biscuits were dense and large and had cornmeal in them, which I was eager about and didn't really dislike them, but I really didn't like the gravy, it was too light, watery and bland with no sausage crumbled in it (thus the peppering). 
What made the gravy worse was looking over at the brunch that my wife had (and was oohing and aahing over) and she had hand-made sausage patties that looked better than the old standard of the Welshfield Inn- the precious pinnacle of sausage superiority. 
She freaking loved the place; \"the sausage, the patio, the people watching, biscuit with butter, coffee and eggs and the chunky fries were perfect\" to put it in her words."}
{"text":"The meal was absolutely excellent, from the amazing buttermilk biscuits to the delicious pulled pork. I love the upscale/modern American atmosphere and decor! The server was friendly and considerate and the food was delivered to our table within ten minutes of ordering. I love the homemade sauces!! Overall, we loved the whole dining experience and just wish we lived closer (we are just in town for camping at Punderson). Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"The place that brags about their smoked meat my boyfriend and I we're not impressed. The brisket was unflavorful!"}
{"text":"No, we are not related to the owner, nor are we employees or related to any employees!  We aren't even locals. We first heard about the Smiths when we visited the Great Geauga County Fair where they had a tent previewing great barbecue things to come to downtown Burton!  This is our first time visiting the restaurant and it will not be our last!  The atmosphere is down home casual and the decor is country postmodern. As far as the cuisine, the Angus burger surpasses Flipside, according to my husband. That's really saying something!  I had the 1/4 smoked chicken with 2 sides. Simple, flavorful, fresh food cooked to order!  No microwaved food here or yesterday's frozen favorites. The barbecue sauces are homemade and come on the side in order not to spoil the rub.  We drove 45 minutes just to dine here...and it won't be our last trip!  PS.  Do try the coleslaw!"}
