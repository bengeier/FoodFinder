{"text":"I am from the East coast and have been in the Phoenix area for about 3 years now. It has been a challenge to find a good Chinese restaurant and I am so glad I have finally found one at Ming-Gee. I tried the Family Dinner so I was able to try many of the dishes on the menu and everything was absolutely DELICIOUS. I enjoyed everything so it was hard for me to decide what I liked the most. The prices were unbelievable for the quality and amount of food you receive. We did not have to wait long for our food to be prepared which is surprising as I have come to expect a long wait at most restaurants in the PHX area on the weekends. The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly. I would recommend this place for good, reasonably-priced Chinese food."}
{"text":"Best Hot and Sour Soup in the valley. What they lack in ambiance they make up for in quality of ingredients. Tried alot of restaurants from one side of the valley to the other, this is a real hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great food for great prices. The staff is awesome too. My husband and I found this place on a whim when we were adventuring around our community. We def found our fave Chinese food and this is always our first place to calm our Chinese food cravings."}
{"text":"Called in an order for pick up since i was craving it and the reviews were good. Pucked up my food. Got home only to find i had shrimp fried rice. Im allergic to shrimp. Didnt go back, didnt call but i will not order from them again"}
{"text":"I have not actually eaten in the restaurant, but have had delivery several times and it is definitely the best quick, Chinese delivery I have ever had. Each time I have the potstickers for app which is a great start. My favorite is the shrimp in lobster sauce and the portions are massive! I can make this into about 3 meals as a result and the egg flower soup is also very tasty and the small is like a large. They are very quick and the delivery boy is always friendly as is the person who takes the order when I call in. Best Chinese delivery in the West Valley for sure!"}
{"text":"We were driving around and I decided I wanted Chinese food, when we found one with good reviews and when we arrived it was closed...........Dang!  so we decided to find the nearest one and give it a shot...........We walked into Ming-Gee and was pleasantly suprised to find a very clean and friendly place.........We were seated in a booth and was waited on right away.........Very friendly staff and we ordered War won ton soup and orange chicken and Crab puffs, oh, and Pork fried rice.........Very good, cannot complain about a darn thing..........The Orange chicken was a bit spicy and we loved it........the crab puffs, were so delicious and the pork fried rice, NICE........can't forget the War won ton, pleanty of fresh veggies and the taste was worth going back again...........We recommed, give it a try.   pretty sure you will be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"The orange chicken was excellent and cooked very well.. The crab puffs had a little too much filling so it became overwhelming. But other than that this place is exellent, I dont really do delivery but they were on time and the food was hot... I would recommend them...."}
{"text":"I have had them deliver to me now 5 times. I love this place. I haven't been inside, but so far they have not disappointed. I have had Their General Tzo's, Cashew chicken, happy family, szechuan chicken, the shrimp with veggies for the baby etc....I always get crap puffs free with my delivery and i order us each an egg roll. I'm literally eating their cashew chicken as i type this. There delivery time is never to long and my food is always hot when it get's here. I live in what I like to call the \"ghetto dead zone\" almost no one delivers over here and the ones who do are fast food pizza chains and few Chinese's restaurants. I found Ming and Gee by a fluke and I'm glad that I did. For as long as I live in Glendale i will order from them only. I have had Chinese all over the state and city, from dragon palace, to new china gate, and even the original Kyoto bowl on Thomas, this place is up there with the top 3 best Chinese i have had in my 26 years of life. That being said my only complaint is the Mongolian beef, it had so many onions in it, it was actually hard to eat. Otherwise great flavor and good amount of meat. Their veggie to meat ratio is always excellent."}
{"text":"Picked up some food to go here. For a quick meal on the cheap this place isn't that bad. However, it wasn't very good either. We got the dinner combo b and everything on the pupu platter was either bland or dry. The fried rice and garlic shrimp were actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Yup.  Fast food Chinese alright.  Cheap prices, good portions, great crab puffs.  Surprisingly clean location for the area, and a lot bigger location than I expected.  I'll definitely come here instead of Panda."}
{"text":"Love everything here, for lunch I usually get the teriyaki chicken rice bowl for like 4 bucks! Dinner is always great here whether It's the usual orange chicken, house lo mein or something new to try, and if you're ever under the weather a big bowl of the egg flower soup is the best remedy."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since my Air Force days back in the early 2000's. They have delicious food and great lunch special prices. I havent been back in years because I moved to Gilbert and i was surprised they are still open. I got the curry chicken today lunch special for $2.99. It was so delcious. Friendly and fast service. Glad they are still in business."}
{"text":"As a long~time customer of this place, un4tun8ly giving my lowest rating thus far. Even though most other Xs have been good overall, this last time has changed my feeling about them. Over the wk~end, I had a craving 4 some chinese so an order was placed 4 pick~up instead of the usual delivery 2 avoid a tip as I had no cash on me & I don't like adding tips on cards. I had an associ8 go pick it up & when I asked 4 my receipt, I knew the total charged wasn't right (nearly $10 OVER) so I called them. 

   I asked 4 the amount of each item that was ordered as it wasn't reflected on the receipt & the menu I was ordering from had outd8ed prices.  Even so, calcul8ing the correct pricing it was still way over & then was told they charge 12% tax... Uhm, WHAT?? But even w/ that OUTRAGEOUS amount, some1 got paid about $10 tip for a PICK~UP order!! (Either that or I'm missing $10 worth of food I didn't order). They were given a chance 2 correct it & didn't even offer ANY rectific8ion. 

   I strongly feel that it doesn't matter if they knew this order was from an old~timer patron or some1 new to them (since I had some1 else picking it up) ~ if this is how they conduct business, I'm afraid I have 2 take mine elsewhere! @ least then I can get what is paid 4 instead of being ripped... EXTREMELY Disappointed in a place I USED 2 Like & frankly I should have disputed the charges on my card but they're losing much more than that in the loss of my business & what I've brought them... ;-("}
{"text":"We found this restaurant through Yelp when our favorite place closed. Great food for a reasonable price. Service lacks warmth or conversation and if you have food alergies be dilligent about them asking the chef as the cashier and order taker is not motivated to find out for you. However, the negatives are offset by great food."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area from Cali and this was my first Chinese food place I came to. Orange chicken was okay. The noodles and rice were really good but the egg rolls tasted weird."}
{"text":"I called this place because the people on the phone for the Chinese food delivery place closer to me were rude. The folks here were very polite. The food was good. Although I would not call the portions generous I didn't feel cheated.  

There was an issue with the charge to my debit card. They researched the issue and resolved it the same day. Overall I'm pleased with this place."}
{"text":"I live quite a distance from this place, but since I heard raves about this restaurant from one of my colleagues and we were in the area, I decided \"why not give it a try?\" Walking in, the place looked real ghetto, but we decided that if we don't give it a try, we won't know if we liked it. Together we ordered walnut shrimp, egg foo young, house chicken, and sweet and sour pork. The food was actually good, and the portions were quite large for the price. We may go there again, only if we are in the area and in the mood for Chinese."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Have been going here for my whole life.  And have very rarely had any problems. The quality is always consistent and the people are nice. The sesame beef is my go to and this is the first place I've been that can get it right. Will continue to go here for as long as it's around."}
{"text":"Love this place's food!!! Not my favorite place but good when I don't feel like driving too far for good Chinese food!! Best of all; they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! its cheap, you get alot of food and its good! I go here for lunch alot. the lunch combo is like 5 something, and its so much i cant finish it, so i eat the rest for lunch the next day! 2 days lunch for 5 something?? cant beat it."}
{"text":"Everything I ask for from a Chinese restaurant. We take out here regularly since we live in the neighbor hood. Never gets old and a great deal."}
{"text":"One of the top Chinese food places we've been to. My boyfriend was born and raised in San Jose, CA, so hes more into more traditional Asian food, but I've been coming here since I was younger. For six bucks you get a lot of food and they treat you real well. They're so sweet and nice that it keeps us coming back. It was in fact the first restaurant I let myself pig out at in front of him cause they make you feel comfortable. Definitely a must go to! :)"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery and take out from this place for a couple years.  Love the crab puffs and pretty much every entree I've tried was good to great.  If you are looking for good Chinese food, you should check them out."}
{"text":"Took one star because they are so stingy with condiments. You ask them and they still do mot give you much more.

Aside from that...food is pretty good. Good prices and good amount of food based on the low costs. I think they make the best Egg Fried rice over all dozens of Chinese places I've tried in Arizona.

Lunch specials are the best because they are cheap and depending on the size you get you get full with small or have left overs with a large lunch special. Lunch starts at $3.75.

They offer delivery even though I've seen they wait until they get enough orders before they drive off. So be warned your food might be sitting getting soggy and cold before it gets to your house."}
{"text":"I work right down the street. Always like to find a good Chinese joint. I ordered the twice-cooked pork supper combination. It was $8.80. It's quite a bit of food and this is spicy too. I will probably eat here again."}
{"text":"Have eaten take out from here at least 50 times more like 100 i suppose but never looked at the yelp listing until today. I question the people who do not like it as in no way has the food ever been anything but great but the way these people act like the food is from mars or something I have to wonder how honest they are. Even if the food tasted bad I have never seen it anything but cooked very well and always fresh and steamy hot when I get it home. I have gotten it and brought it to friends houses for meals gotten many different items and never had anything but great hot food. Seems everything is getting so expensive these days but I usually get enough for two meals so looking at it that way it is still a great bargain."}
{"text":"Primarily a take out with outsranding food
Eat in too but served as take out food. Food is outstanding and prices low

Food has gotten bland tasteless not the old Ming"}
{"text":"I'm originally from The Bay Area, home of some of THE best Chinese food. To top things off My stepmother and step grandparents are also Chinese, so I know good authentic Chinese food. 

With that being said....I've now lived in Arizona for 11 years. I have looked everywhere for some decent Chinese food. I have been nothing but disappointed. A lot of places try to pass off spring rolls as Egg Rolls and flavors are usually off. I've been doing my laundry at the laundry mat next door to Ming Gee. About a month ago I decided to check this place out while I was doing my laundry.

This is one of the best Chinese food places that I've been to since I've moved here. Their egg roll is an actual egg roll. The food was flavorful and you got a decent amount for what you pay for. My husband and I got the pu pu platter, it was delicious and not greasy like most places I've been too out here. The Egg flower soup was very tasty, except too many water chestnuts (it was good enough to not think about the over abundance of water chestnuts though). The fried rice didn't taste like it was over cooked or sitting there for awhile, tasted pretty fresh! The Beef & Broccoli and the Sweet and Sour Pork were amazing! A great meat to veggie ratio...unlike most places where you get mainly vegetables and very little meat. We had so much food we had it 2 nights in a row and I took some to work for lunch! 

The customer service was great, they were really polite and kind. When I told them I was doing my laundry next door they put Styrofoam plates and bowls and plastic cutlery in my To Go bag so that way we could eat while we did our laundry. They were super fast too...it only took like 10-15 mins!

We had the Pu Pu Platter (2 fried shrimp, 2 beef skewers, 2 egg rolls, 2 crab puffs, 2 chicken wings), Family dinner special for 2 people (fried Rice, egg flower soup, 2 egg rolls, 4 crab puffs, Beef & Broccoli, Sweet & Sour Pork), Side of steamed Rice....and my total was only about $31....

This will definitely be the place that I go to when I'm in the mood for Chinese food....which is quite often"}
{"text":"This place is so gooood! Definitely better than Panda Express. The owners are really sweet. Portions are huge. Food is cheap but good quality. It looks run down but you can tell by the taste of food why they have been in business for a long time. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place delivered us the most disgusting Chinese food Ive ever had. I wouldnt eat it, it was soooo bad. If thats what they call Chinese food, they should really do some more research. I dont cook Chinese food and I could have done a thousand times better. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"We had not eaten here for a number of months. So my Daughter and I thought we would have it delivered. We got the Orange Chicken and Beef and broccoli. They both had little flavor and the beef was tuff and grisly.  We also got the hot and sour soup and it also lacked flavor.  Very dissapointed. I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"So, I just moved to the area and had a hankering for some Chinese food. What was a girl to do, but consult my trusty Yelp! app and see where it led me. Wel-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l......I must say this is the first time I feel like I've been led astray.

You see, my go to whenever visiting a new Chinese place is a soup and a rice dish. I mean if a Chinese restaurant can't get that right then there's no way anything else I order is going to be any good. That philosophy hasn't let me down yet......hmmmmm now if there was just someway to apply that to relationships and I'd be a millionaire.........

But, I digress..... back to the food. My no flavor won ton soup was full of ribbons of pork fat (no meat) that still had the veins running through it......blech!!! The house fried rice tasted like old pork, dried-out old chicken, old shrimps mixed with rice that had been fried up in at least 2 month old oil. To make sure I gave this place a fair shake I did refridgerate and attempt to eat the food the next, but to no avail I still began to feel ill immediately after.

Now don't get me wrong. I believe all of the opinions about this place are true. But, I also think the lovely folks that live around this neighborhood must have iron-clad stomachs or they have been fed so much bad Chinese food it's been determined that this place is good. It's all relative????..maybe?????
Unfortunately, the food I was served was illness-inducing. That's the only way I can honestly describe it.

In fact, the following day I felt so sick after taking just a few bites of rice that, out of curiosity, I decided to check out the Dirty Diner report so I could find out if there were any Chinese restaurants around here worth going to. To my shock, but not surprise Ming Gee was at the top of the list for multiple violations. Many of the violations for things that would cause a person to have food poisoning. And that is why for the first time in my life I threw away $20 worth of food with no regrets.

To add insult to injury I too was charged this mysterious 12% another Yelper mentioned in a previous post. Funny....when I took my total pre-tax bill and multiplied by 12% my handy-dandy little calculator showed I should have paid more than what I paid. Then I thought maybe they're taxing more the dish that contains shrimp, but even that did not add up. 

p.s. I waited a few weeks to write this review to see if any other reviews showed up. WHY???? Because there has been a big, fat CLOSED sign on the front door for at least the last week. So-o-o-o-o-o-o my question is how is it a few people have eaten at this restaurant in the last 2 days when the place hasn't been open within the last 2 days?.......hmmmmmm?????

Bottom Line: I cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant to anyone. You are risking your health by eating there IMHO. Also, if their doors do open again expect to pay a higher amount than whatever total you are given online or over the phone."}
{"text":"Love this place from their WOR wonton soup to the kung pao chicken and the black bean shrimp. Love their lo mein and fried rice!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, we're addicted to this place. For take-out Chinese it is pretty darn good. The fried rice is tasty and not too oily, and the portions are generous. The staff is friendly and they do deliver, although they will charge if you're too far away from downtown Glendale. They've made a few mistakes on orders but have always apologized and given us a discount on a future order (since delivering a correct order to our house isn't necessarily an option). I'm hooked on their sizzling rice soup, although I do wish they had an option for a smaller portion."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 3.5. This place has decent food and good, efficient service. The Mongolian beef, crab puffs, egg flower soup and chicken fried rice were very good but I was disappointed in the egg rolls and hot and sour soup. But the service was very friendly and quick and they deliver. You can order online at www.beyondmenu.com. Best Chinese option for delivery in my area."}
{"text":"Another one of my long standing lunch take out places.  Also another place I have never been to myself.  Probably have been eating from here once a month for 6-8 years.  A few years back they were closed for almost a year after a fire.

I have had several menu items.  My choice yesterday was Orange Chicken.  It is not one of the lunch specials so I got a full dinner combo ($6.15, see picture).  It was way more food than I could finish.  In fact all but the smallest of the lunch specials is usually too much for me.  One of my favorites is House Chicken.  The fried rice is dry on a good day and almost inedibly crunchy on a bad day."}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese takeout so decided to try this place after reading the reviews..was one of those meals where there was some really good things and some other things that were just ok..I ordered the family dinner \"b\" that included the soup, garlic shrimp and house chicken and a pupu platter which consisted of egg rolls, fried chicken legs, crab puffs, and chicken skewers and fried rice.  I opted for the wonton soup which was really good and the garlic shrimp was really good as well.  I found the fried rice a little on the dryer side and the chicken wings tasted old. Otherwise for the price, the portions were huge and they delivered exactly when they said they would. If your craving Chinese not a bad place."}
{"text":"Tonight we went in and ordered two orange chicken dinners and a sweet and sour pork dinner. We got it home and the orange chicken sauce tastes burnt! The breaded egg rolls were soggy and my husband ordered extra spicy on the sweet and sore pork and they didn't add it! Spent $40 on dinner and had to throw it away. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Their menu prices online are not their current prices.  Also, watch out for delivery fee they charge without telling you, we paid $7 on top of our bill, thats more than what 1 entree cost!  Hot and sour soup was watery and tasted like it came out of a can.  The crab puffs were good, but didn't have any crab in them."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. My nephew recommended it, we got four main entrees and a couple extras like fried rice and wontons. Enough food to feed four of us for three meals. My favorites are the chicken fried rice and LEMON CHICKEN! The broccoli beef was also outstanding; not a piece of gristle or fat in the carton. The sweet & sour pork was good but too much bell pepper, and the teriyaki chicken was also delicious. 
Do not come here expecting fancy. It is what it is, good Chinese food at a reasonable price. We went in and ordered to go and our food was all ready in about ten minutes. 
It is a family business so do not be surprised to hear and/or see children."}
{"text":"Pretty good! First time trying it. I ordered delivery n it was quick. Nice guy n great good"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after the good reviews. I ordered delivery and it was delivered in the time promised. Food was not horrible, but I have had much better. Panda Express even has more flavor in their food. I ordered extra spicy and it was very bland. let the search for good Chinese continue, I would not order from them again."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to Chinese place. The food was always excellent, portion sizes enormous and an overall great value. Delivery times? Absolutely unheard of in their speed. They would tell me 30-40 minutes and be here in 20. And no, the food was not cold or old, legitimately fresh and delicious every time. Tonight that all changed. I placed a $50 order for my household, there are four of us, plus appetizers and a few a la carte items it was still a great deal. I was told an hour for delivery, and while this was longer than the norm, I was still happy to wait as the food is always delicious. The food arrived in about 30-35 minutes, far faster than they predicted. The food however was a total disappointment. I ordered the garlic chicken combo, not only was it laden with veggies, had no garlic to speak of and was completely devoid of flavor. My husband ordered the orange chicken a la carte, which had absolutely no orange to speak of and just tastes like fried chicken. The one slice of orange in the carton not only looks rotten but smells old as all get out. While the food is enough to give them one star, the customer service when I called to let them know was impressive. The guy offered to remake and deliver the items, I declined as our appetite has been shot. 

Food - 1 star

Customer Service - 5 stars"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years. Stopped in and the food does not taste like I remember it. The won ton soup was ok, the fried rice was very greasy, as was the noodles. The kung pao chicken was not that flavorful. Not really spicy or anything. Just a bland brown sauce with celery, peanuts and dark meat chicken.  Overall a disappointing meal. Best thing I can say is that it was cheap. I wouldn't recommend it anymore."}
{"text":"Pretty good. It was on par with the place that I usually ordered from before, with on-time service and good quality of the food. Ordered Hunan Beef combo, Moo Goo Gai Pan combo for someone, and wonton soup w/ extra egg rolls. There was supposed to be an extra egg roll and free one with coupon, but they may have been in a hurry to deliver or forgot about it. The portion sizes were decent. A little bit of a language barrier, but not anything to worry about. Overall, it was really good and I'd order again from here. I may try their lunch special next time and stop by to see how that is during the day."}
{"text":"I was surprised this place served such good food! I was with my friend and we were in the area craving Chinese food. We saw Ming & Gee and decided to give them a try! The Kung Pao chicken was super tasty the portions were huge, vegetables were fresh and the flavor was great. I like spicy and asked for it spicy and that it was! I tried my friends Orange chicken and he thinks it was better than mine, they were both very good dishes! Very reasonable prices same price as any other fast food restaurant. The next day leftovers were just as good! When I am in the area I will make sure I go back!"}
{"text":"I get delivery from this place about once a month, I always order the combos, they are a great value huge portions and pretty yummy too. I'm not giving 5 stars based on the food alone (this is not the best I have had, although it is the best delivery I have had) but the overall value, service, and quality is amazing. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food is cheap like any fast-food chinese restaraunt. The portions are huge for the lunch and dinner specials. The veggies are fresh just the right crunch. The food is better than the more expensive chinese restaraunts. Dissapointed with the egg rolls and the soups though. They can use some improvement but overall a quick and easy decision."}
{"text":"OK - so since my last review, I have been to this place like 20 times.  I thought it was just ok - but really - it's much better than that.  AND - the staff there is really great.  The ladies at the counter remember me and are super friendly.  Again - I'm not sure it's the best Chinese Food I've ever had - but for the money and feel of the place - it's great.  Best thing on the menu - Hot and Sour Soup.  OMG it is so freakin' delicious."}
{"text":"This review is a comparison to other take out places. Ming Gee is one of the best Chinese takeout restaurants I've ever eaten at. Whether I'm picking up or ordering delivery, the staff is always friendly and the food is great. In all of the times I've ordered, I have only ever had 1 mistake which they fixed. My wife loves the sizzling rice soup and the fried rice is a major weakness of mine.

A slight warning. They will deliver outside of their area but there is a delivery charge for each mile outside of the area. That said, the prices are fair and the food is good."}
{"text":"Had the large Beef with Snow Peas for lunch. The meat was very tender and melted in my mouth from the chewing. The meal came over white rice with a combination of snow peas, carrot slices, onion & water chestnuts. I highly recommend this dish. There's also an option to purchase a smaller version & a combo version that is prepared with fried rice, egg drop soup (That has corn & chunks of chicken in it.) and a egg roll.
*TOTALLY YUMM*"}
{"text":"I got sweet and sour chicken take-out for lunch. The large is $4.95 and it was a good sized portion and the dish tasted great. I could see into the kitchen from the counter and saw the food preparer handle the chicken chunks from out of the cooler with his bare hands. Not Good!"}
