{"text":"Rays is the classic college town restaurant and bar. The food is great and the atmosphere is laid back. It makes an effort to be respectable and not be one of those dumpy \"let's get drunk\" places to go out in Kent.  If I had to recommend only one place to eat in Kent it'd be Rays.  It's unique and everyone will feel comfortable there."}
{"text":"This establishment has a great menu selection.  Not to mention you receive more then your moneys worth in quality and quantity.  I love this place.  It might actually be my Kent favorite for a bar that serves food.  I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Went for lunch an had great service from walking in the door, had a double bacon cheese burger am the jerk fries which were amazing. The burger was cooked right which was a medium. Price was about What i expected out to be recommended stop when you come threw town."}
{"text":"Large portions and very affordable. Not a fan of their horseradish thousand island dressing on the Reuben."}
{"text":"food was terrific, although teamwork was apparent, our server needed to be much more personable, her personality was very cold, never even looked us in the eyes."}
{"text":"This place was FANTASTIC. We went as a big group one evening and hung out at the bar - which has a wonderful selection of craft beer - one night until we decided to get a table upstairs. That night, I had the pulled pork (incredible) and my fiancé had the chicken parmesan (delicious). Between the atmosphere and the staff, we liked it so much that we went back the next day for lunch! We took more family then and they loved it too. If you try anything, get the jerk fries, pulled pork, and a cold draft beer!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to go. The upstairs bar is better than the downstairs one. If you sit at the bar downstairs, people are most likely going to keep bumping into you. Food is good, but the staff will just look at you weird when you sit down sometimes. Overall, one of my favorite bars in Kent."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place with good food and good beer, but even though I've been there many times I have never had good service. The servers make mistakes and they're way too informal. Sometimes uncomfortably so. I like the food, but Ray's is never my first choice for dinner out on Kent."}
{"text":"This is probably sacrilege, but I think Ray's is just okay. The food is adequate, especially if you just want some typical pub-style beast. There are a few cool menu items (the fried macaroni and cheese, in particular), and there are a number of above average beers on tap. Unfortunately, I've never been a big fan of the atmosphere, the waitstaff isn't particularly friendly, and until recently, you'd smoke a pack and a half just sitting there for an hour. Maybe with Ohio's new smoking ban in place it's a better hangout. Unfortunately, Ray's has just never done anything for me."}
{"text":"I am going to do two reviews of this place, as it changes dramatically depending on when you go.  Review 1:  For dinner, Ray's is very solid.  I have yet to find a bar that rivals the beer selection anywhere else.  The portions are VERY generous (strongly recommend the pasta with sausage and peppers), and the overall atmosphere is very pleasant.  Review 2: This is one of the worst places you could go on the weekend for nightlife.  All the frat boys who aren't still passed out from the previous evening's Bud Light, Cornhole, and Date Rape Extravaganza all flock here to get into fights about Browns v. Steelers and brag about how much they've manscaped in the past week.  Also, the bar TVs will constantly be playing some kind of sport; they will be playing GOLF before Comedy Central is on there.  In addition, the staff is so overrun with orders that you won't get served for a long while.  Overall, I do like this place a lot; I just hate seeing it devolve into what it is on Friday/Saturday evenings."}
{"text":"I had the fish sandwich and shared a basket of fries.  The tilapia was great, the fries - not so much - limp and soggy."}
{"text":"Good food, awesome beer menu. The atmosphere is just okay but the beer makes up for it."}
{"text":"This is the Cheer's bar of Kent.  If you want to run into KSU Alumni or even Drew Carey when he is in town stop here.   They still have the shot wheel for those that are turning 21.  Last year they fixed downstairs with many HDTV's, windows that open to make a more open air bar and a generally more pub feel.  Before 10 pm this is a good restaurant.  I suggest the burgers or the mac and cheese bites.  The food is good for a bar.  After 10 pm is when the Geeks show up, mostly upstairs with Alumni downstairs."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service. Reasonable prices. Would  definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Nice place. Great atmosphere and the burgers where awesome. Definitely will come back again"}
{"text":"Beer specials often (a tall Miller Lite is sometimes less than $3).  Beer tastes really good (I think I read that they meticulously clean their beer lines).  Their burgers are pretty good (I recommend the MoFo).  Sweet fries are delicious.  Mac and Cheese bites?  Yes, please!  Overall good bar food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I just returned to my Youngstown home after a trip to Ray's, and my ears are still steaming. In my 50+ years, I've never been treated as rudely, dismissively or flat-out scornfully by anyone representing \"management.\" I've endured a lot of grievances over the years to make regular pilgrimages to Ray's:  the hour-long drive; terrible parking; an ear-splitting noise level; a no-reservation policy.  But I've remained a loyal patron for a good many years because I love the food:  the pastrami sandwich, the fries, the bacon cheeseburger and most especially the ribs.  Everyone who knows me will tell you that I've raved about them in no uncertain terms, even going so far as to describe them as the best ribs I've ever eaten in a restaurant. (Coincidentally, quite a few of said acquaintances have made the trek to Ray's just to try them, solely because of my ringing endorsement.)  In all my years of devoted patronage, there were only two occasions prior to today that I complained to a server. Once because my (full order) of ribs had arrived stone-cold. The other because the kitchen had apparently forgotten my request to serve the ribs and fries on separate plates (or basket in the case of the fries).  Both times the corrections were made promptly, apologetically and with a smile. Until today. When I remarked to the server that the first two ribs of my half-rack were tough, stringy and dry, she offered to speak with a manager. A man arrived who didn't bother identifying himself, but who clearly seemed to be suffering from anger management issues. He insisted--in no uncertain terms--that the ribs were perfectly fine, and that there was nothing wrong with them. In other words, \"You're an idiot; don't bother me.\" (I thought I was watching a \"before\" section on an episode of \"Restaurant Impossible.\") When I tried to explain the issue I had with the sampled portion of meat, he blew me off, vanishing back to wherever he came from. Since the fries remained untouched--all I'd eaten was the cole slaw and two (out of six) ribs, the server asked if I wanted to take them with me.  A carry-out container was quickly provided. But when the bill arrived, I was puzzled to see that the uneaten (and now absent) ribs were still on the bill.  I told the server that, since I was paying for them, I might as well take the remaining portion home with me. At that point, I optimistically hoped that the remainder of the (half) rack would be up to Ray's usual high standards. She once again offered to speak with a manager. Shortly thereafter, the inconsolably rude gentlemen from earlier returned, this time even more obstinate and nasty than he was previously. He accused me of being a chronic complainer who \"always sends food back\" (?), and asked repeatedly why I bother coming to Ray's at all since I clearly \"don't like the food.\" I'd say that my attempts to explain the situation--and my long-time enthusiasm for his restaurant and the food--fell on deaf ears, but that would be an exaggeration.  He clearly wasn't listening to anything I had to say and walked off in an insolent huff. The (corrected) bill was resubmitted, but nothing could take the vile taste of my two brief encounter(s) with the extraordinarily hostile manager out of my mouth. I left feeling as if I'd lost a friend.  And in a sense I had, since I knew it would surely be a cold day in hell before I walked through the doors of Ray's again. I'll definitely miss the food I grew to love, and the generally top-notch service. But I'll never forget--how could I? how could anyone?--the disrespectful-bordering-on-contemptuous way I was treated. What a horrible way to start the new year."}
{"text":"As other reviews have noted, time of day is the deciding factor in your Ray's experience. Before 10pm, it's the first place I'd recommend in downtown Kent. After ten, the last place I'd recommend. The \"late crowd\" packs the place, to where there is nowhere to stand comfortably; forget about getting a single seat.   Food-wise, it's a step above standard bar fare, both in variety and execution. I've had a number of meals that were far better than they should have been, and the fries are the among the best in town. The selection of beers is staggering, The service is always competent, but nothing to rave about.  It's a fantastic choice for an early date, but a terrible choice for a nightcap."}
{"text":"Underwhelming food. I have yet to be wowed by them.   The service leaves something to be desired too.   Never my first choice. Ever."}
{"text":"If it's your first time in Kent you have to come to Ray's place. A huge beer selection and great long islands. The food is also amazing. Bring your family or go out with friends at night Ray's place is for anyone. Been at for 77 years and going strong. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was tasty. The service was not so good. The waiter rushed us throughout our entire meal, even taking away food we hadn't finished. He made our experience a bit uncomfortable.  The spicy garlic wings are good....try them!"}
{"text":"Ray's Place is always a solid choice when visiting Kent. Great beer and food selection, but it can get a little busy so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Normally my husband and I have no issues with Ray's in Kent.  The food and service is always good. On Sat 1/28/17 we stopped for lunch.  After we finished our meals the server took away the small plates we had not used.  We did have a couple dirty napkins placed on top of them.  I saw the server take the plates to the cart by the window to the kitchen.  He threw the napkins in the garbage then looked at the plates.  He put the bottom plate with the clean dishes.  He inspected the top plated after removing the dirty napkins then decided to put that it with the dirty dishes.  He almost put it with the clean ones.  Hopefully management will coach the newer employees on how to handle dishes from the tables.  Please wash them...."}
{"text":"Love Ray's place.  It was one of the first places I was told I needed to check out when I started working in Kent. It did not disappoint. Hands down the best beer selection in Kent. They have a great selection of craft beers and they consistently add new ones on draft. I've only eaten there a couple of times but the food was great as well. The service is great. Even when the place is packed the staff makes sure you have everything you need. If you're in town you have to check it out."}
{"text":"Draft list had a nice variety. The pig rub wings were amazing. But the staff, ehhh. Took us like 30 minutes to get a check and we had two servers...that were kinda assholes not gonna lie"}
{"text":"This place is a classic in Kent. Known and loved by many. I'm a particular fan of their well-priced burgers and sweet potato fries. The Cuban sandwich is also really good! Best places to sit are upstairs by windows, downstairs tucked in the booths in the room off to the back right or at either bar...upstairs bar is usually my preferred, though they usually have Boddington's on tap downstairs. Ray's serves a wide range of crowds from family at dinner to college students late at night. As the night goes on only expect fried food items from the kitchen."}
{"text":"We love this place for its fries, burgers, and chef salad. Also has a great drink menu. Best bloody marys around and the servers are really friendly and make us feel welcome. (Jocko is our favorite. )"}
{"text":"Love it. Been here on several occasions - difficult to find a seat if you come at prime dinner hours but any good bar/restaurant is. Reasonably priced, always very friendly service. Mostly a beer bar - not really a cocktail type of place (not that they can't make the standards). The only thing I would improve would be the restrooms - extremely dated, dirty and small. Go ahead and take out a booth to make the necessary renovations- your business/customers are worth it."}
{"text":"Do you love frat boys wearing their letters and yelling about which chick they have/have not, would/ would not do?  Nope, I'm not a fan.  I don't care too much for that frat boys at a bar scene.  Rays was the one place that you knew you would end up at because, honestly, that's all there was at Kent back in 01.  It was also the one place that you didn't want to go because you would see the same scene on repeat.  Frat, Frat, Frat and the girls that love them."}
{"text":"Great variety of beers on tap. I had the jambalaya. Really good with a combination of shrimp, sausage, chicken and dirty rice. I also had the jerk fries as a side order. The proportion size of both the jambalaya and jerk fries was huge.  The service was great. I could not ask more of our server   The atmosphere was what you would expect of a well established restaurant in a college town. Prices were what you would expect for what you get. Sadly my wife did't feel the same way. She had a Rubin. The pumpernickel bun was not that tasty, with small amounts of cheese and sauerkraut.  Everybody else at our table was very pleased. This was my first meal at Ray's Place,but not my last."}
{"text":"Use to come here in college about ten years ago. Stopped in while traveling through the area. Always great burgers. Also a good bar."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  However, do not use the condiments. One dude drank the vinegar (out of the bottle!) and we caught and reported him to our waitress. The manager didn't do anything and it was brought back despite our complaint."}
{"text":"Best burger in Kent going away. Famous for chili, though I'm not a chili person.   Interesting atmosphere:  Mid-afternoon basic bar.   Dinner. Almost a family restaurant.   After 10. A student hangout.   It all works."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in one evening as we were passing through. The place was packed so we sat at the bar. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. One of the best french onion soups that I've ever had! Great deal on Wednesdays, all you can eat spaghetti for $2.99 WITH salad and garlic bread. I'm severely picky about spaghetti sauce and Ray's was very good! Huge selection of beer! Servers are great! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been to Rays place countless times.  It is great for hanging out with friends, they have an excellent beer selection, and I think that their service is usually quite efficient given the demands.    I just wish that their food was better.  The menu always seems a bit ambitious, but the sandwiches can be tough, the burgers almost always overdone, and the french fries too greasy.  Also, their drinks always seem a bit watered down.  So, go for the ambience and the history -- but I always try to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to Ray's on a Sunday afternoon. The first bartender who approached us had a bad attitude but the second one was delightful. I ordered a veggie burger and it was delicious as well as the sweet potato fries. However, NEVER order a margarita. They are disgusting and taste like tequila and salt water. Other than that, it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"I love the burgers at Rays, but tonight I tried their flat iron steak served with caramelized onions and balsamic reduction. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Cannot call yourself a true Flash until you go to Rays. Amazing food and some awesome drinks for a great price. I enjoy the MOFO with a long island. Nothing better to get over a exam than a trip to Rays. I did order a Tequila Sunrise and the bartender was upset with my choice which soon became a LI, so you will also learn what a girl drink is lol."}
{"text":"I'd vote 3 1/2 if I could, because the whole \"it's a different restaurant depending on when you go\" thing is absolutely true. I wouldn't step foot in this place on a weekend.  The service is generally good, though sometimes you do get your fair share of apathetic-part-time-college-waiters-who-are-totally-apathetic because its a bar in a college town. Good, not great.  Portions are generous, and for such a huge menu for a bar, its surprisingly consistant. Which while on the whole is a bit above average (3 1/2 again) I think they deserve some respect for being able to put out burgers and lobster ravioli of equal quality. Also, get the jerk fries, they're amazing.  Oh, and heres the thing that made me give 4 as opposed to 3 stars. The Friday Clam Chowder. I've been all across the eastern seaboard and nothing there compares to the thick, creamy, generous serving of their incredibly herby chowder. It may seem a tad pricey for the bowl, but it fills you up reeeeal nice."}
{"text":"Decent bar food.  Honestly, it's a better place to go get drunk and have an inexpensive burger than a place to dine-in with your mom and dad when they come into town. I've never had anything off of their menu that's been bad, so that's a plus.  Edit: I have to amend this review to add that the rueben was absolutely horrid. No dressing and the meat was so dry I have to think that they kept it uncovered in the refrigerator."}
{"text":"Great service  Shelby and Paulina are phenomenal.  The food was great but the service was the best I can remember in any restaurant"}
{"text":"Best brew spot at Kent State.  Amazing brews on tap and in the bottle.  If you can't find your brew here, you're drinking swill.  The food makes great beers taste even better.    Every time I get anywhere near Cleveland, I get my ass to Ray's."}
{"text":"Great burgers...handsdown!  As a Kent Alumni---of course this place is an institution for me.  A friendly relaxed atmosphere, with a large on tap offering, great burgers and fries.   The Mofo burger is my fav----though I can never finish it---the hubby gladly eats his and what I can't eat of mine.  We had the peanut butter cheesecake last night and it was delightful."}
{"text":"Cool vibe to hangout anytime with friends and family  awesome service! I ordered long island tea and cherry bomb shots and so happy about it"}
{"text":"Ray's has awesome burgers, delicious fries, an incredible beer selection, and a lesser known winner in their peanut butter pie. Atmosphere tops it off to perfection. I've enjoyed consistently awesome food from Ray's for the last 16 years. Still flawless."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night.  Once we were seated we waited 45 minutes for our food.  The only thing that was good on the table was the BBQ sauce--good combination of spicy and sweet.  The french fries were limp and the burger looked like a 9-year old cooked it.  My chili was definitely NOT homemade--it was definitely \"bought in\" from a restaurant supply place.  I realize Ray's is an institution in Kent but the food needs some serious resuscitation.  Taco Tantos down the street looks to be a better food option."}
{"text":"This is THE BAR in Kent. It's been around so long that my 91 yr old Mother in law remembers when it was a speak easy during the prohibition. It's the perfect mix of towneies and college students. AWESOME beers! AWESOME burgers! AWESOME menu! The place to be in Kent."}
{"text":"Staff were very knowledgeable concerning food allergies but menu just didn't have many options for gluten free and dairy free. My vegetarian friend was very happy with her vegetable stir fry. We happen to visit on a day that a large group was having a birthday bar crawl and looked to be having a lot of fun. My grilled chicken salad was good. The portion was more than generous. Great location and memories from years past spent in this city and on the campus."}
{"text":"Another Yelp Success Story!     We were visiting the Kent area as my daughter just got accepted at Kent State.    After a great day spent on campus we started looking for a good place to eat and end the day.   Rays Place popped up on Yelp, it was close by, so in we went.   It was on a Friday afternoon, just about ready to hit the dinner rush hour so we were lucky as we only had a 10 min wait or so.   In the mean time the smell of the food cooking and watching everyone guzzle down the beers made everything look very promising.   Clearly when you walk into Rays, there is no doubt this place has been around for some time and it is well used.    Not the cleanest place, BUT, by far not a dump.      The wait staff is energetic, know their way around the menu and provide good tips on what beer to get.   We started off with a few appetizers which one could make a meal of just by this menu alone.   But, we were in good spirits, having a lot of fun and we stuffed ourselves silly and order some main meals as well and boy they did not disappoint us.    Thank you Rays Place for putting the cherry on the top of a great day!"}
{"text":"OMG one of the best burgers ever..oh yeah, the handcut fries ain't so bad either! The service was great and I would certainly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, great beer list, and good pub food. I got the MoFo burger, which was really tasty, however, when I got it the bottom bun was so soaked from the juices that it fell apart and I had no choice but to eat it with a knife and fork, which sort of killed the experience. Would like some better insulation against that in the future. Still, a place I'd definitely return to."}
{"text":"If you love craft beer and great food this is a \"must stop\" place when in Kent.  I go there for their awesome Meatloaf dinner and sandwich while getting my growler filled with the Columbus Bodhi when they have it.  Their beer selection is always one of the best around and food is all cooked on site.  I'm not sure which we like better, the food or the beer:)  The staff is very friendly and prompt too.  Ray's has been around a long time, they know great food and offer great craft beers!!  And don't forget to check out the upstairs bar too, same great food and different beer lists sometimes.  One year later: Back many times and sad to say but food is going downhill I'm afraid.  Beers are great but last three times here very disappointed with our meals.  Service is still great just not tasty like it use to be.  Fries hard or very crunchy etc?  So great place for drinking but that is it lately."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and gave it a try - glad we did! The craft beer selection was very good and we tried the famous Ray's Reuben sandwich with a side of coleslaw. Both were delicious. All the other reviews were true - great place to drink, hang out with friends and eat if you feel like it. Classic college town pub atmosphere."}
{"text":"On an episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate on the Food Network, Michael Symon named the MoFo at Ray's the best burger he'd ever had... and he owns hamburger restaurants. So while in that part of the world, I stopped in for a MoFo. I'd been to Ray's before, but only for the brews, many, many years ago. I must say, the MoFo is gigantic, so much so that I believe it has it's own gravitational pull as mine practically imploded on itself. Easily the messiest burger I've ever had, but it was very, very tasty! Just know that this is a burger in which you might have to repent after eating, as your very soul may need a good scrub."}
{"text":"This place has surprisingly amazing food for being a great bar. Usually you get one or the other. It gets packed when there's a game on and when the late night crowd comes in, but service is always good and attentive. If you can, try the Mofo burger! It's awesome in every sense of the word. It's one of those burgers that once you pick it up, you can't put it down. Too messy to risk it, but it's also that good. Peppers in oil, jerk fries, and nachos are also worth getting."}
{"text":"Updating my review...but keeping the rating the same.  Here's why.  I like Ray's.  Really.  It's my favorite place to go with friends after a long week of graduate school work.  I love the atmosphere and the staff members who work there are great.  And yeah, they still serve Woodchuck.  I do have two gripes.  First, they're kind of overpriced for what they serve.  I somehow managed to drop $50 here last time.  And they have a really bad habit of \"forgetting\" to give you the happy hour discounts.  From 4-9pm on most days they offer $1 off all drafts.  Well, when you get your bill later in the night, your discounts aren't reflected.  And your server will probably make a huge fuss if you ask that you bill be fixed.  Gripe two: The food really sucks.  On my last review, I said it was passable.  I don't think so anymore.  Last time I went I ordered a grilled cheese and when they brought it out, the cheese wasn't even melted.  So, I sent it back.  When it was returned to me, it was exactly the same as when I sent it back, so they obviously didn't do anything to it.  Also, it tastes like they put salt all over the bread.  Really gross.  I've had similar issues with the quesadillas, the hummus (their hummus is foul), the veggie burger (also foul) and many other things.  The only \"Safe\" menu option is the sun stix (sweet potato fries) and even those are mediocre compared to other places.  Go for the drinks and for the company, but do not go for the food."}
{"text":"If you aren't already a regular, I wouldn't bother with this place. The tables are jammed so close you can smell the person at the table next to you, and the noise was deafening.  All of our food was either cold or burnt to a crisp, and took an hour to get to us after ordering. My ribs were so burnt (blackened meat and bone slathered in bbq sauce) they were inedible, and half the fries they were served on were still frozen. The fiancee's meatloaf was cold and mediocre at best, and her deep fried mushrooms were overcooked on the outside and under cooked on the inside.  They also charged my fiancee 11$ for an Alabama Slammer that didn't seem to have any alcohol in it."}
{"text":"I stopped by here while on a road trip with my brother. He saw this place on a food show, so I was like \"Hell yes lets go!!\"  We slip the mofo burger and it was really good, tasted like a typical greasy spoon burger but like 3 times the size. It was not bad, it was just not special. More does not make it taste better. Fries were good and greasy and the beer selection was as nice. I don't know how it go recognition to be on a TV show, either way I am glad we tried it."}
{"text":"I really like Ray's place for an after work beer or cocktail.  They make a really good long island iced tea and their nachos are very good for a group of friends to share. My husband loves the MOFO As far as the evening, it is your typical bar scene on a college campus.  i will not downgrade my rating due to the people that are there late in the evening (typically after 10pm).  It is not the fault of the establishment on how people behave.  As a matter of fact, I give any employee of a college bar props for dealing with \"those people\" that cant help themselves."}
{"text":"Car Bombs. Good Beer. Good Liquor (and by good I mean Bombay Sapphire)."}
{"text":"Very nice and a friendly atmosphere.  Stopped in for a quick bite. There was no wait time.  Food and wine selections were great . Service was excellent thanks to Brenton. Would definately recommend this place.  Thx DR MD"}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of beers, from darks to IPA. I love their sun sticks (sweet potato fries). Sometimes I go there for a snack giant basket of sweet potato fries and a cold beer."}
{"text":"Ray's is a local staple - let's be real, everyone loves Ray's. Any time alumni visit or family comes in from out of town, Ray's is where they want to go. It's a really cool place, with exposed brick, walls of windows, and two floors - which means two different bars, with different beers on tap depending on where you are. I haven't had anything bad here, but my favorite is definitely the Cuban Sandwich - instead of on a bun, they serve the sandwich on flat bread (which means its huge), and instead of mustard, they serve an annato mayo on the side. And I don't know what's in it, but I wish I did because i would put it on everything. I always ask for extra sauce, and I go through all of it - it's delicious. Ray's is vey well-known for the burgers (and those are good too), but I highly recommend giving the Cuban a try.  Ray's drink game is strong, too. Like I said, they have two different bars, which means they have twice as many taps available as most places. And they switch out the options regularly, so there's always something new to try. One thing I'm trying to get into is asking for samples of beers before I make my decision, and Ray's is a great place to start the habit, because there's so much to choose from. If you're not into beer, no worries - they also serve wine, and their cocktails are affordable and well made.  Considering how popular Ray's is, it's not uncommon to have a wait, especially if you have a larger party. I've recently noticed that they've started seating guests on the weekends, which is a big culture change. And I'm not sure I like it - Ray's is a bar, and it's set up like a bar. There's no space for a hostess station, and without that, there's no visual cue that you shouldn't seat yourself - so you'll see a lot of confused customers wondering why they can't stay at the table they found for themselves. But it's no reason not to go - just look around as you walk in to see if there's a bartender-turned-hostess running around seating people before you search out a table on your own."}
{"text":"great service but the food was okay we had the mo-fo burger just too much meat not  much flavor just because you add bacon and mushroom it doesn't make it great like some rating give it. There was it nothing great about it, pulled pork was dry  I just don't know how they can be in business with food like this. There were a lot of people at lunch time why? I wouldn't go back there, we were visiting from out of town on a visit Kent State."}
{"text":"The burgers are definitely NOT overrated.. you've gotta try one. The prices are meh.. average'ish. I'd say the quantities are what makes the place decent, oh, and the taste of the food is great for bar food/a greasy spoon. Good \"American food\". Expect the bad atmosphere and you'll be satisfied/pleased with your experience at Ray's Place in Kent, Ohio."}
{"text":"Stopped here when at Kent for a college function.  The place was pretty busy so I figured it had to be good.  At the encouragement of the waitress pumping the smoked meat, I decided on pulled pork.  Everything is ala carte so I also ordered cole slaw and rings.  Pulled pork was medium warm.  Overly smoked and sauce was bland and salty.  Cole slaw was typical and fresh.  Rings were heavily breaded and greasy.   This is the place for late night, drunk dining.  I wouldn't rexommend otherwise on what I ordered.  Service was immediate and friendly."}
{"text":"1 - Why are french fries not included with your sandwiches?  A sub-par wrap with fries should not cost $10.  This is Kent, Ohio, not a major city!  2 - Why did the doorgirl study my ID (Illinois) like she was studying for the GMAT when I was walking in with my dad?"}
{"text":"Lets be real -- we can't beat the beer selection @ Rays. I love the changing taps and specials and appreciate being able to get any type of beer I'm in the mood for.  Now to the food -- I honestly hate most of the menu, but I will give them some props for the newly added tacos which I have enjoyed.  Its a classic hang out, so I go with friends - but I really enjoy long periods without Rays."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, warm inviting environment. Great little neighborhood restaurant. Always happy to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to go for a while, as it is quite a legend in the Kent area. While I passed on the \"MOFO\" burger, I opted instead for a burger of lesser size, and a side of fries to share. My freind also had a smaller burger and it was plenty of food. The burgers were good, not great, but very well cooked and pretty moist. The fries were good as well. Service was excellent, and the decor is vintage sports bar..........which is what this place has always been!! I'll definately be back!"}
{"text":"It's a classic Kent spot that always is a bast on the weekend nights. It's a little overrated when it comes to their food, but it is good quality and priced well."}
{"text":"Beat burgers in Kent by far!   Oh the atmosphere is ok too.  :P    You cant go wrong eating at Rays.  They also have a huge beer selection from around the world so if you like to drink the suds..."}
{"text":"Best beer selection in Kent by far! And it's always rotating, so there's always something new to try. And the food is above average for a bar. I never have to wait long for service and the staff is incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Great beer taps. Great atmosphere. Jerk rubbed chicken wings to die for. Calamari. ...a must order. After these aps and Firkin Friday beer....we are ready for the weekend!  Great job, Ray's!"}
{"text":"Greeted as I entered and picked a, table in the middle of the restaurant.  Big menu with lots of choices.  Ordered a draft beer and I came quickly to the table.  Ordered a dinner salad and it was promptly served, but it had a lot of brown lettuce in it, mixed with the spinach and other leafy veggies.  The blue cheese dressing was out of a bottle, but was good.  Waitress suggested the Ruben..."}
{"text":"Yummy and fun! This is such a great, young restaurant/bar. There atmosphere is hip, quirky, and exciting. Their Long Island is the favorite drink for everyone. Their burgers are delicious as well. I have a lot of fun whenever I come here no matter what hour it is (dinner time or going out time). I recommend coming here with a group of friends to hang out and eat some appetizers. The conversations will flow and no one will want to leave!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan.  Professional and attentive staff, delicious food, affordable prices.  I've never had fries so fresh!  Just come here for the fries....nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"Since I was visiting my baby sis in college (Kent), I came here for lunch with them, hearing that there's this MOFO burger that was pretty awesome to try. Even if I'm on this strict diet of mine, I decided to try it anyways since I came from out of town and supposedly it's amazing. Boy, was I right. It felt like I didn't have a burger in ages! Stacked with 2 meat patties and all the works, it was DE-licious. It's definitely a lot to consume for 1 person so I split it up with my sister.   The bottom bun got soggy after having it stacked with lots of ingredients on top but I didn't care much about it anyways since I was starving. Along with our burgers, we also ordered their sweet potatoe fries which was good as well but we ordered way too much food for just 4 of us. We were stuffed!   As far as the place goes, it's a casual. So nothing fancy at all. It is a bar at night but during the daytime, they serve breakfast and lunch. The bathrooms were a bit out-dated and kinda gross. But what can you expect from a bar that was probably filled with college students the night before?"}
{"text":"I love Ray's place it is a great place to eat, it is a great place to go have a drink late at night. The burgers and beer selection are amazing. When in Kent this is the place you have to go to."}
{"text":"Great gathering place, I sit next to the open window looking out across the old brick road towards the old railroad depot. The place was filled up when I got there and also when I left. I had the Wiskey Peppercorn sauce steak with steamed vegetables and salad, it was very tasty.  Service was fantastic, I never had to ask for a refill."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch. Grecian salad huge, fresh, and yummy. Tomato bisque soup was creamy and rich. Loved it. Enjoyed the character of the old building. Wait staff was average."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places on earth. We had the best times here in the late 90's. The ambiance can't be duplicated. Went yesterday and nothing has changed. Their fries are awesome! Smoked wings were great. I had the blue moon sandwich. It's way way better than Panini's. Please don't ever change or go out of business. I was so happy to be there yesterday."}
{"text":"I guess I was under the impression that this place was actually a restaurant and not just a bar, but when I showed up last night for dinner, the place was overcrowded and completely unorganized.  The doorman was there taking IDs like a bar, but we were there for food.  There was no hostess and as far as I could tell, no waitresses either.  Cocktail servers, yes, but no one serving food.  I don't know when they serve food, and I assume they do since they have a menu, but apparently it's not always an option just to go have dinner here.  When it's not clear as as to when you can and cannot sit down and have dinner and the staff is disorganized, I'm not likely to come back."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after some drinks at Dominiks do the road on a Friday night around 9:45pm. They sat us quickly, the kitchen closes at 10pm. We quickly ordered, I ordered the mo-fo burger, my friend ordered the bacon cheese burger and we split a basket of fries. The mo-fo burger was amazing but a bite hard to eat since it was so big. The bun fell apart a little but it did not slow me down, I just made a mess of myself lol. The fries on the other hand were just so-so. They were un-seasoned and with no salt. Needless to say I was not impressed with them and would order a different side to compliment the burger next time. My friend enjoyed her burger as well the bacon was delicious. The atmosphere as the typical bar.  I would recommend this place for a great burger. I look forward to trying so of the other food."}
{"text":"Stopped by after visiting Kent State.  This restaurant was pretty busy for 2 pm, but there were tables still available.  We had a pulled pork sandwich, Cuban sandwich, bacon cheeseburger and kids spaghetti.  None of the sandwiches came with a side, you had to order sides separate, so we ordered a basket of fries.  It was more than enough for 3 people.  The sandwiches were liked by us who had them--I had the Cuban and it was amazing!  Food came out quick and was hot.  The kids spaghetti was disappointing.  It was a plate of noodles with a small cup of sauce and one meatball.  No additional side (other kids meals came with fries or applesauce).    Still a good place to stop for a meal!"}
{"text":"I was in town and read some good reviews so thought I'd try it out. Ordered a newer item the poutine. Their version has fries, pork, pork gravy, green onions and sprinkled with lettuce.  I was pretty pumped until it showed up. I've had poutine at dozens of places, and I like all the ingredients they had listed but this dish showed up in a disgusting pile and just didn't work together. The wilted lettuce on top just made it worse. I tried to be open minded and tried a couple bites before giving up. When I went to pay my tab the bartender had left it on there, I had already told him i wasn't happy with the dish and returned 95% of it. He simply told me \"yea it's not a traditional poutine\" (DUH!) and never offered to take it off. I'm a generous tipper and not afraid to spend money on  good food, won't be back here though !"}
{"text":"this place USED to have one of the best burgers in Ohio...hands down, but now the burgers stink.   They used to source their hamburger beef locally grassfed, and the burgers were defintely 4.5 star quality. now its supplied by Costco and you can taste it . gone way down hill since i remember first going there. I think Michael Simon experienced his Mo Fo burger when they supplied the grass fed beef.   go to swensons for a burger, order the 1/4 pounder , it will run you about $3.50 hands down one of the best burgers on earth.  Ray's does warrant a second star due to the superior beer selection."}
{"text":"So I really didn't remember eating here a lot when I was in college at Kent, but I knew I had to take my fiancé here when we were in town. I'm so glad I did!  We started with the eggplant dip that was so good. It was flavorful without being overpowering. A great start to our meal.  I had the stuff gourmet burger & oh my god was it good! The onions, cheese, mushrooms everything together was on point!!! Hunny got the bacon cheeseburger and was equally pleased! We decided to split the single order of jerk fries and I'm so glad we did!! Fresh cut fries with awesome seasoning, sign me up again!!"}
{"text":"Going strong for 77 years and now under its fourth owner, Charles Thomas, we've frequented Rays Place since Jack Lambert partied here. Yes, THE Jack Lambert of KSU and Pittsburgh Steelers fame. Side Note: He had all his teeth then.)  Beers on tap so numerous they change eight each month as new beers. Known as one of the first bars in the US to televise football games.  Great sandwiches with many burger choices. Opens at 11 through 2:30 am with a special \"late night\" menu after 11 pm. Noisy late at night with students. Pleasant until then with distincltly different lunch and dinner crowds.  The phone booth doesn't work any more but that is the only change in all these years. Known by parents of all KSU grads with no bad references. Come and enjoy a burger and a brew at Rays.  Edited to add: These men have also been known to eat and drink here: Rich Rollins, Thurman Munson, Steve Stone, Nick Sabin and Josh Cribbs."}
{"text":"Ray's Place as a restaurant is about three or four stars. There's a lot on the menu, varying in quality, but at least you have the option.  Ray's as a bar is the best spot in Kent. The upstairs level is very college-y, with a pool table, full bar, and brightly lit. It's always packed.   The main floor/downstairs is cozily lit. The music is never intrusively loud, nor is the sound. Rays is the type of bar you can have a conversation at. If it's not a more mature crowd, then it's a more chill crowd. The people looking to get rowdy usually stop in to spin the birthday wheel and leave or go upstairs.   One thing I cannot praise Rays enough for is forcing their bartenders to be educated on how to properly make a drink. Their legendary Long Island's are always consistent in taste. I've never had a drink made so poorly it was undrinkable, which I can't say for other bars in the area.   Ray's is an awesome way to kick off, end, or even spend the night at. You'll never run into a sobbing drunk girl or someone passed out in the bathroom. You'll have quality drinks and a relaxed night."}
{"text":"Decent place in downtown Kent. The I ordered a burger and fries, burger was good, but I'm always confused/dubious when they don't ask how you want it cooked (it appeared to be medium). The fries were okay, but were a but soggy. Overall, nice place, nothing amazing, nothing bad."}
{"text":"Ray's Place was the first place I ever visited in Kent.  For a Bar in Kent, it's really nice inside and the food is good, the beer list is excellent.  For a restaurant, the service is slow and the place is just too damn loud... so if you're looking for a place to go out with people where you'll have plenty of time to talk but where you can't hear anything, Ray's is the place.  The food is good and it is generous.  The sandwiches are delicious, particularly the cheeseburgers.  The reuben is also a favorite.  I've never gone wrong with the daily soup specials either.  The beer list is pretty diverse and deep, with probably more than a dozen on draught, though I think a nice budget option (PBR anyone?) would be a good addition.  In my experiences, Ray's has different clientele at different parts of the day.  Lunch seems to be mostly Kent business people and such, dinner seems to be more the university faculty, and at around 11 pm it shifts markedly toward annoying preppy college brats.  While it's loud during dinner, it gets really loud when drunk frat boys yell at each other during the later hours.  Ray's is the best bar-restaurant in Kent, by far (though not the best bar) in terms of things you ingest, but beware the changing atmosphere and the noise."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and beer choices.  Get the sweet potato fries and the peanut butter pie....trust me."}
{"text":"Nachos were a joke, I had to pay extra for each dip, the only good one was the cheese. The salsa came warm in temperature and tasted more like spaghetti sauce. The fries looked like a big soggy mess. I did think that the mac n cheese bites were ok though."}
{"text":"It's Rays! What's not to like? Food isn't bad, some items are much better than others - I like their rubens and fries. Decent beer selection."}
{"text":"I liked this bar. It was a fun place to hang out and have a couple drinks with friends without spending a fortune. The food was better than most bar food. Their menu is actually pretty extensive and they have daily specials. Everything was very reasonably priced. I had the atomic burger and Cajun fries.  Burgers are only $5-$6 and we ordered a basket of fries to share for 2 people and it was huge. 2 burgers, fries, and 4 beers came to $42. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Visited Ray's Place when visiting some friends in the Kent area - and although we are definitely over the average college-town age, it was a good option!  Food was relatively inexpensive and the menu had great choices - Definitely recommend the goat cheese and marinara app.  Cute restaurant for a college town!"}
{"text":"Love Rays. Discovered five years ago and love it. Perfect college bar restaurant feel. Good selection of drafts, flights are fun. Nice menu selection have never gotten bad good here. Peppers in oil is great local appetizer; basic appetizer but some ice surprises. Excellent burgers, corned beef has an addicting smoky flavor. Downsides- wait for a table; college town organization; loud( guilt that comes with sitting too long as hungry people look over your shoulder. Rays is pretty much Kent."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good time, come with Ray to his place after hours.  All I remember about my last visit to this place is they have Delirium Tremens here. Their beer selection is the best in Kent, hands down. It's also the nicest bar in Kent, in my opinion. This is my favorite place to chill with my adopted AE brethren or my binge drinking lady friends.  The atmosphere cannot be beaten. The prices are average for Downtown Kent, so a night out with friends can easily cost you $20 or more. Still beats DC prices, but keep in mind you're in a college town when you eat here.  Yes, Michael Symon did make the 45 minute drive from Downtown Cleveland to Kent for an episode of \"The Best Burger I've Ever Eaten\". Apparently, the MOFO is the best burger I've never eaten. It has great reviews, as does their other food, but I can't comment on the food here."}
{"text":"Rays Place may have seen on TV, Best Thing I Ever Ate.The food is Good nothing spectacular it is average bar food. The bar on the other hand is really fun great people lots of room and the bar service is pretty solid. the food menu is big with nothing that stands out. The best thing in my opinion on the menu would probably be there burger selections."}
{"text":"Ray's is an institution, a delicious, delicious institution. Great beer list, great food list. The only thing I see as a consistent issue is that we're frequently there with kids (during normal kid-friendly hours...tyvm...they have a kids' menu, okay?) and the servers don't seem to understand the importance of GTFO when we're done eating. Bring us the check, take our credit card, and bring it right back. I cannot stress how important this is to us, to the kiddos, and most importantly, to the other patrons."}
{"text":"YUM! Had a Christmas Ale(or two) with a friend and ordered a MOFO with \"O\" rings and breaded mushrooms...Delish, forgot to get some of Gerties chili but I plan to go back again soon... Place has been around forever but they keep it simple and good....So in or around the Kent area? Yeah you gotta stop by..."}
{"text":"Very good burger, would have enjoyed brewed iced tea. It looked like they have a nice beer selection but it was lunch time and I was working. Perhaps next time I'm in the area. Nice little place to grab a bite and a drink."}
{"text":"Went for the mo-fo burger...  Ordered the spicy shrimp appetizer which was drenched in spicy sauce.  I asked for a roll to have some of the sauce. Didn't end up eating the burger; instead took it home to my daughter who loves them.    Service was good, interiors haven't changed since I went to college at KSU (many years ago).  Great Pub."}
{"text":"\"Yeah! That's my mo-fo!\" -- Jerry Maguire (1996)  I travel quite a bit for work and rely on Yelp to help me find the right places to eat (Thanks fellow Yelpers). My coworker was no help, so I happened upon Rays. I ready so much about the Jerk fries and the MoFo Burger, we just had to come.  This is definitely a \"hang-out\" type of joint. The place was busy, but not too busy. A more relaxed atmosphere, but this isn't a place to come when you are in a hurry. My coworker and I grabbed a seat and ordered a couple of things to start and a couple of drinks. He was happy with the beer selection, so we were all set.   Jerk fries are where's its at! This is a MUST. So flavorful, you just can't stop eating them. We also ordered the fried mac n cheese. They were good, but paled in comparison to the fries. I mean, really everything did. I also ordered the MoFo Burger (as instructed by fellow Yelpers) and I wasn't disappointed, but it was a lot. It's a double stack, but more-so than I am used to where I am from. Usually, they are super thin patties. So when I was asked how I wanted it cooked, I knew it was going to be big.  The burger came out medium (as instructed) and it was juicy and delicious. Piled high with toppings (mushrooms, ftw) and tough to eat (who has a mouth that big?). I had to squash it down to be able to eat it - and it was pretty messy. I was too full to try the peanut butter pie (fail), but man it looked amazing. I would come back again, for sure.  But damn those fries..."}
{"text":"I had been to Ray's several times in the past, but based on Michael Simon's recommendation, I tried the MoFo. I was not disappointed. Fresh beef, cooked to perfection, fresh toppings. A pretty good crowd on a Friday at 10ish did not prevent our server from doing a nice job with a pleasant attitude.  The area is pretty cool, with several eateries and bars. Especially in the summer us older folks can relive the feel of a college town without having to wade through drunken frat boys.  I would encourage those looking for hummus and vegetarian to seek other options. This place is good for tavern food."}
{"text":"I feel like I would like this place a lot more if I could drink. The food is alright, just the typical bar food but it is always fairly busy and exciting which I like. It's definitely the place where the college kids come to drink and watch sports games but the people in it usually aren't obnoxious."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened tonight?  Kitchen was REALLY REALLY slow. Cjrcked in on yelp nearly 50 minutes ago. One  or two drinks later and we are still waiting on food.     We are hungry!!!    Big change ..... very disappointed, no more flat iron steak with Blue chhese"}
{"text":"Ray's is one of the oldest bars in Kent and holds a special place in the heart of nearly every local & student! If you are from the area, you know all about Ray's.   But if you're not, it's a classic themed, two story bar and restaurant that serves typical American food and good beer (as well as a full bar). At night, the upstairs area turns into the typical bar scene. I've never actually hung out downstairs after hours... I think maybe the older crowd hangs out down there?  If it's your birthday you get a free shot by spinning a giant wheel and taking the one it lands on. But these shots are purposely made the be really gross and unusual"}
{"text":"Service and food are awesome! Beer selection is vast and the staff know what they're talking about. I can't wait to come back and get the mussels again! Goat cheese and marinara were great also."}
{"text":"This place is great! The downstairs seems small, but then there's a whole 2nd level with an additional bar and dining space. They have plenty of vegan/vegetarian options outside of your typical bar food option - black bean burger. They accommodated a group of 20-25 of us and made our experience one I'll definitely repeat. Our server, Chris, was super helpful and we'll request him on our next visit. He paid attention and really helped make this visit go smoothly."}
{"text":"Couldn't get enough of this place.  During my first visit to Kent, we went here twice in one day, once during the day and the other late at night.  Their Cuban sandwich is memorable.   I usually forget how foods taste after like 2 or 3 days, but its been about 60 days since I've had their food and I remember it.  Their menu describes their version of the Cuban as a sandwich with \"ham, smoked pork, swiss cheese and dill pickles pressed together between grilled flatbread.  Served with a side of Annato mayonnaise.\" I was salivating as I was eating the sandwich--it was that good!  That Annato mayo was something else, I'd like to take a bottle of it home and just put it on everything I make.    When we went to Rays later that day for their night life, their kitchen was closed but they still had cold sandwiches. I had the turkey sandwich.  I'm not much of a cold sandwich person, but I was hungry, it tasted good and it did the trick.  They stuffed that sandwich with A LOT of juicy turkey!      Great experience!  I'll be back the next time I'm in Kent."}
{"text":"Food is really mediocre and the service can vary from excellent to awful. I came in on a Tuesday night to an understaffed restaurant. It took over 40 minutes for half my party to be served their burgers and the other half of the group, including myself, happened to never get our food, so we left after an hour of waiting. The manager said that this Tuesday happened to be busier than normal, but if the staff could not manage handling the large crowd, then the number of tables for food service should have been limited. I would rather wait for a table and get good service than sit at a table for over an hour being ignored by the overworked servers who can barely manage to handle the number of people they are serving."}
{"text":"Don't order the salad it damn near comes to you with an uncut tomato, onion, cucumber and whole head of lettuce..."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, so-so burgers.  I was underwhelmed by the Mo'Fo burger, which I ordered on the recommendation of many other yelpers. It was certainly large enough, but the meat was flavorless, and I felt generally pretty sick for the rest of the day.   If you're looking for a burger made with flavorful, local, high quality beef, take your business to B-Spot or the Rail."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by tonight and the food was great and in large portions definitely get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and the best French Onion soup in town!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, ambiance, beer list and service. The Mo Fo burger lived up to the hype.  The wait staff is super, helpful and eager to help.  The basket of fries were like going to the fair.  The Reuben was enormous but so full of flavor.  The burgers are flame grilled with the edge crust that makes the burger.  They cook their burgers to medium and it was delicious. Must stop in Kent.  Plus, extensive beer menu!  Always a plus."}
{"text":"Students were on break, but still crowded. Great space, lively, with just enough tv's to follow game, but not enough to dominate conversation and turn it into just another sports bar. In particular, the bartenders were friendly and knowledgable.  Plenty of fine microbrews on tap.  Noise level wasn't so high so as to discourage conversation. Even the Tina salad sandwich wasn't half bad."}
{"text":"Avoid this place until they get their kitchen in order. On a normal, not that busy night the kitchen took almost two hours to send our two burgers, dozen wings and basket of fries. Ridiculous. The burger came raw. This place needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Ray's is a comfortable and friendly place to hang out. The early crowd is less frat-like and more sophisticated so if that's your group you'd better be there before 11pm. The food is good and has remained relatively stable throughout the years. Broccoli Cheddar balls and the hamburger your way are faves and the wings are phenomenal.  With the Ohio smoking ban Ray's has transformed, no longer do you leave with the need to shower and wash your clothes - and the food tastes oh so much better without the smoke! There was a remodel last summer and Ray's now sports windows along the front lower bar area that allow in lots of light and great views of the Pufferbelly, Gazebo, and the road. Overall, Ray's Place is a classic college town bar with different on-tap selections in the first and second-floor bars as well as any mixed drink you can think of and plenty of wines by the glass."}
{"text":"Ray's has some great food including the best burgers in Kent and what I would argue is the best sandwich I've yet had in Kent - the CUBAN.  I tried the Cuban once on a whim and now I am obsessed.   The Cuban consists of smoked pulled pork and ham (double pork!) sandwiched in between two flatbreads with melty cheese (I usually ask for Pepperjack but it comes with Swiss) and crispy wonderful dill pickle slices. It is served with a side of \"Annato Mayo\" which is an unusual sauce that I find intellectually confusing but quite palatable and complimentary to the sandwich in practice. This sandwich is BIG so I'm usually left with at least a second half that gets happily devoured for lunch later in the week. Amazing with their jerk fries which are fantastically spiced! (And a \"single\" order of fries, as opposed to the \"basket\", comes in a smaller basket and is plenty for two to split!)   It's often quite busy, and sometimes it's difficult to find a table if the upstairs is closed. You can eat at the bar but waiting around is well worth it as well!  They run a tight ship here and I've found service is consistently good even when they're slammed.  In terms of it also being a bar, they have a wonderful selection of drafts and ok cocktails. Long Island Ice teas seem to be perpetually on sale and they are ok too. For some reason, this is the bar everyone decides they want to be at around 1:30am. I've never understood waiting at the door to get into a bar fifteen minutes before last call but I guess it's a thing.    Ray's gets extra kudos for what I've heard second-hand about their great treatment of employees. It seems like they go all out for their people with events like their employee Christmas party and summer camp-out."}
{"text":"Overrated. The burgers are decent, but nothing special. They have a famous \"mofo\" burger that is okay, it just has everything under the sun piled on it. Overpriced for sure, I paid $17 for a mofo, (the doesn't even come with fries) a fish sandwich, a side of fries and WATER. They're going to have to lower their prices and up their quality to stay in business with all the new ones coming in."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town and had Rays recommended. I had the Ray's Reuben and she had the Chicken Gyro. Both were excellent. I rate places on how good their Reuben is and Ray's was one of the better Reuben's I've had in the last 10 years. I'd definitely like to try some other options since my introduction to Ray's was great."}
{"text":"I came here from Cleveland and was in kent for work so I yelped good places around me and this place came up. Based on the reviews fried mac&cheese, jerk fries, and a burger is the way to go. I got all of those which I got the Atomic Burger, sounds better than it was. By no means was the FOOD BAD, it just wasn't anything special.   First with the mac&cheese bites they were good. If you have ever gotten mac&cheese bites at Sheetz, these are the same exact ones and probably more expensive. I would not say this is a must have item.   The atomic burger wasn't anything special. The patty seemed like it might have been out of a box. The party was bland. The toppings was nothing special just some pepper jack cheese and some Jalapeños out of a jar. I would try something else than a burger if I came back here.   The jerk fries were good. The portion is large enough for two people to eat them. If you are into the jerk dust I would recommend them. They were also fresh cut so that is a plus.   The bar overall has a very cool vibe I would go there to drink at night. Their cash register is old school and give a cool touch. Lots of beer options too!"}
{"text":"Dropped by this little tavern on my son's visit to KSU. Had the special of the day a smoked BBQ chicken.  The portion was enormous!  The taste was superb. I loved the dark woody look to the dining area. It was recommended by an alum of the college as well as two faculty members... You won't be disappointed if you try Rays..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan and have been for years! Always great service and great food! When people come visit me in Kent, they always choose Ray's! The steak salad or Ruben are my go-to's. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Micheal Symon from network had this place on Best thing I ever ate. He was right the food is great and so is the service, I had a bacon cheese Philly and it was great.  I will be going back again. Kids can come here too."}
{"text":"I was not a fan of rays, and the purple I went with were not either. The staff was ok, not very attentive but not outright mean. The drinks were very average. However, it was our friends birthday and they wouldn't let him into the bar because he didn't have a second form of ID (he was from PA). Who does that? It doesn't make sense that people should not be allowed in just because they were from a different state and didn't have another ID form. After that, we Obviously all left immediately since we weren't just gonna let him be outside alone. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I just absolutely love this place. It's in an old authentic building that is classic downtown Kent. I used to love coming here late nights when I was a college student, but now that I am older, I come here sometimes for dinner and a beer just because the atmosphere is very lively and it is fun. The food is good and it is REALLY cheap. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Ray's is hands down my favorite place in NE Ohio to get a Burger!  When you want good old Bar Food, this is where you go. While the Burgers are the highlight for me, the wings and fries are also huge hits! Especially the Jerk Fries!  The also have a fairly extensive list of Craft Beers on tap and in bottle. Each time I go I find something new.    The first time I was here I found my favorite burger, the MoFo! I got to wash it down with a WTF beer! I love telling that story. Ray's is the only place I know where you can get a MoFo and WTF!   It can get crowded in here at peak times but they do have downstairs and upstairs seating. If one looks busy, check the other. It is a perfect place for after work gatherings or parties. They have always accommodated our large work groups if we call a few days ahead.  The staff has been great and always knowledgeable of the menu including drinks.  Since it is located in downtown Kent, parking can be tricky at times but if you luck out, you can find free street parking. Just don't try to park across the street in the Puffer Belly lot. They watch it like hawks!"}
{"text":"There is a group of us from work that have been coming to Ray's for Friday lunch for years.  So obviously I'm a regular, but I really think it is just OK.  It is a landmark in Kent, been here forever.  You almost have to check it out at least once.  For the most part it your typical bar food, with a little bit of an update.  Burgers, sandwiches, even some salads.  They used to have lunch specials, but they disappeared a while ago.  Generally, the more unhealthy (burgers, meatloaf sandwich, corned beef) the better it is; their healthier stuff isn't as good (though the taco salad is pretty good).  Everyone talks about their big baskets of fries, but I think the fries are just OK; non-crispy shoestring fries.  It is kind of variable, some Fridays it is very busy, others are quiet.  There are days the kitchen and waitstaff is better than others.  I'd probably even give it 2.5 stars if Yelp let me, but I'd struggle to give it 3.  I wish it was better than it really is."}
{"text":"Met a friend here after the Kent State football game. We ordered a Reuben, Cuban sandwich and a BLT along with a basket of fries. Sandwiches were very good and very big. The fries were huge and just like you'd get at the fair. Do yourself a favor and try Ray's next time in downtown Kent."}
{"text":"Great service, warm ambience, and excellent food! This is my go to stop when I go out to eat in Kent. They have award winning burgers and the wings are pretty fabulous too (just order them extra crispy!) They feature specialty drinks each month, and the bartenders have to pass an exam before serving so they know what they are doing. Try their long island (better than any other I've had) or futhermucker if you want something a little sweeter."}
{"text":"It really had the feel of a Colorado Brewery, with the windows open to the street and the mellow tone.  Bar tender was uber friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.  He made an amazing Black and Tan that was made with Rasputin instead of Guinness.  Fantastic!  Lots of good food options beyond the usual bar foods including mussels and some pickle fries.  Fun relaxing place.  Lots of beer choices.  Would like to try their club sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place and will always come back but our waitress  needs a personality adjustment."}
{"text":"The food is unmemorable but tasty and effective. I like drinking at rays place with friends on weekends because the music machine is cool and the bar seems chill and unassuming. What I mean by that is I feel more comfortable hanging there than the water street tavern or zephyr. Oh, and the pool tables upstairs are fun. :)"}
{"text":"Looking for a beer and a burger? Look no further. This place has a great selection on tap. Be sure to try their beer flight to get a good buzz going.  Food is flavorful; I'm especially taken with the MoFo burger and the wings. The wings, in particular, were not over-fried nor dry and stringy - rather, they were perfectly juicy, tender, and hot.  Overall, the dining/drinking experience was a good one. Service was snappy. Get a bar seat to observe the bartenders punch in sales on an old-time cash register. It's all good fun."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but a great burgers-and-fries place if you're down for some casual fare. Prices are more than reasonable and portions are ample. Great craft beer selection, too. FYI, there is an upstairs, so don't be discouraged if the downstairs is full. Try this if you're in the neighborhood for a show at the Kent Stage, as it is right around the corner."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Kent, you probably already know Ray's. The place is an institution. Great beer list, Friendly Staff, decent bar food with wide selection, always loud, always busy. Home.. what more can I say. oh yeah, best burgers in town! The Reuben also is top notch, always."}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch meeting. I ordered the hamburger well done and it tasted delicious. I had the jerk fries and they tasted great! A recommendation for sure. It was a little busy and crowded but we got our food quickly. Parking was available but you have to pay. We parked about a block away where it was free. I really want to stop here for a beer next time Im in town."}
{"text":"Awful. This place has been hyped up so much, and I cannot understand why. Every experience I've had here has been disappointing. The employees are rude, including the current manager. The worst time that comes to mind was when my boyfriend and I sat there for nearly 20 minutes at the bar just waiting for our check. Since no one bothered to acknowledge our existence, my boyfriend suggested leaving. I still put money down, but even then no one said anything. Drunken girls climbing over the bar... Stupid loud guys everywhere. Always super packed to the point you can hardly move. Food selection is limited and pretty much sucks. Would love to understand what's so great about this place."}
{"text":"First time to Ray's Place and I won't go back...not because the burger's weren't good but the service was lacking.  The waiter took 8 minutes just to make contact and another 12 minutes to get our drink order-not bring it, take it.  I asked if the breaded mushrooms were breaded on site and was told yes (no, they're not).  He never came back to refill our drinks and never asked how the food was...didn't even ask about the uneaten mushrooms that were cooked so hard I couldn't break through the breading...but when I asked another person there about it, he said \"Sorry, we hire the handicapped\".  No, they didn't offer to take the nasty things off my bill and how dare they imply that only handicapped people make mistakes. Being thoroughly disgusted we paid the bill and left and I assured him I would try my best to stop anyone from going there.  Obviously they don't care about customers not satisfied."}
{"text":"Ray's Place is one of my favorite places to get food and beer.  The menu has a wide variety of food, and they always have a huge list of drinks.  The bar tenders can be a little unfriendly at times."}
{"text":"Great vibes. Great service. Nice location in downtown Kent. The place was packed which is nice. It's always fun to feel like you chose a happening spot, and this did the trick. It had one of my all time favorite beers on tap, the Willoughby Peanut Butter Coffee Porter. While I love the PBCP, I might be outgrowing it as it was crazy sweet. Anyway, they had tons of other beers on tap. About 20-30 in fact. They also have a huge selection of canned/bottled beers that make for a huge selection. Good prices as well. As for the food, I just had a dozen smoked wings. They were good (but it's kind of hard to mess up wings). I'm curious to try more food off the menu. If end up living here, I'm sure to be a regular at Ray's place."}
{"text":"Rays is my go to place any time my family or friends come into town. With a great bar/restaurant atmosphere, friendly waiters, and delicious food there really is no place like Rays!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Rays? It is beloved by townies and students alike. Their food is great, their beer selection is great. LOVE that they have Strongbow on tap! They have an upstairs and a downstairs, large bars, a couple pool tables, and an open air area in the summer. If you aren't getting beer, the drinks are a bit pricey for the pour you get and it does get super crowded to the point sometimes you just can't go in. But those are the only downfalls. Overall, 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ray's  = Dying Breed  This place have everything you'd ever need in a college bar and it doesn't try to be anything it's not. Don't forget to come here on your birthday to spin the wheel for your free birthday shot :)"}
{"text":"As a current student at Kent State, I can honestly say that Rays has been a staple place for my friends and I to visit the past four years. Rays was actually the first place I ate at when visiting the university for the first time. When I come back as an alumni to recollect on the glory days, I will be sure to visit Rays.   Almost any time someone visits me from out of town, I take them to Rays. It's a local staple, and I've found that if someone from out of town has heard of Kent, they most likely have heard of Rays.   When I come to the restaurant during the day to eat, I usually get the veggie pita and fries. I'm a vegetarian, and this is one of my favorite places to get a veggie pita. When I come to Rays at night to go to the bar, it's is always busy! Every time I go to the bars in Kent, I end up at Rays at some point during the night. The Long Islands are what the bar is known for, and I usually like to go to the second floor if it's open since it's usually less crowded.   Rays will for sure be one place that I will miss when I graduate."}
{"text":"''We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.\" Must be the motto of Rays, sadly we wear planing to come on Friday night the night before homecoming. We wear with one person under the age of twenty one and we wear turned away from eating dinner. I asked the door person if she could just let are waiter know we wear just coming in for dinner. Sharply she said No, and I then proceeded to ask for a manager and she said that was what she was told no one under the age of twenty one allowed. I then said really you are going to turn down are business, she replied with a smile yes we are. Sad you can't hire waiters with the mental capacity to ask for ids."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Huge selection of beers on tap. Magnificent eats. Bartender recommend the Cuban, really good recommendation. Dill pickle fries are a must-try!"}
{"text":"Ray's Place is \"shining like a star\".[1]   Bob (my brother) & Linda (my sister-in-law) just reminded me that August 15th, 2008 was the 30th anniversary of their meeting at Ray's Place. So I guess you could say that I've been saving this review since that fateful day in 1978.   I was a 17 year old high school student visiting Ohio from California to see my brother. Since we're of the same Father, it was perfectly natural to find a bar, have some cocktails, and renew that brother - brother relationship. Bob suggested Ray's Place and off we went.[2]   Being so young, dumb, and full of ...what's that rhyme?...booze, I don't really recall much of Ray's Place, but it's obviously a place where magical relationships can be made, so I'd say check it out if you're looking for love (or cocktails).[3]    Footnotes: [1]  A term my brother used ad nauseam until we broke him of it. [2]  We didn't let trivial details such as my age interfere.   [3]  I magically met a gal, as well, but only for that night."}
{"text":"Rays is, and has always been, over-rated.  It's basically a large room with tables.  During peak times expect to stand up as seats are hard to come by.  The music is usually so loud so you cannot talk with others at your own table.  The remodel made it look better, but it's still the same over-hyped place."}
{"text":"This place is really great for a big group of people. They're always packed, the drinks are super cheap while also having a huge option of beers, plus this is the oldest bar in Kent. Overall I would give it 5 stars, but one waitress did put a bad taste in my mouth.  She came to the table to ask what we wanted and after my order in the worst tone and attitude \"are you gonna tab out, because you're not gonna do this over and over, so if you want more keep it open\" I would recommend starting with \"would you like to open a tab?\" And if I said no then kindly inform me of the options.  Also, weirdly smells like sewage in the back left corner of the bar. Once we moved we didn't smell it anymore."}
{"text":"Love Ray's Place. I have been going to this place for years now. Classiest bar in Kent with a large selection of beer. They tend to close the latest too which is good when it's 2:00 AM and you don't want to go home yet :P"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ray's for over 15 years & this place has really gone down hill. I still love their hand made french fries & Bailey's Irish creme pie( if you can actually find a clean table to eat at). But the food & staff's attitude has become less & less inviting. And the bathrooms are always dirty :( Can't say I visit as often or even brag about it's unique atmosphere (can't go wrong with restoring the buildings historical environment) but it doesn't feel like home anymore. Sorry...."}
{"text":"We have been there three times and the food has always been good. Very good French onion soup and very large salads.  Service was a little slow but they were very busy so we didn't get too worked up about it.  We would go back for sure."}
{"text":"We were in town for a couple days and tried this place based on yelp ratings and reviews. Fantastic!  Any time we are in town we will be back!"}
{"text":"I was here on a business trip and loved it. Friendly bartenders, with a great selection of craft beers and bar food. A hoppin' place in Kent on a Wednesday night. You have to try the cilantro lime garlic wings!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Rays for over 30 years and it has continually improved and upgraded its offerings. The staff has always been attentive and hustles to accommodate their customers. It can be extremely busy so avoid peak times or you may have to wait a bit for a table and food. The beer selection is great - diverse and always changing. If you're looking for health food such as a kale salad, this isn't the place. That being said, the food is delicious and filling - think mofo burger and meatloaf sandwich.  The specials tend to be lighter and the salads have gotten healthier so Rays isn't afraid to evolve."}
{"text":"Burger was the only decent thing on the menu, and it was cooked way past well done when I ordered med-rare, both times.   Lots of gross frozen fried foods on the menu.  Decent beer selection, but what bar doesn't have that now-a-days?  Douche-apocalypse at night.  Would only go back to drink or if friends wanted to go."}
{"text":"The shrimp appetizer is the reason I come the 100 beers on tap is the reason I found out about it and the atmosphere is why I have a hard time leaving"}
{"text":"We now live in Columbus and took a trip to see Kent State's wonderful matinee production of Side Show.  Of course we had to stop by Rays Place as we have not been there for a couple of years- IT IS STILL GREAT.  I had my burger which is better than any I have tasted in Columbus and my wife had the Mustard Seed sandwich which I believe is new and is excellent.  Ray's Place- we miss you- the food, the atmosphere and the friendly service.  Kent State students and locals- you are lucky to have this institution; certainly Ohio State in my opinion does not have anything close to Ray's."}
{"text":"My parents hung out there in the 60's when they were students at KSU.  They always called it Rocky's.  I live in Toledo, but I have a daughter at KSU and we occasionally have lunch there on return trips for her.  We very much enjoy the food.  I love the fish sandwich and the kids like the burgers.  Good service and friendly staff.   This is almost always on a Sunday afternoon when we are there."}
{"text":"Ray's Place is one of those legendary-to-locals restaurant/bars that many college towns have - lots of sports and local memorabilia on the walls, scuffed floorboards, sassy wait staff and big plates of food washed down with beer. Ray's does it better than most.   We walked in on a Saturday evening (the night of the NBA finals!) and made our way around the big bar/dining room to a table. While it was self-seating for us, I doubt it's like that when it's super-busy. Lots of families chowing down on wings and other bar food. Our server was nice, attentive and a whirlwind as the crowd got bigger.  The menu is large and varied, with plenty of seafood on the menu, and lots of Greek/Mediterranean influences in the dishes (read Feta and goat cheese, olives, etc.). They must be known for their Fo-Mo burger, which is a double cheeseburger with bacon, mushrooms and all the fixins. Looked good, but we ended up with a Pittsburgh throwback \"Steak-n-Fry\" salad for the spouse and a French onion soup (decent) and a half-smoked chicken for me. The chicken specifically tasted like it had been in the smoker all day - nicely done.  Honestly? Traditional non-fancy bar food should be this good always. Stop up at Ray's to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. It was a bit loud but that was to be expected. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Ray's about a half-dozen times  before as I live three hours away from my best friend in Kent. I usually stick to the burgers - I love them - but this time I decided I felt like the hot pastrami on grilled rye sandwich and some fries. The fries were great, as was my friend's Cuban sandwich, but unfortunately the pastrami on my sandwich was so caked in straight black pepper that it was inedible - black pepper was all I could taste, even on the meat that was away from the peppered edges. Couldn't taste the rye bread, the swiss cheese or the whole-grain mustard. I called the waitress over so I could just send the sandwich back and have it removed from my bill, and I'd just finish the fries.   Wasn't very impressed when she told me (very kindly - no fault to her) that the sandwich couldn't be removed from the bill and my only options were to have a corned beef sandwich or a sandwich (didn't get the name) that apparently comes with pastrami and cole slaw; the cole slaw would apparently 'calm the pepper down'? Then there was a remark in the direction of telling me all about how pastrami was made - I make it myself at home (and yes I do use pepper) so that was a little condescending and not really necessary. I understand the stuff gets a pepper rub on the outside, and I put plenty on mine but yours is too much. I saw slices of meat with nearly a quarter-inch of pepper on the rim.   So to wind it up, I would have been pleased if this had happened differently. There shouldn't be any quibble about taking a sandwich off a check if your customer finds it inedible after three bites! It's *very* bad business to make a customer pay for inedible food, and also bad business to not have a manager to the table to discuss what went wrong. There was some kind of a discount applied to the check by the server which was nice but it wasn't the whole amount of the sandwich.   And on another note, my friend and I both were looking for beers and the beer list is so heavy with IPAs there were hardly any other types to choose from. Maybe shake it up a little bit and remember there's a large (very large) segment of the population that find IPAs bitter and weirdly grapefruity.   So, two stars for the inedible food with no manager apology, too IPA-heavy beer list, and the policy of not immediately taking inedible food off a customer's check. All my other visits would have been a 4 or 5 star and I'm hoping next time I come back I can give one of those."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with their burgers and wings, some of the best in the county.  But this time I tried the corned beef sandwich on their special pumpernickel roll, if your into a lot of bread this is for you, if not, I recommend something else, the bread to meat ratio is way off."}
{"text":"My brother in law lives close by and went to Kent so he had to take me to Ray's Place.  The bar was packed and we were a two family group of 10 so we went to the upstairs and it was basically ours. The service was fast and friendly. She was pretty knowledgeable about the menu and recommended the Michael Simon favorite burger. The burger was very good and worth getting if you are finding trouble picking off the menu. The level of homemade aspect of the patties seemed to be in question, but I will give them the benefit of doubt.   We also grabbed the sweet potato fries and a basket or two of the jerk fries. The macaroni and cheese bites were not to my liking but they were a hit with the kids.  They had multiple beer specials and a very good selection to choose."}
{"text":"First saw Ray's Place on TV, so had to try it, and it gave me a reason to drive to Kent.  Comfortable old college bar, clean and nice, including the bathrooms.  Singles, a group of older folks, a family.....all having dinner at Ray's!  The burger with the soft round bun was delicious.....have it your way.  The crunchy battered onion rings were....can't eat just two, eat more!  I got dinner and tip under $10. Has a big picture window with a nice outdoor view.  Good choice."}
{"text":"Have recently discovered kent, and saw on yelp that I must try rays. It did not disappoint. Went on a date night with another couple. Sat upstairs....had a great server who hooked us up with some great beer suggestions (their list is insane), and some perfect meal suggestions. My peeps all had burgers which they said were great and I had the Cuban. Loved it. Great service, good bar atmosphere (a little dive-y, not pretentious), and good bar food. I think this is one of those places that you shouldn't get crazy with what you order. Stick with tavern fare, and you win."}
{"text":"Great food, nice selection of beers and excellent service. It's by far one of my favorite bars in Ohio!"}
