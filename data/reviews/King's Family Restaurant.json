{"text":"Ian from Big Brother said he went in there one night with some buddies to order some coffee. They were asked to leave if they weren't going to order food. Ian asked to speak to the manager. The manager tells him the same thing even when Ian said he'd gladly leave a big tip on the order. The manager said that wasn't acceptable. When Ian tries to order an appetizer the manager informs him that it won't do and they'd have to order entrees. They left.  True story."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical reading the reviews, but after coming here for breakfast I was very impressed. Our food was very good and came out quickly. The server we had was not the warm and fuzzy type but she was efficient and we hardly waited for anything. I wouldn't come in expecting some 5 star restaurant, but if you're hungry and you want some decent food at a low price this would be your place!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what's with all of these bad reviews. The food is great and hearty. The service is fantastic and friendly! They are nice to you and the food is big portions but wonderful and warm authentic food! Enjoy, and this is a wonderful place!!! Not noisy or loud at all either."}
{"text":"I own a BBQ restaurant in NC and know how hard it is to get good friendly staff.  The waitress (Kathy) was personable and great at what she does. The manager also made a trip to our table to give us a sample of their Potato Pancake. The whole staff went over and beyond to make sure we were happy.  I'd love to hire the whole crowd... lol. The food was good as well. It was a very pleasant visit. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night and breakfast this morning.  We had great service and good food.  The desserts were awesome!  They just need better coffee."}
{"text":"Sorry to say that upon entering the restaurant, the smell was not good.  Smelled musty or old.  Did not look clean. Food was so so. The waitress was very friendly and upbeat, probably the best part of the visit.  The girl at the econo lodge where we stayed warned us about the place, but we were too tired to go anywhere else.  Our mistake...you can drive down the road to Pomodoro's...save yourself some misery."}
{"text":"If you haven't already had King's Frownie Brownies yet, then what the heck is the matter with you, you big dungus?! King's and Eat n' Park are the two places in Pittsburgh where you can go to get any kind of breakfast food you want, and even burgers and fries and chicken tenders, but the star of the show is the Frownie Brownie, which is a brownie that somebody draws a frowning face on. You can get one of them, or 12 of them, or a sundae with them, or a bunch of other stuff, so what the heck are you waiting for go get yourself a brownie."}
{"text":"Ate here recently with some relatives in the area. I don't why others had such a bad experience. Our food was fine. It is not gourmet dining, but if you stick with the reliable menu items that one associates with family restaurants and diners you won't go wrong. I would definitely come back. The cherry pie was great, homemade taste, not too tart or sweet."}
{"text":"We were greeted promptly, but that's about the only positive here. It has been years since we have been to a King's, and we won't be back!  After being greeted we were told we would have to wait for him to clean a table off. This is funny to me since I think there were a total of 5 customers, but I worked in resturants so I get it. Several minutes later we were seated. Before our server arrived the two tables beside us were already complaining so we quickly decided to just get dessert and then eat elsewhere later. Boy am I glad we did! Our poor server came back with one water and said \"how many teas did you want?\" I thought I heard her wrong because we ordered two waters and a coke. Poor thing apologized and went and got the right drinks. We then ordered two Banana Delights (they came out in the wrong dish and only a few slices of bananas) and corn dog nuggets (which came out burnt). We were so ready to get out, but that little bit cost us $20."}
{"text":"This was one of the very first places I went when I moved here. And this is normally the kind of place I would hate, but there's something I find really hilarious about the whole thing. Like, it's so corny, and I'm really (deeply) amused by the frownies.  I got the Kings Country Breakfast and it was okay, and I really like the broccoli and cheese soup. I've had pretty good luck with my menu selections there. I know my roommate was less than thrilled with some of the things she's gotten.  I think of it as kind of like a Denny's and you just go because it's there."}
{"text":"What can I say about King's?  It's mediocre.  Oh, you want more? OK, I can do that.  King's is another one of those 'Burgh fixtures, although unlike Primanti Bros. and other restaurants that the city claims as its own, King's doesn't receive as much love or praise. It's utilitarian at best. There's nothing special about it, so if you go in with no expectations, you'll probably enjoy it to some extent.  The Steubenville Pike location is the one and only store I've been to, so your results may vary at other locations. Whenever I go in here, I feel like I'm walking into a poor Xerox of a Denny's. Yes, I would rate Denny's over King's. Not that that's any big deal, but when I go to King's I feel like the waitresses there are just barely clinging on to whatever desire they may have to serve. I see other reviews here have stated that the service was slow or lacking. I haven't had that problem. I can say that the waitresses need a little more pep in their step. But then again, maybe working at this place over the years has just beaten them into a depressed mental submission.  Wow, that was jolly, wasn't it?  The burger here. Which one is it, the one that tries to be like Eat 'n Park's Superburger? I've had a few of those here. They're not as good as a Superburger. There's something sad about the sandwich. Maybe the sadness of the waitresses spills over onto the cooks and then the burgers become sad, too. I don't know. I can say that the sides of cole slaw I have had here are a little happier. But it's cole slaw, so does that even count?  The chicken tortilla soup is interesting in that I never thought you could get canned chicken and tortilla strips to become semi-interesting in broth. You could definitely do better elsewhere. I get the feeling a lot of the stuff here is canned. Mmmm, canned.  I can say that the spaghetti is better than the spaghetti I've had late nights over at Eat 'n Park. Over there it tasted like it was cooked too long and the sauce was a bit of a drag. At King's it at least did its best impression of spaghetti with Ragu sauce dumped on top of it. Pretty big portion, too, considering that I got it as a side to one of my entrees. Not that I found myself wanting to eat all of it. It was too sad.  I've never had the Frownie brownies. I bet they're good. Seriously, I do. How could anything like that be bad? It couldn't be.  Man, I guess King's is just a depressing place. There are always a lot of old dudes sitting around in the front of the place, with the families dining in the back. When I was leaving one night, I heard the cashier tell one guy he couldn't sit there and go to sleep. Yeah, it's that kind of place.  Hooray for sad restaurants, I suppose. Guess I should go get a Smiley cookie at Eat 'n Park now."}
{"text":"I went here once for breakfast with 7 people and will not be back. Everyone's portions were small and the quality was mediocre.  Expect to pay $10 for enough low quality food."}
{"text":"Kings Family Restaurants' have been around since I could remember. I stopped at the Wexford location last night for a business meeting, and I wasn't too impressed. I ordered the Veggie Crepes and they were overdone and slightly cold. The main reason we met here was because they offered free WiFi, which was a bonus.   If you need a spot for a quick meeting with free WiFi, it works. Next time I'll pass on the food and maybe just get a coffee."}
{"text":"Cross between Denny's & Friendly's with local pride (only Western PA & since 1967).  Decent food.  Certainly a solid decision if you can normally tolerate the corporate food spots mentioned above. Endearing goofiness too; they have a dessert called a \"frownie\" - 'we make a mean dessert!'  the waiter tells us, with a complete lack of irony, when we ask why they call them that.  Good job Mr. Hartley King.  PS They offer a to go cup of coffee to take with you - I love this. Only other restaurant I know of who does this are the Egg Harbor restaurants back in Illinois."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant could be spruced up to look better. The waitress was nice and brought out our food promptly. We got drink refills. We ordered breakfast food such as eggs, toast, bacon, and pancakes--nothing fancy--and it tasted fine. The men's bathroom was apparently so filthy that my husband who had held his poop for hours when he was driving on the road (sorry for TMI!) refused to use the bathroom."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place to eat  I ate here one morning during my trip to Pittsburgh about a month ago and it wasn't a bad experience at all. My girlfriend had a convention she was attending, so I decided instead of spending the morning in our crummy hotel room (http://www.yelp.com/biz/motel-6-mc-kees-rocks#hrid:CkV5eQ-P5Fk-PQuQCpr-ng), I might as well go down the hill and get something to eat. I went in, took a seat (its self seating), ordered, ate, paid, and left. It took all of about 20 minutes! Pretty quick service. The food wasn't bad either...I had the Wake Up breakfast with the pecan french toast, eggs, beacon, and oj. It cost me $12.50...not bad. If your visiting the Pittsburgh area and are just looking for somewhere to eat breakfast that isn't too fancy, then King's would be a pretty good place to try."}
{"text":"God help me I'm reviewing King's family restaurants. This 100 review challenge is going to be easy, and I don't expect to do tons of eat n park and McDonald's reviews to get the 100 reviews in, by the way, this in number 10 so far.  Now, King's, is a direct rip off of Eat N Park, another Pittsburgh headquartered family restaurant. Rip off you ask? Yes, Eat N Park has the smiley cookie, a few years later King's adopted Frowny the Brownie. I'm sure that will end up in court one day. Anyway, I was very surprised King's had a pretty decent veggie burger, served on a Kaiser roll with lettuce, onion and tomato, and a pretty good honey mustard.   Not too bad when nothing else is open, or it's 4 am. We used to come here for their signature dessert, apple pie a la mode with King's famous cinnamon ice cream. This is you basic Senior Citizens play ground with 5.99 lunch specials and 7.99 dinner specials every day. The only thing missing is the early bird specials."}
{"text":"Oh, the memories. Was taken here as a child. Still loathe despite years."}
{"text":"A typical King's. If you're from the \"Burgh\", then you've eaten at King's. I will base this review on my last visit. Wednesday night, 11PM, 3 other tables had patrons, so it was pretty slow. I was greeted as soon as I sat down and gave my drink/appetizer order right away. It's a new menu since the last time I was in. I was disappointed that an order of Cheese Wedges is only 3 pieces, but they only cost $3.49. My entree was Chicken Fried Steak, Mashed Potatoes(Sausage Gravy over all), Applesauce and Rolls. Everything was really good. I was stuffed but wanted just another bite. Washed down with a big ole glass of milk. Total bill was $13 and change, not bad considering how much I got. The one waitress kept walking around picking her teeth and hustling food without washing her hands(-1). The booth right in front of me needed bussed the whole time, flies, flying around, while 3 waitresses and the manager wandered about(-1)"}
{"text":"We came with some friends for breakfast. I got a ice tea that tasted like soap and it even had soap bubbles on top. I sent it back and the waitress never even brought another one. Which was probably for the better. I just drank my water. My wife's silverware had stuck on food on it. Two other people in our party were served cold food. They asked our waitress to microwave it for them, and she did. You have to walk up to the cash register to pay your bill here. The problem was there was at least 10 people in line waiting to pay there bill. The line was all the way to the door. New customers could barely get in the door. It took 15 minutes waiting in line to pay our bill. With all that being said the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Composite review:  A three visit review -- main takeaway is that with most King's Family Restaurant's, the quality is variable because of the staff.  Sometimes it has been great; one time not so great.  Entry and seating has been fine; checkout seemed a little congested.  Hopefully, someday all this will be managed directly at the table -- Hertz can do this with thousands of autos per day in a parking lot.  Time for the food industry to stop bottlenecked everything at a single cash register.    f8 and be there."}
{"text":"Service is so SLOW.  It was not crowded, the cooks are just in slow motion. Why do  I come back? The food is good, but it takes so long."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stayed in Pittsburgh for a few days this past summer, and King's was around the long, sloped block from our hotel. In fact, it was literally the only thing within a mile of us for sustenance (we didn't have a car, so our options were even more limited). The girl working the counter was very entertaining, if nothing else. The food was very good, but they forgot something we ordered, so I guess that deducts a star. I suppose if we lived in Pittsburgh and ate there more frequently, I'd be less crazy about it. But, overall, I enjoyed my brief experience there."}
{"text":"We walked in and the first thing we saw was the sad, sad dessert case filled with burnt pies looking like they were there for a long time. We were greeted and seated quickly (I would seat people immediately too if my dessert case looked like that). Our waitress was friendly and fast. our sundaes were okay and served their purpose but they weren't extraordinary as they once were. I feel as though King's has gone downhill. Where did Frownie go? It is sad that he's gone! Frownie is just as much a part of Pittsburgh as a certain other dessert from a rival restaurant. I feel the peanut butter cups that were used in our sundaes, although advertised as real were some generic version or old, really old. It was just ho-hum. I would have gone one star but our waitress was terrific! King's, what happened to you? Sad, so sad! :("}
{"text":"Bottomless coffee, the intention is good, but the bad thing is the staff will check on you less often... At King's, we were served food but they forgot to give us utensils... We have to wait another 10 minutes after our breakfast was served to actually start eating..."}
{"text":"If a person comes here expecting Emril's or a white cloth experience the main course will be disappointment. We are getting what we hoped for, good food reasonable price & nice service"}
