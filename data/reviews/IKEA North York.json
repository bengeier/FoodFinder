{"text":"I am reviewing both the food and retail store.
Recently went to this branch of one of my favourite stores to get things for my eldest, who has just moved into his first apartment. We were hungry on arrival so went to get some lunch. I haven't been to this IKEA before, and haven't eaten at one for a few years, so hope this wasn't representative. Most of the meals were fish based, and we are all allergic. I had a sandwich and my son had the meatballs. He was unable to finish as the gravy was cold. My sandwich greens were turning brown. Nasty!
No quarrel with the selection of furniture. Everything we wanted was in stock. The real shock came at the check out line. I counted 13 items on our cart and so went to the self-serve line. There was one woman supervising four self-check out lanes but for some reason she focused on us. She was literally at my shoulder the whole time. Apparently she didn't like the way I scanned things ?????? and kept correcting me. WTF? I picked up a blue shopping bag and she grabbed it and said, \"you'll have to pay for that\"\" When it was time to pay, she gave me a lecture about having too many items for the self serve line. 
Wow. 
I will never go back to this store."}
{"text":"Breakfast (eggs, sausages and homemade fries) for 1$ is a great deal. Add two pacakes for 1$. I am afraid that for a big guy it could be too small portion, but even with tripple portion it's still pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Approached an associate for direction to a product while she was doing nothing but chatting to her co-worker, and her response was snotty and made me feel like I was interrupting her. I later found her sorting towels at a bin of towels that was not meant to be organized, looks like she was just there wasting time away and to look busy."}
{"text":"long story short, IKEA wasted my time and money over nothing. 
I'm responsible for every word i wrote here.  


had the worst costumer service ever,, got a sofa-bed that appears to be factory error. and took me 8 weeks till now to deal with customer service .. finally i decided to return it back this weekend once and forever. (Quality not as good as before)

second issue:  the delivery company north york IKEA deals with is a disaster, they give a 4 window-hours let you wait all that time (usually will come the last hour) but they only wait 15 mins max for customer to prepare elevator or else they will leave.( ppl who lives in buildings can not book the elevator for 4 hours ) so i paid 76$ for them to leave?!

Assembly company though was good.
( it is actually the first time my father recommended me a company and i regret dealing with them later ) no good quality no respect to customer's time."}
{"text":"I ordered 5 pieces from Ikea, a mattress, a bed frame, wooden boards for the frame, a desk and a chair. The order was placed on August 29th and they said they could deliver it on the same day or anytime really so we put it down as the 5th.

Come the 5th, the delivery people come with my stuff and I was excited to move in to my new place. But noticeably missing were my mattress and chair and the delivery people said it wasn't their fault but the warehouse people didn't give it to them.

Now 2 weeks later, I've called them more than 15 times now, and I'm always on hold for anywhere from 30-80 mins before I actually spoke to a human. The first few times I was told they were \"tracking\" my items. This takes about 5 days and then I find out the item is out of stock. Finally 4 days later it is in stock so I call them non stop, each time being met with the same condescending respond \"i'll put a request in for you but I can't actually set up a delivery time because this is just a call center\". Now 4 days after calling them 2+ times a day to try to set up a delivery time I wonder if they'll actually ever deliver my items. They told me I could get my items refunded if I go to their store which is an hour away from where I live but I will not be refunded my the delivery fee which was $100 ($40 service+$60 delivery). 

It just seems ridiculous to me because the only reason I got delivery was because I can't exactly lug a mattress home by myself. They are not willing to compensate for their errors at all either. The only thing I get after being on hold for over an hour and talking to someone for 10 minutes is either they (the person on the phone) can do nothing about it but won't transfer me to someone who can do something, or they'll \"put in a request for me\". Which I believe actually does nothing because I have had so many requests put in already. Now a day shy of 2 weeks after the day my stuff was supposed to be delivered they tell me that neither of the 2 items I wanted are in stock anymore and I have no idea when they plan to deliver the items if ever. Never get delivery from Ikea! Even if they mess up they will not bother to fix it and they obviously don't care about their customers at all since they already have such a huge customer base."}
{"text":"Some food are not okay... If you are really really hungry, here's a cheap place to get food in Canada.

But, never ever buy any furniture from here... We just had such a terrible nightmarish experience with our brand new house, just because we ordered furniture from North York IKEA... Crappiest furniture sold, delivered and installed in the dumbest way ever possible :-( 

IKEA is totally responsible for ruining our much awaited 'house warming event'. 

Stay away from IKEA! Hi friends and people, pay a little more and probably all other places will treat you like 'customer is king'."}
{"text":"Food is good. Only complain I have is that you have to ask the cashier each time you want sweetner for your coffee. I find that is absolutely ludecrous. What are they thinking."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with the food... but in a day and age of the internet and online shopping IKEA has gone the way of the dinosaur... no phone calls to the store directly to see if they have something physically there.   You must have the number handy and if  you are trying to call \"as is\"   forget it..  there is no number... bad service for a retailer..  Are they an online store or a bricks and mortar store.   Love the food but hate the draconian approach to phone calls."}
{"text":"Most abusive, disrespectful treatment of seniors I have ever experienced. 

Threatening and arrogant words over the phone from the assembly services. 

AWFUL. ABUSIVE. THREATENING. ARROGANT."}
{"text":"The IKEA food court is really good. After eating 10 meatballs with fries (gravy on both), a garlic bread, a plate of smoked salmon salad, and a soft drink, go downstairs and get a $1 ice cream cone!

Recently IKEA added free Wi-Fi in the dining area so it's even better!

Washroom rating: UNAVAILABLE"}
{"text":"All IKEAs are essentially more or less the same - same products, same layout, similar showrooms. But, since I usually frequent the Etobicoke location, this location is tiny in comparison! It felt even smaller since it was a very busy day that you can't really go around without bumping into someone. The restaurant had a small seating area (compared to other IKEAs I been to), which made it difficult to find seating to enjoy lunch. 

One pro factor of this location is that it is conveniently located near Leslie station - easily accessible by public transit! (A major plus in my books!)"}
{"text":"It's a staple but the customer service is terrible at this location, which is sadly the only one in the area. The prices aren't that much cheaper than other stores."}
{"text":"$1 breakfast (before 11am) and $2.99 Fish & chips on Thursdays after 2pm. And who can forget their meatballs with gravy and lingonberry jam? When I can eat a full meal with only pocket change, I never complain. Nuff' said."}
{"text":"This is for the North York store: I am so beyond frustrated with this store and their delivery company! I had a large delivery on Sunday \"between 1 - 5\" which they were late for and gave no curtesy call to let me know. Then, two pieces were damaged so I had to request replacements. Which meant waiting around again yesterday between 9 - 1. Of course, they never showed and when I called IKEA they told me they didn't get my pieces into the delivery truck in time. No phone call to let me know that though, just let me wait around all day. So it was rescheduled for today...and again no one showed even though I called the delivery company in the morning to double check everything. Now I have to reschedule again for Saturday. What did they do to apologize to me for having to wait around for three days already?! NOTHING! I am disgusted by the treatment of your customers. Is our time not valuable? Do we not deserve a little respect? I really loved IKEA before this incident and now I feel like your customer service is terrible and your disregard for your customers is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ikea restaurants for many years, mostly to the one at North York.  It is usually very crowded, but you will still be able to find a table at most times as the place is fairly big. Their most famous dish is the Swedish Meatballs and mashed potatoes served with gravy and lingonberry jam. I think it is delicious and the portion size just right."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love IKEA. Spending an afternoon there will make me happy, and my wallet... well, not so happy. On that note, I've been to much better IKEAs than this one. IKEA North York to me feels a bit messy and the layout much more confusing than other locations I've been to (Calgary, Winnipeg, Etobicoke. Oddly enough IKEA Winnipeg being my favourite). 

I've purchased a bed, desk, bookcase, and TV stand to furnish my flat, and didn't (completely) break the bank. I got a bit carried away with throw pillows. 

The cafeteria is top notch. I've been back three times to this place since moving back to Toronto and the food is always delicious. Now that I think of it, I kind of want to be back there again... but what can I do. And with a huge line, I only waited about 15 minutes for food, so it's a very efficient service. 

And since I live downtown, A+ for being (relatively) close to the subway. There's a shuttle from Leslie Station that makes it a lot easier to get to."}
{"text":"We ordered ikea kitchen, delivery came with missing parts. We went to the store to get it but we have to go to warehouse instead. Then we ordered countertop a week went by no progress or visit so we cancelled it. We tried again try to get sofa cover and got told that we have to drive to pick it up at the warehouse. Multiple trips, miscommunication, everything u can ask for not to happen..."}
{"text":"WARNING...I visited the Ikea store to buy some items.  It was chaotic. The cashier checkout lines were very, very long,  The clerks on the floor were helpful, but STAY FAR, FAR AWAY from the self-scan checkout.  I was not very familiar with the scanner  screen and did not select the choices properly before picking up the handheld  scanner, so the scanner attendant came up from behind and tried to intimidate me by snapping a warning at me that I am being videotaped.   Clearly, she was assuming and implying that I was trying to evade scanning my products...when I haven't even finished my transaction.    STEER CLEAR of the self-scan checkout....STEER CLEAR of this attendant.  She was a heavyset woman with tan complexion, dark hair.     It seems this woman likes to verbally intimidate customers. It's very disturbing that she lingered near my scanner right from the beginning and during the whole transaction, looking over my shoulders.
It is not the first time I have encountered problems at this Ikea Store, but this is by far one of the worst incidences.  There is something SERIOUSLY WRONG with this employee..

If you must shop at Ikea, when you deal with any employees, be sure to switch on the audio recording of your smartphone as you will need it in the event of an incident.

I like Ikea products, I like Ikea food, I like the Ikea concept...but I do not feel comfortable shopping at or bringing my family to this store again. It was a toxic encounter! They are doing a fine job of chasing away customers."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty cheap and it's ok. Fries are pretty good and I would compare them to Costco. Fish and chips, the batter was pretty hard and the fish not too moist for flavourful. 
I would stick to the meatballs."}
{"text":"We bought their pax system which held out for 3 months and then on a weekend the shelves fell and destroyed my stuff-nothing heavy. After months of deliberation they decided to give me a $100 gift certificate to IKEA. The damage was about a $1000.00. To take them to court wasn't worth it but I would never buy anything from them again! There customer service is terrible."}
{"text":"Ikea is the mecca of all things cheap and cute. From a two year old, university student to your grandma, there is somethng for everyone. Well, maybe not your grandma unless she's really hip- they've got a lot of modern stuff. 

Anyways, I found and wanted to buy a lot of nice things. But so much of it was sold out! It's quite a trek out there and given the size of the place it should be a one stop shop. You shouldn't HAVE to go out to Vaughan to buy your bed, box spring and mattress. 

After spending hours going round and round in the deliberately twisty building, I needed a hot dog. How delightful it is that the line to the cashier is long enough for you to leave your things with a friend, go in another long line, get the hot dogs only to come back and find you haven't even been served yet.

As for the hot dog, I literally cannot complain- it was 99 cents.  However I will say I was sad that I couldn't have a cinnamon bun. There was just one, cold looking one left and they were not replacing the tray until someone picked up the lonely one .  

So all I can say is, shape up North York! The Vaughan location (where we went afterwards) is schooling you with more product, shorter lines and fresher food!"}
{"text":"Ikea earns two more stars for listening to their customers.  The self-serve area is now stocked with computers so that you can check to see not only where items are but if they're still available.  A brilliant improvement!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"PARKING NIGHTMARE! (Tip: Do not come here on a weekend)

As much as I love coming to IKEA for their Swedish meatballs, parking is such a pain that I'm often discouraged from making such a trip. But, seriously, I'm in love with their meatballs w/ cranberry sauce. 

Cheap food aside, I have to admit I buy IKEA furniture as well. It's easy to put together (for a girl) and delivery is offered if you don't own a car. You can also get good deals on kitchen ware, candles, duvets, rugs, blinds, curtains...etc. However, if you ever need to refund/exchange a product, be prepared to take a number and line up for an hour or two. A cabinet I purchased was missing a wooden panel, and I waited around an hour for someone to retrieve one for me. 

Now that my place is fully furnished, I come back only for their meatballs and $1 soft serve ice cream!"}
{"text":"It seems that everyone who gets things delivered here are unsatisfied, and there is a reason for that. ikea hires completely incompetent delivery drivers. The incident I had to deal with was very unprofessional.  DO NOT use their delivery service! 

Their drivers didn't want to bring my things up to my unit. They were complaining the whole time, arguing, and drove away. The ikea employee on the phone told them to come back and re deliver and they returned...but didn't want to deliver.

Luckily they offered me free re delivery but I decided to get a refund instead.

I have to wait until they ship the items back in the store before they even process the return, just like someone here complained about too. I didn't sign the paper, I didn't receive the items,  I am not responsible for what their drivers do...yet, I still have to wait to get my refund."}
{"text":"Come on??  These hot dogs and ice creams...they might be made from horse parts...but they hit the spot and dinner for eight will cost you about ten bucks!  Lol.   

My wife and love to go here on \"deep discount dates\" when we are nearby..."}
{"text":"You can never leave IKEA without buying one thing and that includes food! If you don't know what to get from the restaurant... Their meatball combo is a must try! Their prices are not expensive and the quality and quantity of the food you're getting is great! 
Before leaving I always get their frozen yogurt! It's so cheap... And their hot dogs are even cheaper. 
I've recently finished renovating or revamping my bedroom and I decked it out with IKEA furniture and decor! Love my PAX Auli wardrobe system and absolutely love my bed; almost everything I got was in white and the prices are reasonable. We also got 15% back in gift cards for buying bed frames.
Their staff are accommodating, especially in the return and exchange area. 
LOVE IKEA. I can literally spend hours in there! I call it the 'adult playhouse'"}
{"text":"IKEA meatballs. That is all. Sometimes my boyfriend and I make pointless trips to IKEA just for their food. I'm obsessed with their meatballs with the gravy and cranberry sauce they have, it's a great mix, and not to mention cheap enough to get you full! Luckily they sell bags of frozen meatballs that you can purchase near the exit, saves me the time to mission down there. 

Other than the meatballs however, there's barely anything to look at. You walk through the entire place, and come out with nothing. From afar, a lot of the furniture and showrooms are nice to look at... until you get up close & personal with the price tag. Why is everything so expensive? Or rather their items are just too overpriced. 

IKEA manages to be the first place I go to when I'm looking to renovate or redecorate my bedroom but ever do I come out with a full set of equipment. Whenever I pay a trip to IKEA, I usually get something small - like one of their fake plants from the marketplace or a lamp to replace a broken one. Other than that, I don't see myself buying out an entire showroom of furniture because quite frankly, their sofas, beds, and desks aren't very appealing."}
{"text":"I hate there delivery department with a passion. I went in picked out my order to have them deliver it and find out my ceilings too short, no biggy my fault went in to have them schedule an exchange after I had picked the proper size. Walked in on wednesday and asked them to deliver on saturday as I work monday - friday, they said it was fine and tried to deliver it on thursday, of course I'm not home so they tell me you have to come in again and speak with them to reschedule which is stupid but none the less I come in again on a saturday and tell them to deliver on sunday. I wait at home all day sunday and they call me to tell me sorry we can't delver it I tell them to F off and let me speak to supervisor, they hang up on me. I call back and demand to speak with a supervisor, after arguing with them for half an hour and having to get the supervisor to call me back on a monday I'm furious. How can you make me go through all that and give me no compensation what soever. Nothing done, went in a third time to cancel my order and demand a refunds for everything, I will not shop there again. I would give them zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Love it when I come here to go shopping for my home where they always have great deals and wide selection of home decor. I love how ikea has the idea of a showroom you walk through where they showcase all their furniture and setups of different rooms for the house. 

Get the free membership if you frequently shop at Ikea, enjoy a free coffee everytime you go there. They have weekly deals that are exclusive only to members. I love visiting the restaurant  for a plate of their infamous swedish meatballs even despite the recent scare of traces of horse meat it dont bother me LOL.

This location ia the one closest one to the downtown core usually alwas packed on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Can I give -5 stars? Loved the store experience. Delivery mega 0. Setup mega 0. 

IKEA shortchanges everyone: suppliers, vendors, etc. At the end of the day clients suffer. 

I'm on error #5. Delivery rebooked 4 times due to XPO screwups and assembly pushed out over 9 days now. Right into the Christmas holidays. 

Thanks IKEA. You suck."}
{"text":"Again,  I wanted to make a purchase of a desk.  I went to the store, they couldn't help me out.  They said I could call and get the $59 delivery for the item which was fine since I probably couldn't get the item home myself.  I called to order it and they said they didn't accept payment info over the phone and I'd have to order only with $100 shipping.  That doesn't seem right.  IKEA seems to like to make things difficult and inconvenient, only to give themselves more money.  Or less customers"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????6????????????????????????????????????????????orz ??????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but there's something calming about being in the Ikea showroom. So many different rooms, all put together perfectly. I want to take a room, bring it home and make it my own....which I actually might do. They have products for any size room!

The food court is pretty awesome, Low prices and the food is pretty good! It's always busy!

They had many registers open, but still the self check out line went quicker than them all. 

It's nice to visit even if you don't buy anything."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this IKEA since I was a kid, and I'm always impressed at how they've stayed relevant all these years. They have amazing everyday prices on big and small furniture - and their food is mind-bogglingly cheap. It's no wonder this place is packed on weekend mornings with people buying $1 breakfasts. And after you're done your breakfast, you can wander the store for hours just looking at their beautifully laid out rooms (and crying because your place looks nothing like it), and then go to the marketplace and pick up everything you could possibly need, and everything you probably don't need.

Did you know IKEA sells baby sleep sacs? Right?! Mind blown. Or, did you know that IKEA sells fabrics so you can sew whatever the heck you want for a really reasonable price, and their fabrics come in a variety of prints and textures? (want some waterproof table cloths? done. Want some lovely cotton with fun vegetables dancing on it? They have that too). 

the dangerous thing with IKEA is that their stuff can go on the cheap. Like, a cup for 50c, or a picture frame for $2, and the next thing you know you're paying for $200 worth of small little furnishings (cushions, where did that blanket come from? do I really need a flower-ice cube tray maker?). it's okay though, you can cry over it with $1 ice cream on your way out."}
{"text":"It's an Ikea. It's got everything you need if you aren't afraid of Allan keys. This one runs its own hybrid shuttle to the TTC station every 15 minutes (we walked). First stop was the meal hall for meatballs, dice cake and logon berry soda.

 Suitably nourished we wandered, dazed, through the marvelous only in HGTV inspired room set ups. In the interest of decluttering I bought a document organizer and a salt shaker to replace our broken one. Also on order was a wee Christmas gnome and a cat carrier from Ikea \"whatever pet is in Swedish line.\"

Just like Target in that you go in to get one thing and drop mucho $$$"}
{"text":"IKEA MONKEY! 
Lol jk didnt get to see the monkey but its the world famous ikea!

The 3* rating is on the cafeteria part only! 

The line was longer then normal on this visted, and started from the otherside which threw me off a little! The meat balls were also more dry this time but the gravy made up for the moisture! 
I did also notice its starting get a little pricier,  perhaps since im not a teen buying .50 cent hotdogs and havs graduated upstairs to the jail like cafetira that i notice the 6-9$ price point! 
As always lots of seating, view by the window isnt terrible if ur into condo watching. I also dont find the coffee all that bad. Also nice to know the option of beer or apple juice bottle wine is there in case!"}
{"text":"I think I'm still lost ... someone send help ... so confusing. I fancy myself fairly intelligent but even with the map, I couldn't figure out where the Hell I was, where I was going, or where I wanted to be.

Bonus points because their bulk candy section in the Swedish Market is A+.  But, the sticker printer to put your candy price on the bag was broken.  No one who worked there would help us, and if I was less of a woman, I would have just walked off with the candy without paying because it just got to be too annoying to try and pay for it.  The line-ups for the food were insanely long, too. (I know, 75 cent hot dogs are appealing)  I wish everything was easier to navigate.  However...it's still Ikea, so it gets a pass because reading the names for everything made me giggle."}
{"text":"Now, I don't own a home (or a condo), but this place honestly makes me so happy! Can't wait til I have my own place to decorate and get furniture! For now, I'll just have to go and touch/sit on everything! Lol. 

There's something awesome about seeing all sorts of looks of furniture displayed orderly on a showroom floor! You can test out what you like and make fun of stuff that looks funny (but secretly want!).

Can definitely make a day out of it, and have some lunch, which btw, is awesome! Have you ever had those Swedish Meatballs? They are immaculate! Can't get enough of those little balls! Hehe.

As for this Ikea in comparison, I do like the one in Vaughan a little better as it's newer, but this one has a larger self-serve section.

Just make sure you sign up for their Ikea Family, as you can collect points and even get a free coffee when in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"My first furniture as a child in Canada was from Ikea. Now that I'm all grown up and married, I find myself strolling its long continuous aisle discussing PAX closet storage systems with hubby after an inexpensive dinner at its canteen. Coming here is both fun and exhausting. How will I ever keep our place as clean and compact as the beautiful displays say I can? Truly a place for everyone - families, students, residents of condos and houses. There are furniture design ideas for whichever stage of life you're in. Not the best quality of stuff, but pretty, practical and very useful all at once.

The food at the canteen can be ridiculously cheap. Daily $1 breakfasts before 11am. The place is rammed with families on weekend mornings. Love the Swedish meatballs which is a great deal to buy frozen to bring back home at $7.49 a bag. Chicken leg with fries, white fish with cheese sauce, all good at portion sizes that leave me stuffed and hubby barely satisfied."}
{"text":"It's not a bad store for ikea, but a lot of things a very disorganized here. The areas are messy and sometimes its very hard to find help for the simplest things."}
{"text":"I've been going there off and on for 12 years and have usually enjoyed my experiences there. Only once I had to go back because something was missing in a box. Going with friends is always fun! Definitely check online or call ahead to make sure what you want is in stock so you don't waste your time. I got some bookcases but the inserts were sold out. Of course eating there is always fun and cheap!"}
{"text":"As a student living downtown, this place is a lifesaver. Why spend $90 at bed bath and beyond for bedsheets? Why buy crappy cutlery at the dollar store? And to top it off, they have a free shuttle service to the nearest subway station, so you don't need anything more than a token to bring your loot home. Yes there is some criticism, maybe,  but being where I am in life I really can't afford to be picky. Besides,  $1.50 for a hot dog + drink? Only in an insufferably capitalist society, but I don't care. I'll buy fair trade coffee when I actually make money."}
{"text":"I love Ikea. Sure the quality of the furniture isn't fantastic (I'm sure we all have a Billy bookcase, sagging with books and crap) but they are able to give people decent looking items for a decent price.

Today I had the fun task of returning a whole bunch of large picture frames. Being unable to trick anyone into coming with me, I was tasked with driving to the loading area and try to heave all the frames onto a cart alone. An Ikea associate was nice enough to help me and watch the cart while I parked.

I got to the returns area which was pretty comfortable and moved quite quickly. I was happy about that.

Went to the restaurant to get breakfast, but discovered that the scrambled eggs had milk in them. No breakfast for me.

Went through the Marketplace and got a bunch of junk for my house and did the self checkout, which was quick, easy, but didn't take cash like other self checkouts. 

Overall a decent experience, 1/4 of the associates I spoke to was super nice, and the other three were reasonably polite. 

I will go back again, but only because at this juncture, I can't afford anything else."}
{"text":"I usually come here for breakfast or lunch. They offer pork roast with gravy recently priced $9.99. Personally I don't like the sauce and the is not worth its price. Other than that, they have good food at a lower price!"}
{"text":"Whoever does not like Ikea is either too rich to shop here or was never a kid at heart. Ikea is a massive warehouse full of Stuff!!! It has super cheap food and super cheap things for your home. Bedframes, sofas, tables, chopsticks, knives, shelves, and the list goes on and on. The quality is not the best but it is also reflected in the price. Come here and play some hide and seek but just make sure you do not get caught... haha!"}
{"text":"Large parking spaces available through out the area. The baby play room is a nice addition where I can drop my kids off. The $1 breakfast is definately a steal. Employees can sometimes hard to find or get help since they are always so busy and not enough available. This is also the same as when checking out. But again that's almost the same as any other IKEA I been too"}
{"text":"Love coming to IKEA for lunch! Reasonably priced, tastes great and very spacious. Perfect for families as there is enough room for strollers. Lots of seating, no need to fight with anyone. Kids food include drink and a cone! How amazing is that?! Breakfast is $1!"}
{"text":"I always come to ikea for the meatballs and wine... and the broccoli medallion. Love the meatballs here!"}
{"text":"I don't get this place. Is it only this location? Why does everyone walk around the place like they own it. People bump into me and then GIVE ME a dirty look as if I shouldn't be there. I'm looking at dishes, and clearly in front of it, but people will just come and pick things up with no respect for boundaries. 
I'm standing in front of a shelf I want, writing down the details, and a family starts asking us questions as if we work there. 

We came on a Monday night, and it was fairly busy. I would rather come during the day to have a better experience and walk around the model homes without someone giving me a dirty look as if I opened their kitchen cabinet. 

As for the cafe. We had dinner here. Really busy around 6pm, and for some reason only one cash open and long line ups. 
I went to take a look at the front of the line to see what the fries looked like, and these women gave me a dirty look, as if I was cutting the line, and copying their homework and moved down in a way that I couldn't look over. 
While AT was in line (why didn't didn't open the 2nd service station I don't know), I went to the bathroom. When I came  back, there were more dirty looks when I joined the line again. 

Finally got our food, but waited again in line for the cash. By this time food was cold and the gravy on the meatballs was caked on. 

By the time we sat down, there's was lots of choice, but you're surrounded by old people and kids. And no matter what you're in view of the tray collecting station in the middle of room which was not cleared - imagine half finished meals and trays with flies flying around it. 

All in all, I have to say it wasn't the most appetizing experience. I just try to have blinders and eat as quick as possible. 

For $7.99, salad , 10 meatballs, potatoes, gravy and soft drink, is not a bad deal, but also doesn't seem as cheap as I expected.  Unfortunately for me, soft drink does not include the Lingonberry juice that they used to have, and all sugary, HFCS beverages which I do not drink - essentially I paid a premium for tap water.
Food itself was tasty, but reminded me of fast food - a treat. Felt very heavy and sleepy afterwards. 

Everything else here seemed to be standard Ikea. I think next time I'll go to another location."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Ikea location. The layout isn't as confusing as other's I have been in and I've always had a good experience here. The people are friendly when you need help however only if you can find them! The yellow shirts don't stand out all the time. Of course, you can never go to Ikea without scooping some of those meatballs. Delicious! But who doesn't know this already? 

Prices are good, quality isn't bad and I always leave with what I find. No complaints here for me!"}
{"text":"Located close to the TTC's Leslie subway station (IKEA offers a free shuttle bus from station to store and back every 15 minutes), this location of the popular Swedish home furnishing chain is always full of shoppers every day of the week. Offering affordable home furnishings and accents, although I dislike most of the chain's furnitures, their home accents (rugs, pillows, shams, glasses) are decent enough to pay a visit. A small restaurant and grocery store is located by the store exit, offering shoppers a small variety of food items (the frozen yogurt cones tend to be the most popular). The great thing about this location it is accessable via the TTC (must get off at Sheppard-Yonge station to transfer to Sheppard line) which saves me a lenthy trip to their Etobicoke location."}
{"text":"Went to Ikea for their $1 breakfast which included scrambled eggs, 2 sausages and hash brown. Added a bit more for some bacon, $1 for 2 pancakes and another $1 for chocolate milk.
It was a pretty good breakfast that was super cheap. The drawback is that it was extremely crowded being a Sunday, but we were still able to find a seat and although the line was pretty long, it moved quite quickly. Let's just say, you'll find me here a lot before 11 on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is the local Ikea store where all the fancy showrooms display my dream setup. But of course, that's the dream and it usually doesn't pan out to that. Anyhow, I came here to pick up some furniture and accessories as I have the time. Even on a Friday, I didn't expect Ikea to be this busy. Yes, I was quite off the mark. This place was packed. Though I figured cause it is the holiday season, so people are here to score some deals. 

This Ikea is quite tidy with their showrooms and all the different furniture setup. One thing I like a lot is they got a model condo unit setup for anyone that has a condo and wanted ideas. 

Onto my trip here. I came to pick up some new pillows and other bedroom accessories. Nothing too thrilling. I even had a self serve cashier to process my merchandise to avoid the unnecessary crowds. Their self check out systems are prompt and efficient. Aside from that, my experience with their staff is pretty good. They are helpful with my inquiries and needs. Plus point me to the specific shelve to where everything is."}
{"text":"This is the location I went to during university and the beginnings of young adulthood. It's a great location, recently made more popular by the Ikea Monkey.

The location is large, but there are always tons of people. It's unavoidable. In other cities I've never seen an Ikea so crowded.

On this particular trip my mom purchased a kitchen sink. We had to pay at the register, then wait for them to retrieve it from the back. This is different from the normal pick-it-up-yourself model that we're used to at Ikea, but since it was a sink that's how it is.
We waited in line to pay, then waited again for about half an hour while they retrieved the sink. My tip would be to get the sales associate who prints the sales slip on the showroom floor to call down your order so you don't have to wait quite so long to pick it up."}
{"text":"In love with the $1 breakfast! I've seen commercials and advertisements and always thought it was too good to be true. Finally decided to give it a try, impressed! Eggs and hash browns were delicious, Didn't have the sausages since I don't eat pork. Asked for the lady to give me extra eggs as a substitution and was happy to do it. 

Carton of milk to wash it down, $2.10 for a breakfast with tax. As good as it gets, big bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I oredered the chicken and it came in a biggg piece which i cannot finish on my own as a girl. But the price is pretty cheap for the quality of food so its worth it. Milk or juice only costs 1 buck on top."}
{"text":"It's one of the smaller Ikea in the GTA. Nonetheless, the staff were friendly and helpful. Parking and location access is not the best - you need to know where you're going in order to maximize your arrival and departure. If I have a choice, I would go the one in Etobicoke. The shopping experience feels less claustrophobic -  the market area is a lot bigger."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. I personally love their selection of foods especially their soups and cakes. The mashpotato you can tell is powder mixed with water but heck, it still tastes good with those meatballs and gravy."}
{"text":"I moved at the beginning of December and had a problem in that I had nothing to sleep on. I made my boyfriend steal his parent's SUV and we were off to Ikea. I'd actually never been to Ikea before. So much cool stuff. I think we spent an hour just looking at faucets and arguing over which ones we liked best. Anyway, we found the beds and the foutons and tried them all out. I eventually found something I liked and it was sold out so I chose another one. Then I was like hey... how do I pay for this and get it to the car? Then I found out you need to walk 12 miles to the self-serve warehouse thing and handle it all yourself. Definitely losing a star for that. I don't like handling heavy stuff myself. Thank God I brought the man. All in all it was a smooth experience. We also decided to eat because we're both crazy cheap and heard that Ikea food was made for us. The food is soooo cheap. I approve. I had some mac and cheese for like $3 and a mushroom and cheese crepe for like $1.50 and all you can drink drinks for like $1. The other half had some salmon with hollandaise. It's not gourmet food but I'm living for that mac and cheese. It was overcooked but delicious and sooooooo cheap. Screw Wholefoods and their $15 mac and cheese. I've found a new calling. I'll go back."}
{"text":"The cafeteria-style restaurant inside the IKEA is fuel that is needed to journey through the gigantic maze of IKEA showrooms, displays, and palettes of products that are screaming for you to buy them.

You can never go wrong with the Swedish meatballs meal with fries, mash, and a dollop of the lingonberry sauce. I think that is the tastiest thing that they offer there. I convinced myself to try the butter chicken curry and it tasted like it was from a packet. Obviously nothing like the real stuff that you can find elsewhere. My expectations were not set high but curiosity got the best of me.

They also offer cold entrees like smoked salmon, sandwiches, and the like too.

For the price, you get what you get and you don't get upset! It's satisfying and will arm you with all the energy you need before, during, and after the shopping, purchasing, and eventually assembling of your stuff."}
{"text":"I like this Ikea, it's not super overwhelming like some locations.
I enjoy dining here cuz it's quick and easy, I have yet to try the exit-downstairs restaurant. I like the cafeteria style eating. Love coming here for furniture shopping/everything you need shopping. Can get chaotic during sales on the distribution floor, so make sure you organize your cart for quick check out. Also get help and don't try and lift heavy boxes by yourself- your back and bones will appreciate it."}
{"text":"Once again, just reviewing the food. Had an egg salad sandwich - $2.99? For the price, it was a very reasonable egg salad sandwich. Fairly fresh. Lots of egg. Some kind of wheat bread. Also had their daily soup (vegetable of some sorts) - $1.99. Once again, very reasonable for the price. Lots of different kinds of veggies, and also those tiny little pasta things you find in Italian wedding soup. Yum. Oh. The soup comes with a dinner roll (whole wheat, I think). A fairly reasonably priced lunch.

Oh. One other thing. Apparently, everyone had the same thought as us. It's finally warming up outside, so it's time for Ikea's frozen yogurt. There was quite a lineup when we started waiting in line. We were almost at the front of the line when their frozen yogurt machine broke down. No frozen yogurt for us. So sad."}
{"text":"I like IKEA, but instead of going to the Etobicoke location we decided to come here, and I was not impressed. It just seemed more chaotic, less organized, and less maintained. We wanted to buy a clock with adjustable pieces but most of the boxes were ripped into and people seemed to be having a free for all taking and swapping pieces out. 

The parking lot is also a mad house. I'll stick to heading west from downtown instead of going north to this one."}
{"text":"I come here strictly for the soft serve and the swedish meatballs. 
Haha, just kidding but not really.. those are really good! It's always fun seeing grown adults all in a singular line in a cafeteria.. throwback much? 

Now, I don't really buy the basic furnishing necessities here (eg. bed, desks etc) just because my dad owns a furniture company so I already get those for fraaaay $_$ But I love coming in here and seeing how there are different setups for different rooms. Since I'm looking into getting a condo in the next couple of years, I'm super interested and I've already started planning what kind of furniture I want. I get to see the different kitchens, beds, bathrooms and how they are all unique. It's definitely inspirational walking through here and getting inspired by setups I would've never thought of myself. Most of the furniture is cheap and good quality, while some definitely look overpriced for what it is. I'm such a big fan of the little knick knacks you get put around your house to give it a special effect. I'm a sucker for anything that wastes my money, really.

Ikea worker service is inconsistent.. sometimes I don't see anyone and the ones I do see appear to be so lost, I question if they were just customers at one point that got so lost, that they automatically got recruited to stay where they are and work here. Other times, they're really smiley and helpful. I had to ask a question today and after recruiting one worker over, a bunch came over to help me as well. If only that was the service every time. The parking lot is a hot mess, especially on busier times. I always like to come here in the middle of the weekdays, just to avoid shenanigans. Also.. entrance and exit too far away from each other.. it's like.. if you want to park close to the entrance, then leaving will require a far walk, especially if you bought furniture. If you park close to the exit, walking to the entrance is a struggle, especially in the cold winter days. 

Anyway.. I'm really down to come here anytime, seriously. This is definitely a store that I'd come to for fun, or for food, rather than to actually buy furniture."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love shopping IKEA? It's definitely one of the busiest locations in the GTA. It's quite the massive store. Love coming here to enjoy their signature Swedish meatballs. Loved the showroom here where you can see everything in sight and have a firsthand look of everything before making a purchase. If you want to purchase a furniture item, it tells you on the tag where to pick it up in the self-serve area before paying at the checkout. I think their system overall is very ingenious where you can view Overall, great place to do your shopping for all your home needs. Reasonable prices, easy to build furniture and quite the extensive list of items of you where you can essentially find anything you need!"}
{"text":"So I needed some kitchen items and baking pans and I deceived to go to IKEA, the things I need are not items I need to build or put together so I figured why not?!

I was surprised at the selection of items, I did have to walk the whole dam store because they don't make it easy to find Kitchenware items or maybe it's me whatever.  

I even tried out all their beds and sheet they were quite comfy.

#30daysofYelp"}
{"text":"The prices aren't too bad, but always a long line up at their restaurant.  Only two servers were keeping the place going.  Kind of sucks."}
{"text":"It is OK for many things...but its over-crowded. They sure have good value, but generally speaking, a quality that matches their prices.

Their coffee is good and cheap, and they have a few food items that are outstanding. A great fish roe in a tube and some awesome cookies.

On the furniture side, they offer value and convenience, but possibly the least green approach to buying furniture. All their stuff just won't last. It is made with compressed 'cardboard', or composites that will not produce a 'life' for their furniture. They do have a few 'better' items in real woods, but they are few.

Overall a good store."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at the IKEA food court. We went there pretty early (just before noon), so we didn't have to line up for too long. I liked the system there. You pick whatever you want as you move along the line. They have a variety of food items to choose from: desserts, soups, salad, cold meals, and hot station. I got roasted chicken with salad on the side and shared a cinnamon bun with my bf. Of course I had heard of their famous Swedish meatballs, so I had to try one from my bf's plate. A HUGE mistake!! It just tasted like dry..protein...? I don't know how to describe its taste and texture, but it just didn't work for me at all. My chicken taste very very commercial too. The cinnamon bun was dry. 

Overall, I will not eat here even if I need to buy stuff from here."}
{"text":"What else can you expect? As a furniture store, it gives you enough space, nice decors, nice design sample rooms, sample kitchens, living rooms, bathrooms, sections to accommodate kids etc. Not to mention, IKEA Food, its so cheap. My girlfriend and I ordered butter chicken and chicken meatballs and it was buy 1 get 1 free, cost us $11 including tax. Gotta love this place. Keep up the good work Ikea. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap food this is the place to be! 

A great perk is you don't need to be less than 12 years old to eat off the kids menu! For a great value of $3 you can get a drink, apple slices, and either fish and chips, meatballs and mashed potatoes, or macaroni. I had two kids meals for lunch to have a variety of food and ended with food to spare and was more than stuffed. 

Although, beware of the extras that quickly rack up your bill! While waiting in line for your entree(about $7-$8/person) you pass by all the desserts that are super tempting. After getting your meal (since it's cafeteria style) you pass by the garlic toast, dinner rolls and salads that are small portions but cost a few bucks. 

Overall, great food and would eat again!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service on food items. Purchased 2 packages of frozen salmon (lax kallrökt and lax gravad). I wanted to return them for refund because we couldn't eat it.  I have never had such salty salmon (been eating it all my life so I know how it should be). IKEA has a no refund policy on any food products. Beware!"}
{"text":"I love Ikea food because it is affordable and fast. The food tasted great at this location but I am giving it a 3 star because of its cleanliness. When I went to grab a bowl for a salad, I found a couple of bowls with food still stuck to it--gross! Took me a bit until I FINALLY found a clean bowl. (This was also the case when I went to get the cutlery.) I found from an employee that I didn't have to stick to one type of salad. I loved that I got to put different salads in a bowl and still be charged $2.49!! I also got the egg salad sandwich for $2.99; it was a decent sandwich, I love the arugula that added contrast to the flavour. Overall... an okay place to grab a quick bite but take extra care when choosing your bowls, plates, and cutlery to make sure it is actually clean!"}
{"text":"Had an awful experience with IKEA's delivery service.

My roommates and I entrusted our purchased items in carts together with the IKEA delivery counter. Little did we know, promised next day delivery would turn out to be 3 separate deliveries dealing with missed and messed up items over the course of the following week.

The initial delivery was missing a bed, a mattress and received another customer's nightstand while they got delivered our laptop stands (sounds almost the same = same thing maybe?). My roommate had to rush home from work to be available 5-9pm 3 times last week waiting for the deliveries. 

We figured if it's flat rate ($79) we should get every one of our purchases delivered.  However, from this horrible and headache inducing experience, I recommend using their delivery  service only if you really have to (ie. huge items like couches) or if you're not in a rush to get something.

I still like browsing the showrooms and will probably continue buying the furniture but the delivery service has left a bad impression."}
{"text":"We all know that IKEA is the place for cheap-ass stylish furniture and other things you need for your home at great prices. And that navigating a store can feel like a video game, with the linear maze-like experience. In fact, to effectively and efficiently shop at an Ikea, one must attack the trip like a video game. If you know exactly what you want and to get the hell out quickly, it can be hard to resist the temptation to admire the store's many displays and products.

I have been going to the North York location long before they built the garage structure. Heck, long before the Sheppard subway and Esther Shiner Blvd. even existed. At this point, I am familiar with its many shortcuts, including ones that allow you to skip the showroom entirely. Think of them as like the 'Warp Zones' in the Super Mario games.

The highlight of any IKEA is its cafeteria-style restaurant. Never mind the famous meatballs; their pasta is fucking amazing. On a weekday, it can be had at a special price of TWO DOLLARS! Makes you wonder how this chain can make great food and sell it at lowball prices, never mind their furniture and decor. The North York location's restaurant has plenty of seating that fills up quickly on a weekend, and offers stunning panoramic vistas of the parking lot and of North York's eastern abyss.

IKEA offers a free shuttle bus service to and from Leslie subway station, although it is within walking distance from the station's bus terminal. New condo towers built across the street offers extreme store fanatics the chance to live the dream of living next door to an Ikea. In that case, who needs delivery service, or a car, or even the TTC, when you can cart your new BILLY bookcases to your place across the street?

Only in the City of Toronto, I guess..."}
{"text":"Never try and return anything its an event on its own. Staff are so slow abd it takes forever. They should train them at Home Depot that's a retail store that takes care of its customers"}
{"text":"Dear mr. Ikea 
Your stores are over crowded and has a lack of staff. After spending too much of my time if your store I finally got the required information to purchase the \"right\" product. Unfortunately for me, after spending hours building the bathroom vanity it obviously didn't fit and the licensed plumber couldn't even figure it out. I called IKEA to return the product that is brand new and I was not permitted to do so. For a large company they sure do have poor service. I will now try to sell my newly built wasted time bathroom vanity on kijiji and I refuse to ever buy from ikea again. 

By the way prices at ikea are actually way more expensive now than they used to be and you can buy the same products from Home Depot, Lowes and other independent stores for way less and much better quality that you DO NOT have to waste hours of your life putting together."}
{"text":"3.5

I actually love all the little home décor, paintings and general knick knacks they have here.  The Christmas stuff is out and the cute little decorations are to die for.  I could wander for hours (on a weekday morning when no one is here!/) but forget about coming on a weekend.  It is a madhouse.  Try getting some help on the weekends and well...bring a book, you will be waiting a long time.  The entrance and exit are these teeny tiny doors where people with big carts are tying to leave and there is no room for them to exit without banging into your shins.  The furniture is cheap and simple and sometimes you need and want that :).  Over the years I have bought several pieces from Ikea and to be honest I have never had an issue with any.  Is it the best quality - no, but then again they don't claim it to be either.  

The $1 breakfast can't be beat - it's decent but what do you expect for $1?  The café is large but seriously they need a larger serve station and more cashiers to get the line moving. I'm starving and my food is looking right at me - I need to eat!!

Tips - go on the weekday if possible.  You can maneuver around the maze like floor plan  to your hearts content until you find the cheese (cashiers!).  Also wait for sales because they always have them, which is another reason I like them.  This weekend they had 20% off all rugs.  

Thankfully over the past few years they added a second tier parking level so don't even bother to look for parking on the ground..just go straight up to the second level and you will always find a spot"}
{"text":"I've been here many times before.  This isn't my favourite location...it always seems extra crazy, even on a weekday.  Today, I went in to pick up some extra parts (dowels) to assemble a shelf we purchased.  I was able to find someone to help me, since they weren't in the extra parts shelf.  I feel like that returns and extra parts area is a bit short staffed.  They found 2 pieces in a cupboard and gave them to me.  So kudos for the quick customer service.  This location also had some shelving inserts that were sold out on the weekend at the other ikea, so I picked those up too.  The line up was short, but so so so so so slow...  In general be prepared to be here for a few hours."}
{"text":"This location has the best As-Is. If I dig around enough I can find what I need.  
The checkout is getting better.  With the \"self-checkout\", you can get out a lot quicker.  As well, with the wacky Wednesdays, there are lots to save on... Mind you, it's still Ikea.... you have to build everything yourself."}
{"text":"I haven't had IKEA food for sometime now, but I must say, I'm a bit disappointed.

Breakfast special is always great. How can you mess up eggs and sausage?

Lunch time on the other hand was disappointing. I ordered the chicken with fries on the side. The chicken was dry. Portion was big, but dry. Fries are good.

I also tried the blueberry juice, but there is little next to no sugar in it. If you are seeking for a healthy option, this is it, but you are sacrificing taste.

You can't go wrong with the Swedish meatballs."}
{"text":"A great value for a meals and most of the stuffs are also affordable, always love to shop on Ikea. I also ate lunch at their restaurant, unfortunately I didn't eat their meatballs, instead ingot kids meals; fish and chips and pasta. It's so cheap, and satisfying! But the fish is kinda hard and cold. If i live close by, I'll definitely come everyday for breakfast which is crazy only for $1 (scrambled eggs and roasted potatoes) they also have a great deals for hotdog ( $0.75 ) and Pizza.

The crazy part was the AIR CONDITIONER isn't working today!! It's crazy.. It's 30 degrees outside!! Plus there's so many people today, I'm suffocating.

{"text":"OOOOHHHH I LOVEEEE IKEA TO DEATH.

FACT: my favorite thing to do when i'm in the washroom? reading the IKEA catalog. It's gone to the point where I walk into IKEA and immediately have to run to the ladies room (with a catalog obvi...) i'm basically Pavlov's dog, Swedish version.


FOOD FOOD FOOD FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. Tuesday - 2.99 meatballs. I get like 3 portions obviously.
Wednesdays - fish and chips. 2.99. Again, 3 portions. 

Their gravy is to dieeeee for, i ask for so much extra I end up with gravy soup, mashed potatoes and meat balls on the side, please.

Fountain drinks....pear soda....almond cream cake....more more more more.

I think they also sell furniture....? I always just assumed those made up beds were there for me to nap on comfortably after a large meatball lunch (that's what she said).

Anyway, come one come all - IKEA is the best thing to happen to my stomach since Jillian Michaels. 


PS they have awesome bed covers and sets, sometimes they're on deep deep sale so you can snatch a whole queen size deal with two pillows, bed skirt, duvet cover for like $20-30 bucks. YOU'RE WELCOME."}
{"text":"Always busy. Hard to find an associate. Inventory often low.  On the plus side, I love the food court. Great selection, relatively clean and friendly staff. Although I wish they'd stick to one version of the salmon dish."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times and everytime I go I just love the displays! You really feel as though if you has the time you would spend all your money here. I really needed some big items and I had lots of help finding them. Only problem I never know how to get out! They need more signs on how to get out. And if they can be more clear on how to shop here, like where you get the piece of paper and a pen to write down the item numbers and so forth, this would be an awesome place.  For selection its good. But that delivery is way too expensive."}
{"text":"C'mon we all love Ikea.
People may complain about the long lines, some broken pieces in the box when you get home, the crowded parking lots, and rude patrons who keep bumping your carts, be we all keep going back year after year.
I went last week, and the nice thing is that nothing has changed.
One complaint is that I wish you could return something that is clearly an Ikea product without a receipt.  They let you do this once and that's all.  Home depot's return policy is sooooo much better.
And they can't be making any profit on food.........can they?"}
{"text":"Used to always come here when I was a kid for the play place while my parents shopped. The restaurant used to always be my favourite, but over the past few years, the quality has really downgraded. Took my little cousin on a quiet Monday, and decided to stop at the restaurant because we were both kinda hungry. I got the Kids Meal Fish and Chips for her, while I got the Blueberry Cheesecake. While we went to pay, I realized the cashier charged me for a regular fish and chips and not the kids meal. Of course, I did let her know, because she was charging me an extra $5 for something I didn't order. She told me the one I had was the regular and not the kids meal. I was too upset at this point, because I specifically told the server I wanted the Kids Fish and Chips and not the regular. Oh well. Their fountain drinks are flat.I did enjoy the cheesecake however."}
{"text":"This Ikea store is a furniture showroom, a retail store, a warehouse, and a cafeteria-style restaurant. The meals and snacks served are delicious and good value. You gotta try their Swedish meatballs at least once!

The showroom and retail space are brightly lit and spacious, making for a comfortable shopping experience. It's a fun place to shop for home durable goods, from small things like picture frames to big things like kitchen counters."}
{"text":"I've always loved IKEA and going to this location was an adventure when I was a kid in the late 80s, and I still get excited about it now.

It can be a little chaotic, but the store is massive, so even on the weekend I never lose my mind. There's always tons of marketplace items I can't help but grabbing. Their furniture ranges from solid to flimsy, great price to rip-off -- don't get dazzled by $10 chairs. I've become much more sharp with my IKEA budget as I've grown, so I just focus on the practical deals.

I used to think the cafeteria food was pretty wack, but it's actually quite delicious. Those veggie medallions are incredible! And the Swedish meatballs are really great, even though they're super unhealthy.

It's a trek to get out here, and can be expensive (if you start getting into furniture), so I like to keep my IKEA trips to only 3-4 times a year. I always have fun getting some odds and ends for my place. And eating some meatballs.

Note: It's easier than ever to get to via subway. Grab the shuttle if you can, but it's really only a 5 minute walk from Leslie station."}
{"text":"If you come here, be sure you give yourself 1-2 hours because there's a whole ton to look at and you're going to start to reinvent the house you have.... or you'll start thinking about the \"Next\" house! They have different sections of the home set up so you can really imagine yourself in that space. It's definitely fun for kids to run through and gives adults a nice visual idea of what they might be looking for. Think of it as a giant disconnected doll house. They even put up some decor like fake plants and art work to get you thinking. 

The staff are super friendly and it's easy to get information anywhere (literally all over.. ). And you just write down what it is you're going to pick up and at the end, you grab what you need from the warehouse area and shove it on a cart. Easy. The items are fairly easily assembled too. I bought a queen bed a few years back and it's super sturdy. I never once needed to drill or seriously hammer anything. They have the pegs set up to make sure the entire structure of whatever you have is sturdy to last. We also got a few dressers which are amazing quality and fit so nicely in the rooms. Everything seems to be pretty decently priced as far as my purchases have gone, and you can check the flyer for extra deals. 

But the thing everyone really is interested in is the food. THey have this food court/ cafe area upstairs which makes you feel like a kid, lining up in the cafeteria for lunch time. You pick out what you want and pay at the cashier towards the end. Then you find a seat and munch away. The swedish meat balls are awesome! I buy the frozen ones to make at home as a little snack. I literally pop them in the toaster oven and bake until cooked. Super easy and doesn't really need sauce. The soft serve here is also a pretty nice treat! I don't really find that I've enjoyed much else here yet.. haha but to be fair, it's not like I'm trying much... and I make an Ikea trip maybe once every couple of months..

It's really just a fun place to go kill some time and imagine your future living space. haha"}
{"text":"A very busy ikea especially on weekends. I've bought a table, desk and bed frame to furnish my condo recently. This review is basically for the restaurant. I did visit the $1 breakfast and it's free coffee before 9:30AM! The food isn't that great but for a dollar - you just can't say no. You get scramble eggs, two sausages and potato wedges. I have to warn everyone that it does get a little crazy and crowded. I'm talking about like lining up before the store is even open! IKEA does manage to get through the line up pretty quickly and there are enough seats as people will leave once they are done eating. 

If you do plan a Saturday to do your shopping here. Coming from downtown? Leslie subway stop has a shuttle bus just for you. Come early for breakfast and spend the rest of the day to go through the showrooms and marketplace. It does take a few hours if you go see it all. Have fun ya'll."}

{"text":"Who doesn't love Ikea? Great cheap furniture for those who love it. Great ice cream and lots of parking. 5 stars for IKEA. Never had a bad experience here - but mind you - I'd never buy furniture here. I'm 40 and just can't justify spending money on furniture here. I much prefer Elte or Art Shoppe, however, the food is great value for money. 

I'm reviewing the food - not their furniture. If it was based on strictly furniture - IKEA would likely earn a solid 1.5. Chip boards, shitty laminate? Let's be honest / your staff know what they're ordering. Barf. 

The food though - god bless Ikea. Eat lots - live long (I hope)."}
{"text":"When you are tired of wandering around the massive store, poking around different living spaces, or tracking down that one item you actually came for..... stop by the cafe for a fuel up! 

There are plenty of options to choose from. Lighter meals, snacks, healthy meals and fried treats. Of course the most popular choice is the meatball combo. It comes with mashed potatoes, gravy, veggies and cranberry sauce. It's a very balanced meal for a food court situation. On the other side of the health balance is the fish and chips combo. A great treat though. We were pleasantly surprised at how big the two fish pieces were! 

I appreciate how family inclusive they try to be. There is a small play area for kids and they even provide a jar of free baby food for each adult meal!"}
{"text":"$0.50 cent hot dogs.  A girl can't complain."}
{"text":"My family comes here for their $1 breakfast almost 3 times a week. You get 2 sausages, egg (scramble) and fried potatoes. The portions are quite reason for the price. It is self served and if you arrive in the first half and hour of opening you get free coffee or tea! 

For 3 people we ate about $7 worth of food. Very economic and for dessert I got their $1 \"Frozen Yogurt\".  

I had lunch at Ikea before as well. I like their daily specials, but its not exactly THE best food you will ever put in your mouth. 

VERDICT- Don't expect to be amazed, but the prices and portions will put a smile on your face. Breakfast is what brings in the crowd! I never tried their dinner, and I don't think I will."}
{"text":"As usual, when I review a chain, my review is for the location in question and not the chain itself.

This IKEA is conveniently located near both a subway stop (Leslie) and the 401.  It get extraordinarily busy on weekends and is smaller than their Vaughan location.  Last time I was there I bought a combo furniture item which had a part that needed to be obtained from the pickup counter as it was not a standard bin item.  After the checker put in the order, it took a very long time for them to retrieve it.  The sign said their wait time should be about seven minutes but a lot of the folks had been waiting a lot longer.  Plus there was no one staffing the pickup counter when I arrived.  Of course, it was a busy weekend, but  still, the management should expect that and have enough staff on hand.  

On the other hand, I have never had trouble finding parking here, even when they are busy.  Maybe its because a lot of folks use the subway to get here.

I prefer the Vaughan store to this one but as this one is a short distance from my home it is more convenient."}
{"text":"Great interior decoration inspo and cute restaurant - I always have to have a cone before I leave!

Pasta was very oily but it is what it is for 3.99. I usually get the mac and cheese which is my favourite and the garlic bread was tasty.

As for the store itself it's easy to navigate around, if you're looking for a specific item (decorations, shelving, lights, fake plants) -- they're most likely on the other floor located downstairs.

Top floor are showrooms for inspiration."}
{"text":"Got the salmon here and it was overcooked so the meat was very stiff and dry. I think the heat might have contributed to this while it was sitting as well. Otherwise it would've been really good. However, the vegetable medallions here are so good! Highly recommend. You also get unlimited coffee refills if you choose to buy coffee. I tend to get the frozen yogurt here as well, but it was more liquidy than usual (there was an issue with the machine). It's cheap and you get your dessert fix!"}
{"text":"I never really enjoyed their food here but my sister wanted to eat so we end up ordering a plate of pasta and the famous meatballs. Meatballs were good but not filling.

The pasta. Omg was the worst tasting pasta ever. It felt like it came literally out of the box without being boiled. It's so hard and stiff. Feels like it's been there for 5 days. And the sauce, tomato, but it's definely just poured over from the can without even cooking or heating. It's by far the worst. Also the utensils are dirty!!! I understand it's budget eating but if you can't make the food affordable then charge it at a decent price and make it better. 

Will not eat here again. Only for ice cream."}
{"text":"Whenever I walk into my friends' houses, it's like a walk into an Ikea store. I find most young adults buy their things from Ikea since it's fairly cheap and stylish.  Since I don't really buy anything, my review is based on a 3 things.

$0.99 BREAKFAST
The best value for 99 cents. I mean you get 2 sausages, eggs and tator bits. And I was full after eating my plate. Free water too! For you coffee drinkers, the coffee is $1.00 too. Not sure how it tastes but it's a buck for a caffeine boost. Not bad I say.

RETURNS with NO RECEIPT
So as a Christmas gift I got pots. One of those coming of age presents I guess....gearing me up for wifehood? right.... Anyways so I went to see if I could return it without a receipt. Turns out you can get a gift card of the products retail value (lower of current price or sales price in the past year). Not bad eh? They only allow you to do this once a year per household.  My only main complaint is that I had to wait at least 45 minutes for my return.  This was way too long and the number of ppl who came behind me increased at an increasing rate. They really needed to have another person on staff handling returns. I hate waiting.

# OF CUSTOMERS
I do agree that this place is way over-crowded. I went at 11 o'clock on a weekday and I still bumped into people. I remember going in on a weekend in the past and there was no room to push my buggy.  What's even more difficult is that when you get to the kitchenware, there is even less room.  So not a fan of the overcrowding but at least you know IKEA hasn't been hurt by the recession!"}
{"text":"What's up with the secrecy to paper cup? I just wanna hold my drink while I shop around. It's not like the food place is a buffet so what the hell"}
{"text":"Lets be honest we all come here for the food!! I got the sweedish meatballs with fries and they are always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I love Ikea for it's excellent selection, quality and price, BUT today I was very disappointed when the refund department (both the clerk and manager) refused to process my very reasonable refund request. My nine month pregnant wife, who purchased a product a few days ago she wished to return, was at home bed ridden, so she couldn't come with me to the store. I brought 1) the original receipt; 2) the product in unopened packaging; 3) her credit card number used to purchase the items and 4) my credit card (linked to the same credit card account). At first the Ikea agent told me it was \"impossible\" for Ikea to issue the refund, and then when I told them I had done the refund successfully at other stores using my card (linked to same account that my wife used) AND called my credit card company for them to explain to the merchant they had all the material necessary to process the refund, the manager acknowledged she was technically *able* to do it, but still refused, saying it was inconsistent with their policy. When I asked to see their policy, I was referred to back of receipt, which of course said nothing of the sort. They were being extremely difficult to my wife and me at a time in our lives where we really would have appreciated some basic human compassion and common sense."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star, I would. Bought multiple furniture items 3 weeks ago and scheduled delivery and assembly. Delivery came with pieces missing. Scheduled delivery of the missing pieces for another day. Assembly guy came in, found multiple defective components and assembled what he could. I called Ikea and arranged for defective pieces to be replaced at the same time as the missing pieces. Delivery was never received (twice!!!) because ikea never placed the items on the truck and never informed us that the delivery would not occur...TWICE!!!Today, finally got the delivery (second assembly appt is scheduled for tomorrow) and guess what?!  Not only did they send the wrong items, some stuff wasn't delivered at all!  On top of it, the delivery guys were frustrated and refused to deliver what they did have right. Waiting for ikea to get back to me now. It's been 3 hours. I am beyond frustrated. I used to love Ikea and would go at every opportunity. Not any more. No one knows what they're doing. Over the last 3 weeks, I've had multiple people try to resolve the issue, give me incorrect advice (tip: delivery guys DO NOT TAKE AWAY ASSEMBLED ITEMS, contrary to what the customer service rep told me over the phone). The head doesn't know what the tail is doing. I can't believe this is what $5000+ gets you. Disappointed."}
{"text":"It's Ikea...  It's Swedish...  It has a funny name.

If you start having conversations with all your furniture on a first name basis then I would suggest you start trying to broaden your horizons or perhaps re-think your obsession with flat-pack furniture stores.

They do have some nice-ish things, but really it's mostly utiltiltarian-get-it-done-for-the-lowest-possible-price-while-saving-on-everything-including-style.

And yes, I really did just use 15 hyphens in a single sentence paragraph.

My computer workstation lives on an Ikea \"Jerker\" desk and I have a couple \"Billy\" bookcases, and my parents gave me a coffee and end-table for which I do not know the names when they fled the big city for the humble cottage and retirement.

On the upside, it is cheap, and no doubt a good percentage of the materials are helping to bring sweat-shop workers into the 21st century and helping transform their 3rd world countries into 2nd or perhaps 1st.  (ok ok, that is wishful thinking, but it will happen eventually and the world will run out of countries to exploit for cheap labour... The sooner that happens the better since people will be fed up of having to buy the same damn kitchen utensil over and over and over again after the cheaply made ones break again and again and again).

Ikea is great to get you the stuff you need to hold your stuff so your humble abode will not look like a disgusting hobo shelter, or look like you're a hoarder with piles of books, knick-nacks and the general crap that we all tend to accumulate over the years."}
{"text":"Always a horrible experience. 

To be fair, the show rooms are beautiful and all their products are cheap and well designed, but I can't say anything nice about their operation and customer service in this particular location. 

Delivery:  for the past two deliveries I paid, they consistently missed the delivery date, and no one is responsible since they pass the balls around between ikea and the delivery company they subcontract. It was very time consuming for me to call different numbers to resolve the issue. Once arrived, the delivery guys just push things around in your home without regards for scratches and dents at your home. Do yourself a favor and avoid their delivery at all cost. 

Stock level: things I'd usually like to purchase  from this location are frequently out of stock. Be it kitchen appliances, kitchen cabinets, shelves and sofas, I frequently have to wait for months for anything to be delivered. And I'm not talking about promotional events or holiday seasons. This is happening all year round. 

Food court: usually decent, but today I got an unnecessary condescending remark from the cashier for simply asking a question. Hence driving me to write this review complaining about all my bad experiences from past. 

The lack of staff training and operation management is atrocious at this location. Unfortunately, after spending tens of thousands of dollars, I will still shop here for their design and value, but I wouldn't expect any good/reliable experience like the ones I had from west elms and EQ3."}
{"text":"Food Ikea is not what you remember from your childhood...still good value food with staples like meatballs and garlic bread. Everything still taste A-Okay, but I'm not a happy camper when they change recipes for things you grew up to eating.
They changed the meatball gravy, it's now less creamy. 
They also had the balls to change their balls - EXTREMELY not impressed *RAGE EMOJI*
They used to be less dense and much fluffier with a more irregular surface. I'm not talking about their newly introduced chicken or veggie balls, it's their regular meatballs.
Yes, they are still tasty with your lingoberry sauce but Ikea meatballs are a nostalgic memory for so many 90s kids."}
{"text":"Decent place to have a bite to eat while shopping. Their store layout is like a long maze. There's one entry way and one exit. The cafeteria style area provides a nice break as you navigate the store. I had Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes. It was slightly better than frozen food at the grocery store. Price was cheap. You can refill and have as much coffee or soft drinks as you want for a dollar. Busy with many families."}
{"text":"I had a very frustrating experience last week at your store.  I though I had emailed it but since there was no response I may have not pressed send.  Here is the issue briefly.  I would appreciate a reply.

I was at IKEA today to check out the interior fittings for a Pax wardrobe I will be buying (this will be over $5000). On the way out I grabbed a few things and decided to go through the express checkout because I only had a few small things and it was quicker than standing in the long line. I scanned all my items and then scanned the bar code for the small bags and paid through Interact. I grabbed a bag and was told it was a big bag and I hadn't paid for a big bag. I asked for the small bags. I was told they didn't have any. So...? I asked if I could give them a quarter and take a big bag. The poor kid who was helping me asked the next aisle person, Keiko, what to do. She told him not to give me a bag and not to take any money. She told him (while I stood there) that I would have to go and get a refund and then pay for a big bag. ( to put this in perspective a big bag is $1 and a small bag is $.75). Neither person offered to help me with a refund. I went and checked all the aisles for a small bag and there were none. The kid at the checkout told me I could use a cart instead. I told him I was going on the subway and a cart was not an option. I then stood in line behind 10 people pondering whether to get a refund. After 20 minutes I got to Keiko and decided to just buy another bag. I wanted the receipt because I was steaming by then. She said I would have to wait because she had to reprint it. I left with no receipt. I was extremely rude to the poor guy in the express lane and I am very sorry for taking out my frustration on him but this was over $.25!! This took me an extra 1/2 to 3/4 hour out of my life. They could have 1. given me a big bag or 2 taken my quarter or 3. help me obtain a refund and get another bag and 4. covered up the bar code in the self serve aisle if they know they have no bags and are going to be rigid about it. I scanned this in good faith thinking the product existed. This is one of the worst customer service scenarios I have ever seen -- and all over $.25 after I have spend thousands at IKEA and was planning to spend thousands more."}
{"text":"Ikea, I love you, and I especially love this location. 

The Swedes knew what they were doing when they built this location. Lots of stairs, and a child minding service right at the front door with an enticing, colourful ball-pit.. Know what this means? A shortage of people ramming into you with their strollers around every corner! 

This is my favourite Ikea to go to - even on a Saturday its not overwhelmingly busy. I like that they've added the self checkout area now, it does seem to make lineups go faster. Note: if you want home delivery, do not use self check-out. For whatever reason, this won't work and you'll find yourself at customer service for a ridiculous amount of time. 

As always, with Ikea, know what you're buying. If you are buying the particle board stuff, don't expect it to last a lifetime. I do find they have some higher quality stuff that is excellent though. 

Oh, and you can't go without getting meatballs at the cafeteria. You just can't."}
{"text":"If you're already the proud owner of an extensive Allen key collection, I don't need to sell you on the IKEA paradigm. You get it. You've already embraced the idea that for every hour of shopping and purchasing, you will spend another 3-5 hours pulling pieces of whimsically named furniture out of cardboard boxes, spreading them over your floor, and studying assembly instructions short on copy. 

This location is near Leslie subway station on the Sheppard line, but you might need an alternate form of transportation when you leave (if you're like me and always buy more than you planned to). Be prepared. Wear comfortable shoes. Don't shop tired and don't shop hungry. You will probably make several unplanned purchases in the marketplace. You will wait in line for EVERYTHING - if you're not hungry when you line up for meatballs, I guarantee you'll be ravenous by the time you make it to the cafeteria checkout."}
{"text":"When I've ordered online from Ikea, the shipping is always fast, delivered in a window, they call ahead, and it's super professional. I should do this all the time. However, sometimes you do need to see the furniture so you can really visualize it.

This Ikea is okay. They have some real staffing issues, like if you want to buy a couch or get some kitchen help, you basically have to hover and swarm around the one or two staff people, who are obviously overwhelmed and having a tough time referring who was in line first and people who are claiming they just need 30 seconds for an answer. 

Also, this is going to sound really silly, but once I paid for some food at their express line-up place (you can get hot dogs, frozen yoghurt), and she gave me the wrong change. She shorted me $1. This is not a big deal, but she did. When I pointed it out, she had to get her manager so they could count the till. The manager said, well actually, her till is less than it should be, so she doesn't have extra money, therefore she didn't shortchange you. This is the worst logic ever - she has obviously made mistakes on other people's change, so the fact that her till is off means...she didn't make a mistake on mine??"}
{"text":"Wife and I used to come here once or twice a week for breakfast and then go shopping. Back when breakfast was $0.99.

The new breakfast is $2.49 or $2.99... the breakfast sausages are smaller and taste weird due to lesser quality meat. Clearly a price jump while adding two tiny slices of tomatoes, and a small slice of bread.

While the change is still a reasonable deal, it is no longer an amazing deal.

Due to proximity we will be switching to having breakfast at a mom n pop style place closer to home... near a Canadian Tire. So I guess CT will be getting our business from now on."}
{"text":"Was here to pick up batteries (flat ones) for less than $3 (whilst this is usually over $10 elsewhere) & a storage box for under the bed. We came pretty late & had no problems finding parking or nor did we have to wait in line to pay. 

The staff Andrew in the lighting department was so nice and walked us over to where the batteries were located & answered any questions we had about other items at ikea as well. 

I like the price & style for their furniture. Some things are affordable. Hope to build my future craft room w/ ikea furniture one day. If only plywood didn't release formaldehyde over time... 

Love their yogurt cone here."}
{"text":"You've seen one, you've seen them all. IKEA - a great place for picture frames, candles, cutting boards, durable children's toys and build-it-yourself furniture. 
The North York location has been around for many years. It's easiest to navigate when you bypass the regular entrance, go through the cashiers and go straight to whatever you need to pick up. 
This location is always super busy. I've gone both morning, noon and evening and there are always lineups. 
Cashiers work quickly and are very cheerful. 
I can't comment on the food as I've never eaten at IKEA."}
{"text":"omg the meatballs (°?°) 

and the 50 cents garlic bread!!! 

and the salmon salad is really good!!!

and i never tried it but i heard the lingon drink is rly good too!"}
{"text":"As always Ikea is a mad house. Was looking at the natural latex mattress here. But I checked reviews & basically 75% of people were happy with their mattress. I'm not going to spend that much money & only be 75% sure of being satified with my purchase! Still a great place for home accessories though. I hate the maze-like floor plan. It makes it more difficult to get somewhere quickly. But I guess that's the point so you'll see something & say oh yeah I need that too!"}
{"text":"Why do I leave the nest and venture to parts unknown... 

Kids only allowed 45 minutes in play place.... I kid you not, I was in line waiting for my food for 30 minutes...

I waited so long, saw the time and abandoned my hopes of a quiet meal... left the line to get my kids"}
{"text":"Insanely cheap furniture that will probably break within the year if it gets a lot of use. I find that things like couches and beds won't last very long for anyone over 100lbs. But the cabinets and dressers will last forever if you put them together right. 

Also, they have an amazing cafeteria that has insanely cheap food. (If you are looking for quality, why are you here in the first place?) If that is the only thing you end up buying, it is still worth it."}
{"text":"Okay, so the layout and products are kinda blase in that spare Northern European design within-reach aesthetic,  I mean c'mon everyone of us certainly has a Lack table an Expedit wall unit and a Poang chair mingling amongst the furnishings in their homes, right?  Ikea's cheerfully cheap so you can't help go overboard and get like 10 kinds of sheets and duvet covers with names like STENKLÖVER, it's hard not to.  The quality of most furnishings is definitely of the impermanent variety but at least you get to assemble them which is one of my favorite things to do, seriously assembling Ikea stuff is very cathartic and way cheaper than therapy...

The real challenge is convincing male SO's to come here.  Getting hubby to drive, park and shop at Ikea  is like asking a man for a reverse circumcision, but if there's one thing hubby LOVES, it's those soapy \"Swedish\" meatballs, so all I have to do is flip to the back page of the Ikea catalogue and show hubby money shots of meatballs drizzled in gravy, and we're good to go!  Besides you really can't beat a lunch for two people for less than $15 bucks!

Random observation about Ikea:  there is more GTA interracial couple representation here per square foot than would be represented in a German porn marathon?? 

With regards to the furnishings, if I could offer one shopping/decorating tip, it's please please please, just don't buy the prints or  hanging \"art\" at Ikea :( .  There's nothing sadder than when I see Ikea \"artwork\" hanging in peep's homes, I'm not trying to knock your design values, but it's just so un-inspiring, I'd much rather see a flocked velvet version of \"Dog's Playing Poker\" than this pablumized \"art\".

Avoid weekends at Ikea like the plague unless witnessing a plague (especially parking) is actually your thing.  Monday mornings are blissfully peaceful, and quiet to the point I was shit-distubingly planking on nearly everything and NO ONE noticed!

Best bet: The grocery section of Ikea has been incrementally downsized from the past, but you can still walk out with satisfactory European manufactured foodstuffs for a decent price.  I picked up frozen Rosti, AppleKaka (AMAZING Swedish applecake, that for some reason it's made in Germany?) , and that to-die-for white chocolate coated Swedish Almond Tarta Mandel , plus a huge can of sparkling (de-alcoholized?) pear juice, all this for $17!!! Häftigt!"}
{"text":"I can live in this place. I love ikea. Staff is usually friendly and place is chill. Good in their cafe is good, but usually packed. Have the ice cream downstairs too."}
{"text":"A place where you can pretty much find anything and I mean anything for your home. The designs are cute and stylish and colourful.
I bought a memory pillow here, cause I needed something firm that doesn't lose shape, within my budget. The one I got here was very comfortable and was exactly what I wanted. One thing that got on my nerves though, was the strong plastic smell it had. I sprayed it with Febreze and left it outside for a day to get rid of the smell and even though it was reduced, I can still smell it when I sleep on it.

The customer service is great. The only thing I don't like is the long line ups. The closing time is never what's written. I have come here at 8:45 PM before and stayed around till 10 PM without being rushed to checkout."}
{"text":"Let's be honest here, I was able to get two breakfast's with sausages, 2 pancakes, a cupcake and 2 coffees for less than $7. I can't make all of that on my own for $7. It's always busy here on the weekend so go early before the huge line ups. 

I recommend looking for the actual entrance for the IKEA Restaurant as it looks like no one really knows about it so the line for that side is super short compared to the \"exit\" that everyone enters from because that is the only way to get in at first glance once you get up the stairs."}
{"text":"Really horrible customer service and zero consideration for the customer. I went there with a list. One item was out of stock. I travelled a long way to get there, and was only told sorry, too bad for you, basically. They advertise stuff they don't actually have and its apparently my job to make sure they have the stock they've advertised, you know, because making me build the furniture myself isn't enough responsibility. It made me not even want to buy anything on my list there. But I swallowed it and just got what I could from the list. Fine. Then I ordered the last thing, a coffee table, from their website. It's been five days and I still don't even have a tracking number. I called customer service and they said I'd probably get it today, but I have no idea if they mean the table, or just the tracking number. Neither has showed up. The guy was very short on the phone with me. I'm still using my son's play-table as a coffee table and I've been trying to buy a coffee table from them for weeks now. Take my money, give me a coffee table. It should be really simple but for some reason, it's not. I ordered a bunch of other stuff at the same time and I've gotten tracking numbers from every other company except this one. IKEA has some cool stuff, but it's almost not worth the hassle of dealing with them in order to get the stuff. I paid $30 extra for them to loaf around for a week before making a simple, single-item delivery in the same city as their store. I should have just picked it up myself instead of wasting my money. Glad I don't have to buy home furnishings very often. I hope my table shows up and there's no problems so I can just put this whole transaction behind me."}
{"text":"IKEA is IKEA is IKEA

BUT in a fist fight, Ikea Etobicoke kicks this Ikea North York's butt... in most regards. 

Ikea North York has a better cafeteria layout if you ask me, but that's about it. 

The west end Ikea is larger, better designed, offers more frequent/conveniently located shuttle services, and has a friendlier staff presence, in the aisles and at checkout. 

Admittedly you can walk from Leslie station to the Ikea without the shuttle, but the return is tricky if you're done what anyone in Ikea does- shopped. 

And granted- location is key so if you must, head north. But I stronnngly 



RECOMMEND: Checking stock minutes before you leave. I missed out on a great floor lamp and they have no ETA for it at North York. Meanwhile, it's sitting pretty in a box in Etobicoke. Gggrrrrr :'(

EXTRA TIP: Self-checkout is 15 items but who's counting. No literally, no one is counting lol. Or verifying anything. -_- 
DISCLAIMER- DO NOT PIN YOUR SHOP-LIFTING HABIT ON ME. no no no... #WaggingFinger

{"text":"This IKEA location is quite special to me because it is the first IKEA I ever been to. Back them when I was in University, I came here quite a bit to get some cheap furniture and I still have some of those around my house.

Years later, I am back again. After been to the bigger location in Vaughan which is never crowded on a weekday, this location feels packed and super busy. All these shoppers have nothing doing to like me on a weekday afternoon? The store set up itself is quite crammed too..  Or just because of all the shoppers? I can imagine how busy it would be on a weekend!

Yogurt cone was just as good as I remembered though. Always a treat whenever I go shopping at any IKEA."}
{"text":"This place charges ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR DELIVERY!

Am I insane to be appalled by this - or does anybody else think this is NUTS?"}

There are so many good things going on in this cafeteria setting that I am proud to say it's a great place to bring your first date. 

They say that most people or a lot of people break up in ikea so that if you can survive IKEA, that person is probably a keeper! 

The prices have gone up recently but not by much. The famous 10 meatballs with fries or mash potatoes is $6.99. They no longer offer free coffee if you are an IKEA family member."}

Just like your regular IKEA. Cheap furniture at cheap prices. They make redecorating yourself easy or at least easier!!"}

Most recently, all the drawers in dresser were wrong.  I've also had missing parts, had deliveries not come, been given the wrong sized mattress and the list goes on and on.  All of this and I still go because the quality for the price is so good.  Yes, I hate putting it together more than I hate a root canal but there is nothing else like it when you need to furnish a lot of rooms (I have 3 teenagers).

The food is also ridiculously well priced - not particularly remarkable but dirt cheap.

{"text":"i lub Ikea.  Loved their pretty catalogues, cheap prices for pretty things,unique prints.
I don't visit often enough, so when I do make a visit, I'm looking for the positive.

We were there on a Saturday, mid-morning.  Busy, with so many little kiddies around.  (I'm guessing that the big kiddies were at the free Ikea kid care fun zone).

Parking was tricky, but good things can come to those willing to wait.  At least to wait for a bit.

good:
cheap! prices
cool prints (broccoli, hedgehods)
good selection in-store, should have what you need and then some

er...:
what's with the maze?  You go in for A and to get to it, you have to try to outwit/outsmart/outplay the Ikea system and really focus on any signs or visual hints to get you to the checkout counter, or said item, asap.  It's like we're a bunch of lemmings, treated all the same way - subject to the same run-around every time.
(guaranteeing no quick visits).

Also, you have to be careful about quality.  Once in a while, you'll get a piece that's well made.  Most of the time, expect for items to be trendy, but not last."}

I got some eggs, home fries and two sausages for just over a toonie. 

Personally unless you are really close to Ikea or have some other business being there, I won't recommend it. 

There is no free wi-fi either. 

I'll try it again next time if it is after 11am since that is when their breakfast is over."}
{"text":"Today I got to go to Ikea for work. An errand from the heavens. I love Ikea. I was looking forward to it all week. Unfortunately, this time, for the first time, Ikea *slightly* disappointed me. 

It's so hard to rate Ikea - I'm giving this location a 2 for the store itself, and a 4 for the cafeteria... because... well... meatballs!

I won't go into the actual furniture, because we've all got our lack, our hemnes and our tiny allen keys... so allow me to focus in on the store itself: 

This location is inferior to the one in Etobicoke as it's less cleanly and appears to have less variety in all departments. This was frustrating as I was thinking this location was closer to my house and could become MY Ikea. Alas, it shall not be, I'll continue to hightail it half-way to the airport, where aesthetics, smell and variety are king. 

But, it wasn't all bad as I had the meatballs. There is salty crack in that gravy.

Happy furniture building!"}
{"text":"I ordered a delivery between 1-5 p.m on a weekday and I had been waiting for them the whole four hours at the shipping address and no one called or came. I left after 5 o'clock because I simply didn't have all day to waste waiting for someone not punctual. Then I had no choice but called the IKEA costumer service to reschedule my delivery and assembly. The first call told me they didn't immediately help costumer to reschedule and I needed to wait for them calling back to reschedule, which was fine. But they also told me I needed to PAY exactly the same price for the delivery for $99 to reschedule, which was nothing but ridiculous because the delay was apparently their fault. Then they called back minutes later to tell me AGAIN that I should WAIT for another calling back. OK. FINE again. And this time they relieved me by telling me I would not be charged another payment. Then the most confusing thing happened when someone called back from a number besides 866-866-4532 and asked me to reschedule. I rescheduled with the staff from this call. Then later a call from 866-866-4532 called. And this time the staff said IKEA was not informed that I changed the delivery time. I asked them then who the previous call was and he said he didn't know. I was so worried because I just realized I made an appointment at a precise address on a precise date and time with God knew who that was. Later he confirmed that the previous call was from the shipping company and he bothered to remind me that I SHOULD HAVE CALLED IKEA to reschedule instead of the shipping company. OHHH LIKE HELL I DIDN'T! How kind he was!"}
