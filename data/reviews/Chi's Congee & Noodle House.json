{"text":"Staff are rude unattentive and speak their language amongst themselves. Food is mediocre and has a lot of vegetables as filler. Wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you want a bad."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! One word sums it up. The food is really good- and by what my Asian friend's tell me- it's pretty close to the authentic thing. Their congee is perfect...and the side dishes are awesome. If you are looking for really great Chinese food - and are not bothered about \"ambiance\" this place is perfect. The atmosphere is great - the wait staff is friendly and the service is fast."}
{"text":"yeah i'm a fan of this place!  I prefer it over Congee Dynasty which is down the street.   This is always busy and packed with full tables and a wait list. Did you know you can call for reservations? Probably a good idea if you're going around lunch / dinner times.  Congee super bow + noodle + xo fried turnip patties all for under $30.  However, I'm starting to get disappointed with this place because the portions are getting smaller. I get food is getting more expensive but it's still upsetting....  I'm getting hungry just writing this review.. mmmMMmm   Hope this helps, -jT"}
{"text":"I yelped the closest restaurant to me and this resto popped up among others. We chose this because we really wanted something to warm us up. It was end of January, really cold with the snow and wet rain! We were surprised with the modern decor and the nice relaxing spa like music. We were seated right away and were given hot tea and menu promptly. Points!! We ordered three things to share within the 3 of us. Large bowl of congee with corn and tofu (not on the menu) Points! She suggested some fried donut fritter on the side to go with the congee..Point again!! Also added braised baby bok choy with a side of oyster sauce and deep fried spicy tofu. The food came out really quickly. Point again! And finally the server was very attentive to us and everyone else in the restaurant. Points!! The food was really good. Another point!!!  Congee was piping hot and just what we needed in the cold winter day. The fried tofu wasn't oily at all, and they put a bit of cayenne pepper to make it a little spicy. A bit of garlic hot pepper would've made it awesome though. The veg wasn't overlooked and just the right portion size for us to all share. We spent 25.00 for everything, taxes included. Tip extra, of course. I'll be back when I'm in the area and I'll definitely try something new. If you're looking for a family friendly atmosphere and you don't have a lot in your pocket, and you want to fill your tummy, for the price, the service, this place is worth it. 5 points all around!!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"good food at a reasonable price, can be very busy on the weekend with a line up of people waiting."}
{"text":"Always a go-to for our family, we come here a few times a month and always joke that \"Chi's\" puts the \"chi\" in \"chinese\" -- that's how wonderful it is! Any of the congees (with the deep fried dough fritters) are always a hit among my family and friends who I frequently recommend this restaurant too. You can never go wrong with the turnips (with XO sauce), or deep fried shrimp dumplings! If you're feeling extra adventures, one of my favourites is the deep fried oyster in this honey garlic sauce that has just the right amount of batter to give it that crispy consistency you can enjoy without it feeling overwhelmingly oily. And words cannot even describe how heavenly that sauce is (enjoy it with a plain bowl of rice, that's all you need)! They offer classic dishes such as fried rice, chow mein, and wonton noodle soup if you're looking to get your typical chinese food fix. But the staff are so friendly they're always willing to make the best recommendations. Such a gem in Mississauga with top-notch food and superb service! Chi's Congee Noodle House never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"Mind boggling that this place has been so close to my house all these years and I only recently found out of this place through Yelp. Usually I just go for Tremendous or Phoenix. I tried a variety of dishes from this place. The Malaysian noodles here is a must try. This place gets packed very quickly and service is not too bad either. The food tastes very fresh compared to many other Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Was open later on Sunday than many other options in the area, so we had to go with out backup choice.   Most recent visit for dinner, was overall good.   Items were:  Seafood Tofu Soup - 4.5/5  Chicken Hotpot - 4/5  Mushroom & Beef - 4/5  Green Beans with Pork - 4/5   We realized they forgot to give us our included dessert, but this was well after we left the restaurant.  Would give it a hard 3.5, but had to go with a soft 4 instead.   We will come back again."}
{"text":"If you want great food and amazing value, a (VERY) happy (and noisy) dining experience, and are not fussy about the ambiance, Chi's Congee & Noodle House is a great place to be.  The people are A-MAZING ...  their secret? They treat each one like family! Love this place."}
{"text":"Does not accept Apple Pay, or any credit/debit cards. The majority of people prefer not to carry cash around and certain cards come with rewards, such as air miles on my visa.   Deuces"}
{"text":"Great price, good service, food taste good. They have good value for set dinners and the food comes out quick! I would recommend coming here for dinner with your family."}
{"text":"Had chicken/duck congee and lobster with onion and ginger sauce.  Chicken and duck in the soup tasted sour, the lobster tasted like rubber.  Nevre coming back here."}
{"text":"The best congee place yet in Mississauga after all these years. Good food and good portions. And the price is right.  The owner invested in a new look just recently as well. Their always friendly service makes you want to come back all the time."}
{"text":"This is one of Missisaugas great go-to restaurants if you are hungry for good authentic Chinese cooking. Food is great!"}
{"text":"Very average. The rice noodle rolls were a bit hard and the soy sauce was lacking in flavour. The steamed gai Lan was overcooked. The congee was just OK. The wonton noodles were pretty tasty. The prices were good and the portions were large but overall I wouldn't return for the taste."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's such a hidden gem. You'll get authentic food, large portions for a low price. It's gets pretty busy during dinner but the staff do their best to get you seated. Service is quite efficient. Deep fried turnip pattie cakes spicy/non spicy is worth a try. I like to order their congees, yeung chow fried rice, fried sweet and sour pork on onions, garoupa on fried rice. Everything is made pretty well matter what you order."}
{"text":"I love eating here. The servers are really nice and are helpful.  I can't read their \"specials\" which is in Chinese, so one of them translates it for me.  I never fail to order the fried shrimp wontons. It's so addicting. I've eaten most dishes here and everything's been great."}
{"text":"Fast + delicious and good price. Their tea could be better."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food if you're looking for something in Mississauga. I come here regularly when looking for some authentic tasting food. We ordered Congee and a fried noodle dish which did not disappoint. Would def keep coming back here. Would be nice if it wasn't cash only."}
{"text":"My go to Congee place when in Mississauga.  I highly recommend the preserved duck egg with pork congee and the chicken and duck congee.  This is the only place that I can find in GTA that has boneless chicken and duck congee.  Also recommend the hand pulled chicken meat that is marinated in spices and a special sauce... very flavourful and delish.  The only item I would not recommend is their curry dishes.  I found the curry a bit watery and not strong enough for my liking.  Everything else on the menu is two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. My wife and I have come here twice now and ordered the salt and pepper squid, congee (Great congee here), stir fried chinese broccoli and one of their sweet and sour chicken I think... Service was not that great both times I went. The waiter/ waitresses did not smile at us or say much at all. Doesn't really even look at us. The second time was a little better than the first- maybe they recognized us? The manager was very friendly though and she speaks Mandarin. I think most others speak Cantonese there.  They only take Cash so just a heads up! There's a TD nearby if you need to take money out though.  I'd go back for the food and only for the food. The restaurant is well-lit, crowded and noise level was slightly higher than average. But that's a good ol' chinese restaurant- feels like home :')"}
{"text":"Sorry Markham/Scarborough, Chi's Congee is our favourite congee place in the GTA.  Whether you feel like having something light or heavy, veggie or meat, this place will satisfy.  We like getting a congee super bowl (seafood) and sharing various sides like the dumplings, fish skin and turnip.  \  Like others have posted, the staff are very friendly.  They seem to be owner/operators because we see the same crew most of the time.  They welcome you with a smile and unlike some Asian restaurants they are quite warm towards non-Asians too.  That says a lot about the amiable vibe of this place.  We were running late one night and stopped in for a snack before closing.  We fully intended to be out of there before close (11pm), but they did not know that.  The staff still welcomed us in and never rushed us.  We were out the door by 10.50pm, happy and content.  Chi's Congee & Noodle House never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Their food is AMAZING !!! But their service is really bad I've been there a few times because the food is good but I expect to be treated poorly especially since I'm not Asian and the friends I go with arnt Asian either. one time the waitress tipped herself, she literally took our change and walked away.  If you are not Asian go with an Asian friend maybe you will be treated better."}
{"text":"Agreed, this place is great!  It's cute, clean, fast, and you get so much good food for the price.  Did the MSG test (stuffed ourselves silly and then after waited to see if anyone was extra thirsty, sleepy, or had a headache) and they pass - no msg detected, yay!  I like the duck and chicken congee - you get a huge bowl for $5.50.  The crispy fish skin is great too.  The lunch specials are great - large platter of vermicelli noodles with shredded duck and lots of shrimp for only $6.80. Amazing value. Nice little gem."}
{"text":"The flavor is amazing, just what we expected. The congee I ordered was packed with chicken and duck pieces, all portions are very generous. We had to take away half of our lunch because we simply didn't expect this quantity. The staff is very friendly and the service is speedy. You raise your hand and the first person who sees you is running to you, amazing! Way to go!"}
{"text":"Super unpleasant dining experience on Mother's Day. Waited more than half an hour for our order to be served. Overcooked rice noodle with plain flavor. Would not pay a second visit from personal POV."}
{"text":"This is my favourite authentic Chinese food restaurant around. The food is excellent and the menu is extensive. Service is friendly and very quick. The place is not fancy but the service and food more than make up for it. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food restaurant in sauga.  I've been here many times.  The food is delicious and prices are reasonable.  I like their weekday lunch specials - for about $8 you can get a dish with your choice of a hot drink like tea, coffee, lemonade or soy milk or add another $1 for cold drinks.  They are almost always crowded especially if you come in for lunch on the weekends you may have to wait for seats.  I would like to give them a 5, but I was a bit disappointed with my takeout order this past Sunday.  They were extremely busy but still you gotta make the orders right.  First of all, I came in to order around 11:30am and waited for 20 minutes to get my food, it wasn't a big order either.  Before I left with my order I asked is my order complete and is it correct.  I didn't want to check it there since they packed up everything and tied the bags.  The manager assured me that I got everything and it was correct,  so I trusted her.  When  I got home and checked my order, ended up they gave  me one wrong order and it was something  i didn't like either so I was a bit pissed about that because the noodle they gave me was also too saucy that it made it so soggy.  Everything else was good.  Don't get me wrong, i will still come back to this place to eat anytime because their food is still great!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a few years now, even before their renovations.  I like that some of the wait staff can speak multiple languages (English, Tagalog and Chinese). Love getting their congee, especially with century egg and jak wai (fried donut). I liken it to the East-end Congee Wong/Congee Queen, but in GTA's West End. There is no other place that has great Congee here, just Chi's.   Whenever I am craving congee, it's to Chi's I go. Food and service has been consistently good compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area. They have an English menu and Chinese menu.   In the plaza is a major bank, so come prepared with cash only - as is the practice of the majority of Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"TIP. Avoid the mythical large congee. I need to give this review even though the congee is great. I've been a customer for years, and always order the same thing (pork with century egg congee). My normal order usually comes with 3 take out containers. This so called \"large\" price I was asked to pay this time is no where on the menu. Since, it was twice the price of the only congee on the menu, I asked how many containers come with the regular congee, and was told 2... so why wouldn't I get 4 mythical containers if it's twice the price (2x2)? The price usually drops with larger orders."}
{"text":"Great place to have a family meal! Wonderful server named Mimi - she suggested delicious meals and ways to save when ordering. We were seated right away, given the menu and our orders came really quick. I would definitely come back and we were happy to find this little gem thanks to Yelp.ca!"}
{"text":"A truly great authentic Chinese spot. My favourites: spicy fried tofu, chicken and shrimp in pan fried noodles, and green-beans with minced pork/garlic/ginger.   Extremely helpful and fun service - did not get any annoyed looks when not knowing what to order. There's a TD across the plaza which comes in handy because even though it is cheap...it is cash only."}
{"text":"Get the turnip cake ! Best thing on the menu. Ordered a large pork & preserve egg congee, beef flat noodle dish, turnip cake and vegetable dish.     The congee ($10~) tasted great, plenty of pork and preserve egg. It was salty enough on its own and paired great with deep fried dough ???). The noodle on the other hand, was very average.     If you're going, I recommend their congee, fried dough and turnip cake (MUST). The price range is fairly cheap, even for a Chinese restaurant. Very nonchalant atmosphere, and fast service. Nothing amazing, but definitely not bad for Missisauga."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble across this place by chance and have been there twice in one week. I used to go to Chinatown to get great Chinese food and I now no longer need to make the trek. This is great food at a great price and the folks that work there are very nice. My kids are convinced that this is the best Chinese food that they've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"The food came super fast. Maybe too fast. The speed that food comes at you is maybe the only plus at this restaurant.   The food is really not that good! When you cook it that fast, the quality shows. Noodles soggy and overcooked. Proportions bad. 11$ dish was mostly bean sprouts.   Couple dollars more expensive than most places in the same plaza despite the lack of quality.   For the same money, I would go to full moon. If Bayview garden were still open, would've gone there. Or even Chiu chow man.   The service here is the worst thing ever. They don't speak any language well, maybe a dialect issue?   I knew I was never coming back here when I came back to the table to find out my wife was literally \"shoo'd\" out of our table, and a new couple was already ordering. As soon as you pay your bill, you're getting shoved out asap.   My wife said the larger server collected our cash payment, came back minutes later to tap her on the shoulder, gave her the get out motion with both hands and pointed at the door.   Where does that happen??  All I can think of is....  Go back to mainland and stop ruining Canada."}
{"text":"I have been trying to find a good Chinese restaurant in Missisauga and I think I found one.   The seafood congee with donuts, fried shrimp wontons are my favourite!"}
{"text":"I guess no one here has been to Markham and tried true authentic congee and HK style restaurant food. The food quality here is absolutely sub par, looks like they don't put any heart in to their cooking. We ordered Cantonese chow mein and basil chicken which the waitress recommended but did not meet expectations as we had thought - poor quality chicken, packaged dry non-fresh chow mein noodles...and red pepper in Cantonese chow mein? C'mon that just doesn't go...maybe at gwai lo restaurant but not at a supposed \"authentic\" spot.  I am only giving this place 2 stars because of the service along with the fortune cookies tasting decent, and giving me good fortune. Aside from this, the food was not up to my standard,  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food quality is below average. Missing orders... orders coming out slow... and some dishes taste soooooo bland while some others are full of MSG.... I think people come here to eat only because there's very limited selection in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The staff was rude, and gave our table to someone they knew. I don't understand why their reviews are high. It makes me wonder if they buy their ratings, or if their restaurant is recently under new management.   The place is cramped. During rush hour or on weekends, waiters will force you to share a table with strangers. Never in my life have I seen a crew/team so disorganized."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. We ordered chow mien, snow pea leaves and sesame chicken (which was recommended by the waitress). All very good and authentic tasting. The environment is your typical Chinese restaurant feel. Nothing fancy, but the food was good. Highly recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for Chinese food, may I recommend Chi's Congee.  The location is kind of hidden (on Central Parkway just south of Burnhamthorpe) yet somehow everyone knows about it.  The restaurant isn't huge so it fills up quickly.  There's been a line-up almost every time I've been there, but it moves quickly.  While the majority of the staff only speak Cantonese or Mandarin, a few of the waitresses speak English and are very friendly.  They have pretty much any noodle dish you can imagine and are willing to make ingredient substitutions if required.  I highly recommend any dish with XO sauce, which is a spicy seafood sauce, and their deep-fried tofu.  I'm also a big fan of their congee, which is a rice porridge, and would never order it without the deep-fried donut for dipping.    I recently ordered take-out from Chi's.  The owner was able to help me choose a few dishes and the wait was about 20 minutes.  This was during peak dinner hour and the owner assured me take-out usually only takes 10 minutes to prepare.  Bonus:  you get a 10% discount for picking up your food.  My favourite thing about this restaurant is the staff.  Not only are they multilingual and friendly, they are super efficient.  All of the waitresses are constantly running around and checking to see that you have everything you need.  If you go more than a couple of times, they will even start to recognize your face and remember your favourite dishes."}
{"text":"We used to come here often, to order its different congee. We loved the ones with the clams and shellfish, but have since found that its quality has deteriorated significantly. Last time we came, the congee was extremely watered down. Moreover, instead of its previous generous portions of seafood in the congee, we had only a few pieces of the clam and fish. Some even did not taste fresh!  The fried things are also overly greasy, in my opinion. It's sad, but we can no longer find a good congee place in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at GREAT VALUE AND TASTE!!  Came on a Tuesday after Christmas expecting it to be dead considering it's still kind of the holiday plus we just had a snow storm but to my surprise, this place was still busy. Dine in wasn't particularly packed but they also take a lot of take out orders.  This place opens from 11:00 to 11:00 everyday.  Their food is cooked to great Asian standards and good portions. Prices are fair and service was decent.  Congee was good, cooked to perfect thickness and viscosity and good flavour. The food in the congee was fresh and big pieces.   Their lunch special starts at 11am and it comes with a side drink (coffee or tea).  Overall I'd come back for another fair and filling meal."}
{"text":"It's your typical Chinese local food joint that has the congee and offers fried noodles. Their won ton noodle beef brisket soup was just okay nothing to write home about. I didn't try their congee but it looked like standard congee nothing like congee queen's congee. The food is cheap and the service is just okay. You have to deal with Chinese waitress ladies who are older and may give you decent service or service with some attitude because they are older and they can. I liked their Singapore noodles and their beef chow mein with choy. Would I go back not if I didn't have to be honest. It was the one of the lowest points of the trip for food. I didn't love it but at least it fed us and we got on our merry way to drive to New York state to be heading home."}
{"text":"Great Congee   CASH ONLY for those that are willing to give this place a go."}
{"text":"I have developed a serious love for this place. There are days where we need to remind ourselves not to go back so soon..  In the times I've been there, they definitely did not disappoint.   They're quick, clean, and the food is authentic!   The portions are huge! Where in Mississauga can you get non-westernized, authentic, Chinese food for under $10 a plate?  Their congee - hearty, not at all watery, lots of meat/seafood. I've always stuck with my two favs; Lean pork w/ preserved egg and salted egg, or seafood congee. Huge difference compared to Congee Dynasty, Sam Woo and Emerald.   Rice and Noodle dishes are great too.   We tend to think with our stomachs when we order, and because of the large portions, we always end up with boxes of takeout for the next day.    Beware: If you visit on a weekend, or even during peak dinner times during the week, this place will be packed and you're in for a wait.  If you're super hungry, didn't come with a large group and don't mind adopting the 'Dap Toi' sharing table practice, you'll be sure to be seating before everyone else. It's a common practice in restaurants of Asian culture.   And again, as my fellow yelpers have mentioned, cash only!"}
{"text":"Very fast service and the food is great! Came here first time to order to go. Would be back!"}
{"text":"A nice congee place that is open late with good food and reasonable prices. The food comes out fast,  and the service is on the ball. One annoyance is they they only take cash. The other annoyance is that you need to go in a group as they food is best enjoyed in a group of 4+. If you go with less people, the pallet is limited and becomes bland as you order less food, etc.  During the week, they have specials on various dishes to entice people to come in. Overall,  I give this place a 4/5."}
{"text":"My congee spot.   Great food and portion sizes. Good pricing. Fair service- they don't really smile or aim to cater to you. Space is limited and that means long waits for dinner or sharing tables. I had lunch specials here before and it was good too"}
{"text":"the seafood congee is excellent as is the service.  i went for lunch. they were very accommodating and polite.   the menu was exptensive and from what i saw other dinner eating, it all looked excellent."}
{"text":"Customer service needs improvement, at best service is okay. Food is mediocre: house special fried rice is not good, Fried chicken wings are good, Congee was the highlight (chicken and duck). Veggies are not as tasty (snow pea with garlic) not as fresh as it could be. Would probably not return a second time... price is within average range."}
{"text":"Man ohh mannn is the food here awesome!!!! I have never eaten at the restaurant and have always done take out. The first couple of times I ordered Singapore rice noodles and fried squid. Those are always good! However this time I wanted to be a little bit more adventurous and looking at some of the other reviews I ordered some of the dishes that kept coming up in each of the reviews.   So I ordered the lobster with ginger and green onions, shrimp with ground pork and black bean sauce, chicken fried rice, the fried squid (because it's just that good) and the Chinese vegetables which is like a spinach / broccoli type of crunchy vegetable served with oyster sauce on the side. Everything was absolutely delicious and the portions were great.  Definitely want to do eat in one day and try some more dishes out. When my family and I have Chinese food it's usually hakka style, so it was very nice to have been introduced to a different style of chinese cuisine. Will be back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Chinese congee at great prices, what more can you ask for? Can get busy at times and it's a small place! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant around 9:10 PM on Thursday. Upon entering, we were offered two seats; to either sit facing the entrance (which was too cold) or beside the entrance. We asked to sit near the cash, in which case the waiter thought about it for a bit, but let us. The menus and tea were given to us after we sat down.   We ordered a seafood congee and the beef stomach. The food came quite fast. I really enjoyed the seafood congee because of the many ingredients in it including scallops, shrimp, fish, squid, and crab sticks. The beef stomach came on a bed of lettuce. I have to say, they stewed the stomach quite well, however I found it to be a bit too salty.   Overall, the food and service here was good. It was my second time here and I am pleased with the friendly staff and service."}
{"text":"This place has always been my go to for quick easy Chinese food. Congee is great, often it is thick and flavorful. Soup noodles are recommended too, along with  side dishes to complete your meal. Really fast service, good price point and their food is decent!.  Always a busy place so don't be surprised if you have to wait or share a table with others!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service. Average tasting food. The dough fritter was super hard you need to chew with all you can when eating it. The congee and the fried rice was loaded though. Once of the decent places for Cantonese food in Mississauga for sure."}
{"text":"One of my fav Chinese food in Sauga. The congee is definitely good. Fish skin and soya sauce chicken are also my favorite. Price is excellent. Service is great"}
{"text":"Excellent food, authentic menu, fast lunch service, very affordable, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood big bowl congee, fried oysters and deep fried spicy tofu.  You can't go wrong with the congee!  It is a great value with a good amount of seafood.  The fried oysters were pretty good...crispy on the outside and tender inside.  The fried tofu could have been crispier.  I think I might try the combo's they have in the big menu next time such as their 3 item deal.  Their staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Good food and good prices, renovations make this place a good place to even hang around a bit longer.  Congee and noodles are all good."}
{"text":"Their chicken congee was not that special, but not that bad either. I will definitely come back here though!  I like the waitress who can both speak tagalog and mandarin"}
{"text":"Terrible food and typical service. Went there after read good reviews on yelp. Ordered their must have dishes: honey garlic oyster, chicken, curry beef brisket and beef noodle. The oyster and chicken were very disappointing, taste terrible. The curry lack of flavour and the noodle is so so. I don't quite understand why it is four stars and seems it is a very busy place while people are waiting to get in. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"My parents and I dropped in on a Saturday just before noon for a 1 hour quick lunch.  We were seated quickly and tea was served immediately.  This place does a brisk business, courteous staff are very prompt in taking our order and food prep/portion size/presentation was surprisingly very good.  I'm amazed that the menu prices seem to be a few dollars lower than at other Chinese restaurants.  We ordered the super seafood congee, dad wanted this beef brisket noodle soup, beef ho fun for me and mom settled on grouper with vegetables.  Look, this is my 3rd time here and 1st rating because each time the total experience was different.  So, I figured my rating here is totally based on large food selection, great (cash only) menu prices, quickest service (don't take it personally if staff don't social chit-chat with you) and very good food.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Loved the Shrimp Wonton, probably the best I have tasted yet. I don't usually order wonton, so I am glad I did. I had to wait 10 mins in line before being seated, but it was expected as I read the reviews before coming in. Very fast and surprisingly pleasant service for such a busy place. We ordered two cold Hong kong teas, one of which was made really sweet. It was a quick fix though, and I didnt let it ruin our first time experience. The crispy noodles we ordered however, was not that great, too soggy and not crispy at all. The cash only was another downside as we had to go to the TD accross the street to pull out some cash, but again, It was expected and I probably should have been prepared from the beginning. Overall though, good salmon congee, lobster, and wonton. A good place for authentic chinese food at a decent price."}
{"text":"I love their congee. I wish we them in florida, boy I'd be there all the time. Im sure be coming back in this place."}
{"text":"There comes a time when I get impressed by something other than the quality of the food, and that is the time at which the food is prepared. Oh my gosh I've been to this place 4 times and each time they serve their food in such a fast and efficient manner! I kid you not, they prepare the food in 5 mins!  In addition to the efficiency of their serving times, their food is really decent for the Mississauga area, making this one of my favourite go to places if I'm really hungry and want some fast food!"}
{"text":"Congee is the perfect hangover food! I was craving congee so badly and Chi's definitely satisfied my cravings. My absolute favourite congee since i was a kid is the ?????, i think in english is something like preserved duck egg and meat congee? The only thing i hated was that the meat in the congee was too salty for me. But for my friend she didn't care that much, so it was just my personal taste. Other than that the food was absolutely amazing. I also want to mention that if you go during prime times you're going to have to wait a bit for a table. We went around 7:30 and we shared a big table with a family, and afterwards there were many people waiting in line. Overall i definitely recommend everyone to come try this place!"}
{"text":"We chose to try out this restaurant out of so many other comparable eateries in the plaza as it had a pretty attractive Yelp rating.  However, I'd say we were left a bit disappointed as it was just mediocre.  The seafood congee did not have as much seafood bits in it, lacking in the typical share of shrimp and scallops that you are characteristic of the name.  Fried turnips looked and tasted a bit too charred fortune liking, although still quite good.  The wonton noodle soup only had about 3-4 wontons and our soup was quite 'dry.'  Chinese donut looked a bit stale too.  Overall, I think we were a bit let down because of the higher expectations driven by Yelp reviews.    Service was quite slow too.  We were seated in a small table by the entrance and I guess we were a bit out of view because it took so long to flag someone down to take our order.  That being said, the food came out quickly.  Staff appeared friendly...although everyone spoke Cantonese and we did not understand a word!"}
{"text":"A continually busy restaurant can only attest to its quality. Food arrives quickly, tasty, and hot. A Cash only business.  The chopsticks need a really good scrubbing because there's a gummy film covering them."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch on the weekend.  Service is friendly and the congee is fantastic!  Generous portions and nice crispy donut to go with the congee.  This time we ordered Cantonese chow mein, garoupa and creamed corn on rice, abalone and chicken congee, and shrimp and egg on rice.   Huge portions!!! Alot of rice and a generous serving of the main.  Noodles a bit greasy as was the garoupa dish.  Wasn't expecting it to be battered fried fish.  Congee good as always.... Where else can 4 dine for $40???"}
{"text":"I'm craving for congee and tried this place for first time. All food we tried is very good. Young chow fried rice, beef brisket, congee with pork and preserved egg, fried dough and fried lobsters. Service is excellent too. Will surely come back to try other food."}

{"text":"Chi's Congee & Noodle House is a standard Cantonese restaurant that serves rice, noodles, congee, stir-fried dishes, soups, and the like.  It's located in the busy and popular Golden Square Centre in Mississauga.  We were here at 1 p.m. and the place was bustling and very busy!  We were able to take a five-seater that fit us perfectly as the original table that was meant for us was overtaken by a larger party.  After this, there were a lot of people waiting for a table too.  Good thing we came in time otherwise we would have had to wait for who knows when to get seated.  We ordered a variety of dishes like 'boat congee' (???) -- my always preferred type of congee; crispy fried noodles with pork and bean sprouts; stir-fried satay rice noodles and beef; and fried dumplings.  All of the the food was really good!  I think the kitchen had enough \"wok hay\" so that everything was tasty and satisfying.  It was comfort food.  The portions were great.  I especially liked the fried dumplings too."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the most authentic Chinese restaurants I have ever been to. What makes it so authentic was the fact that there was no \"Sesame, Orange or Honey Chicken\" on the menu which is a make or break for some people, but for me, it just reassured me that I had come to the right place! Very casual atmosphere and surprisingly extremely friendly staff (as this is sometimes difficult to find at a Chinese restaurant). Definitely will be back here on my next trip to Canada!"}
{"text":"Great congee place!!! .  Has been around for ages!  When congee dynasty first opened i had a feeling they waved their hands and said \"psh no probs, we got this boys\".  Now that congee dynasty went out of business, this place is always packed. It was busy before but now its lines and lines.   Can't expect service to be amazing here though since it's always rush rush rush.   Food 5/5 Service 4/5 Price 5/5"}
{"text":"Love the service!!! Fast, friendly, great food. We go there for quick congee lunches or large family dinners."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and service is really quick. At most, you'll wait 10 minutes from time of ordering to time of arrival on your table.  Must try: any of their congee and curry fish rice.  I like going here at least once a month."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I've been to.  Good job, you arrived! But too bad there is no tables left. Sorry, we don't have seats for you to sit while waiting, so I guess you're going to have to stand at the doorway with a million people while holding a number. Someone who had a number after us was served before us because we had 4 people and the seat was for 5 people. Okay, so you're now seated. And after a minute or two, a waitress asks you are you ready to order? What does she think we are, some sort of magician, after glancing at everything once, you'd be expected to know what to order!?! If you pronounced the name of the food wrong, don't worry, they have people laughing at your mistake while they correct you, how kind! The food was okay, I would recommend the Supreme Seafood congee, but probably never would come to this place again..."}
{"text":"This restaurant takes the award for best value out there. If you're traveling with a group, you will not find a way to feed a large group for less than here.  I was surprised to see a full suburban Chinatown right in Mississauga but I came for the Congee & Noodle House and found that it was not just a standalone operation but rather the star in a strip mall of Chinese cuisines.  The two of us were seated at a table for 8 because the restaurant only seems to cater to large groups. That theme seemed to run throughout. We each ordered a soup, shared a plate of vegetable rolls and each picked an entree. Our server looked at us and asked if we were absolutely sure that we needed that much food. We were pretty hungry after being out all day and, based on the prices, I figured splitting an entree would leave us hungry.  Our food began to arrive and soon looked like a the scene in European Vacation where they just keep bringing more and more dishes to Audrey. 2 people at an 8-top filled with food from edge to edge. I began to fully understand her earlier warning but it was now too late to back out. For $27, we received enough food to eat for 2 full days. All of it was top quality which is no doubt why this place is always full."}
{"text":"With all the restaurants situated at this particular plaza, it's easy to overlook Chi's. But after reading the reviews here, I decided to check it out, and I'm very glad I did. If you want no-nonsense, inexpensive yet authentic Chinese fare, this is the place to go. It's just as good as Chinese food you would find in Markham or Scarborough, with comparable prices. I commonly order their beef chow mein, chicken and corn congee, and a side order of chinese fried donuts (don't forget to ask for sugar to dip these in, of course!). For two people, it's easy to stay under $23, based on the inexpensive pricing of their menu. Overall, they have a wide variety of congees and dishes to choose from, service is friendly, and the food is delicious. My only qualm would be the lineups that you often find here on Friday and weekend evenings, but other than that, I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went back here and ordered takeout. Had the spicy squid, duck congee, lemongrass and basil chicken and their fried vermicelli with shredded duck.  Without the pushy waitress and eating in the comfort of my own home, I was able to enjoy the food more vs the last time I ate here.  The spicy squid had spicy salt and was crispy on the outside and very soft on the inside.  However, it lacked the onions and chilli that usually comes with the dish.  The congee was a bit watery, but it had a lot of the condiments so it was ok.  The lemongrass chicken was subtle and tasty and the vermicelli was great! Loved it mixed with hot oil and ginger and scallion.  Quick turnaround for takeout.  I wish they had a takeout special like extra 10% off if you spend twenty five dollars or more.  Note that if you do takeout, you don't get the option of ordering the shrimp for six bucks or the lobster for twelve bucks."}
{"text":"I usually go to Chiu Chow Man next door but decided to try out this place because I've heard so much about it.   Service: this is the main factor for the 5 star rating. The service here was great. The waiters were diligent, nice and prompt.   Food: so savoury and the hot and sour soup is delicious (not too sweet or sour lol). We ordered the garlic lobster, chicken chow mein, chicken hot pot, flat rice noodle with beef and black bean sauce and turnip dish. All were so great tasting!   The only con was that we got seated close to the door so it was very cold with the door opening and closing. It's also quite cramped at the front so with the waiters trying to bring food in and people trying to walk by, it got a little congested.   I'm going to start coming here now for some tasty Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Super yummy; nice large portions of congee of various flavors. The wonton noodles could use a bit of work, as they're weren't as chewy as I'm used to. The Singapore rice noodle was amazing; just the proper amt. of spiciness. A great place for small Cantonese eats."}
{"text":"I come here once in a while for Chinese food. Cheap and yummy, very big portion for the price. I love their fukien fried rice, yummy!! It can get pretty busy during dinner time."}
{"text":"I always get the Chicken congee. Sooooooo goood. Great and fast service! It is also cheap for the amount you get."}
{"text":"My favorite congee restaurant to visit in Mississauga.   I always get their super large congee seafood bowl to share. Comes packed with all sorts of seafood for a really amazing price.  I've tried various other dishes as well and they never disappoint.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Definitely Chinese comfort food. We stayed by the best western by Toronto airport and had a craving for congee at 9pm in a Friday night and came to this place with a group of 12 which included six kids/teens. They only have one large table which was occupied by another group but got us seated quickly at a medium size table with a bit of a squeeze. The pork and preserved egg (thousand year old egg) congee are on point and portions are really large. The fish with corn in egg sauce hit the spot right on also as well. I saw a lot of people ordering the pan fried turnip dish. They open until 11pm and 10:15pm is approximately when they are willing to take the last seating. The staff is attentive and helpful and this establishment has won me over. Btw, there was a restaurant next door at the corner that served seafood, but no where as popular in comparison to this place, hence we opted for this spot. Who knew that many people loved congee during the late supper hour."}
{"text":"I wish I can give 3.5 stars, but since I cannot, I rounded up to 4.  The Summary:  Good:  Reasonable price, Large portions, food comes out fast, CERTAIN dishes are very tasty, such as the seafood congee and beef chowfun, open late, friendly owner.  Bad:  Cash only, Dishes outside the Southern China such as Mabo Tofu are not good (it tasted like dog food, and I paid $14 cash that included tax and tip), dirty in appearance, be prepared to step into the washroom.  Verdict:  B-  This place is worth checking out especially if you are craving for good congee, especially when the weather is cold.  Don't dare order northern dishes, or anything outside of Southern China.  Remember to bring cash.   Lunch time specials include a drink, which is a big plus.  People who work here are pretty nice."}
{"text":"Dope service Nice environment Food is decent, same as every other congee place"}
{"text":"There are soooo many congee and ho fan (flat noodles) brisket wonton soup places in Mississauga. So what makes this one stand out:  Decor It's refreshing to go into a Chinese restaurant where there's no plastic table cloths and brightly colored or plain white walls. Not that I complain when I'm eating delicious and flavorful noodles soup, but if for the same price I can also enjoy the simple but modern decor, I wouldn't mind.   The restaurant was on the top 5 list for best noodles in Mississauga, so I ordered a beef brisket and wonton ho fan. They had a really good chili oil available on the table and paired with the noodle made a spicy delicious mess! The beef brisket wasn't too fatty and the wonton had good chunks of shrimps in it, but the wonton wrapper was too hard that i started just eating the shrimp and putting the wrappers on the side.   Also tried the beef brisket curry on rice, here the brisket was way too fatty (i had to spit out chunks), but the curry sauce was really good. Flavorful but not just plain spicy and not overly salty. Their 100 year old egg and pork porridge was also very good.   The service was also hit and miss, they had a cute little boy serving for a while which is entertaining but also made us uncomfortable to ask him for tea. The server was also unavailable for some periods of time.   Overall I would definitely go back if I was in the area, but I really prefer Macey's down the street for their large but soft wontons and 1 server per 4-5 tables ratio!"}
{"text":"Good late night chinese food place. Ever since congee dynasty closed down, this is a favorite spot to get some congee. I recommend you try any of their large congee bowls with dough fritter whenever you're out with a group."}
{"text":"I checked this place out after reading reviews that it had the best authentic Chinese food in Mississauga. While Mississauga isn't Markham or Scarborough, it is still home to a large population of Chinese people and there are quite a few Chinese restaurants in the city.   Upon walking in for the first time, I was greeted by the wait staff, most of whom appeared to be Filipino. I told them that I was recommended to try the place out and they gave me a bunch of recommendations. My party of 3 ended up ordering the Seafood Congee (you gotta try this), donuts, fried dumplings, and chow mein.   While everything was worth going back for (my family actually ordered a tray of the fried dumplings a week later for a party), the standout out of our order was the seafood congee. It contained quite a lot of seafood for the price ($7), with many large pieces of salmon. Definitely a great value there.   The food at Chi's is definitely up to par with the high standards set by the other reviewers. I've been there three times now and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Chi's has a very extensive menu and prices are very reasonable (bring cash as they don't accept credit cards). The food comes out piping hot and service is great. The place is packed which is a good sign. The ambiance is not great, looks like it was some other type of restaurant in the past and they just took it over. No problem, we came for the food. It was hardy, tasty but a bit rough around the edges but well worth it. Would highly recommend. Great congee by the way."}
{"text":"Open till 11 so it says but don't walk in at 10:13.  Had 5 minutes to order because we were told kitchen closes at 10:30.  Food was rushed and rather bland.  I was served wrong item and never came back to check on us. Mopped with bleach water right under our feet. Not sure why such rave reviews especially when there is 50 other Asian restaurants in Mississauga"}
{"text":"Not sure where people are getting their positive reviews from. I went to this restaurant because of them. What a disappointment. The place was freezing and the food was poor quality. The service was good though."}
{"text":"I love this place because I can order anything off of their menu and like it! I got addicted to it at some point and had to stop because ... well, home girl got fat. LOL  Its a fairly good size restaurant and they are always packed with customers! Try it out when your near the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! My family and I have been going here many years and still do! The lobster, congee, fried rice, etc. are amazing! Probably the best Chinese restaurant I've been to. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Comes to chi's congee very often. I like their tasty congee and all different types noodles. Their special chicken is delicious too. The servers are able to recognize customers and well, they remember me haha."}
{"text":"This place saved my sanity during my 3+ year hiatus in the west. It was my go-to place for Chinese food whenever I had cravings. This place is an institution in the west and they deserve to be so.  Most of the stuff here taste fresh and great for the most part. You are not going to blown away by anything out of the ordinary but you won't be disappointed either. As far as for the west, you probably won't find too many places that serve Chinese food better than this place.  So there you have it. Fast, fresh and yummy. Get your Chinese fix here if you can't make it into the city."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for many years and the food is always excellent. The kitchen is fast.  Many choices available but some of our favourites are turnip cake, seafood congee, snow pea tips, and the hot/sour soup. The only drawback is that this place is always super busy and you may have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Been coming here for more than two years.  I walk in the door, they know exactly  what I want.  Best hot and sour soup outside of Toronto.  Plus I have weird thing for Shrimp and Egg on rice ... they do it perfectly.  Amazing service and speed of delivery."}
{"text":"I regularly order here for takeout and it is always great.   My favorite is the Pork and Preserved Egg Congee. Tastes great every time and even the small portion is ALOT!   Also the Spicy Turnip Patties are a must! So good!  Service is always great. They are always friendly.   Cash only but there's a TD bank across the parking lot."}
{"text":"For the price? Can't beat this place!!!  Food is always good tasting, service is fast and prompt and friendly. Genuine Chinese food dishes!!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty fast service and the food was good. I got the Supreme Congee which had lots of meat for $12 but added extra egg for $1. Parking is easy during lunchtime on weekdays with ample space. The place is relatively clean and seating is comfortable. I've also had the Yin and Yang rice at another time. I don't recommend getting the dish. Phoenix makes this way better. Unless you like bland overly sauced food. I would come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I love going there. The food is very affordable and the portion is a good size. The taste is authentic chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"We were brought here by a family friend who frequents this restaurant regularly. It's a small hole-in-the-wall but super friendly staff (probably cuz our family friend is a regular). The hubs and I were impressed by the prices of the food and by the portion sizes! Good deals and good eats!   We got some classic dishes: Beef Chow Fun Young Zhou Fried Rice Pea Shots (YUM!) Pork & Preserved Egg Congee (very thick)  Overall a solid restaurant with lots of leftovers!"}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner at Chi's 10 minutes ago so I'm writing this with my tummy full.  HOW AND WHY did I not discover this place earlier?! I frequent Arirang, the Korean all you can eat barbecue restaurant just around the corner, quite often for lunch. It never even crossed my mind to spread the love to the abundance of other restaurants in the same plaza!  Thankfully, I was craving some congee and upon searching \"Mississauga's Best Congee\" into Google, Chi's popped up. I was pleasantly surprised when I entered the restaurant, because it was nice and clean AND fully packed, which was a good sign. We ordered: Rice Noodles with Black Bean Sauce (not the best I've had but nevertheless, still tasty af), Steamed Shrimp Dumplings (reaaaallly yummy and came with wonton broth, which was equally as good), Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce (standard veggies, steamed) and finally, the Seafood Congee (earned the MVP award). Yo I'm gonna be real, I'm not a Congee connoisseur but... the one I had from Chi's was the best I've ever tasted.   Additionally, despite the language barrier, service was quick and the servers were all very nice! BUT remember - CASH ONLY so bring those dolla dolla billlllz"}
{"text":"Chi's Congee House is a good place to go if you're ever graving for quality congee! Probably the only other place I know of in Mississauga that specializes in congee, they do offer a variety of other foods that I can recommend to try that you may not find in other restaurants necessarily (ie. their deep fried wontons are awesome!).  If there was a 3.5 rating, I would give it around so just because there are other Chinese restaurants around that can compete with this one. So all in all, I would say it depends on your cravings at the time."}
{"text":"Great restaurant if you're looking to get some congee in the Mississauga region, but I would personally stop by only for the congee, as their other dishes aren't very good.   I came here for lunch on a normal workday and I noticed the place is pretty packed, so I figured the restaurant can't be too bad. I ordered the ??? congee with a ?? (deep fried dough wrapped in rice noodle). The congee was delicious: the rice was well cooked to soft texture, the toppings were plentiful (fried pork skin, minced peking duck skin, peanuts), and the flavour was good too. The deep fried dough wasn't that good though. First of all it was ready cold when they served it too me, and I could tell it wasn't fresh because the dough was too firm and too chewy. My fried ordered stir fried rice noodle and the dish was super oily and no flavour with barely any meat in it. Both dishes came with a complementary drink such as coffee, milk tea, or lemon tea.  So yeah, just get the congee, don't bother with getting anything else."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the reasons why i'm an active member on Yelp and continue to use it as a reference.  It's not on the way for me, is approximately 20 minutes away from my hotel, but definitely worth the trip.  I live in New York city where Chinese food is abundant and tasty.  This restaurant could be transplanted there and would do VERY WELL amidst the competition.  I'm just sad there aren't more restaurants like it.  Food is heavy on the congee and noodles as the name suggests, but there are also appetizers and hong kong style drinks.  Staff seem to speak both english, cantonese and mandarin fluently,  Attentive service without being overbearing.  Very substantial portions and then some.  Depending on what you order, you could probably average  less than $10/person.  Appetizer, drink, tea and one huge bowl of congee (which ccould realistically feed 2 to 3 people) ran me approximately $15."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for dinner and we were blown away by the quality of the food. It's not just really delicious, it's fresh and there's a lot of it. We got the chicken congee, fried chicken wings, fried shrimp, shrimp dumplings, and spicy pork. I can't find anything to complain about any of the dishes. It's a little hole in the wall place with friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere and I'm sure I'll be coming back here time and time again."}
{"text":"This place is packed on weekends and ambience isn't the best, but food is fantastic!!!! (And honestly, what Chinese restaurant really has amazing decor and ambience...)   Great: plain and fish congee, fried doughnut and rice paper covered fried doughnut with dipping sauces.  Good: fried egg noodles with bean sprouts and pork.    The food is consistently hot and fresh and tastes authentic. The servings are generous and service is fast. Many of the staff have limited English abilities."}
{"text":"I've had better Chinese food but what keeps bringing us back is the awesome service!!!  Their greens are fresh & they do the snow pea leaves well. Sometimes they'll have their off days where the food is too salty or too bland. But no matter what, the servers are consistently nice & pleasant.  Nice cheap food, great service...what more can you ask for? Oh and the renovated a while ago so it looks more homely.    Usually my baby doesn't need a diaper change while we're out but one visit he was about to poop so I took him to the washroom to do his business.  They don't have a change table or counter space so this place isn't too good for infants needing a diaper change."}
{"text":"Back in the college days, this place was my favorite. After 10 years, it still is. If you are in Mississauga and can't decide where to eat, come to this restaurant. I think this is the best place in Mississauga for decent price food. Some people might say their price is expensive compare to Scarborough, but here is Mississauga with no competitors...  Remember Cash Only here...."}
{"text":"Every time I tell my friends about this place, they stay a regular.   Best grouper and corn, fried dumplings, and congee I've had in Mississauga. The congee is always loaded; my personal favourite is the chicken and duck. The Fujein fried rice, with a five-spice gravy and meat and seafood overtop, is another great comfort food worth going for.  The staff knows their regulars and their regulars know their staff.   Their minor renovation within the past 5 years was a well-needed facelift that made the place as warm as their food and staff.   It is cash only, and busy on weekend dinners. Their weekday lunch special is worth speeding over for a quick bite! Great prices and the addition of a milk tea makes for a good stop.   Tip well, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My family has been dining here for almost the past decade and we keep coming back since the food is consistently good! There are endless choices for even the pickiest eater and anyone that we bring here loves this place! I've tried the seafood congee here, fried tofu, eggplant with minced pork, chow mein, grouper with veggies, young chow fried rice, salt and pepper squid, hot and sour soup, bok choy with garlic, and general tao chicken to name a few. I don't think I remember having anything that didn't taste good here.   The prices are reasonable for good Asian comfort food in this casual and small restaurant. It's always busy and full of regulars but somehow the wait time has never been more than 10 minutes. Friendly service as well here. Parking can be a bit of crazy depending on the time you come since this area is always packed. Despite how hectic this place can get, definitely give it a try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"While the food was good the service was bad.  We ordered the lemon grass chicken, it was pretty good.  I have read from previous reviews that non Asians are treated a bit 'differently'. They made us sit at the centre communal table shared by another non Asian family. Could be just a coincidence.  They only accept cash and literally force a tip which I found upsetting.   I also found them expensive. We spent $52 for a dimsum, soup and 2 mains.   Don't think I will go again.   Dinesh."}
{"text":"Tip:  CASH ONLY.  If you're in a bind, there's a TD across the lot!  Cheap, quick, HUGE portions, decent food, and efficient service.  What more can you ask for in a meal??  Consistent?  It's that too!  I usually come here when I don't want feel like cooking &/or want something fast...without feeling as if you ate out.  Blech.    If you order something small for yourself, you can definitely spend less than $10 for your meal, re:  any of the noodles in soup, a bowl of congee, a doughnut stick, etc.  Lunch specials come with an HK milk tea, but the special only runs during the weekdays.  :(  You can't really tell from the exterior of Chi's, located at the unofficial Chinatown of Mississauga, but this is a pretty popular joint in the city!  ALWAYS busy, but I don't think I've ever waited too long for a table.    As per the other reviewers, the staff is multi-lingual, speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, and I believe 1 staffer speaks Tagalog, making this a go-to for many Filipinos as well.  Tip:  If it's busy, you may be asked to share a large table with another party."}
{"text":"If i can give 0 star I would.  The food was very greasy, lots of msg, pricey for what they are.  We ordered a chick duck congee and i saw no duck meat only skin.  Also ordered rice noodles with beef and it has to be the most tasteless and chewy beef i have ever encountered in ho fun, and there was equal amounts of bean sprouts and rice noodle? Which is far too much bean sprouts.  Overall, a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"This was my third visit and probably my first review. We were a party of 4- 3 Chinese and 1 Caucasian.  We ordered lobster with onion and ginger for around $20, (reasonable and decent price) and fried beef with rice noodle ( decent serving size, but anemic looking), pan fried pea pod sprouts (good) and fried pork chop with sweet and sour sauce (also good). We arrived around 6 pm because I know that any later and we would be waiting awhile for a table. While the food was good, the service sucked.   The waitress was surly and had an attitude.  We had to ask 4 times for steamed rice, and I'm not talking about a refill.  We had to ask for more hot water for our tea carafe and no extra napkins were offered (since we had the lobster, which can be messy).  Other tables were given sliced oranges after the meal, but we weren't.  I would still recommend this place if you aren't fussy about the service or below average cleanliness (sadly, typical in a lot of Chinese restaurants), but be sure to bring cash because that's all they accept"}
{"text":"We were looking for vegan options in the area after our bikram yoga session and chi's noodle house hit the spot perfectly. They provide plenty of vegan options for my friend. The congee was as expected, the dough fritters were fresh and my friend loved the turnip cakes minus the one hair we found. Instead of returning the dish... we jus placed the turnip onto another dish. I got the eggplant with mince pork with spicy sauce on top of crispy noodles.... the dish was slightly too gingerly for my taste. The eggplant were nice in color and yummy. I wouldnt order this particular eggplant dish again, however all of my friends who have gotten take out from here enjoyed it n the place was completely full wit the majority of the crowd being chinese. The service was quick n the servers were good."}
{"text":"I would like to give it 4 stars as the food and service was great. However the environment was so hot that we couldn't fully enjoy the the food. They should turn up the AC especially on a hot day like today. Otherwise if you would like authentic HK style food like congee and noodles, it is not a bad place to visit."}
{"text":"Came across this place on YELP and was craving some authentic Chinese food and was our patience well rewarded! We called ahead to book for 7 and even though we arrived 20 minutes earlier we were promptly seated as soon as we mentioned our name! Our Server Cheryl was amazing and was very helpful in her suggestions.  We settled for the fixed dinner for 8 for $88 and what a treat that was!  The feast consisted of: Crab meat with Fish Maw Stir Fried Two Lobsters W/ Ginger & Scallion Chicken with Spicy Sauce Stir fried Garoupa with vegetables Stir fried special pork with black bean source Deep fried Shrimp Balls w/sweet and sour sauce Deep fried fish W/Soya Sauce Snow peas tips w/garlic sauce White Rice (extra charge!) the only slight negative! The flavors were spot on and the entire meal was enjoyed by all, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Came by for dinner the other day and it was mediocre at best. Ordered the beef brisket wonton rice noodle soup which was lackluster. Beef brisket was fatty, although some parts were overcooked and too salty... The wontons were okay although they didn't taste super fresh...  The rice noodles were also mediocre as again, they didn't seem super fresh...  The broth was surprisingly decent...  $10 /person including tax and gratuity.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Wow.  Just wow.   For a cash-only, casual inexpensive place to have this level of quality and service is unbelievable, in a very good way of course. The food is really amazing.  They have a lobster congee that is so fresh that you can still taste the ocean in the lobster meat. Just lovely. So is their snow pea tips. We also ordered a shrimp and pork noodle dish that was delicious.    Service was super friendly - they speak english, and are quick and efficient in their responses. You don't seem to have to make eye contact more than once, and they'll be at your table right away.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My second visit to Chi's did not disappoint! We had chicken and duck congee, fried doughs, pork chop noodle soup, and a dish containing pieces of fried tofu with fish in it. This place has amazing food, and waitresses are efficient and friendly. I'm giving this restaurant five stars this time, because I noticed the waitresses can actually speak good English to tailor to non-Cantonese/non-Mandarin speaking customers. In addition, I was impressed with how good the food tasted even though I got the same dishes that I've had before. Yay for consistently tasty dishes! I can't wait to try different dishes next time I visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"This placed used to be great value; good tasting food, low price and friendly staff.  Recently food taste is mediocre, staff is rude and price has gone up. A couple of years ago, I would have given them  3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have come here several times to eat in and take out. They are quick and inexpensive. I often order their corn and bean curd congee, the dough fritters and turnip patties. It always hits the spot! The service is good, but it can be challenging to ask for modifications to meals if you have any allergies or food restrictions.   Tip: Its cash only!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Chi's Congee & Noodle House for many years. We keep coming back because the quality is always the same. Dishes come out piping hot and very quickly after ordering. Service is efficient and friendly.  My only complaint is that they only accept cash for payment. It's inconvenient in a time where most people don't even carry cash. However, that's a minor problem.  We've ordered many dishes from the menu, but one of our favourites is the hot and sour soup which is packed with mushrooms, soft tofu, pork strips, bamboo shoots and black fungus.  Another favourite is the fried turnip/radish cake. We've had this at many dim sum places over the years, and Chi's is definitely the best. It's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and they make it spicy (adding chopped chillies) at our request.  Our son's favourite thing here is their Singapore fried vermicelli. Again, it's something we've had at countless restaurants, but he claims theirs is much better than most. It has plenty of bbq pork, egg and shrimp in it and is just the right amount of spicy and salty.  Our favourite vegetable dish is the snowpea tips sauteed with extra garlic (ask for it). They arrive piping hot and have a nice amount of salt and aren't watery or oily. Delicious!  When it comes to congee, the ground pork congee and scallop congee are two of our favourites. They are just the right texture and have plenty of protein added.  I could go on all day about the delicious dishes. We haven't had anything here that we haven't enjoyed.  The bathrooms leave a little to be desired, but that's often the case at the more authentic Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"We decided to stop off at this place on our way to the US border making it our last meal in Canada. Originally, daughter was going to order the Chiu Chow Fish Slice Congee but the waitress said it was rice in soup. The daughter decided to switch over to Congee With Fish Slices instead. She liked it a lot especially with a side of hot dough fritters. The fritters were hot off the fryer and was delicious! Hubs ordered the Taiwan Rice Noodle With Shrimp  And Duck. He thought it was ok but I thought it was bland. I ordered Sliced Beef With Raw Egg Over Rice. It was delicious. The beef was nice and soft and egg was nice and runny. It wasn't raw as advertised. Service was ok. It wasn't as friendly as the other restaurants I've been to but it was ok. Been wanting to try this place for a while and glad I did!"}
{"text":"The staff was rude, and slow.  The food we ordered was salty.  I do NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came back to Chi's Congee for some hot Chinese comfort food.  Plus my boyfriend was craving the fried noodles and I've only gotten him the Cantonese chow mein (which he says is like a uncooked ramen).  The parking lot here is hostile asf plus a huge supermarket.  There's so many different restaurants and very limited parking.    Walking in we had a table right away but it was close to the door.  Turn over time seems okay as the food is served quickly after you order.  I got the beef congee with fried doughsticks. - The beef congee is massive.  They don't over charge you like Congee Queen.  It's around $6.  I had left overs as well!  The doughsticks were okay but I wish they gave me more! Loved it.  My boyfriend got the beef fried noodles + vegetables - He loved it.  He's like: finally after a year you got me proper noodles I can eat.  Haha. - The noodles were too oily for me but perfect for him. - There was enough beef that kept him happy. - The veggies were grinded but he said it was okay.  I loved the service. They have 2 or 3 servers that spook sufficient English.  Service was efficient and thoughtful without hovering.  Will be back this weekend!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that is cheap, good and fast? This is it!   Their food is amazing and you can ask for no MSG! All made to order and arrive at your table steaming hot! Servers are also very polite.   This place might be faster than most fast food restaurant! Give it a try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is on the salty side, but good for cheap, Chinese comfort food. Came here with my boyfriend for Sunday lunch. Was very busy. We ordered the pork and preserved egg congee. Delicious! A little on the salty side but very cheap for the portion size.  Much order the deep fried shrimp dumplings! Also had the deep fried pork chop. This restaurant had more of a curry flavour than others and salty."}
{"text":"Our go to place for Congee - excellent selection and prices. Our favourite items are the seafood supreme bowl, basil chicken, deep fried pork chop, beef ho fan dry noodles and their crispy fish skin. Cash only."}
{"text":"was really busy when my family and i arrived, so i figured that was a sign that it was good :) we made a reservation since there were 7 of us, so we were seated right away. got one of the pre-arranged dinners (they have dinner for 2, 8, 10, etc.) since it was our first time there, so wanted to try a variety of things. very good food! service was just okay, and we ordered some extra stuff, but never got it, which are the reasons why i'm not giving 5 stars. busy plaza, but not too bad to find parking."}
{"text":"Excellent, loud authentic Chinese restaurant experience. Friendly service, good prices and very good food, too. It's a little"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chi's for years. I always get the bean sprouts fried noodle with beef. Service is great, order comes right away and the food is always tasty and hot (not to mention great prices!). If you go on a weekday, lunch specials are $7.40 and includes a hot drink. See pictures of beef noodle and yeung chow fried rice (lots of shrimp and BBQ pork). One of the best in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"For the past few years, I've been a frequent customer at the restaurant. However, I've been coming here less often for the past few months ever since the quality of the dishes deteriorated. I always order the lunch special beef ho fun but it is no longer a special since the portion size has halved! They also lack consistency in their other dishes as the portion sizes for the chu hou beef brisket is halved 50% of the time. Furthermore, their plates, utensils, and tables aren't very clean. Sadly, this will be my last time since I can't see anything worth coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Finally yet another Mississauga Chinese restaurant to bounce between the ones I already frequent. The servers already recognize us and address us by name when we walk in which is not typical in a Chinese restaurant... The food is very tasty unlike some other cantonese restaurants in the area.   Great food and great service!  What more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"If you're craving for a congee then come here. They do varieties of congee seafood, mixed pork, clam, beef etc. try their oysters, won't let you down 14.99"}
{"text":"Probably the best congee house we've ever been to. Good comes out quick but the quality is still there. Amazing food every time. Wish we lived closer to eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good price.  Not much else you can ask for.  Authentic fast Chinese food."}
{"text":"My friends, I am a regular at this joint. This is the safe bet, the \"I'm hungry, what do you want? I don't know, let's go here\" place, the \"I've been on vacation for a while, I'm craving something\" place,... okay I'll stop.  Anyways, this place is just fantastic for the value, the deliciousness, the friendliness and the convenience.   Pros: - service is always good: multilingual (Tagalog, Cantonese/Mandarin, English); the waitresses are always very friendly, polite and fast - food is always GOOD - it's not mind-blowing mind you, but it's such a consistent \"hit\", that it's GOOD.  - prices: cheap and very reasonable for what you get  Cons:  - decor: they recently renovated this place, and it's cute because they're Chinese and Chinese restaurants are never known for their fantastic interior decoration. This is true for Chi's as well, even post-renovation. Things are a bit eclectic and out of place, but A for effort! - it gets busy! But customer turn-over is fast, so you won't have to wait long for seats; and if you're comfortable with it, you can always \"dap toy\" meaning that you join strangers at a larger table  Overall, my favourite Chinese noodle/rice restaurant in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Love this place and I've been going here for years.. Everything here is just your same old typical Chinese restaurant, but they're always consistently really good.. I usually order the same thing all the time (seafood congee, Yeung chow fried rice, Cantonese chow mein, deep fried spicy squid and beef ho fun) and I have never been disappointed.. It's not mind boggling amazing food, but it's always cooked right, with good ingredients and I have always been satisfied... The wait staff is better than some Chinese restaurants I've been to..  It to sure why some people have issues with them.. But as long as you're polite to them, they'll always be nice to you  Ps. I'm not sure why people complain about soggy noodles... Of course they're going to be soggy... It's covered in a wet sauce.. I'm sure some parts of it are still crispy and it's probably the parts not covered in sauce"}
{"text":"I want to update my review to say that this place is still awesome. In light of some of the more recent negative ones I just wanted to reiterate that. The chicken and duck congee is the best in town. The lai wan style Congee is also pretty good. We've also tried their Young Chow fried rice, Singapore noodles,  and. Cantonese fried noodles.  All are delicious. My favourites are still the chicken and duck Congee  and the pork chop noodles. Best of all this place is so cheap. The service is very efficient if a bit curt. I wouldn't say the service is rude though."}
{"text":"O.M.G! This is comfort food! Their congee is amazing and really cheap! I love the seafood special, and I absolutely love the fried donut they give to go with the congee. If they do not give it to you, order it! It's worth it! Besides the congee, we have also tried the seafood, garlic fried rice and we really liked that too! CASH ONLY! Parking can be hard...but you eventually get it. The portions are humongous, still we order individual ones because we love to bring home the left overs! Highly recommend this place!   When it's busy, you may have to share tables, but this is not a minus. I love the community dining experience. Their ambiance is casual and cozy. And their restrooms are clean, that's always a plus!"}
{"text":"I always come here with family for cheap and authentic food. The lunch specials cant be beat and they also come with a drink (not the biggest drink portion). The actual food portions are great! The only thing is they get pretty busy on the weekends and if you come in the afternoon with a small party, you'll likely need to share a table. Service is fast and after their renovations, everything looks much nicer and a tad more modern.   I would recommend."}
{"text":"Our family comes here whenever we want to have a casual Chinese dinner with a friendly atmosphere.  All the waiters and waitresses are so friendly here which is uncommon for a Chinese resto.  Lol.  I say this only because they are always rushing around and focused on just getting the food out and not with the friendly customer service that you typically should see at restaurants.  This is not the case for this Chinese restaurant though.  The minute you walk in, they yell out a welcome to you.  That's also because we have become such regulars here.    They are super fast with bringing out the food.  We even have to tell them to slow down!  Lol.  The minute the order goes in, even if it's a 6 course dinner, the food arrives on the table in less than 5 minutes, especially the soup.  Very tasty food and average price for 6 dishes is around $60.  They have excellent family combo dinners which you can choose from.  They all include a soup.    Definitely recommend this place for family dinners.  Huge selection and very tasty food indeed!"}
{"text":"What restaurant in 2017 doesn't have debit or credit available? I don't care how decent the food is, I don't like paying $3 at the ATM next door and I don't have confidence the tax I paid on my bill isn't going directly in their pockets instead of the gov"}
