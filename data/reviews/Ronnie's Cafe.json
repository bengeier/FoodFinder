{"text":"We have been semi-regulars of Ronnie's for a few years. The food is consistently very good, the portions are huge, and the servers are all extremely nice and very attentive. It's not fancy or gourmet, but it's seasoned well and tastes good. My bf always gets the steak & eggs special and for the price, it's always very good (potential for chewy cheap steak, but it's not). The only criticism I can give is that since they expanded the dining room last year, the kitchen sometimes gets backed up when they are swamped (more seats but no extra kitchen = slower food) so you will sometimes wait a little longer for your food. We always have some type of special request on our order (extra cheese or sauce, no sausage, etc) and they always get it right.   I definitely recommend Ronnie's, and have sent many friends there, but if you've never been there before, you may want to go on a week day when they aren't so swamped. But... the place is swamped for a reason."}
{"text":"Awesome spot, prices are crazy good, and waitress was so friendly!  $4.75 breakfast is an awesome value, pancakes are huge. $6.99 steak and eggs is crazy good! First time visiting AZ and first time using Yelp, we will be back to this dinner."}
{"text":"Went for an early morning/late night breakfast with the hubby. The atmosphere was lovely, the patrons seemed happy and the wait staff was great. My coffee was never empty! I ordered the French toast with a twist (the twist is that they make their own bread) and it was divine. My only gripe is that there wasn't more! My husband ordered the western omelette with home potatoes (or home fries maybe?) and it was huge. Too much food for him to finish. He enjoyed his as well, commenting on the ham specifically being delicious. I was very pleased with the overall service, surroundings, price and the food. My one bad note (which is not too big a deal really- certainly nothing to keep you from visiting this lovely sweet and homey little place) is that I ordered a side of fresh fruit (HUGE serving!) that had some chucks of ice in it and the pineapples were canned and completely flavorless. I do believe this to have just been a one in a million type of thing, but noted nonetheless for the honesty of the restaurant review. I suggest you check it out and come hungry!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent from the moment we walked in and throughout our meal. Food was good old homestyle and portions were plentiful. Wait staff was friendly and efficient. We will most definetly return."}
{"text":"I eat at Ronnie's at least once a week, usually breakfast and have never been disappointed in the service or food. Come hungry. Portions are very large. Samantha and Sandra are amazing servers. Drinks are never empty and in spite of a normally packed house they treat us like we were the only ones in the place."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!   In a world of pretentious all-show, no-go breakfast \"jointz\" Ronnie's is an oasis of friendly service, homey decor and great food. What I found most refreshing about Ronnie's were their patrons. I felt welcomed by their regulars. Some of them came to my table to randomly chat. I felt like I was back home. It helps that I have a super cute baby, but I rarely get that welcomed feeling from Scottsdale's elite foodies who stink-eye me because they think I'm biting their style.   Hopefully Ronnie's doesn't become a hipster hangout. Ronnie's is great, not Ironically."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast meet up joint. Became a regular on Mondays. Food is good and so are prices. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"When we first arrived we were told  the special  for the day was Ortega chilli and cheese omlet. I asked what exactly that was and the waitress answered \"ortega chilli in a omlet with cheese\" I'm like OKAY you just said the same thing and switched the words around! I don't know what Ortega chilli is! Anywho they gave us a new waitress she was so nice the portions were huge the food was mediocre and the prices were very reasonable. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best food ever! We love all the waitresses...its like home with the huge portions..great food..fun and laughter of the staff!!!"}
{"text":"It's crazy how hard the servers and cooks work. Every single time I come in they are busting their tails to serve our food in a timely fashion. I'm amazed every time for the past 10 years since I was 10 years old it's been the same hard working attitude that every worker has every time I come in. The food is deliciously put together every time. Sweetest people I have ever met literally. Their chicken and waffles are amazing"}
{"text":"Warning: the portions here are HUGE.  I stopped by here twice in one week and wish I would've gone more. The skillets and Belgian waffles are to die for. Again, bring a huge appetite or a couple friends.  If you go on the weekends, get there early because it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Food was very good and the portions are huge. But mostly, super friendly and efficient staff!! My husband is a type 1 diabetic and was having a scary low blood sugar episode during lunch and the wait staff brought him glasses of orange juice and a brownie.  Even before that they were quick and attentive. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Ronnies the best breakfastplace in Phoenix.The wait staff is like family Richard knows everyone and is great and the food is awesome.  Brian"}
{"text":"Great place for breakast that feels like home, with a big variety on the menu. P.s. the French toast was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We visited Ronnie's Diner Sunday for breakfast for the first time.  OMG!  I am so happy we did.  We were greeted cheerfully,  our waitress explained a lot of things about the menu and restaurant.  The food was wonderfully prepared.     I brought my own coffee from home, usually frowned upon by most restaurants, not at all by this one.  We will be back.  I was actually talking to my sister yesterday telling her about Ronnie's.  She laughed and said she knew it well, it used to be a regular spot for her and her late husband.  We will gladly recommend Ronnie's and will be taking my sister with us when we return."}
{"text":"Come here once or twice a week for breakfast. Good service, big portions, decent prices."}
{"text":"Hands down best breakfast place in the Valley! Truly a hidden jem! Portions are very generous and very inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast one morning and I was really pleased with what I got. It may look like it was over-decorated by the kitschiest of grandmothers, but the food was good, filling, and not terribly expensive. The home fried potatoes weren't anything special, but the omelet I got was great. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great place! Homey, friendly, great food and giant proportions at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Good food, great people, huge portions. You will always feel welcome and back home in grandma's kitchen."}
{"text":"Portions are big. However my wife's omelette was undercooked with egg juices drenching the potatoes. Everything seemed to have a buttery flavor. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"Well, I've been meaning to yelp this place for a while now. I stopped by today for breakfast and decided that today was the day.   Although I don't really like the plates and cups and silly sayings on the walls and counters and everywhere else they could fit it I love the food and staff. Everyone where some teams jersey, I'm not a fan but whatever. I'm there for the food and friendly service. It's true that they are almost always busy, requiring a wait. I don't care. It's usually not long and it's worth it.  My fav on the extensive menu is Adam's Eggs. An extra large biscuit, poached eggs, ham and cream gravy. Oh yes, and a huge portion of home fries. Delicious!!! The plate sized pancakes are great and Farmer John Breakfast or something like that is a meal for 3 people. That is not an exaggeration.   All things considered they have my vote for best breakfast. Maybe I should make the trek down to Matt's but their wait is just not attractive to me. I hear the food is awesome, but in neighborhood Ronnies is king."}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast at Ronnies Cafe southwest corner of 43rd Avenue and Cactus... for the money best darn breakfast value in town"}
{"text":"I only come here for The Best breakfast in town, I love this country goodness. Very large portions they do not cheat you enough food for 2 people."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast place. I love that their food is not the normal stuff and that they serve HUGE portions. The laid back feel of the place is good too!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place on Yelp. Seriously our favorite breakfast. So much better than The Place. My boyfriend is already making plans to go back tomorrow. Ha!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and big portions!! This place is never empty. Great service, friendly and always fast on service! Definitely worth the visit and is inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Ronnie's Cafe! The place doesn't look like it offers much, but we had a great first time experience. The food tasted great and the service was really good. My husband and I split the country fried steak and ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. The food portions are huge, so you definitely can share. The breakfast potatoes were so yummy and tasted fresh. Our server was really friendly and overall we really liked this place for breakfast. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here. Chicken fried steak excellent, gravy is homemade and delicious. I made a mistake on my eggs and they came well instead of medium.  Grits were great also. Wait staff friendly and efficient. Glad we came"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times the first time I had the eggs and rib eye steak the steak was not that great kind of dry and hard, the 2nd time I HAD the chops and eggs again the chops was a little tough and hard but they were big, the 3 time today we waited like 1/2 hour for our food and when it did come my wife and doughter came first and mine came about 10 min later, was not happy about that, and the NY strip that I ordered was Raw, so they took it back and it came back perfect I must say, about 8 min latter, my wife ordered the NY strip and it was a little tough and dry for my taste, they need to up there meat game, don't know if I will go back, but I might, but wont order the steak or chops that's for sure."}
{"text":"If I could rate it lower I would! They lie about taking reservations and made us wait forever just to tell us that they can't really take reservations. I would definitely not recommend unless you are a member of a local biker gang......"}
{"text":"Once again another satisfied visit to Ronnies cafe. My server lisa is so amazing she remembers what I want every time makes me feel special I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great place for a Sunday Brunch. The service is excellent and the food is great. Thank you Lisa for the outstanding service. Great Job!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and was very happy with the visit. It was very busy on a Sunday but waited about 15 minutes for a party of 5. I had the southwest omelette and it was delicious. I think it was about $8 and the portion was huge! Didn't even finish half. Pancakes are huge also. Covers a whole large plate. I tried my husbands country ham and it was very tasty also. They have all sorts of pictures and decor on the wall you get just take off and take to the cashier once you've finished and ready to pay. Most of the decor was cheesy but cool concept and there were some cool things. All the staff was moving a million miles a minute but very nice and eager to help you in a timely matter. Will definitely be back. Great food, huge portions, very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!! Plus, you get A LOT of food! Niki is the best server I have ever come across! If you want good food and great service, this is the place to go! I would HIGHLY recommend requesting Niki as your server!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast restaurant ever! I go here like twice a week with my family. I was stuck on the Steak and Eggs plate for a while but decided to try their other plates. Their biscuits and gravy plate is my new favorite. I rather my money go to family owned restaurants than a franchise as a business owner myself. If you haven't been here yet what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"This place is really very good! :) great selection of food, great prices and portions and the food is delicious. The vibe in the place is very homey and comfortable. Great place to enjoy urself with some great food."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour to be seated and the food was very bland. Steak and eggs was dry and no flavor, eggs Benedict was not good."}
{"text":"Oh so good home cooking.  Great prices, super friendly staff and fantastic portions.  Ordered pancakes and my eyes almost fell out when they landed on the table.  They are the size of a wheel!!  Joes now has some competition with which dive I choose for breakfast!  Love places like this!!"}
{"text":"Look up breakfast comfort food in the encyclopedia and Ronnie's will be shown. Delicious food served unpretentiously by good people."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place homie large portions very good home fried potatos frendly staff good atmsphere"}
{"text":"Another great breakfast at Ronnies! I'd eat here everyday if I could, but my waist line won't allow it. Get there before 10:30 so you can do the specials. I had the ham and eggs with potatoes and toast. It was delicious, more food than I could finish and only about $7. Love this place."}
{"text":"BEST MEAL I HAVE EVER HAD! This is the best little mom and pop shop I've ever found. It was beyond delicious and I cannot wait to go back and try more items from the menu. The portions, staff, and all around atmosphere was divine. I will NEVER go to any Denny's, IHOP, etc. again! Good job Ronnie's Cafe! You've found yourselves two new regulars!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Ronnie's for breakfast. BEST crispy home fries/breakfast potatoes ever!! Huge pancake was excellent too. Eggs over medium were cooked to perfection. Staff treated us as if we were regulars (and it was our first time). Highly recommend!! A must try!"}
{"text":"Ronnie's ROCKS.  We ate at Don Ruben's (excellent Mexican food next door to Ronnies) and were referred to Ronnies for breakfast.  We usually go to The Place - Ronnie's takes the cake.  Not only are their serving big enough for 2 or three but the actually taste is amazing.  I usually get the skillet.  Center-cut bacon, ham, cheese and red potatoes.  My Mom gets the Feta spinach omelet and I've had the French toast.  The service is wonderful and you'll never have an empty cup of coffee.  This is our \"go-to\" breakfast place."}
{"text":"What a great place.  Walked in and a very home-style feel to it.  Friendly down-to-earth service.  The kids pancake was huh-uge (a lumberjack would've been scared of the size).  I mean it was really big for a kids pancake.  My niece ate such a tiny sliver that it looked like we didn't touch it.  My eggs and chorizo plate was huge, I was able to get through maybe half to two-thirds done.  Service was awesome and friendly.  Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Breakfast exploration fail. :( I was really hoping to find a new breakfast spot while taking summer classes at the nearby college. Ronnie's is not the spot. I ordered the waffle, eggs and bacon special and cup of coffee. The waffle was probably the only edible item. I requested my eggs over medium and received them over easy (fine not a problem) but the bacon was sooo limp, My guess it was microwaved. The coffee was probably the biggest disappointment, very weak and watered down. I sat at the bar to eat my food and could hear the servers gossip about the clients. I will continue to search for the breakfast spot because this place was not it."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast on a busy Sunday.  Despite the great service and really friendly staff, the food is not very good. They have huge portions but their omelette and red potatoes were very oily. So depending on your food tastes you will either love this place or be disgusted by it.  There are a lot of people that love it as the place was packed but get ready for the grease."}
{"text":"Gave this place a chance based on the reviews. The food portions were huge but the quality was crap. The waitress only came to our table twice. I never went to a place where as soon as you got your food they gave you your check at the same time. Went the entire meal without a drink because as soon as she dropped off the check we never saw her again. She never came by to see how the food was. There was a lot of inappropriate actions at the restaurant such as the waitresses pinching and slapping each others butts and girls biting their nails and not washing their hands."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Phoenix. Great prices and you will not believe how much food you get and it taste great. If the line looks long don't worry you will not have more than a 20 minute wait. At least we never have and we go every weekend. Our favorites are the chicken fried stake and the breakfast croissant breakfast. You will have leftovers with any meal you choose."}
{"text":"The portions and prices set the bar in this city.  Ronnie's is great for breakfast and lunch.  The other places on this side of town cannot compete with their menu.  It is quite easy to make two meals out of one offering."}
{"text":"When I saw the other reviews I got scared that it was going to be bad. I walked in and right away I was seated and asked what I wanted to drink. Drinks and my food (the pancakes) came very quickly. The pancake was almost perfect, but my dads cinnamon French toast made with homemade bread was burnt on the bottom. The waitress was so nice and the price was great. I would recommend this restaurant but either don't get the French toast or get it lightly done."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after a friend recommended it.  A great atmosphere, very friendly staff.  Food is absolutely delicious; the home fries (breakfast potatoes) are incredibly crispy and to die for, eggs were cooked perfectly, and the pancakes are light and fluffy.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"OMG....the food was very good and the portions were huge.  My husband and I shared an order and we were able to bring some home.  This place is a bit old looking on the inside but the food makes up for it.  I will be returning soon for sure."}
{"text":"Let me start be saying I love this place. The food is outstanding and the service from the ladies is always fun and entertaining.. That is until today.  Didn't get the servers name..she never told us. Blonde hair purple shirt.  After waiting more than 30 mins for corned beef hash and a Greek omelette and noticing tables seated after us are getting their steaks served before our omelette, we inquired and were told omelettes take much longer to prepare and make.  After another 15 mins our food comes.  I've had 2 cups of coffee and am jittery by now.  The dry rye toast I ordered was buttered.  When we mentioned it she said \" I don't have dry on my ticket\". Okay I'm a liar I didn't order it dry.  She knows at this point we've asked to talk to the owner and says this to us \" the owner will be out to talk to you.  He made the omelette.  You can tell him he is stupid.\". WTF!?  WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?   So going fwd I like Ronnie's too much to stop eating there.  But if I walk in next time and she is serving I will walk right back out."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Ronnie's.  We wanted to try a new lunch diner and found Ronnie's on Yelp. Ronnie's tasty, hearty food, comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff were just what we had in mind.  They have a nice variety on the menu, too.  We'll be back for more."}
{"text":"For any out of Towners like myself looking for an awesome meal. Look no further than RONNIE'S CAFE. I visited on a Wednesdy late morning and was seated right away. Server/waiteress was friendly and quick to answer any questions I had. Five Stars because today the food and service deserved it. I would highly recommend this place to one and all."}
{"text":"This is a cute, quaint cafe style restaurant. The portions are large, the waitstaff quite competent & friendly. The food is delicious! A little gem, with great prices & plenty of places to sit! Parking wasn't a problem for us."}
{"text":"Casual American dining experience. I love the staff and the turkey croissant sandwich is our families favorite dish here. We come here a couple times a month for tasty brunches, they do get quite busy during the Sunday AM rush."}
{"text":"Deliciously huge breakfast with lots of flavor. First time here & I love the atmosphere. Such friendly staff. Plenty of room for my wheelchair also."}
{"text":"it was just ok.  The portions are large and the quality was so-so..I had a Greek omelet and it had way too much feta, hubby had a Florentine omelet and didn't complain.  Their potatoes (home fries) were crispy..I just wasn't impressed.  Weird thing about the service too...they don't bring everyone's food at the same time - I noticed this at other tables too."}
{"text":"Not, Bad. At All. I like having healthy options, and this place is lacking, so that's why I deducted a star.  However, their biscuits and gravy were yummmmmmmmm The coffee was poured generously! A plus for meeeeee Their iced tea tasted mmm mmmm good. Parking could be difficult, but my bf and I went a little later in the morning that most people, and we got a spot easy peasy!  That's about all I have to say about this place.  Sooooo yeah. Check it out, because why not?"}
{"text":"This is a truly bizarre restaurant, but they do serve a good breakfast. As others have mentioned the portions really are huge. I can be a fairly big eater at times and I found one pancake to be more than enough. My wife's omelette was also large to the point where she had leftovers. We found the bill to be very reasonable. The biggest issue this place has is slow service, but in fairness it is a busy place on a Sunday morning. One thing that I found interesting is that you can buy antiques that are hanging on the wall. We didn't indulge in that, but it was kind of neat to see."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food is ok. Nothing special. But this last time I went in a group of 5 and ended walking out. We went for breakfast. It wasn't crowded but we never got served. There were plenty of waitresses and after a 1\2 hour of not even getting coffee we had enough. Dont have a clue why we were snubbed, but to add insult to injury, two of the employees had to make sarcastic remarks like \"Have a nice day!\" on our way out. Don't understand, and don't really care cause we are never going back.  If you are looking for an awesome breakfast I highly recommend \" Crazy Otto's \" just up the street. Your not missing anything special at Ronnies. Cept bad customer service. :P"}
{"text":"This has become one of my husband and myself favorite. He especially likes the homemade potatoes and country gravy. I enjoy their omlette' s. They give real home style servings very generous for the price.  I especially like the neighborhood country atmosphere Ronnie's has to offer. It has a small town feel in a busy Phoenix area. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"The pancakes are to die for. Like everyone has been saying, the quantity of food will feed an army!! Good to see a classic diner really put roots down in Glendale. The line for this place is out the door on Sunday mornings. and I'm glad I braved the elements to experience Ronnie's Cafe."}
{"text":"The place is very neighborhood friendly place. There were some stuff on sale in the front part of the cafe, and the waitresses are very busy. We ordered veggie omelet and a skillet, and they were both amazing. The omelet was very good in portion and quality (4 eggs ones oh yeah), and the skillet was just amazing. Based on their prize, they were definitely worth going back again."}
{"text":"Although I have only the 1 check in here we have been here numerous times and have NEVER been disappointed! The staff is always great and quick with the coffee refills! (My kinda place)  The servings are plenty you will most definitely not leave hungry!  I bounce all over the place when it comes to ordering sometimes breakfast, other times lunch!  Today was a Philly sandwich day and it was absolutely delectable! The prices are very fair and my suggestion is to bring patience because this place is ALWAYS busy and normally a 10-15 min wait, more on Sundays.  Well worth the trip and the wait, to coin a phrase by another restaurant....when you're here, you're family!  ;)"}
{"text":"Everyone was so polite and welcoming! Even the patrons!! The food was what is to be expected from a diner. Good overall meal. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot. The food has remained consistent, amazing & tasty for the past 6 years I've been coming here.   -Portions are large & filling -Genuine homecooked food -Prices are perfect and affordable  -Great staff -Food comes out hot & never have to wait long"}
{"text":"We tried Ronnie's on a whim after seeing how busy it got a on a Sunday morning. The place feels like grandma's house with trinkets and such on the walls and for sale. He had Sh** on a Shingles and I had the 2 pancake breakfast, the food taste homemade and the portions where huge. We order the Farmers Breakfast to go at least 3 times a month, its enough food to feed 2. We have also ordered lunch at Ronnie's and have had no complaints. The onion rings are very good."}
{"text":"This is one place where I'm able to recharge mentally physically and spiritually all due to the nostalgic appeal and wonderful hospitality of the staff"}
{"text":"I had a great experience all the way around.  The place was busy but we were seated right away.  Our drink order was taken within a minute and our order shortly after.  The waitress was great from start to finish.  I ordered the farmers breakfast and my wife one of the benedicts.  We received our food within a short time and the waitress was correct, it was a lot of food.  I pay much more for much less in most restaurants.  My wife raved about the gravy (she is very picky) and the potatoes were fabulous, along with the rest of the meal.  I couldn't eat it all and took leftovers home.  I also loved the pancakes.  They were huge and slightly crispy but soft in the middle.  So far this is my new favorite breakfast place.  I will be back to try another meal."}
{"text":"You know those small town breakfast places where everybody seems to know everyone, the food is great and comes in huge portions, and the waitstaff calls everybody \"honey\" or \"dear\"?  That's Ronnie's. my only complaints are that it was really cold inside (maybe we were just under an AC vent), and they don't take AmEx. But we'd definitely return if we're in the area again."}
{"text":"Fast service and friendly staff.  They're all smiles. Eclectic feel but classic food. Tasty and prompt service. Definitely a better alternative to Denny's :)"}
{"text":"Took the family here for breakfast! There are 6 of us and we shared 3 of the farmers breakfast. None of us finished! The picture is of a split meal, only $12.95. Gigantic meal!!! The potatoes were freaking delish! The crispiness on the outside soft on the inside. I was worried about how thick the pancakes were, but they were actually really good! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Love coming here when I'm in the area for breakfast.  Great food, service and fresh made, wholesome food to start your day.  A locals favorite and mine too.  Very generous portions of food that you might want to consider splitting or taking home."}
{"text":"Been to Ronnie's 3 times and every single time I felt like I got a lot of food for a small price. People are friendly.what more is there to say?"}
{"text":"The service is fast and the food is great. I love their potatoes! Soft and crispy at the same time. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The cute little cafe with large meals for inexpensive and delicious. Employees are always very inviting and friendly. Definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot! They have great home cooking and give large portions plus they have yummy pancakes! We went there for the first time today and will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Good local home-cooking place with big portions for a decent price. If you in the mood for a country breakfast, this is probably what you are looking for. Definitely not a light-affair kinda spot. The key word is country cooking so expect a lot of grease and calories. All delicious!   We had split an order of ribeye and eggs with a pancake on the side. The ribeye was cooked nicely but it didn't have much flavor. We added some salt and pepper which made it taste a ton better. Their pancake was on point; fluffy and soft. Note: the pancake is huge so refrain from ordering more than one unless it is your whole meal! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My sister has been talking about this place for years so when I finally to visit she took me for breakfast. I honestly didn't know what to expect but was quite surprised on how it looked. First walking up it looks like your standard store front. When you walk in there a a bunch of knick knacks on the wall that you can purchase. I got steak and potatoes. The steak was super yummy and the potatoes were my favorite! They were super soft yet crunchy on the outside, I def Recommend getting them when you go! The service was super friendly and helpful and it's a total small town feel place. Fed better then your typical Denny's or ihop."}
{"text":"To be honest the food was a 4 but the service was really bad, as in 1 star. Our sever was actually really nice and did a good job. The kitchen couldn't seem to get anything right. I'll save you the details but we got our food 30 min after we ordered.  On top of that it came out spread over the next 15 min. The place has severe management issues. Somone needs to show them how to run a restaurant with some efficiency. Luckily I don't live in phx so this won't be an issue for me again."}
{"text":"I give this a five star only because for what it is, it's BANGIN. I got so,etching called the farmers meal, or something like that. It was MASSIVE. When you order a pancake here they give you one the size of three, and it's actually delicious. They have wonderful crispy home fries. It was just a great and filling meal. So I give it a five star. They cooked one hell of a breakfast."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place. It's like your mom made you a huge homemade breakfast. I highly recommend the homemade bread. It's awesome! Portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"I had the skillet which was very good. Everything tasted homemade and the service was great. The portion sizes were huge! It definitely made it to the top of my list of places to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good portions, somewhat fairly priced (until they raised the price on the steak and eggs),  friendly people for the most part (will explain below).    I am one of the originals who came to this place from the very beginning.  I was a steady customer for a long time.  People there knew my name, what I liked to drink, eat, etc etc.  This all changed one day while I was in there having breakfast close to where the cash register is.  I overheard the waitresses talking down about a regular customer who I have seen in there quite often.  What they were saying was inappropriate and should not have been said about the guy.  After witnessing that I find myself going there less and less.  Too many other breakfast places out there to have to listen to employees talking down about the customers."}
{"text":"Great lunch place, good size servings and reasonable price! Service was superior and very well attended too! Has the pastrami burger and fries! Well worth the price!!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. The Kevin's skillet was pretty awesome with chopped chicken fried steak. It was quite creative and had a little kick. The mountain of food they put in front of you are pretty ridiculous. That being said, we ate it all leaving empty plates :D. Will definitely be back next time we are back in town. #thumbsup"}
{"text":"Loved Ronnie's Cafe. The service was fast and friendly. The restaurant had great food and fun decor. My waitress was quick to recommend her favorite dish which was very tasty. The only thing I didn't like was that the yolk in my eggs were still a little bit runny, but I just didn't eat that part. Everything else was spot on."}
{"text":"My family goes out for breakfast every weekend. We're always searching for the perfect spot: unpretentious with a breakfast to rock your socks off. When I saw the pictures on Yelp with the homey decor and plates piled high with scrumptious looking breakfast staples, I knew we'd found a winner. I was surprised there was no wait on a Sunday morning. We were seated and drink orders taken right away. We all enjoyed our breakfast thoroughly. Portions were huge and prices very affordable. We ordered the kids french toast for my son and the kitchen accidentally made the adult portion. Our waitress noticed right away and only charged us the kid's price. For about $30 we had breakfast for three adults and one child, with leftovers to boot. And before I forget: the breakfast potatoes were AMAZEBALLS! I consider myself a connoisseur of breakfast potatoes and these were seriously the best I've ever had. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned perfectly. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Every menu item I have tried has been tasty and a large portion size. Very popular, lots of regulars, and be prepared to wait. Well worth it. Maybe the best breakfast place in Phoenix ."}
{"text":"I am so glad I was nearby and saw the great reviews on Yelp, this place was awesome, both the service and the food was excellent today. I had a sirloin steak, with two eggs over easy, a huge portion of home fries, and a wonderful buttermilk biscuit and it only cost me $6.95! I will definitely be back to this place and we'll be bringing friends next time, so glad I found this little gem. I have not tried them yet but I saw others ordering these enormous strawberry pancakes that were like 14 inches wide I would guess! All the portions seem enormous here, can't wait to try some more of this yummy food!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is average to below average. Nothing was good, from the service to the food, except maybe the coffee. We had a vegetable omelette and the broccoli in it was still frozen. The mushrooms were canned. The home fries looked good, but had no flavor. The chicken fried steak was below average. As was the gravy, which was actually almost not good. The powdered packaged gravy you make at home is better. Out server was civil, but not particularly friendly. The ambiance is nice, it's too bad the food isn't...."}
{"text":"As enticing as it looks, don't try the pancakes. They look huge and delicious but the are lacking in flavor and they are just not worth it. I can't vouch for any of the other breakfast foods (ie. Waffles, French toast, etc) but I can say that if you want the most bang for your buck and want it to actually have flavor go with the skillet breakfasts. I'll come back here maybe if I'm in the mods for the skillet or if friends drag me here."}
{"text":"This place is cute. Very homey! Prices are affordable! Our server, Sandra, was the best. She is very friendly!   I had biscuits and gravy and mixed fruit for breakfast. The biscuits we're soft and buttery. The gravy was think and peppery just like I like it! The fruit tasted weird though. The cantaloupe and pineapple were not fresh. They tasted old. Other than that, I was pretty satisfied with my meal.   The atmosphere is a little old and run down but what's cool is that the decorations on the wall are for sale. Cool!   Ronnie' s cafe was a tasty and friendly place!"}
{"text":"Food was sub-par I had cornbeef hash breakfast. I found myself picking fat out of the hash. Table was sticky along with menus yuck!  Our waitress was really sweaty and dripping sweat she even joke about being so sweaty. Watching her, she wiped her sweat of while in the kitchen area. She did wash her hands but still she should have excused herself to the ladies room.  Needless to say, we left the restaurant still having full plates of food without packing it to go.  Probably won't return."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time @ Ronnie's. Great food & BIG portions. If you're looking for home style food, this is the place.  The staff was awesome too - friendly & informative."}
{"text":"I don't usually put up reviews here but this place was such a find. I had the special which was Hawaiian bread French toast with scrambled eggs + ham and peppers and a fruit cup for about $7.  It was so good, all of it. Even the fruit tasted great and I usually hate fruit cups.  Everything was sweet and ripe and fresh. The server was calm and helpful and I was able to buy one of their cool coffee cups for $5 before I left."}
{"text":"Breakfast for a great price. I love this locally owned breakfast place. They boast a $6.99 steak and eggs deal. The home fries were flavorful and seasoned well. The steak was okay but what do you expect for such a great price, and the eggs were done to perfection. One of my colleagues ordered Belgian waffles with strawberries and cream. That looked amazing. The next time, I am trying the cornbeef hash! Tip: No reservations, but you can all in advance to give them a heads up that you are on the way with a party of x number of people. Tip: They don't have Heinz 57 sauce."}
{"text":"This place knows breakfast, hands down! They cater to the breakfast and lunch crowd and I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. My wife and I love this joint, she's a breakfast person and I just love good food. I usually get the steak and egg special for $6.95 and it doesn't disappoint. They do have a great lunch selection as well, if you want a good burger, they've got you covered. If you're looking for good prices and big portions, I'd definitely check this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm not good at being negative but we have been there twice now. The first time was good nice service good food. The second time this weekend my mom and I got there 30 minutes before closing order eggs and potatoes I asked for over easy mom had over hard. My moms was over hard it was a little too done but my mom would rather have that than not done. Mine was not what I asked for the yolk was hard tried to get a waitress attention to no avail. I took my food to a nice man he took back and came back with it wright . We never saw any waitress the rest of the time we were there. Not sure if I want to go back!"}
{"text":"I had heard nothing but great things since we moved to the area so we decided to try them this morning and all the meals were aweful. The biscuits and gravy was flavorless, the gravy had no flavor like it was just milk that had been thickened, the potatoes were also bland and had a bad taste, thats when me and my wife realized that both our meals had black rotten potatoes in them, i thought yhey were just cooked a little to much, nope, it was black rotten potatoes, i then tried the sausage which had such a funky taste that had to spit it out, and we didnt even touch the grey eggs.. needless to say we wont be going back Ronnies Cafe although our 2 year old liked it but now we're hoping it doesnt make him sick.. and the prices are ridiculous for such bad and rotten food.."}
{"text":"Ronnie's is my new favorite breakfast place the prices are incredible quality is great and the portions are huge and it helps that the staff is so friendly and fun!"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting and our family brought us here. I left saying \"wish we had a Ronnie's in our neighborhood!\"   Very friendly service , great menu options, generous portions and yummy food.   I had a couple bites of my daughter's  French toast and it was AMAZING. I'm watching my carbs and ordered an omelette. It was delicious and cooked well. I had a nibble of biscuit that was served with it. It was very soft and rich, just how a biscuit should be! My only disappointment was with the potatoes. They're the sole reason for dropping a star. I wish I could do a 4.5. There wasn't any seasoning at all and they were very bland. It helped me stick to just a couple bites, though.   Coffee was refilled often and the kids got cups with lids. Smart staff!   Thank you for a wonderful family breakfast.  We'll definitely go again when we're back in town."}
{"text":"Just because you get a massive plate of food at this place, it does not warrant good marks. Yesterday's breakfast was one of the top worst overall experiences that we have ever had in a restaurant.  First my expectation was not set high at all being it was New Year's Day. We had nine people in out group and put ourselves on the list and waited patiently. At least that was until I noticed a large group leave and them split up the multiple tables put together to make a large table, and begin seating 2 person parties that came in after us. Yes we were next on the list. It took me saying something for them to realize the error and put some tables back together and get us a seat. We ordered drinks and food after 15min of sitting while the server was running around to all her other tables.  Then, she didn't come back to check on us for over 45min.  Our drinks were empty, adults were frustrated and kids getting restless. Everyone in the restaurant could see what was happening to us, some sharing their own frustration with us.  When we finally had the server come back after 45min, she let me know they just got to our ticket and were out of the hash I ordered.  It was pretty funny how I could see the kitchen quite well and watched plenty of tickets put up after ours, get pulled before ours and filled.  Anyway, I choose plan B for breakfast and we waited some more. Now its an hour since we ordered and the restaurant is beginning to clear out and we still have no food. Lots of customers sat after us have got their food and left. The waitress comes back and offers nothing but excuses as to why we still have not eaten. My brother in law, finally got up and left.  We all should of left at this point but the kids really were starving.  It was now after 12 noon and we had come in around 10:00am. Food eventually came and was OK. Not great by any means. Not worth the wait or the fact most of our order was wrong. We had our breakfast boxed and left.  As we were leaving, I hear the same server we had, telling another customer that they just got to his ticket and had run out of hash.  The server knew 20 min before this that they were out of hash.  Any reason she had no commmon sense to inform that customer sooner?   Needless to say, we will NEVER eat here again and don't suggest anyone else does that expects at least a little service with their meal."}
{"text":"The only reason I haven't written a review sooner is because I don't want everyone to know about this place! Even when they are packed, the service is always great and the coffee is always hot. Breakfast here almost feels like sitting around the kitchen table with family. The food is amazing and very reasonably priced. The pancake is bigger than the whole plate it's served on, and only $3.45. My family dug in before I could snap a photo of any of the food, but everything we've ordered there so far has just been wonderful."}
{"text":"A good stick-to-the-ribs breakfast at low cost in a comfy place -- what more can you ask for? To fortify ourselves for a long day driving around the valley, a visiting friend and I went to this place after finding it on yelp. The place has a nice at-ease vibe about it, with friendly staff and cute and kitschy decorative items covering the walls. We found out upon closer inspection that all those items on the wall are for sale, and were very inexpensive without looking cheap. My friend ordered the eggs, hash browns, sausage, and homemade bread. I ordered the $5.99 steak and eggs, plus a side of 1 pancake which turned out to be huge. We sampled each other's orders; everything was good and I especially liked my steak, which I ordered medium and was thick, tasty and juicy - a really great deal for the price. Once again, thanks to yelp for letting this foodie find a great place to eat on a limited budget."}
{"text":"I woke up this morning wanting \"big breakfast\" like we used to make growing up.  But since it's just me, I didn't want to make all that food.  When I looked it up in yelp, Ronnie's looked good and it was less than 10 miles away.    Staff was friendly & helpful.  There was about a 10min wait,  but not bad for a Sunday.     Food was AMAZING!   I ordered the Cadd Special (2 pancakes,  2 eggs & 2 strips of bacon).  But silly me, I couldn't resist the Biscuits & Gravy so I ordered a 1/2 order.  I was also dying to try the home fries but decided my eyes were probably larger than my stomach (thank goodness I did not order more food).  The pancakes were so LARGE they filled a whole plate on their own.  Seriously,  I only ate half of one & I was stuffed!  The half order of biscuits & gravy was the perfect side & they were also Fabulous!   Next time my family us in town,  we will be visiting Ronnies."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here solely from the reviews. As we are sitting it took over 5 minutes to even get a hello from the waitress.  We were sat at noon after a 15 min wait. My wife ordered a Pepsi and it was tasteless.  She exchanged for an iced tea that is weak. We ordered soup before the meal and it hasn't shown up in the last 10 minutes. Service is weak at best. Just before the meal showed up the waitress said they were out of chicken noodle soup....at the beginning of lunch?  The food came piping hot but the breakfast burrito has no flavor whatsoever.  My wife has had to put salt on it 3 times. The Greek omelet was flavorful and big. The side of fruit was disappointing as was the barely warm frozen buscuit.  Since we came from the east side to come here we are not impressed with this visit."}
{"text":"Ronnie's is open 7 days a week, and that's seven days of temptation for me. When I bring someone who's never been here before, their eyes goggle when the food comes to the table.  Breakfast here spoils you for anywhere else. Tasty food, plenty of it (like...maybe share), and reasonable prices.  They get busy on the weekends, but have a lot of tables, good waitstaff, and a good sense of humor. Keeps the line moving right along, so don't be intimidated if you see one."}
{"text":"We came in based on reviews and are not disappointed. Food and service are top notch at very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"My first time here and not at all impressed. My wife and a couple of friends told me to try it so we did. A few notes for anybody wanting to try  PRO Portions are good  Servers are nice  CON: Food does not really have any taste. I had to put a whole lot of salt and pepper on everything.  Clean up service kept on taking our plates while we are still eating from them. This older shorter fellow with hat and glasses kept circling around our table every two minutes to take our stuff. It got so bad that while my wife was boxing the items and leaving some food for my daughter that we had to yell at him to stop as we are not done.  Please do yourselves a favor learn to be patient with your customers. We were about to leave anyway it was just a matter of waiting one more minute for us to  completely finish and leave with a positive outlook on this place rather than trying to clean up early and create a negative experience for us."}
{"text":"We were looking for breakfast and Yelp had very good comments about Ronnie's. We were not disappointed! The hostess seated us promptly and explained the specials. We both had the country bendict. Excellent! The service, thanks Sandra, was top notch. The coffee was very good, but to me, overpriced. 2.25 per person seems high. The place is clean and well run.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ronnie's Cafe is a little hole in the wall place with excellent food and service! My friend and I stumbled onto it last Saturday and thought we would give it a shot and we are so glad we did. The parking is a little tricky but so worth it! I am definately coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great Place, Great food and awesome atmosphere!.. if you give anything less that 5 stars, just stay home and pop in the hot pocket in the microwave and watch re-runs of Archie Bunker.  Those of us who have seen low quality service,& bad food would appreciate an enjoyable experience with out the negativity!..Bon Apetite!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was WONDERFUL! Service was great and every staff member was incredibly friendly. We got the chicken fried steak, country Benedict, and French toast and all three of us left full and happy! Even after we finished and we were just chatting, the server came back to check on us regularly, refill coffee, etc. 5 stars without a doubt!"}
{"text":"At Ronnie's for a great home style breakfast. Good food, friendly staff, good prices, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"First walk in: flags. A lot of tchochkes and neon nonsense on the walls. Tons of people of all types. It's Americana, distilled and directed into a river of breakfast foods. Ronnie's appears, at first glance, a dumb and earnest exercise in monetizing every aspect of the dining experience. The walls are essentially all advertisements, toys and models and mobiles hang hang on string (also for sale), and even the tabletops themselves are covered in ads for local businesses. I'm certain, if it were viable, that the napkins and silverware would also be sold or advertised on.   The menu is further covered in flags, and has a confusing \"9/11 special\" advertised to state that they're going to memorialize the September 11th terrorist attacks with free breakfasts, and this advertisement is permanently affixed *regardless of what time of year it is*. Ronnie's is trying to make something abundantly clear to each and every person that walks in the door: they love their country very much, and it's very important that you know that. Anyone that is uncomfortable by unbridled displays of patriotism need not apply.  Ordering at Ronnie's: the portion sizes are insane. The pancakes are about the size of dinner plates, but they're thicker. Two of them alone, absent any other breakfast items, could make a large man nap. I say this from experience. Almost anything you are going to order is going to be a little larger than you think it is, and you're most likely going to leave Ronnie's groggy, glassy-eyed, sloshing slightly from coffee and syrup. I have attempted, on multiple occasions, to finish a Big Farmer's Breakfast. I have failed by a sizable margin every time. It was always a two person job, truly, and it was hubris to think I could best it.  So: why 5 stars? The staff. Everyone at Ronnie's hustles. Both the house and the kitchen are good at their jobs, they want you to have a good time, and they're fast. Even when the dining room is packed out the door, which is frequent (the after-church rush can be especially brutal), they are remarkable at turning over tables, getting entrees and drinks out, and maintaining a high standard of service/quality despite moving so rapidly. You can tell when a server is experienced and comfortable, and the people here are naturals. Tip them well, because that kind of enthusiasm and talent can be hard to find."}
{"text":"Friendly, huge portions. They did what they set out to do. Huge portions of breakfast at a very good price. Quality ingredients for the most part. If you're looking for a frittata with asparagus this isn't your breakfast spot. If your looking for eggs, bacon, potatoes and pancakes in an impossible to finish portion you should try Ronnie's."}
{"text":"Based on the Yelp reviews, I took my Dad here with my sons to celebrate his birthday over breakfast. The decor is fun and homey if not a little busy. We were seated right away and our server was very nice and patient as we poured over their extensive menu.  And now comes the reason for the 2 stars. Although the server was good, the kitchen was not. I ordered egg whites and got regular scrambled eggs. My son ordered a make your own omelet and they messed it up. What was interesting is that our server noticed the food was wrong while she was serving it to us and still attempted to give it to us anyway while arguing with herself that it was wrong. We turned the food back and she went back to the kitchen and reemed the kitchen staff a new @-hole. Literally. We were sitting by the kitchen and heard her yelling at them...and apparently this wasn't their first screw up of that morning.  We saw the ticket and she had clearly written it up right so this was all the kitchen's fault. At this point, our food came out in pieces. My son got his omelet but not his sides. I got my toast on one plate, bacon on another, and egg whites came out about 15 minutes after everyone else's food. Further, the \"fruit cup\" is basically canned fruit cocktail with a couple of cantaloup cut into it. Not cool. It was basically a big cluster----. Our server apologized profusely and frequently.   Now, in knowing that our experience was not what it should have been, our server could have given us a discount or taken a meal off or something, but nothing was offered and there didn't appear to be a manager around. I looked. Which leads me to wonder if she wasn't a manager given the way she reemed out the kitchen staff, now that I think about it.   I'll consider trying them again because it can't be that bad twice. The food, once we got it, was tasty. We will definitely need to share in the future because the portions are obscenely large. I hope next visit is better than this one."}
{"text":"First time visiting Arizona and decided to stop by for breakfast. Best decision we made. The food was delicious and the service was quick.  The staff were friendly and helpful. I thought it was interesting that they have items for sale on the wall, very creative way to display it.  Overall great experience"}
{"text":"Despite my earlier review, I went back to Ronnie's to see if it was as good as it used to be.  I'm delighted to say that today six of us visited Ronnie's and the food was excellent.  So was the service.  It would appear that on the 17th of January, 2016 the restaurant was just experiencing a small hick-up.   We collectively had a pancake, eggs /w sausage.  Belgian waffle covered with whipped cream and lots of strawberries, a short stack with lots of cream and strawberries, chicken fingers with honey mustard and french fries, and a tuna melt sandwich.  Everyone was very pleased with their order.   I'm putting Ronnie's back on my \"go to\" list."}
{"text":"Was excited about trying a new place but was sadly disappointed. The omlet was super watery, half raw & runny. It sat in a pool of its own liquid which seeped under the potatoes. More soup that omlet.  My hubby had a soupy omlet also.  The coffee tasted like band-aids."}
{"text":"First off, the portions are HUGE!  Every single bite is delectable.  Ther service is outstnading.  It feels like I'm eating in my family kitchen because the servers act like you really are family.  To top it off, there is always something new to look at!!!totally worth it."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad.   It has been a challenge to find a good spot of breakfast in the Phoenix area and so far, with only one try so far, this one seems to be the best of the bunch.   I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, with homemade bread (good choice) and country style hash brown baby red potatoes.     This I will say, the country style has brown potatoes were the best I have every had, super crisp on the outside, done right on the inside with herb and spices."}
{"text":"Wanted to give them another try.  We live in the neighborhood and after about a year we wanted to see if the kitchen had gotten any better.  My boyfriend got an omelette and I got eggs and turkey patties.   His omelette was brown on the outside because it was cooked for so long, the eggs had a crunch.  His home fries were also way overcooked.  My sausage patties were so well done that I had to struggle to cut them and they were so rubbery that they could not be eaten.  my eggs were cooked over medium as I asked but by then I did not want to eat just an egg.  Our server was nice, but once the food and the check were dropped she did not come back to find out why we had barely touched our food. Upon checking out we had another server ring us up.  We explained to her that the food was overcooked.  She said she was sorry.  After paying $30 for a meal and telling her 'thanks for a bad meal' she turned around and said so we could hear her \"not my fault I didn't cook it.\"  Yes she did not cook it but she is the next reason why we will not be back in.  We did not yell, cuss, scream or act rudely to her.  We were disappointed and we were expressing that.  We did not deserve to be talked back to rudely, I am not paying to hear her opinion about my dining experience.  I returned in to speak to a manager.  I guess there is rarely a manager in there and I would have to keep calling until I got him.   It is a local mom and pop restaurant, I am not asking for 5 star service but I would like a little respect, a decent meal when I pay for it.  If anything it is a disappointment, it is a restaurant I would like to support because it is not a big chain."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat breakfast. Low prices and plenty of food!!! All fresh and delicious. I am not one to try new things at restaurants but here I'm not afraid. I hop around the menu and taste it all and I have never once been let down."}
{"text":"My family and I love love love here.  The people here including food is awesome. The prices are resonable. We have never left here feeling hungry.  DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem for sure. Great service and tasty food. Everyone that works there is so pleasant, and you notice they keep track of their loyal customers. I feel like I'm back in the midwest at the local diner. Food has always been wonderful....definitely one of my favorite little breakfast dives in town."}
{"text":"This place is so good and has such a charming atmosphere. The food comes in hearty portions for such a good price. I love it!"}
{"text":"This place is wholesome and huge portions! Such great food and even better people! Ronnie's has been my favorote breakfast spot for a few years now. The place reminds me of my southern grandmothers house, and I honestly love that. Great food for a great price."}
{"text":"Met friends for breakfast this morning...  Two had some (maybe) Franky & ?? skillet and two of us had the breakfast burrito.  Unanimous votes....  Good?  Nope.....Freaking FANTASTIC meals!!  Boxes?  Four, please.  :)  Friendly attentive server.  Cute little place....I loved the randomness for decorations... READ: not apples.  Not roosters.  I live in the EValley so I won't be a regular but when I find myself on the west side....my appetite will be ready!!  Ronnie's....THANK YOU....for a TASTY meal, a great ambiance, even pretty quiet, appreciated!!  On a five star scale....12....12 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for someplace different for breakfast and after reading the reviews I thought we may have found a new breakfast place. We were in for a huge disappointment .  When we walked in we were seated immediately, so I thought this may be good, the place was packed which was also a good sign. First off we were seated right by the front door which could be the reason we had so many issues. First issue was that the table was in the waiting area so as people waited for their table they stand inches from your table looking at items that the restaurant is selling. Secondly our waitress who probably had tables in the main part of the restaurant had no knowledge that we had been seated so until she came to give someone else their check that's when she noticed us, from the time we sat down til we ordered was well over 20 minutes. Third issue was my wife ordered the Country Benedict and when it came out it was very cold, it is very easy to notice when gravy has been sitting out and this plate was obviously sitting in the window to be delivered to us for quite sometime. When my wife pointed it out to the waitress she took it back and I am guessing was reheated in a microwave, now I am not a food critic or chef but I would never reheat poached eggs in a microwave . When the waitress brought them back they were just as cold. My wife ate the sausage but at this point we were ready to go. The reason for the two stars was I ordered the Florentine omelet and it was actually very good, tasty and filling, but hard to eat comfortably as my wife had to wait for her food to be reheated. Lastly when I asked about a military discount the waitress responded by saying, \"since we do the 9/11 special we feel that's enough\". I really wanted to like this place, just all these issues made it impossible."}
{"text":"The reviews about mediocre service is spot on. Good value and likeability of the food. Wife says she'll be back but probably without me. Server paid too much attention to regulars and neglect newcomers."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the service was great. And the portions were huge and prices were fair. However, we had quite a nasty first visit and it will be our only visit. My coffee mug had a lipstick stain on it, which I only noticed after I drank from it, of course. This was rather unappealing. Afterwards when we got our food my mother found a metal wire in her scrambled eggs. Had she not bitten into it this could have caused severe injury. Clearly this place is not clean and isn't careful when cooking food."}
{"text":"The fried potatoes are greasy and delicious just the way I like it. Ordinary breakfast spot at a decent price.   However, being as I am frugal, I can not give up my Country Boy's restaurant down the street 35th & Cactus.  Two eggs, home fries or hash browns and bacon or sausage just $3.50!  They also have 2 4 1 coupons.  Ronnie's is worth checking out and the food was good but just too expensive compared to Country Boy's for me to make it a regular breakfast stop."}
{"text":"Restaurant staff is very friendly. This place is always full customers and the food is great. The food is all homemade and large portions to the prices are very reasonable we love eating here during the week with their daily specials."}
{"text":"Sadly...an over rated Brunch spot.  Although waitstaff was nice, the food was blah at best.  I had the Zucchini appetizer and it was soaked with what I'm assuming is vegetable oil.  The Omelette I had was similarly soaked in butter.  I feel that they should add \"Heart Attack\" to the name.  The decor makes you feel like your eating in 1980s restaurant.  Pass on this one unless you like feeling like you're in the Goonies movie.  \"hey you guys!!!\""}
{"text":"This place was great. Food was delicious and the staff was friendly. My cordon blue sandwich was a bit on the sloppy side but still delicious. My Dad had the patty melt and said it was the best patty melt he has ever had. Going back today!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast place. We love supporting a local business vs a chain.  We've always received great customer service. They have a lot to choose from and their pancakes are huge!!!  Family friendly and casual environment. The weekend staff is great and they do a great job getting through the amount of people quickly without making you feel rushed."}
{"text":"Sooo, the breakfast is awesome... The wait can b forever, so if you are in a rush, and its a weekend, you might want to rethink this option!   Pay attention to peoples plates as you walk in...The meals are huge, so unless you are the hulk, you probably won't finish the meal on your own.   The crowd is an older crowd, when I went, average age was like 50.. the restaurant is very \"American\", ex-military-ish if that makes sense.. Overall, I would 100% go back. The food is CHEAP and good, you'll be full for the rest of the day off $10."}
{"text":"Came in with my family for breakfast and really wish I had gone somewhere else. Service was slow but they were busy so I am understanding. When our food came out my food was cold, my wife's chicken fried steak was under cooked the batter around it was still raw. My son and Daughters eggs were supposed to scrabble with cheese but they forgot the chesse. They did remake my our meals but never got an apology or any compensation. Been nice to have the management come over and apologize. Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"The best, the best breakfast in Phoenix. Service=great Food=good and plentiful. Suggest Kimmie as a server. (The others are exceptional as well)"}
{"text":"Did I just step back into 1980? I'm not kidding. This place is so old school, rustic is not even the best word to describe it.   There was a short wait but nothing offensive. This is just real breakfast food, stick to your ribs food, no need to eat lunch or dinner food.  The menu has everything breakfast, from fruit to cottage cheese to chicken fried steak with eggs over medium. Which is what I got. Erik got biscuits, ham and gravy.   Everything was perfect. Except be prepared for portion size bc for me, it was too much. This diner truly is a breakfast place worth trying if you're not from this are (which I'm not)."}
{"text":"We loved this place!! The staff was so friendly and  I enjoyed the environment. Great prices and huge portions! It was so nice to finally find a great breakfast place while on vacation after not having much luck.   I will definitely be back when I am in AZ!!"}
{"text":"*** WARNING: Their pancakes are the size of a medium pizza ***  Breakfast at Ronnie's was everything I expected and more. The food was very good. All 5 of us that went enjoyed what we ordered. Their portions are huge. You get what you pay for and the prices are about the same as every other breakfast place I've tried. The service was excellent. Our waitress was friendly and on top of things our whole visit. Never did a coffee cup go empty...   Ronnie's will probably become part of our regular rotation... I know I'll go back at least one more time because the French Toast I saw at another table looked really good..."}
{"text":"Nice place ,it was recommended by a friend,food is ok for a reason $ ,the service tho not and maybe not all the waitress but one ."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with great food, daily specials, great value, and best of all generous portions. Skillet potatoes are the best. Pancakes, chili omelet and ham were my faves but can't go wrong with anything I've had here."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful, family style restaurant with excellent food and service. They serve very generous portions. Their servers are like family, and they will remember all their customers. I love it here"}
{"text":"My Roommate and I went to try this place and we where not impressed.First off I ordered a glass of orange juice and it was old so I had to send it back,ok that's ok I said to the server,she took it off the bill then when she came back to take our order I asked her if the eggsBenedict was a good choice and she said yes it was so I ordered that,and my roommate ordered a omlete,when we got our food the eggsbenedict was soaked in hollandaise sauce that looked terrible but I thought I would try it anyway since I scrapped off some of the sauce,Yikes this is not hollandaise sauce,this was some kind of powder with water and lemon juice not good at all I still tried to eat it but regretted it later.and my roomates omlete said it came with chese and it did not so he sent it back and they melted some cheese on it and brought it back.We ate and left sorry Ronnie this place is not for us."}
{"text":"I definitely won't be coming back here!! We ordered 3 orders of steak and eggs, the steak was so dry and the food hardly had any flavor. We didn't return the plates because on all theee orders the meat was so dry, we figured this place just carries low quality meat. We asked the server for a discount and she refused."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the kiddo.  Thought it would be a cute little breakfast spot with that old fashioned feel.  Inside decor and staff were really friendly.  No music so you could catch everyone's convo and I was particular conscious of keeping the kiddo chill as to not disturb anyone.   Orange juice needs work. I'm thinking concentrate but not 100%. It was just off.  Food was really good with some odd twists thrown in. Had the chicken fried steak scramble with potatoes and eggs....and oddly enough olives. Hmmm. Home made French toast was good with the whipped butter. Bill came out to around 19$ which seemed high but whatever.  I'd come back here with pops or gramps, they'd get a kick outta the low yellow light, random artifacts on the wall and good food."}
{"text":"I live close by to this place and I've tried it 2 or 3 times in every single time it is been not very good food. the first time I went to its just quantity and grease. I decided to give it another shot they had a steak and eggs for $6.99 the steak came it looked like it was boiled rather than seared . I ordered it medium and it came extremely rare on the inside even the two gentleman sitting next to me complained couldn't even eat it waitress really didn't do anything she just hid in the kitchen just got up paid for my bill and told myself I'm not coming back here."}
{"text":"Huge tasty portions at a price that won't kill your wallet.  I had the cinnamon roll few hours toast and my husband had Kevin's skillet.  I would order either dish again!"}
{"text":"This is a fun little place to eat breakfast.  They have a pretty large menu and only serve breakfast and lunch but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Breakfast special steak and 2 eggs, home style fried potatoes and toast 7.99. Lunch special are great. Friendly and polite waitresses around they make you feel as if your at home."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and both times have found this place to have good service and good food.  The 1st time we came we had to wait for a table because the place was packed.  The next time we arrived earlier (8AM) and there was no wait.  I absolutely love their breakfast potatoes.  I could eat nothing but those and be happy.  I have found everything to be good except their hot chocolate, which is atrocious - swiss miss packets and hot water.  We'll definitely be back for breakfast in the future!"}
{"text":"This is my third and last visit. The service is hit or miss. The food has always been good. But when you order one thing and get something kinda like it. And your server wants to banter and argue with you then I have had enough. The food is not that good. Thank goodness I didn't have a food allergy cause what I ordered had olives in it and it didn't state that on the menu. You may wanna fix your menu so the customer knows what they are ordering. And to our server lisa I know you didn't cook the food I get that but arguing with a customer is poor customer service. But by the looks of the other reviews this place isnt known for their customer service. It's waitress and places like this that give us good waitress's bad names. I'm sure nothing will be done about this and things will go on there marry way but Atleast I have the option not to be part of it."}
{"text":"Cool little \"old skool\" pocket restaurant, friendly \"Locals\" and wait staff are very friendly as well.  Not the quickest turnaround for a breakfast but still very good food and the portions are ridiculously large, The wife and I order one breakfast entree and split everything, most recently a Meat Lovers Omelett. We'll probably be regulars until we're dead or until we move."}
{"text":"Typical American fare. Bland food doused with cheese, salt, and grease to provided flavor where there otherwise might be none. However, the prices were very reasonable and the portions were very large, so you will absolutely get your money's worth. This type of food is not for those looking to be healthy, and coming here may remind of the obesity epidemic America faces. Other than that, the place really doesn't stand out in any way. There are some nice decorations hung up about the store you can purchase, but that's about the only unique feature. In every sense, mediocre is the word that I'd use to sum this place up."}
{"text":"So let me just say upfront that this place redefines kitch! I mean I would be shocked if you could find one square inch on a counter or wall that is not filled with some cutesy cup or sloppy slang. But I adore this place. It's small and there is almost always a bit of a wait, but the staff hustles and they are incredibly friendly.   The menu is surprisingly large and creative for a family run, diner style breakfast and lunch place. They offer the obvious choices you would expect of this fare, but then they toss in a little something to juice it up. They have a standing Steak and Eggs special for $5.95 that I have never sampled but I've seen one hell of a lot of them move through that kitchen! They also have a fairly decent all you can eat Fish deal from 11:00 to close. My personal favorites would have to be either... wait for it... \"The Julie Plate\" (yes it is actually called that) or the Breakfast Burrito (which bulges with ham, sausage, bacon, cheese, chiles, and country potatoes). But try one of their daily specials, like German Pancakes, and you may be hard pressed to go back to the regular menu. One word of caution is that the servings here are HUGE. I can literally make three meals out of the BB and still have a bite or two to share with my dogs.   Ronnie's opens at 6:00 or 6:30 a.m. (don't know which, because I'm not awake at that time of day) and closes at 2:00 p.m. It is not pretentious. It is the kind of place that is comfortable, clean, and serves a steady stream of loyal customers which are greeted by name along with hugs and smiles. Prices are reasonable if you consider the amount of food you receive, and the consistent quality / selection far exceeds that of the most popular chains. If you are looking for trend, go somewhere else... it will just make my table free up a little sooner. ; )"}
{"text":"Country fried steak was great. Nice and crispy.  They serve a large amount of gravy with the country fried steak, but definitely compliments the dish and adds a ton of flavor.  The fried potatoes were awesome, nice and crispy with a soft center.   Scrambled eggs were good as well.   My girlfriend got the strawberry pancakes, and it looked like a pizza when they brought it out.   The pancakes were huge, and worth it for only costing $6.   Service was good, waitress was on top of our order and we got our food very fast.   For less than $17, we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast on a saturday morning, and got right in without a wait.   Overall experience was great, and would recommend Ronnie's Cafe to anyone, especially people who like large portions.   Will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place I have been so far! No comparison once you try this place out for breakfast! Big portions but very good quality as well! Homey style setup decor wise. Down to earth place."}
{"text":"Overrated on Yelp, Ronnie's is dirty, the coffee is horrible, and the potatoes were underdone. Omelette was good if you don't mind Velveeta. Biscuits were crumbly and the butter was some fake crap that tasted oily. Worst breakfast place in metro Phoenix-Denny's is better and you couldn't pay me to eat there."}
{"text":"Considering 2 out of 4 of us didn't eat our meal, I'm gonna say it wasn't a good dining experience.  I had a steak that was tough but raw inside, I wanted to send it back but it was already to tough to chew, any longer on the flame wouldn't help.  Another ordered fish and it was so covered in oil that it was inedible.  The service was good and everyone working there was very friendly but even good service cant distract from the appearance.  This place is just so filthy.  Tchotchke's fill every nook and cranny and they appear to have never been dusted.  Wall to wall carpet that is stained so it adds to the unclean appearance.  It just felt gross inside."}
{"text":"Ronnies is a good place to have a nice breakfast or a decent lunch. The staff is good, they keep your drinks full and will help you in any way possible.   We went for lunch. I had a pastrami sandwich and it was good but not great. There was nothing that made it stand out and say \"Here I am, I am the best Pastrami you have ever had\" While I am glad the food does not talk to me I was hoping for a little more. LOL   If I were a huge breakfast fan, I would try this again. Otherwise, it will be in the distant rotation if I am ever stuck and can't find a new place to go."}
{"text":"This was my second visit and it was slightly less delightful as my first.  I brought the wife along so she could experience the food and ambiance. We got there early Sunday morning. Service was prompt and friendly. This restaurant is a heavy locals spot. Many customers were greeted by name and even received hugs from the staff.  Their menu offers a lot of interesting choices. My wife got the cinnamon french toast with eggs (scrambled) and bacon which she enjoyed very much.  I ordered the chicken fried steak (really good) with scrambled eggs, grits and biscuit.  My only disappointment was with the grits. They were runny and had a soupy consistency (was not the case on my first visit). Our waitress was excellent and made several visits for drink refills and to check on us. The little hiccup with the grits won't stop us from returning again."}
{"text":"Cute decor, great staff and yummy food! We were seated almost immediately and my coffee cup was never empty. The hash was delicious"}
{"text":"Like eating at home!  Fabulous service, great food and better prices.  I drive a bit to get here and it's always been worth it."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for 4 years, the first 3 years were beyond amazing as far as food, service, and management goes... now not so much, the food is not as great, over priced, and management not so great, we usually go every single weekend and on our days off.. but this last time I went with my entire family, it wasn't that great, it was extremely hot, and we asked if they could do something about the temp in the room which they didn't, everyones toast was burnt I will not be eating there for the summer again until they fix the AC, obviously they are to cheap to fix it. Also there is a ton of gossip between servers that clients can hear and the bus boy is extremely inappropriate and needs a sexual harassment suit against him, I understand Spanish and i'm sure other clients that go there can too. also it seems as tho food has been reheated does not taste fresh!! I'm going to The Place until issues here are resolved."}
{"text":"**Updated: I'm downgrading this place to 2 stars. Both hubby and I ended up getting sick to our stomachs right when we got home. Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend.**  The service here was excellent. We were seated quickly and our food came out quickly. Everything came out as ordered. I got the croissant sandwich with eggs, cheese and I substituted sausage patties for the ham. Hubby got the chicken fried steak with potatoes, eggs with cheese and toast. Our son got two pancakes. There wasn't anything wrong with our food...it was just kind of meh. Neither me nor my husband finished our food (and he loves chicken fried steak). Neither one of us were impressed with the eggs. My son loved his pancakes though! They were HUGE, they literally took up an entire dinner plate. He said they were delicious and he took the remainder to go.   The place is clean, the servers friendly and the food is reasonably priced. Decor is really cool and almost everything on the walls is for sale which is an interesting idea.   All that considered we won't be back. We were really underwhelmed with our food and there are too many really exceptional places to eat for the same cost."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and was amazed by the quality of food and service. I had the breakfast croissant which was very large with home potatoes. It was delicious! My husband had steak and eggs and said it was very good.  We also ordered 1 pancake which is the size of a plate and was very tasty. There was a wait but only 15 minutes. The service was fabulous!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. I live nearby, I can go in before work and get a quick hot breakfast, but I just don't love it. I feel like the cooks are inconsistent and while I like their French Toast, some days it's just not as good. Maybe the bottom is overcooked, maybe it's not cooked enough. It just seems like recently I haven't gotten the same French Toast as I used to get when I first started going years ago, which is disappointing. I stop by when I'm really wanting a quick hot breakfast but I think there are a lot better breakfast places that I would rather have even with the longer drive."}
{"text":"I say 4 stars because of the timely food preparation. Also, the homely atmosphere and kind people. My first time here. The chicken fried steak I got was ...mmmm fine. I've had better and possibly had worse.   Thanks for the hospitality and I will definitely send people over.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Walked in and wad greeted promptly by the staff with a good morning. Was seated promplty and my waitress arrived shortly after. I ordered the daily steak and eggs breakfast special. Was very surprised my food arrived at my table within 10 min of order. Food was awesome, everything was made specifically to order, however did lack flavor. this place reminds me of my childhood and back home in the country, going to breakfast at the local breakfast place.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places. I like the country fried steak and eggs. They are always packed but are quick and friendly. Portions are large, pancakes are the size of a small pizza"}
{"text":"By far one of the best meals I have had in a very long time. I had the Paula and Jim skillet and was not disappointed! Huge portion and reasonably priced! We added a short stack and thank goodness we shared it! The service was amazing from the moment  I stepped in the door. I immediately felt like they knew me and had been friends for years. Highly recommend this amazing joint! Small town atmosphere with home cooked goodness!"}
{"text":"Very nice little place. It sort of reminded me of The Place before it became bigger and lost a bit of quality. Great portion sizes and even better prices."}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop gem in Glendale.  Tried this place for or the first time this afternoon after seeing the reviews.  French dip sandwich and Ronnie's special (cheeseburger with pastrami) were both excellent.  Great fries.  Portions were large, great value for the price, which was very affordable.  Service was friendly and fast!  Best peach tea we've had in quite some time.  This is a new family fave;-). Thanks for all the previous reviews!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! I have been to Ronnie's twice and each time had absolutely the best service and food. The portions are HUGE and services very quick. I thought I would be waiting a long time for my breakfast because they were pretty full when I walked in however she brought my plate out even before I was ready LOL   I ordered the country fried steak and it was served with home fries and homemade toasted bread and two eggs. The potatoes are definitely not frozen and the country fried steak was amazing. I also got an order of \"one pancake\", it is literally the size of a dinner plate and awesome tasting  AANNDD....have I mentioned that they make their own butter??. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here Saturday  morning after some friends suggested it and, of course, I had Yelped it.  Julie wasn't sure when they opened (6AM) so I got there about 6:45 and the place was already about 1/3 full.  The waitress, who appeared to be old enough to be my mother, made sure I knew about the senior menu on the back cover.  The service was pretty good.  They initially forgot me as I had been seated in the front corner but after that I was checked on on a regular basis.  I am pretty sure all 3 of the waitresses were seniors and they put a lot of younger servers to shame as they bustled around taking care of their and each others customers.  Definite teamwork in play.  Many of the customers appeared to be regulars as they chatted with the waitresses and folks at other tables.  I may have ordered the wrong thing.  I had the Sh-- on a shingle with 2 eggs on the side and a large glass of orange juice.  It consisted of their standard white gravy with some shreds of corned beef on top.  The basic gravy had a pepper taste which I have had before in diners but I would have assumed the dish would be made with chipped beef.  Probably not ordered consistently enough to make it worth while.  Even after eating my eggs the gravy was scalding hot and I was surprised it had not separated or filmed over, which would have been my luck doing it at home.  Total bill w/tax $9.51, and I was full.  Overall the place had a good vibe to it.  It opens early enough I want to stop in and try some of the breakfast specials that are only available on weekdays."}
{"text":"Good food, a LOT of food... Pancakes are crazy large but good. The meat lover omelet is big enough for two meals!"}
{"text":"Ronnie's Cafe is a quaint and unique cafe that serves breakfast and lunch. This was my husband and my first visit after viewing our friend's Facebook posting from his recent visit. The portions are enormous and very filling. We ordered breakfast. I had the country gravy, sausage and eggs Benedict with home fries. My husband ordered the scrambled eggs, sausage and French toast. We both ordered coffee and ice water. Every bite melted in my mouth. The sausage was some of the best I have ever eaten. The service was outstanding. Our server was Tara and she was attentive, always refilling our coffee and checking on us.  The restaurant is clean as is the restrooms. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. They have regulars that come.  We will return in the future."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the waitress was awesome however, there was mold on the sandwich break. They brought out a new sandwich but the appetite was gone.  They made it seem like the new sandwich was on the house but at the register they were trying to charge it. After asking another waitress and getting nowhere they brought out the manager. After all the confusion and commotion they finally figured it out. However, they thought that no one was listening but one person from the group stayed behind and heard another waitress and the manager talking about \"the lady and the mold.\" I find this really disrespectful and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Ronnies is always a solid choice for diner style breakfast. The suite is filled with tchotchkes like mugs and wall decor which gives the table a conversation starter. The staff is always friendly and although they are usually busier than a hot chick's Tinder inbox they are attentive. Yeah, sure the parking is less than desirable, but price and quality are worth it."}
{"text":"cute interior, fast service, delicious food...and TONS of it!  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great prices, cute restaurant, friendly people, good service, and amazing food. Too bad they're not open for dinner."}
{"text":"Been here: 20-30 times  Ronnie's is pretty good (there's a reason I keep coming back) but should come with a few words of caution for non-regulars and newcomers (why I give it a 3).   What's good: the food is consistently OK to good (75% of the time), the wait staff (on the floor) is quite friendly, and the prices and portion sizes are hard to beat.    What you may, or may not, like: the food is quite greasy- I actually enjoy that, but know some people have a hard time with (or are turned off by) greasy foods.  What you need to be warned about: I have had a few experiences of less than exceptional customer service at the front of the restaurant.  In specific, I had a particularly unpleasant experience with a staff member at the cash register.  Unfortunately, from reading other reviews, I don't think that is as uncommon as I'd hope it to be.  What to know: Although they don't have a sign, do wait to be seated at the front. You will also pay up front when you're done.   In short: This is a local, mom n' pop cafe with some of the quirks that come with that.  Food is pretty consistent and service is usually good.  Wouldn't recommend going out of your way for it, but would mention it to a local interested in giving it a try.  I would not bring guests here due to the lack of consistency in food quality and service (I made that mistake).  If you do have guests, I would recommend checking out Black Bear diner, which is a safer option with much of the same local charm."}
{"text":"I live and work across Ronnies Cafe and I'm utterly impressed. This is my very first time trying their lunch and my jaw dropped when I opened my to go box. Believe me when I say it looked as delicious as it tasted. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"If you want large portions and good food come to Ronnie's Cafe. We have visited several times already and we are very impressed. The service is good and the food is excellent. Some of our favorites are the Florentine omelette, chicken fried steak, corned beef hash, and waffles. We just found this place a couple of months ago as it is hidden a bit from Cactus Rd. Take some time to come find it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The staff blew me away with their amazing customer service. We were only in Pheonix for a few hours before heading home but this place was the perfect place to experience Arizona hospitality. We also got great souvenirs when our delicious meal was over. Good vibes and great times!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while. Prices for quality are too high. Over medium eggs were runny, French toast was cold. Waitress was very nice but came for the food & was very disappointed. We were here when first opened 11 years ago. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, had the corn beef hash, it was disgusting tasted like ground up hotdogs or some sorta cheap spam product....couldn't even cook scrambled eggs right, I saw on the menu shit on a shingle, had that when I was kid and make it from time to time, again there using this Cheap spam products or god only knows...very disgusting almost threw up right there bye the smell of this food!!! Wouldn't not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Always friendly service and good food.  Prices are low and portions are big.  The waitresses are very nice."}
{"text":"We can't come to Phoenix and not go to ronnies. Everyone is so nice.  Food is always great.  This time had the tom and penny skillet, I think that's what it was called, it was very good.  Wife just wanted eggs and sausage, and they took care of her.  Come get you some."}
{"text":"Got the huge chicken fried steak.  Fresh gravy, tender meat, spiced just right.   Cobb salad was priced right."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast food.  This is coming from a guy who never goes out for breakfast.  I'm simply not a big fan of it.  I am though, a fan of breakfast being done right.  Generous servings, great tasting food, and a very at-home style atmosphere.  The only thing I'm against the all the random items on the wall with prices.  It makes it feel a little too much like a flea market.    If it didn't have price tags, it would feel more like charm instead of someone trying to make a quick buck."}
{"text":"This place is a must try when you are in AZ. This a family-style restaurant. I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Big portions, good prices and a friendly greeter will bring us back for breakfast. Our waitress was very efficient but she could have been more friendly. She may have had too many tables to cover. We'll have to try their lunch, the menu looks great!"}
{"text":"Great food, prepared any way you like it, large quantities, and low prices. Fantastic place and fun people working there."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for hostess.  We had a group of seven but one of our party is a very large man so we asked for a table for 8.  She said ok but then made it a joke shout out friend.  We decided to still have breakfast but it will be our last visit.  We have been coming here for years and they have just lost a good customer because of a hostess's decision to be disrespectful.  Which is something that is just not acceptable.  Oh.  In the off chance there is some confusion as to why we will not return?  WENDY is the reason.  Rudeness will not be tolerated.  You are in a service industry and she should be very aware of her surroundings!  I am sure she did not intend for my wife and her friend to hear her however they did.  Sorry Ronnie's."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place ever . GREAT homemade cooking . This is like grandmas homemade cooking . I've been here several times everything is good and there is no other place around town that taste so fresh and authentic like this place. Definitely worth your time. And the portion sizes are huge! I would recommend and item but everything taste good like really"}
{"text":"Good food, huge portions (they're ok with sharing), and terrible coffee. I am immediately enamored when I order my potatoes crispy, and they show up that way! (The breakfast potatoes were the best part of the meal.)Nice place if you're wanting to sit and chat. The staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning had the Tony and Jill I think it was called Chirzo jalapeños egg ect. With toast and side of bacon. It was huge had to take home some. My meal was only 15.00 even. But what made it great was my waitress don't know here name but on the bill it said server number 16. She was very friendly had a smile and was on top of everything plus she was very attractive. Would recommend Ronnie's to anyone who wants good homemade meals and hopefully you would get server 16 cause she is very good."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident after doing some errands. I came in by myself to try out the breakfast. This is probably the best breakfast that I have had in Phoenix. I had the corned beef and hash with two eggs over easy country potatoes and a biscuit. Bravo! I can't wait to come back and try it some other dishes. Definitely worth the 5 stars that I gave it!!! Lyndsey was awesome. Very friendly and made me feel welcome."}
{"text":"Wow! That was fast and delicious. They didn't waist anytime. I brought my daughter here with me. We usually go and do Black Bear Diner, but they have gone a little south lately. So now Ronnie's will be our family diner. Thanks for the great experience. FYI: All of the items on the wall are for sale! That's pretty cool."}
{"text":"Breakfast done old school. Lots to look at while enjoying the food. We did breakfast. Giant pancakes that were on the money. Great value."}
{"text":"Great little place with large portions. Just friendly and smashing food! What I going to be cute was you could buy anything on their walls. Like pictures or memorabilia.  Since I  saw the portion sizes before I ordered, I got something small. My husband got the make you own omelette and could not finish it since it was huge. All the food and service was great! Will come back."}
{"text":"The best homefries/fried potatoes in town laid back family restaurant. ...took my mom back the very next day she too gave it 5 stars for the food !!!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast hangout. The pancakes are delicious and HUGE. The serving sizes are big so me and my hubby share and still have left overs. It can get busy and it's not the biggest building so plan on waiting."}
{"text":"Yuck!! The food was incredibly bad. I got the eggs benedict and my husband got the country fried steak. Both tasted disgusting. We also got a pancake and wished we hadn't. The syrup tasted nothing like syrup. The food is over priced considering it tastes so bad and isn't fresh at all. I was charged $4.95 for a small bowl of fruit that was really warm to the touch. Don't understand how this place stays in business. Pure nastiness!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for home style American cooking, this is your place. Good food, good prices and friendly casual dining. They make their own \"home fries\", which are country style potatoes. Always go with this choice as a side whenever possible! Sometimes they have homemade bread too. Their pancakes are literally the size of a plate, so you probably only need one. Homemade chicken fried steak is incredible. Reuben sandwich is perfect. Seriously, if you're looking for diner type food this is the place. They only do breakfast and lunch. One of my all time favorite restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last Sunday after mass (also the weekend of superbowl) and it was absolutely amazing.   There was already a wait at 940am but glad we decided to wait based on all the awesome reviews.  We actually didnt wait that long maybe about 10 mins if that.  Best part was they were selling girl scout cookies right outside! Haha anyway the restaurant decor is full of colorful things hanging on the walls.  Little did we know most of the items on the walls are for sale!  If you look closely you will see a small price tag on the item somewhere.  Now the food.. is amazing!   The portions are definitely huge, no matter what you order its literally going to fill the entire plate! Saw someone eating the paula and jim's omlette special and ordered that with potatoes and wheat toast.  The boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs for only 6.99.  The omlette was definitely everything and the kitchen sink, filled with bacon, sausage, ham and some other herbs and seasoning all smothered in melty cheesey goodness! Came on a skillet and kept it hot the entire time I was devouring the meal! Loved that the waitress offered salsa with it and their salsa is pretty good with a very nice kick of jalapeños.   Anyway... what I loved most was that their toast had a generous amount of butter that melted nicely on the toast.  Most places are very stingey with their butter as if butter was costly!  But this place gave me enough where I was happy :).  Anyway the steak and eggs are definitely worth it.  Its a good size sirloin steak,  might be about 8 to 10oz maybe.  It was cooked a little more than med rare but thats okay since its not a steak house the slight overcooking is okay,  therefore you may wanna do one level undercooked to expect it to be slightly over cooked when you get the steak.  But the food was soo good it was still good the day after for lunch at work!!  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Giving this place a solid 4 for now. The staff was excellent and the eclectic wall decor was amusing, but the food was just good not great. My boyfriend got the pastrami burger and I got the french toast, which was the better of the two. The toast was thick and filling, I enjoyed ir enough. The main thing that would have improved the meal is the fries and burger could have used some more seasoning. We were hoping this place might be out new breakfast spot since moving to the area, but I'm sure. I would still go back though and encourage anyone looking for good cheap eats to try them out."}
{"text":"Our group of 10 members came for a breakfast meeting at Ronnie's.  Since I had called as they asked the day before, they had tables and chairs and set-ups all ready when we walked in at 9 a.m.  Great greeting for a group! We all loved this place!  The huge portions, the good food and the great service really made this event super--and the reasonable price for the food just topped it all off.  More than one person said to come back here when we meet again...and we will! We stayed for 2 hours, loved everything here and will definitely do a repeat in the near future!  Ronnie's Cafe is an excellent breakfast place for us! Our waitress handled the 10 of us with no problem it seemed, and her service was so appreciated.  She was quick, efficient and friendly.  No complaints here. Lots of parking out front and homey atmosphere--almost MIdwestern in it's way--which is  missing in so many places in Phoenix which seems to go for the modern, sterile look that is boring and uninteresting.  We loved the kitchy stuff for sale on their walls, frankly....crazy and we loved it.  We spent part of our time just reading the signs they have up for sale. By the way, try the omelettes--just the size alone will blow you away!"}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite breakfast place!  We used to live just a couple of blocks away, but now we live on the North East side of town and still drive over often.  Ronnie's has the best potatoes I've ever had in a restaurant - EVER!  Portions are huge, never once have I cleaned my plate, although I wanted to.  Service is always warm and friendly and prices are low by comparison to most breakfast places.  Seriously worth the drive if you don't live in this area of town."}
{"text":"This is our second time here, its awesome for breakfast. Service is great n portions n good also. The inside layput is cool because they have stuff on the walls that u can purchase. R.I.P marlon we miss u this time around n u were wit us last time. Must come n try..prices r good n alot of selection in food."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for breakfast while i was in town. there is a ton of great things on this menu but i wasnt really prepared when it was time to order and threw out pigs and a blanket. Not what i really wanted but i was good and service was great.  I would eat the pigs in a blanket again but wouldnt order it again because there is to many good things on this menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Ronnie's for the first time almost a year ago.  We both agree it is the BEST food and service we've ever had!  The staff there are all wonderful and treat everyone like family!  I cannot say enough good about this place, keep up the good work and see you all soon!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions and service has been pretty nice. I've tried the breakfast sandwich and the french toast and the food is definitely better than the standard Ihop/Denny's chain breakfasts. Portion sizes are bigger than usual. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"We were out in Arizona for spring training and I always trust Yelp when looking for \"the breakfast spot\".  Ronnie's came up as #1, so I dragged the family 15 minutes outta our way for crap!  The restaurant staff were nice, but unfortunately that doesn't make the food taste better .  My daughter sent back her eggs because they were brown.  The waitress didn't understand what was wrong with them.  My daughter said she wanted them yellow and fluffy.  When her plate was returned, they looked wet and brown.  I gave her permission not to eat them.  The sourdough toast was burnt hard and cold, like it was sitting out for a while.  The bacon was a dirty oil brown color, but looked soggy.  My kids love bacon, but they couldn't eat the two strips they got.  I got the 2 egg Bfast, which came with oatmeal.  I only ate the oatmeal, which was very good.  Everything was just bad overall.  Over half the food was left untouched on our plates.  I don't know all these yelpers who gave them great reviews, but I'm telling you don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Stumbled upon it one day and so glad we did.  It's like a little coffee shop diner.  My husband and I go all the time for breakfast.  Large portions at a decent price and so good.  staff is very friendly and it can get very busy at times, but it is worth the wait.  Pancakes are bigger than the plate and the home fries are delicious.  no matter how busy it is, your food comes out pretty quick.  Everything I have had so far is great and really want to make it there for lunch.  breakfast is delicious."}
{"text":"I can NOT say enough about how great this place is. The people that work there have been working there FOR-ever. And all their sassy attitude makes me want to come back everyday. Not to mention I get coupons for this place in the mail at least once a month. I love trying new things, but their biscuits and gravy will stick to you all day. And they have a great el cheap -o menu if you get there before 10:30. What? Breakfast with me soon, why yes please. :)"}
{"text":"Quaint Cafe with character and huge delicious meals. You can even shop for items on the wall - eating with a bonus!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for a local breakfast place and I've found one of the best. I love going out for breakfast but don't care for chain breakfast restaurants so happy to find this place. Not only is the food amazing but the portions are out of the world and the service I'd the best.   Give it a try and you won't be let down."}
{"text":"Friends took me here for breakfast.  They have been coming here for years.  It is a local mom & pop operation serving mostly breakast food all day and lunch items.  Service was ok.  Food was not bad and you get a nice portion.  I got the special with pancakes.  They were ok.  I have had better.  The syrup made it go down better.  I thought they were a tad overcooked but some people like it that way. Prices are decent.  I like to support mom & pop restaurants like this.  There are not the best but not that bad also."}
{"text":"Stopped by last weekend for their signature 'steak - egg' combo breakfast, which was a disappointment.  Steak was tough, stringy, marbled with fat and gristle. Would have been better served to Spike (the pit bull barking out front of the restaurant). Eggs were runny and the toast was limp and disgusting.     Coffee...tasted like canal water. Service was slow, restaurant was overcrowded with a 'motley crew' of trenchermen who obviously had not been fed since being let out from their trailer parks a couple weeks ago.     Other than that, a great place full of unusual smells, odors, stains on the floor and walls, and decrepit furnishings that have all seen better days."}
{"text":"Really good food, came here because of Yelp and I am sick of the same old breakfast places.  It is a great little casual hole in the wall (maybe a little bigger), old grandma decor, could pass on the roosters on the table cloth.  Service was good, but there were some white trash people sitting next to me that could not stop cursing every other word.  It looked like a 40+ year old daughter with her dad too which made it worse.  The food on the other hand was great, the potatoes are real cut up potatoes that have been grilled crispy and lightly browned.  I ordered the special which was a green chilli omelet with swiss cheese covering it.   I would come back (what are the odds I would get WT sitting next to me again...right?).  Oh yeah, they have a steak and eggs special too for $5.99"}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  Now, when I say delicious, I mean slap-yo-mama-do-a-dance-and-feel-the-magic-on-your-tastebuds good!! The man and I went here for breakfast on a Sunday morning around 10:30ish.  I wasn't sure if the after church crowd would have taken the place over by then, but we were willing to risk it.  We love little local dives and based on the reviews, we figured this was right up our alley. When we arrived, we were told that it would be about 15 minutes.  We waited on a couple of chairs outside and were called in less than five.  I had originally gone in with the intention of getting the egg croissant sandwich (a picture was posted), but then EVERYTHING looked good, so I wanted to try a little of everything. I got the \"Julie's Everyday Breakfast\" (or something like that... basically bacon and eggs) with the home fries and biscuits and gravy.  The man got the breakfast skillet with chorizo and we got a pancake (yes, just one) to share.  The coffee was refilled twice before our order got there.  Not because it took a long time, but because they're THAT on top of it.  Everything was fan-freaking-TASTIC.  We like to think of ourselves as connoisseurs of bacon and this was some of the best!  It was thick cut and crispy without being burnt.  The eggs were light and fluffy, the home fries were nicely cooked (but needed a touch of salt.)  The man's skillet was REALLY flavorful and had a kick without being TOO spicy (well, it was spicy for me, but i'm a honkey white girl... he added salsa and hot sauce to it...) He went with the server's suggestion to get tortillas on the side to make a couple of little breakfast burritos... which he did and he still had HALF of his breakfast left!! And the pancake was everything a pancake should be.  It was spongey but not soggy, sweet but not sugary and the sides spilled over the edge of the plate.  Yum!! The decor was that of a typical local diner.  The chairs were on casters which was nice; there were pictures and decorations covering the walls that were for sale and the plates were the usual beige color.  Sure, the carpet could use some updating and the plastic table cloths remind me of my grandma's house.  But overall, it was great and we will definitely be back and we'll be bringing our friends and their appetites!"}
{"text":"Minimal wait time on a very busy Sunday morning. Walls covered with a wide variety of images and photos. My scrambled eggs were moist without being runny. Breakfast partner anointed the pancakes the best he's ever tasted. Everyone, from the cheerful and efficient waitstaff, to the host, to the cashier has a smile and a good word. I plan to return the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"In all honesty, Ronnie's was OK. Nothing really stood out to me.. oh wait, they do have really good coffee.. but not enough for 5 stars.  I went I to Ronnie's today around 9am, was not greeted \"Eye to Eye\" but instead I received a \"be with you in a minute\" with a back turned. Once we were seated we had a minute to gaze around at all the interesting items for sale On the walls, pretty cool to have things to look at.  The server brought us waters and hunched down into a squat and assumed we were ready to order(I hadn't even noticed the menu in front of me). So I felt obligated to hurry up and order so I built my own omelette(can't go wrong with that) and my mom ordered the waffle meal. Again, the coffee was great. So our food came out (a rubber or another server delivered) and it was all pretty cold except the omelette. It looks like they had everything ready to go and just added the egg portions on the way out. Even the toast tasted old.  Anyway, I just asked for New toast because I don't really like complaining or sending anything back. The omelette was the best thing there although it is not served with any fixings like sour cream or anything so you'll need to order that on your own. The waffle was bland, the bacon was crispy(good crispy, the home fries were good(better  hey were fresh). So I would not have an issue going back but I'd rather hit up \"The Place\" near by for not only more bang for your buck but a fresher and more friendly experience."}
{"text":"We stopped at Ronnie's Cafe based upon other Yelp reviews. The wait staff was friendly, obviously was well known to the locals, and still very friendly to us out-of-towners. The portions were huge you could not possibly leave Ronnie's and still feel hungry."}
{"text":"Have been frequenting this place for a while. Had breakfast there yesterday and it was really disappointing. Bacon tasted like petroleum and was cold. The French toast was hard as a rock and it looked like they were trying to save a piece of old bread and ripped off only the corners and called it French toast. Not returning ever again. So many other breakfast places that are better."}
{"text":"I was headed for the Mexican place right nextg door, but decided to give this little diner a try.  I am glad I did.  A friendly staff, and HUGE portions made it a memorable stop!!  The pancakes fill the entire plate, and it's not a small plate either.  Plenty of good food, served hot and fresh and with a smile.  It's well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"U won't ever find another breakfast place like Ronnie's. We've tried. It's delicious. Steak and Eggs for $6.99 everyday. Fried potatoes are on point."}
{"text":"I tried it because of the reviews.  Maybe it was an off day.  The home fries tasted like they had been cooked in old oil.  The staff was very friendly.  It is kitchy right out of the past.  No music was nice you could actually hear the person next to you.  Between the 3 of us we had eggs, bacon, home fries, french toast and a roast beef sandwich.  We were all of the opinion of Meh.  If a greasy spoon is your idea of great food then hurry in.  It was edible but not delicious."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic as was the food. Their corn beef hash is homemade... delicious. Pancakes are light fluffy and huge! I also recommend the biscuits and gravy. Stick to your ribs good. Get there between 6:00 and 10:30am for breakfast"}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service! Place you want to eat your breakfast slow as possible so you can savor the goodness of their food and the nice ambiance of the place. Too bad you have to give way for the other customers...  My family and I went here and their food is fantastic, the servers are really friendly and the owner himself goes out to talk to the customers and ask how's the food.  I highly recommend this place for family weekend breakfast!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with my father this morning. And my fiance. Their food is always great sometimes they get a little busy and overwhelmed but the food makes up for it. I get to Julies everyday breakfast when I am there and they know how to make grits correctly. They have other great specials running all the time great food and this place is never a disappointment. I also like there fried potatoes are the best :-)"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for that small home-town atmosphere and amazingly big delicious breakfasts for that small home-town price. The wait staff are always professional, fun, and really take the time to get to know the regulars.  Don't let the line throw you off. We've never waited longer than 20-25 minutes, and it is well worth the wait. Tip: the earlier you go the shorter the wait if you can beat the church crowds.   5/5 for this local gem!"}
{"text":"Good mom and pop place for breakfast or lunch. Large servings. Excellent service. Down home food."}
{"text":"This place can get very packed. Visited on a Saturday morning and luckily we only had to wait a few minutes. The waitress was nice and the food came out fairly quick. This is your \"moms & pops\" restaurant. Prices are awesome and you get lots of food. This will definitely be one of my favs for breakfast."}
{"text":"First time here came for lunch with father and brother . We were greeted by an older women who seated us pretty promptly.. Our waitress didn't come right away but when she showed up she was great. Our food was pretty good I got the chef salad and it was a decent size.. My only complainant was they didn't have the dressing that I wanted.. Dad and Brothers meals were pretty decent according to them.. I will go back and try something else in the future . Now the only thing that was really distracting was the little tiff between two of the waitress's , maybe not everyone saw it but I did.. A little professionalism goes a long ways ladies.."}
{"text":"First off don't go to this place if you're looking for a fancy brunch with small portions. This is a good old fashioned diner with huge portions. Their food is never cold and their waitresses are busy but always helpful. I eat breakfast here I recommend their pancakes, omelettes, and their skillets.  This is a good place if you appreciate down home country cooking."}
{"text":"I love quaint family based breakfast joints. And After getting sat pretty quickly and finding my very favorite and hard to find breakfast item on the menu (cream dried beef aka SOS) I was sure Id end up driving across town more often to eat. Even getting our soup we requested ahead of time took awhile and it was just warm when we got it. It was good though. When our meals finallllyy came I was so disappointed. I know everyone has their own variation of SOS but this was not the recipe I cared for. Too much pepper and I didnt like the choice of meat they used. When it came time to pay, there is no room for a line at the register yet there was a very slow moving line."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal in this place, HUGE portion and great prices. The staff is always friendly... Love when they have the Potato pancakes as a special, they are huge and so good."}
{"text":"Tried Ronnie's for the first time today.  Never would have noticed it without Yelp review.  Good service.  Good food.  Awesome potatoes.  Bacon sadly was overcooked.  Will take kids there and see what their opinion is since they are pickier than me:)"}
{"text":"The most Southern style breakfast in Phoenix!!! The staff is incredibly friendly and the place just screams home style! The pancakes are MONSTROUS!!! Our breakfast came out quickly and everything was awesome. They certainly make sure you leave full... too full in fact. I loved seeing the entire staff meet and greet everyone like they were regulars. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp and thought this would be a great place to try and I wasn't disappointed.    The coffee was strong and hot and the food came the same way.  Had to wait to cool a little before digging in.  (Also may need doggie bag as the portions are big and the price is worth it)  Lots of locals and very friendly wait staff made this trip here worth the experience."}
{"text":"Holy crap!  This omelette was huge!  And good.  And so were the home fried potatoes, which are actually hash browns.   I went online to find the best breakfast places in Peoria and this place was at the top of the list.  Seemed very family-oriented in two ways: family friendly, yet locals seemed to be treated like family.  I felt very comfortable being here amongst the locals.  And a great thing happened while here. I was sitting next to some folks that were telling the waitress, whom they were aquainted with, about how they were interested in selling their 4 tickets to the Cards football game the next day. I asked them a few questions about the tickets. By the time I left the restaurant, I had two tickets and a parking pass for a better price than I could have ever gotten at the game. Thank you, whoever you are!!  Place was packed on this Saturday morning.  Great homey decor.  Service was excellent and everyone was friendly.   If you live in the area, you probably have been here.  If you haven't, you should go."}
{"text":"We are from out of state & we looked this place up on yelp so thought we'd give it a try. Quick attention at the door and seated right away. Cute little breakfast restaurant and walls are covered with so much to see (and buy if you want). Our waitress was Sandra and she was extremely sweet and attentive. Filled our coffees & water regularly and checked on us periodically to see if we needed anything else. Food came out quickly and we ordered country fried steak (2 orders) with pan potatoes, biscuit and gravy & Codd Combo with French toast & eggs. The meal country fried steak was delicious BUT the French toast could have been better. I would definitely come back if I'm ever in Glendale again. It was also inexpensive about 8-10 a plate (with daily specials of $5-8)."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing prices and amazing service!!! Ask for Danielle when you go. She'll take care of you."}
{"text":"First time here, even though I only live a few blocks away.  Well my son brought me here for late breakfast/early lunch.  What was I waiting for. This place is fantastic. Nice Mom and Pop place, like the ones I used to go to growing up. The food is wonderful, home made like it should be. Not like the fast food restaurants. I had an omelet that will feed me for a couple of days. My son had the BLT sandwich, and he said it was fantastic.  Need to bring my grandson here,  because he eats and eats and eats. The omelet is large enough to fill him up. All in all, this place is a hidden gem. Definitely worth the drive from anywhere, to enjoy this fantastic place."}
{"text":"The portion sizes here are absolutely huge. So big that I couldn't finish all my food. If anything I'd take smaller sizes for better quality. I also didn't like that the kitchen is open and you can see not so clean things in the kitchen. Like I said though the portion sizes were out of this world."}
{"text":"The food was very bland and not fresh. The omelette had no flavor, the orange juice did not taste fresh,  and the side of fruit was definitely canned. Service was good, but the food was bad enough I'd never go back."}
{"text":"Ronnie's is everything that everyone has said it would be. We will definitely be back! The pancakes are huge and their food is good also. I can't wait to try their biscuits and gravy yum"}
{"text":"We love this place. We get one of the skillet breakfasts and share it! The waitresses are always kind and very personable. They make you feel at home and the food is like home cooked as well!"}
{"text":"I Yelped \"Breakfast Café\" and Ronnie's was the first on my list. I read the first two reviews and thought I had found my next favorite Café. I was wrong. The waitresses seem to not know what was going on or which order belonged to what costumer. There was a person next to me who had been waiting for 30 minutes and three times they brought the wrong order to him. I ordered the French Toast and they tasted like they had been reheated. Ronnie's was not what I expected."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is like family. The portions are huge and filling. Priced right for what you get. They always make you feel welcome and you always leave full. Try it out and ask for Lisa as your server! She rocks...."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to places for breakfast! It's super cheap and the portions are huge so my 2 daughters and I usually share a plate. The cinnamon French toast is amazing!"}
{"text":"I had the country fried steak while hubby got a gigantic omelette of some sort. Yeah -the servings were huge. Service was pretty great. Food was ok."}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered Ronnie's Cafe from postmates and it wasn't the best. The pancakes and ham were extremely burnt, the eggs weren't well done and it wasn't packed very well. Not all the food was bad, but it definitely wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Walking up to Ronnie's Cafe I was thinking \"Ugh this is going to be another hole in the wall diner grease-fest\"  Walking in I changed my mind. I agree with Devin J.  \"It may look like it was over-decorated by the kitschiest of grandmothers...\" but it had a cozy charm to it. And it seemed most of the decore was for sale! The food may not be the healthiest but it was still really good and the servings are gynormous. The staff and even the patrons were all very friendly. Our waitress even gave my niece a hug and kiss on the cheek when she told her it was her 4th birthday. I had the Adam which is biscuits topped with carved ham and gravy and served with potatoes. SO SO SO GOOD! My dad had the chili omelet and was not happy with it. It was bland, no chili taste to it. It looked more like canned refried beans on it instead of chili, but of the four of us, he was the only one not happy with his food."}
{"text":"More than descent portion sizes for the price with wonderful quick service BUT lacking flavor to make this breakfast place distinct. IHOP for example has better flavors."}
{"text":"I used to come here a few years back with my dad when he was still alive. It was one of his favorite places for a good breakfast. My wife had seen this place the other day as we drove past so yesterday when we were discussing whether to make breakfast at home or go out, I decided to come to Ronnie's.  Upon arrival the parking lot was packed. I expected a long wait. However, we were seated in about 10 minutes.  We immediately noticed the knick knacks on the walls. It gave me a \"grandma's house\" feeling. It was very pleasant.   Our waitress was very polite and attentive. Couldn't have asked for better.   My 5 year old ordered a pancake breakfast off of the kids/senior menu. The plate consisted of a pancake bigger than I could eat if I tried, eggs, and a big sausage. She loved it!  My wife had an omelet. I don't know what it was but it looked AMAZING!  I ordered a skillet with eggs, potatoes, chorizo, jalapenos, and tons of cheese. I tried as hard as I could to finish it but I only managed to down half. Flavor is spot on. In fact, it is my lunch today.  This place is an absolute must visit!"}
{"text":"Great prices & good sized portions.  They have an extensive menu that can tackle pretty much any breakfast craving it seems like. First timers here- I ordered the Country Benedict & my fiance got the Eggs Benedict.  My plate was decent, I liked their homefries, but I honestly prefer hashbrowns myself. The benedict for me was good, but the country gravy wasn't knock my socks off spectacular, I've had better. The food didn't take long but when our plates came out the food was just 'warm.'  If you're looking for a cheap, quick breakfast Ithink this is a good option, but it wasn't super memorable for me."}
{"text":"A mound of expertly cooked bacon on my plate? Check. Fluffy, hot, fresh eggs? Check. Friendly service with a smile? Check. This place has everything one would want in a breakfast spot. Including interesting decor/merchandise on the walls and bottomless piping-hot coffee."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meat lovers omelet, I'll definitely be back here.  Only disappointments were the biscuits(dry boring) and they have a watered down off brand of ketchup.  Overall the portion sizes match the price and they get the food out quick, hot, and fresh.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"All this food is disgusting tasted like a mop and mildew. The vegetables look like they came from a frozen bag. The coffee is water and gross. Not recommended at all. Everything I ordered was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"This what u call breakfast!!!!  Family &friendly place awesome. French Toast with a side of bacon eggs, big farmers breakfast just the best."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast because of the reviews and with the wait I was expecting it to be really good. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. The service was fine and the staff was friendly but the food just wasn't very good. Most of it got left on the table. Not really sure what all the great reviews are about."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. It's not the  best but it is affordable and filling. Service is good and organized. This might be your alternative to IHOP or Denny 's."}
{"text":"I love this place.  If you're looking for comfort breakfast food like biscuits and gravy or steak and eggs, and a couple pounds of it, this is your place.  The menu includes French toast, biscuits and gravy, shit on a shingle, about 15 different omelets, steak and eggs, chicken fried steak and eggs, Belgian waffles, breakfast burritos, etc and lunch items. With almost every breakfast, you get real home-style potatoes and choice of bread. If I go here, I don't eat the rest of the day. Every entree is less than $10 and if you come weekdays before 10:30, there's quite a few specials under $5. Awesome feeling to be full all day for less than $10.  I've being coming here for about 4 years and is my go to for a hangover meal or a hearty meal with my dad."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! Had the chorizo scramble and hash browns, with onions and cheese added.   I was disappointed that they were out of cheese grits by the time we got there, but the taters were excellent.  The decor is a bit eclectic, but interesting! The service was excellent! Let them know if it's your birthday and they will gather and sing to you. Very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Today was our first time eating here, the food was amazing, and the pancakes to die for, good job the place was super busy but they still managed to get us in and give us a table fast as well as the food being brought up very quick"}
{"text":"Great food at an affordable price. This is my new favorite place for breakfast.  Beware the pancakes are huge."}
{"text":"My BFF and I just found this place even though he has lived around the corner for 25 years.  Food was fabulous.  I had cheese burger and fries, he had a skillet breakfast with bisquits and gravy.  Waitress was a sweety, helpful and attentive.  Coffee wasn't the best tasting but was served generously.  Prices are great too!  Wish they had cocktails!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast the other weekend. Excellent service, prices are reasonable and the food was very good.  Will be back soon"}
{"text":"There was about a 15 minute wait but totally worth it.  The food is delicious,  the portions are BiG and the staff is friendly. My favorite thing was the cinnamon French toast."}
{"text":"Great food and good portions.  I have had breakfast here several times and the portion is always big.   I love the there and wall decor.   The only thing preventing a 5 stat is the dated carpet and furniture.   All in all, one of my favs."}
{"text":"Been here at least a dozen times and never left disappointed or Hungary.  Great food and service!"}
{"text":"HUGE portions. Come hungry. Food is definitely reasonably priced. Be prepared for a mix of farm/patriotic decor everywhere you look, but don't look for veteran/military discounts. Aside the the orange juice being frozen concentrate (bleh), the food and drinks are tasty. Skillet cooked hash is always a good thing. Even the shit on a shingle is good. Service can be iffy when they're busy."}
{"text":"Never noticed this place because it doesn't have a big pretentious sign.  Had the chicken fried steak for breakfast.  Generous portions and it was well cooked with just the right amount of spices.  The home fries were huge and also well cooked.  Excellent meal for 10 bucks!!!!  The also have lots of specials so I will be returning  to try the other items!  The service was also great, they always checked in  to top off my coffee and water and they were friendly to boot!!! what a PLUS PLUS PLUS PLUS PLUS PLUS PLUS PLUS"}
{"text":"The portions are huge, and for a great price. I got the Meat Lovers Omelet, and it was purely delightful. The Home Fries were great, and is the perfect side for whatever entree you choose. I'm a visitor from CA, and this has to be one of the best breakfast places I have ever eaten at. If you are traveling, you should consider coming to Ronnie's for breakfast. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and it is enough food that you can eat breakfast for the next 2 days. The staff is also wonderful and attentive even though they are busy"}
{"text":"Went here today for breakfast our 1st time, walked in and behind the counter was an older lady she just looked at us, I smiled & a waitress said are you here to meet someone? We said no, then she walked away.    So the older lady just looked at us and I was confused, I thought maybe we are to seat ourselves.   A different waitress said how many we said 2 and she walked away.  A different gal came and said 2 and looked so confused to where to seat us, she took us to a table but held our menus looking towards back of resturant to seat us there but then put down our menus.  Then our waitress walked by and said I'll be right with you. Came back for our drink order.  I ordered the Cinnamon French Toast I didn't taste any Cinnamon it was a lot of egg and their syrup is in a Dirty Root Beer Bottle and is hard to come out.  My hubby got the Chili Omelet with the Home Fried Potatoes which where very undercooked, some where still half raw.  Our waitress never came back to our table she dropped off our food with the check.  I wanted a fill up on my coffee our waitress was no where to be seen, so we flagged down a different waitress.  Our plates where sitting there forever and we noticed other tables weren't picked up either.  The bathroom always had a line, I tried to go but it was locked and smelled from the outside so I didn't even bother.  The manager looked so tired and worn down like she didn't want to be there.  The Hostess looked bored and mad the whole time,  she never smiled.  It looks a bit dirty.  It takes forever to pay your bill. On your bill they don't even add the total,  so the old lady has to figure it out in her head so that takes a while and when I went to pay our bill the machine ran out of paper.  Very outdated  Won't be going back  Needs New Manager, New Hostess and New Cashier"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Went around 9 and the place was packed, good sign, but the food came out quickly and fresh. I got the skillet and my dad got the country Benedict. The ingredients aren't anything special but it was great diner food for a good price."}
{"text":"Love eating here! Place is great and every person I've brought here loved it too. There big farmers breakfast is good and their strawberry pancakes is awesome, enough to feed 2-3 people."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast based on the reviews, mistake.  I was seated by the front door away from everyone, felt isolated.  Ordered french toast combo, eggs--warm and greasy, french toast--one slice warm. one slice so cold the butter won't even melt, bacon--over cooked.   Will keep looking for a breakfast place."}
{"text":"I had a few problems with this place. The bacon that I ordered was a little burned. Also I am not sure what this was about but a employee shouted something that sounded like argument while it was quiet in the restaurant. Other than that the place has got the old feel to it. The French toast was great and the rest of the food was good."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for breakfast or brunch.   I live nearby and knew about Ronnie's for some time, but hadn't occurred to go here until yesterday, after reading some yelp reviews and decided to take a chance.  I was very pleasantly surprised.   I had the country fried steak and white  gravy platter, and my significant other had the western omelet, which I had a taste of.  The portions are great and as to the omelet and country fried steak, they were very great tasting, too.  The home fries are the best.  Between the two of us, we had 2 large breakfasts for under $20.   Go hungry, because you will have leftovers.  The people next to us ordered pancakes, and they were the size of the entire plate.    The waitress was very attentive and very polite, the food was delivered fast (I would say within 15 minutes after we ordered it, or less)and we were seated right away, even though it was very busy.    This was a great experience for both of us, and we will be back soon!   I highly recommend Ronnie's."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure why this place gets such good reviews.... The food is pretty mediocre. The portion sizes are out of control. I ordered the breakfast burrito with no sausage...it came out and had sausage in it...boooo. Oh well. I only ate maybe a third of the thing because it was so massive. The flavor was pretty bland...nothing exciting. The BF got biscuits and gravy and a pancake and thought they were really good. I thought they were also pretty meh. I will say the service was excellent and our waitress was very friendly. I wouldn't go back here on my own, but I wouldn't completely refuse to go back here if the BF wanted it again."}
{"text":"Eggs and extra potatoes, with jalepenos in the potatoes. Red gunslinger sauce to cover my plate in spicy goodness is how I like it. I get my protein and spicy and crunchy potatoes fried to perfection. Oh ya and rye toast with no butter. They are my taste buds and I give them five stars."}
{"text":"Great power breafast at this West Valley favorite. They have a number of daily specials. Top sirloin steak and eggs with potatoes and toast is just $7.99. Food was great, service was exceptional, coffee is hot and place is clean. Lots of working folks and regulars. I have been here 5 or 6 times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Drove into the Phoenix area and was looking for some good local home cooking. I was very please with the omelette I ordered and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place  Great food  Excellent service Smiling faces Family atmosphere  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for breakfast....eeehh. Then again for breakfast but I had lunch....which was good.  I chicken sandwich was huge and the fries where really good.   We also had coupons so it made the meal even more affordable. When we get more coupons we will re-visit, LOL."}
{"text":"Huge portions (plates can be shared by 2 people easily). Delicious food and good service."}
{"text":"My wife & I come to Ronnies frequently.  The food and coffee are very good and plentiful.    Their food is heavy calorie wise.  We try to watch our weight but their fare does not help.  they really need to add a few light calorie items.  Other restaurants that did not did not survive.  I don't think Ronnie's would but they need to fill out their menu with some lighter fare.  We usually get take away boxes and have enough for  breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Friendly atmosphere.  Waitress was very tentative.  Food was amazing"}
{"text":"Husband loved steak and eggs. Pancake was excellent! Hollandaise sauce was horrible! Coffee was yuk. Really good prices!"}
{"text":"I have  to say, Ronnies is a great place to eat if your really hungry because they serve good size portions and it is really tasty ! The staff is in a league of their own, they are freindly and always there for your needs !!"}
{"text":"New to this place, food is good and as everyone says portions are huge... staff is very friendly...   Definitely going back when I am near there.."}
{"text":"Great food..huge portions and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food had good flavor mostly, however it was all luke warm and or cold. The staff wasn't rude however they weren't really welcoming either."}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast place other than Denny's so my daughter and I decided to give Ronnie's a try.. and we loved it! Our server was very friendly and attentive. We both ordered breakfast specials with eggs, bacon, and pancakes. The pancakes were gigantic! And light and fluffy!   They have a ton of specialties on their menu; next time I'll try one of those."}
{"text":"I have yet to walk out of this place hungry. I know when we are going here, you might be rolling me out! They are open for breakfast and lunch and close at 2PM daily. Breakfast are huge and very filling, the pancakes overhang on a regular dinner plate. I love the sandwiches as well, plenty of meat and more fries than you ever need. Reasonably priced and staff is pleasant as well. This is a can't go wrong type of place."}
{"text":"HUGE portions and the food was EXCELLENT!  Wish this place was in my hometown!  The decor is like your grandmas sun room, but for that food I'll deal with it!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time...Service was great. Super large portions of distasteful, low quality food, similar to golden corral quality. Everything was drenched in oil. Coffee was like water. We had to leave fast because we were near the kitchen, that doesn't have doors, and the oil that was in the air burned our eyes :( if you're looking for low quality, unhealthy, large meals with good service this is the place for you. My French toast  and eggs didn't taste like anything, except oil."}
{"text":"You would not expect this place to be that cozy, super hole in the wall breakfast joint you'd find in Heber/Overgaard or Pinetop. The portions are huge, and the staff is awesome. 5 stars for Ronnies."}
{"text":"Omg delicious food,  hag the pancakes,  just get one,  they are giant.  Next visit I tried the country fried steak, their gravy is yummy and their potatoes are flavorful.  Very down to earth homey feel."}
{"text":"OK, so here's the deal. My wife and I discovered the little gem about 4 years ago and quickly became \"regulars.\" At least once a week we were there. Then the Army sent us to GA for two years. All we did was talk about Ronnie's. And the day we got back to Phoenix, we went to Ronnie's and it was like we never left. The portions are huge (my wife and I always split the Paula and Jim's Skillet). My son, who's 15 and a big eater, has yet to be able to finish a whole pancake. But honestly, the best part about this place is the people. All the wait staff are great, the owner is a sweetheart who acknowledges every customer when they come in and again when they leave and the kitchen guys are geniuses. These guys put out all this food in a kitchen the size of a small walk in closet. Overall, the best breakfast in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place offers a bang for your buck. We ordered the French toast meal ($6.25) and corn beef/biscuits and gravy. They brought us more food than we could eat. The coffee was nice and smooth. This is important since I don't add sugar to my coffee. You would be surprised how many places have awful coffee (but I digress). We had a little bit of of wait due to the  high volume of customers, but we were seated fairly quick. I have no complaints about this visit."}
{"text":"WARNING fellow Yelpers! The 4 star rating is very deceptive. If you have ever read any of my previous reviews you know I don't pull any punches. I tell it just the way it is. They served me a rotten smelly piece of yellowing NY strip steak with my breakfast. Had it removed and replaced with rotten smelly sausage links and patties. The gravy for the biscuits had the same stench as the rotten meat. I think they used the juice from the putrid meat to flavor the gravy. The odor was so bad it was triggering our gag reflexes continuously! Absolutely disgusting and ruined our appetite completely. Hoping to salvage some of the food, I scraped my remaining food onto the toast plate so it would not be contaminated by the smelly steak juice. It didn't help! My son could not finish his breakfast either! They did remove the steak from the bill but charged for the smelly sausage. Total for this garbage was over $20. We were both wondering why there were numerous full plates of food on various tables but no customers were seated there. I think after one whiff they just up and left. Good for them...saved a trip to the ER! The busser would quickly scoop them up as they left. After we gave the busser our unfinished plates of garbage you could still detect the smell of rotten meat. YUCK!  No wonder they are dog friendly... They're probably cadaver dogs! Ha ha We prob won't be able to eat a traditional type breakfast for weeks if not months!"}
{"text":"Cute funky diner that reminds me of a Florida diner I would take my dad. Lots of cute things on the wall and patriotic themed decor. Large plates of food. My breakfast of Cinnamon French Toast with Eggs and sausage was good. Nothing to write home about or die over but good.  Better than most diners in town but a bit pricier than a cheapy breakfast place. Nice servers. I would go back to try lunch."}
{"text":"Just got back form Ronnie's Cafe.  Very interesting place. I drive by there several times a week but did not know they were there. Was looking for a new breakfast spot to try this morning and they were close. This was Saturday morning and the place was pretty busy. We was seated within 5 min. of arriving.  The decor is what I wold call unique. Very unique. Almost like waking into a boutique. Many pictures, plates, cups, magnets. Lots of stuff for sale. Or at least there was price tags on the items. Some of the carpentry work looked almost temporary. Nailed in place but never quite finished. Plenty of light and not so loud where you and the person you was with could not talk easily.  The service. We were treated as valued guests. There were several times to fill the coffee cups and to check if you needed anything else.  The meals. This was breakfast. I got their two eggs, potatoes, toast. Not a complicated meal and it was very good. Way more potatoes than I could eat. I got rye toast and it was better than most places I get rye toast at. My wife got the cinnamon french toast. They make the cinnamon bread there and my wife said it was good. They could have a broader selection of syrup.  Conclusion?? Good place eat breakfast. Food is reasonable priced and good. Service we received was very good. Have a nice day Enjoy"}
