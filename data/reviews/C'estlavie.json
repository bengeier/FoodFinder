{"text":"Came for lunch last week and got Euclid Burger. Price was good, Food was delicious. Place look really nice, contemporary design, made me feel like i was not in Cleveland for minute (lol). We try the weekend night soon."}
{"text":"Update: The name of this establishment is very fitting. My group and I decided to wing it and go to C'est La Vie this past Saturday and they were CLOSED!! How or why would a lounge be closed on a Saturday night?! That was definitely my last attempt at visiting C'est La Vie, but hey...such is life!"}
{"text":"Come here everyday for their daily lunch specials . the food is always fresh and very affordable I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Stopped in to C'estlavie for lunch today with a coworker and we chowed down on some reuben wraps with fries as they were the daily special.  Our server was friendly and our drinks were refilled promptly.  The place was empty and unusually decorated, but the lunch specials are nice.  The reuben wrap was hot and delicous.  The portion was a perfect size.  The fries were well seasoned, but under cooked.  They had just a tad too much salt.  With a few minor improvements, this will be an excellent lunch spot.  I'd stop back in again."}
