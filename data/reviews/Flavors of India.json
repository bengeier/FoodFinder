{"text":"Fresh and delicious - very happy to discover this place! We had the chicken tikka masala and aloo gobi. We ordered them mild and they still had a nice kick to it but not too spicy for us. The chicken was moist and nothing was greasy or heavy."}
{"text":"We order 2 plates chilly chicken, but it is so hard to find chicken in it.  They cooked it with 75% of onions,  capsicum and 25% of chicken.  They should change dish name, it should be \"chilly capsicum\" instead of \"chilly chicken\".  Worst dish!!!   Don't ever order chilly chicken here."}
{"text":"Really delicious. The butter chicken is soooo good. The samosas we ordered for an appetizer were really fresh. And the garlic naan is an absolute must addition to any meal. I've tried many Indian places through out the USA, and this is among the best of them. You should go, don't even think twice about it."}
{"text":"We went with friends who love this place.  Incredibly friendly and patient service that presents fabulous, spicy cuisine from India.  Worth trying for a relaxing and sensational dinner."}
{"text":"yeah, went back, still AWESOME.  would like to note, though, that i basically only ever go for dinner, so i'm not hip to the lunch situation."}
{"text":"Poor service cold food not worth at all worse place to eat, They have no idea about indian food and flavors"}
{"text":"Come here for the buffet every once and a while generally bring a coworker or two as I think this place makes for a pretty good introduction to Indian food.  The naan is always hot and fresh, and I haven't tried anything I haven't like yet.  Just leave room for some rice pudding before you go."}
{"text":"Not very good, this was probably some of the worst indian food I've had.  (I've been pretty spoiled)  At one point there was something that was hard in my food and I cringed when I bit down.  I'm not sure what it was.  I'm used to very well flavored Indian food, and the curry was bland. The service was good, and it was inexpensive, but I think I'll try some other local places first before returning."}
{"text":"Service is good Staff are cool and friendly Food taste is okay But still the place is nice and feels comfortable"}
{"text":"Amazing, Every time! I have been going to this restaurant for over 10 years and they have always impressed me.  Being a foody in the valley I find a lot of restaurants under par but my mouth is always happy here."}
{"text":"If I can put -5 I will give it to this rest. They have an open buffet which is bad and old food ,everything even the salad is old in the buffet, if u want to enjoy don't go there because u will leave the rest. And you're  hating yourself because u paid for them"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was poor. Saw a roach near our table. Not my choice for a lunch companion!"}
{"text":"My newest last meal.   When I die, I'm going to miss my crummy Dallas Cowboys and eating. Finally, a place that gives me what I want!!!  Extra extra hot and spicy, extra garlic chicken vindaloo. Get it if you love the spice.    Join me."}
{"text":"I really never cared much for food of India until my friend invited me to go and eat at this wonderful place I tasted the food it was a high quality food for a very affordable price that food is out of this world the only Indian restaurant I really would go to most of the time or invite friends is flavors of India the best I highly recommend this wonderful restaurant you won't be disappointed I know I wasn't disappointed"}
{"text":"Wow... We came from California for a office trip and this place was close to work. first the place was totally empty and owner was peeping out at entry door which was creepy. We thought of giving them a chance and wow food was pathetic. And when we talked with the owner about food, his reply was this is what it is. If u want it eat otherwise u can leave. I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We reached 5 mins before the restaurant was closing  and the owner welcomed us without any tantrums. We ordered paneer masala and dal makhni. The food was amazing in taste and super delicious. The Mango lassi was perfect what I always wanted. The best part was their hospitality which was really great. Over all I would definitely visit this place if I visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"Just searched on yelp and went there with friends. The food was really nice. Liked the chicken makhani that I ordered, my friend ordered paneer masala and it was yummy ! They charge you $0.99 per bowl of rice, but definitely worth it , it had a great taste !! Overall very satisfied with the food, the service could have been better due to which I am going for 4/5"}
{"text":"The Nepali selections are wonderful.  All were nicely seasoned and very tasty.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  This is a nice change from the traditional Indian fare.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Update:   Still going to Flavors of India.  The food is still very consistent, and it's really good Indian food.  I've had the chance to travel a little to parts of Chicago, IL, and nearby Indiana recently, and I have tried their local Indian restaurants, which people raved about.  I can honestly say Flavors of India surpasses those restaurants!  And btw, Gulab Jamun can be served warm or cool.  I prefer cool."}
{"text":"So my sister used to go here with her friends and then suddenly stopped, claiming that there was a cockroach in her food, so naturally I avoid this place... until I get taken here to lunch with some friends...  I'm open-minded, okay? I'm going to try it out and not say anything to my friends about my sister's experience... so here is my take...  We order appetizers, four dishes, lots of food basically. I tried all of it and wasn't impressed. Lack of flavor. Service was eh.   So, highlight of the visit -- the restroom. What do I find? Baby roach, still struggling for life. Disgusting. If there are baby cockroaches in this place, that means they are breeding! More to come! I don't like to pay to eat at dirty places.   Though, they had an extensive vegetarian menu.   But the people here, the customers I mean, eh. They kinda have an attitude of, 'omg, ethnic food.' Pft. I got the vibe it was like a special occasion for them to eat at this dump... I don't know how to describe it, maybe I'm being a jerk but that's what I picked up on...  Why pay a decent amount of money for mediocre (at best) food?"}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to try this place. I went for dinner instead of the lunch buffet. My friend and I shared the appetizer platter, butter chicken, and lamb vindaloo. Everything was piping hot and fresh. Service was timed well even with a large group in the restaurant. Good portions. The appetizer platter and the lamb vindaloo were delicious. The butter chicken was too buttery for my liking. Maybe it is a different style/region of cooking. I am still on the hunt for a place that serves butter chicken that will taste almost like my friend's mother's butter chicken."}
{"text":"I Love Indian cuisine and this place was great!  Good buffet for lunch and friendly service.    I'm a lover of butter chicken and I literally ate like Homer Simpson at a buffet lol ( shows you my age) this and the mango dessert I couldn't get enough of!  They never ran out of food and quickly filled the trays in a timely manner.  This place is worth the drive and you will leave happy.  I did!!!  The buffet is always good to get a sample of different items.  It's also great for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"I try to judge a place by how good it is at what IT does and what they do they do well here. In terms of quick and affordable buffet Indian eateries they seem to have it down.   I work in the area and often need a break from the Biltmore and Esplanade fare. When I head over here I tell the guys in the office and I always have a couple jump to go with me. The guests' first reaction is the same every time; we pull into the strip mall and skeptically get out eyeing the place which is unassuming on the outside to say the least. We open the door and walk in and you get the inevitable, \"Wow it smells good in here\". You are shown your table and asked for your drink order and then asked to help your self. You will find 8-10 entree dishes + salads, chutney and desert waiting for you that has all been consistently fresh hot, well prepared and thankfully light on the heavy cream that all Indian places pour into every dish to make the, um... crackers eat exotic foods. They bring fresh Naan bread (included) to your table and have a full menu available as well.   The place is owner run and they are polite and attentive. Indian movie dance scenes run the background on a TV set a volume that does not interfere with your conversation and you can get in and out quick between meetings if you need to. Your guests who picked carefully on their first trip return to the table with a second, full, plate and eat until they complain they ate too much because it was so good. Lunch for 2 with iced-tea is about $22 - quite deal as well."}
{"text":"Best South Asian food I have ever had outside the time I ate homemade at a Sikh temple. We had the Himalayan meal with three courses and beer for $19. Tip: one is enough for two.  The Nepalese fried potatoes are buttery-tasting, spicy, and slightly sweet. We knee from there we were in for a great ride, but were astonished by the variety and delicacy of the currie vegetables and salad that came our way in the second course, served with buttery naan. The saut√©ed greens (chard?) were my favorite. Capped off with a sweet carrot pudding-type dessert and creamy rice pudding. And after all that we still got chai. The wait staff were friendly and knowledgeable as well. This would easily be a five-plus star review if I could have ha a beer other than Bud lite with the dinner."}
{"text":"I have had excellent luck with this place by always following the same formula.  Order mid-week, get the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Kwarma, order both at least medium, preferably spicy.  Ask for an extra side of rice, I have always gotten it at no extra charge and the portion of entree does require more rice.  Always order Garlic Naan, probably two orders.  This method will easily feed six people, or yourself for a couple days. I can't comment on the complaints expressed by others, as I have never tried Flavors of India their way. My way, I have always been on the verge of food romance pants explosion."}
{"text":"If gas stations sold Indian food, this is what it would taste like.   The Bad I had the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Chicken was tough, the hardest I've ever had. The sauce was watery and I am sure it wasn't made with yogurt. The garlic naan was soggy because they drenched it in a buttery sauce.   The Good The rice and water were ok. The staff was very friendly.   I love Indian food, but this is the worst I ever had."}
{"text":"Looking for a fantastic lunch buffet?? Look no further. Flavors of India is amazing and they have a fantastic mix of old favorites and new flavors."}
{"text":"Tasty when they haven't run out of food on the buffet. Dirty and full of roaches. I wish I had taken my can of Dow Bathroom Cleaner to spray on the mens room door. Health department says they've take legal action. The employees sit at the bar and drink and talk on cell phones and watch t.v."}
{"text":"Great place for some Indian food. The wait staff is very helpful in explaining what all of the dishes are. The Chicken Tikka Masala is a great beginner plate, and the Mango Lassi is a must. Great place, great experience."}
{"text":"Great service and very good food.  We ordered the Lamb Curry, Aloo Mutter, Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan.  Everything was/spiced/seasoned to order just as we requested.  The aroma of fresh garlic from the naan was outstanding.  Great portions and reasonable prices.  Need extra rice and they did not hesitate and did not charge.  Will definitely be back for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"So on the spur of the moment, I decided to stop into Flavors of India for lunch today as I was driving by... I love Indian food. And with just a couple of exceptions, haven't found much of it in the Phoenix area that I would categorize as great tasting. Unfortunately, this place fell more into the norm of Phoenix Indian food than not.  I wasn't that it tasted bad... It just wasn't particularly awesome or memorable. Excluding the couple of saving graces of the aloo tiki (fried potato & Indian cheese fritters) & kheer (rice pudding), the food was just meh. And with a $10 price tag for the lunch buffet, I think that there are definitely better places for me to spend my lunchtime."}
{"text":"At first glance, I almost turned around and got back into my car. It was in a dark stripmall, everything in that stripmall was closed, etc. The husband and I walked in to an almost empty restaurant, again I almost ran. I'm so glad I didn't. To put it simply...I adored this place! The service was great (not overly attentive but didn't ignore us), the decour was great and more importantly the food was great! I had the lamb Marsala (mild) and found it delicious. My husband enjoyed his meal too. This place is definately on our list of places to go."}
{"text":"On occasion I crave Indian food. This is not the best, nor the worst I've had but I too concur that FOI isn't at the same level as it has been in the past. The servers and preparers are exceptionally polite and lovely, but the food was not as flavorful and savory and I remember. As I pick at the mango pudding and the carrot pudding (which seems like a dessert that is sweetened and full of butter) I will go over the highlights and lowlights of my culinary adventure- I enjoyed the spinach/cheese mixture; one of my go to dishes. The chicken tikka was ok, and the tandoori chicken was a \"B\". On the flip side, the assorted fritters had seen fresher days and the vegetarian/cabbage dish was not very flavorful, IMHO even with the big caraway seeds. The seeds were huge - to the point I was routinely picking them from my dish. Kudos to Yelp which enabled me to have another helping of mango pudding as I write this. Seeing how there are/were several Indian diners here, it can't be too bad."}
{"text":"Excellent food...nice and spicy (when requested)! We have gone twice and being Indian...I can recommend this place as a good source for a buffet and selection of food. The malai kofta is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's going on with Flavors of India.  The last few times we went there, it was mostly empty and it just didn't feel good to eat there.  The food was okay but the experience was not enjoyable. Too bad...we used to enjoy it.  But based on my most recent experiences, I just can't recommend it anymore. :("}
{"text":"I only stopped in for takeout.  The employees were very helpful and attending while I waited.  The restaurant was slow to middlin' for a Friday evening - but the smell was mouthwatering from the parking lot.  My food was fantastic and the nice sized portions ($11 or so for my meal, plus rice and nan) afforded me lunch the following day.  We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. Very nice atmosphere and awesome service. The food was delicious too. I took my vegetarian friend here because he didnt know how many amazing (and flavorful) vegetarian options Indian food offered. It was a superb experience. ^_^ We came for dinner but they have lunch buffet too. All in all a pretty neat place."}
{"text":"One evening I had a huge hankering for some Indian food. This restaurant was the closest, so I thought I would give it a try. Upon sitting down I noticed the interior of the restaurant definitely needed some work ... nothing really looked like it goes together. During my meal the employees were still working on cleaning up the lunch buffet. This seemed somewhat unprofessional. It also made me question their level of cleanliness. For my meal I ordered the garlic naan, chicken vindaloo, rice. The naan was somewhat thin/soggy then what I was expecting. The spice and flavor of the vindaloo was perfect, however there seemed to be a lot potatoes in it. Portions were what I expected. Excellent service. My bill came to $17 plus tip. Due to the ambiance and the average quality of the food I would have been content with a bill around $12. But with it coming closer to $20, I would have expected slightly larger portions or improved interiors or some stellar tasting naan. I would only give this place a second chance in order to try out their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Best authentic Indian food! Best lunch buffet everyday special only $10-$12!! We love the authentic feel of the restaurant and the genuine hospitality from all the employees and owners!! I'm so thankful for the amazing quality and big large portions. Thank you keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners are so very nice. I've been here a few times, quite frequently when I was pregnant, loved the spices. We come here more often for dinner because during lunch they mostly do buffet and I prefer ordering off the menu.  Last week we went with a party of about 14 for some family birthdays. All of the food came out hot, together and delicious! My parents who never eat this style of food really enjoyed themselves and the food. I have a 9 month old daughter and the hostess was so sweet she asked if I wanted her to hold her while we ate and my daughter just loved her. I don't see that happening at an Applebees:)  Sometimes I'll admit I have no idea what I am ordering such as this particular evening but it was the Himalayan Chicken dinner for 2 and it  was incredible tasty. Mostly it was lentils, chicken deep fried, fermented beans, rices and and Indian version of pot stickers which were my fav.  They have Taj mahal beer which washes away the spice with ease. You can order any spice level you prefer. The Naan is wonderful as well, the best around!   If you like Indian/Nepali this place is a must try but  go for dinner first because I think the buffet is good however one gets a fuller experience with dinner. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the buffet.  I like the dinner menu a lot, and the Bollywood videos.  Quick tip most Indian restaurants will serve the mild version for us Westerners unless you specifically ask otherwise.  I can't blame them given the bland tastes of most Sonorans.  My mom actually had a conversation with an Indian woman recently about this place.  The woman said that she kept trying other restaurants but kept coming back to this one because of the authenticity.  I consider that a pretty good recommendation.  Although I imagine what is considered \"authentic Indian food\" varies from one region of India to another."}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet. The food was tasty, but not spicy, and much of it was lukewarm. It was about 50-50 meat and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Phoenix for sure! Our favorite is the Chicken Korma or Tikka Masala and Naan. My folks were in town and my dad loved it so much, we only ate lunch here for the week, seriously. It is a family-run business and they've treated us well and know us by name, which I love."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. Not an original comment, but it describes my sentiments. I think the place is pretty authentic -- without leaving with a smell of curry.   I love the Tikka Kabab Kandhari (boneless chicken comes out a-la-fajitas-style - sizzling with onions) and I order Nan and a side of the yogurt cucumber sauce. Then I make myself Nan tacos. (I hope I'm not making anyone cringe - but it's great and there's no food better than one you can eat with your hands!)   The location is odd, but I guess, after 3 years of being out here, I'm getting use to restaurants being in strip malls. The price of the food is reasonable - especially for dinner.   I took one of our Australian friends, who had recently moved to the States from London. He loved the food, and was thoroughly engage in a conversation with our waiter about cricket. (I kinda zoned out and watched the Bollywood music videos until they finished.)   Great place. Try it!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, but mainly at dinner.  Dinner Has always been great, great waiters and staff, with a LCD TV playing almost famous famous bolywood movies.  LOL  It cracks me up when they dance.....LOL...anyhow, Great vegetarian choices for people who eat there veggies, but trust me, I am a MEAT eater,  Chicekn Tika masala, Little dry but still good.  My favorite is there Palak Paneer. Great for the vegetarian.  I have also tried there lunch Buffet for 11.00.  I give a Thumbs up..  Good, serve yourself, and pig out!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious lamb curry, chicken naan, mango yogurt and freshly prepared samosa. Not sure why it is getting negative press; very pleasant Saturday night meal."}
{"text":"It's fine. The dining area is too dark and the lunch buffet is mediocre. I have a feeling dinner is a better bet than lunch, but haven't had the desire to bother given the mediocre service and lack of options at lunch."}
{"text":"i come to your restaurnat and was nice feeling,"}
{"text":"Just finished with the lunch buffet here and I must say they exceeded my expectations. The service was great and the food was better. I will definitely go back and order off the dinner menue. If thd buffet was this good I'm sure the dinner items can only be better."}
{"text":"Their food is very good but i give Service at about a  6 and that's basicaly because they do not listen to those that come to eat there.  I've asked and asked for some sort of hot spice to put on my food because I know what I like.  I'm constantly told \" oh no we don't carry that here\". Now just because of that, which is important to me, my wife and I only go there when the other two are closed. Sorry but I feel if I'm going to come to a place to eat and spend my money they should try to give good service."}
{"text":"Last night 9/19/2015 was the second time I had eaten here. The first time was a long time ago and I remember the food was good, the staff as being a bit rude and the restaurant itself was a bit warm inside.  Last night was wonderful all the way around.  Upon entry we were warmly greeted, exchanged pleasantries and were promptly seated. We got our waters and bread quite quickly and our orders were taken shortly there after. I got the chicken tikka and my partner got the lamb vindaloo we shared some garlic naan. The dining room was not crowded as it was only about 45 minutes to closing time. We received our food in an average amount of time and it was TOTALLY delicious, the portions were large and I have NOTHING negative to say about my most recent visit. In fact it will become a regular in my restaurant rotation due to its incredibly convenient location. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Love their buffet. Owner is very polite and welcoming.  Food is great. Price is reasonable Must try Chola curry, naan roti, kheer and gulabjamun. Meat dishes are the best"}
{"text":"Visited 4/12/13: Terrible service and even worse food!  I went for a dinner for 2 on a Friday night. The decor was ok but that was it.  We decided to try the Thakali Thali which is listed as a \"set meal\".  The waitress didn't know anything about what the set meal was, what our specific meal consisted of, how much food there would be, or anything. She had to go to the back room THREE TIMES to get help, and even then she didn't have answers to our questions.  She didn't know how many drinks came with the meals, and if it was enough for two people.  The diet coke didn't come out until the meal did, and it was warm.  The food was bland, flavorless (bad for a place called Flavors of India).  The daal was BURNED. It smelled burned and tasted worse.  When we told the waitress, she didn't understand what we meant. The manager offered to get us another dish. It took 10-15 mins and it came back watered down and JUST AS BURNED. The goat was terrible. The chicken shahi korma was flavorless, like they just boiled chicken and plopped it in sauce.  To make matters worse, TWO other tables there at the same time either got bad food or were ignored. One guy and his kid waited over 30 mins to get served, and they were clearly on a time crunch.  I am Indian and I know Indian food. This was horrible food.  I can handle poor service as long as the food is good. This food sucked. I left them a ZERO tip and wrote on the back of the bill how I felt. Hopefully they can fix this because they are giving Indian food a TERRIBLE name.  I will NEVER go to this place again, and I will actively tell my friends NOT to go here."}
{"text":"Great dinner and reasonable prices. Server gave us lots of attention even though the place was packed. We've come here several times and also been happy. Glad we live close."}
{"text":"I love Indian food although I cannot eat it everyday since the spices and my stomach don't get along very well. But when I do get my monthly Indian fix it better be good taking into consideration the next couple of won't be pleasant for me. Flavors of India does the trick for me and their food and flavors are awesome and unique.  Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"These one star reviews don't ring true to me and my wife. We LOVE this place.  Great service and food, period. It's a little pricey, but not horrible."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to Indian restaurant. I've been a customer here for ten years and have always come back because of the great food and service. Last night, both the food and the service were sub-par. We ordered the garlic naan, which was inedible due to having so much raw garlic it made my eyes tear. Next, we ordered the vegetable appetizer assortment, of which most was inedible being either burned or too salty. The only item on the plate that was edible were the samosas. The shrimp biryani and shrimp tikka masala were average, with the tikka masala tasting as if it had scorched in the pot. We waited over half an hour for our entrees to appear after getting our appetizers. We had to ask for clean plates for our entrees, because our entree plates held the remains of the garlic naan and appetizers. The waitress never questioned why we didn't eat the garlic naan or the vegetable appetizers. We weren't the only party who received bad service. There were only two other parties in the restaurant at the same time as us, and one of the others had to flag down the waitress to get their check and then again to pay it. It's really hard for me to justify paying a little over $50 for dinner for two, since half of the food was inedible. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I always come here to eat! It's really good food espically the buffet menue! Inlaws always cater here ! Prices are awsome too !"}
{"text":"Bada bing, bad food and great service, decor is also a little different but okay, won't be returning!"}
{"text":"I have a few Indian food haunts and this is one of my favorites. I do like the Chicken Tikka Masala and also the Vindaloo. The garlic naan is GREAT! It's good to eat in or for take out as well. If it's take out they are really fast which is nice. Love it!"}
{"text":"What can I say. The ambiance is fantastic. The restaurant is clean. The service is friendly.  And the food...spectacular. I prefer going during lunch for the buffet...which is a rarity for me, since I typically loathe buffets. But this restaurant's buffet is packed full of flavorful choices; from the chicken to the vegetable or potato pakoras.   On the dinner menu, my first choice is the chicken vindaloo. Just superb.   On a side note, you should check out their music videos playing on the two tv screens. (Again, this is against the grain for me, since I usually loathe and rant about any restaurant with tv!) Sometimes the videos are so lurid that they're addicting to watch! They're all the same with the same theme: Man falls in love with girl. Girl dances and acts coy. Man sings to woo her. Man gets girl. The end. lol  Flavors of India is a gem. Lunch or dinner, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The all-you-can-eat buffet is the best value in town! I just love the onion bhagis and potato pakoras. I believe there are always at least 2 chicken dishes and a tandoori chicken, the standout was the chicken keema aloo. I'm not a big fan of okra, but what they did with it and onions was very nice and subtle. They also had a squash dish that had nice, firm pieces of yellow squash in a wonderful sauce. This was also the first time I tried their dessert; it was gulab something: perfectly round balls of fried deliciousness in a hot, syrupy goodness. I could just have these for breakfast like pancakes! I didn't even get a chance to try their condiment bar. Trust me, you will leave very full."}
{"text":"best lunch buffet in town. only $10. my favorite place."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them negative 5 they have the worst service and inferior food quality... I found this place on DOOR-DASH and decided to give them a shot...in a nutshell no forks no napkins no rice...and when I called to find out what happened no respect....so that means NO BUSINESS from me or any one I know... they're to many great Indian restaurants in Phoenix to compromise and eating here is definitely a compromise!!!"}
{"text":"Best pakora we've ever had, but everything else was just ok. Good quality but kinda bland in flavor. Definitely no spice / heat factor. They only serve regular naan not garlic for the buffet."}
{"text":"The food is pretty tasty, no complaints there.  The atmosphere is quiet and a little awkward at dinner time. Also, I asked for a side of chutney and they charged $3 for a little cup.  It really feels like you are being nickled and dimed. It isn't really a good value either.  I would recommend taking the food to-go or maybe going at lunch."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. The service is always wonderful, the food is consistently delicious, and my husband loves the BollyWood videos. How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Time has not been kind to Flavors of India.  I just went back for dinner after a couple of years of inadvertently overlooking this place.  It appears that the management has changed and FOI is not better for it.  Perhaps the lunch buffet is still a good deal for the quality and quantity of the food they serve.  For dinner, it's offensive to charge $.99 for a side of rice to go with an order of Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's not an issue of the cost, but the principle of the matter.  Obviously, I'm going to order the rice.  Just up the price of all the dishes by a buck and throw us a bone with \"free\" rice.  And nearly $3 for a bowl of soupy Raita?  They need to change the name of this place to Nickel and Dime.         Farewell, Flavors of India, farewell!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awful. The portion sizes they give you is incredibly small. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it literally came with 4 small pieces of chicken. I asked the server to give more chicken and he simply scooped up more sauce and dumped it into the dish. They also mislead us in thinking that the meals were not spicy when they actually were! I would recommend any other place but this one for Indian food."}
{"text":"After 2 months, we went back to Flavors of India.  The waitress that I was very unimpressed with was there, but I figured we would put up with her because my son and husband wanted Indian food.  Either she's read my review and wanted to prove me wrong or she was having a very off day because this time she was very good.  the food, as always, was excellent!"}
{"text":"A wonderful new discovery. The buffet is exceptional in addition to the extensive menu. Each item is prepared and served with care and attention to detail. You are treated like a long awaited friend. As a bonus, they proudly sell Kingfisher beer to compliment their complex flavors. Stop in and get happy"}
{"text":"Authentic North Indian tasting food. outstanding service. Cleanliness. Welcoming warm people. one of the best I have had"}
{"text":"This was the Indian restaurant I would often frequent when I lived in Phoenix. The three stars I give this place reflects my mixed feelings about it. I tend to gravitate to Indian restaurants that offer excellent lunch buffets, as it gives you the opportunity to sample multiple dishes. The buffet offered at Flavors of India is just okay, but often a little on the bland side. I do enjoy their samosas, vegetable pakoras, and tandoori chicken, but most of the entrees offered at the buffet are underwhelming. The story changes, however, when you order items from the menu and ask for them on the spicy side. Their mutter paneer and aloo gobi are excellent and nicely spiced. My personal favorite here is the baigan bharta, which is spicy fire-roasted eggplant with onions and peas. The taste of it is just out of this world. This is a great place for take-out, where you can order items to your specifications."}
{"text":"Chicken Tikka Meh-Sala ------------------------- Hey! An Indian restaurant in central Phoenix! How about that? Awesome, right?  Um. Don't get too excited, O.  I get seated in a booth by the front door and survey the scene. Groups and dates of people eating. Flat screen panel showing a sequence of 2006's most craptastic Bollywood videos. Bar stocked with Johnny Walker Black Label, because if you're Indian, that's what you drink. Mango lassi is for wusses.  I order ground chicken samosas, boneless chicken kebabs, and lamb vindaloo with rice, naan, and raita. Complementary papadum and chutney is placed on my table. Soon after 4 dinky samosas arrive on a small plate. They were ok. Meh is more like it.  Then I wait a LONG time (20+ minutes) for my entrees. I know grilling chicken takes a while, but these were small boneless pieces - I know it's not supposed to take longer than 4 music videos of Indian hero boy and Indian heroine girl disco dancing in the forest and then all of a sudden a rainstorm and her sari is wet....  ....where was I? Oh yeah. People who came in and ordered 10-15 mintes after I did received their food within 8-10 minutes. That kind of annoyed me. I seethed a little, but only to myself, because I'm suave like that.  Eventually my dinner shows up. Chicken pieces in a sizzling platter. Vindaloo served in an antique metal bowl. Good on the presentation, I'll give them that.  The naan was crisp, which is a good plus, because the divine whomevers ruling the universe will strike upon those, the evil misguided purveyors of the Earth's soggy, limp naans. Oh, they will be struck down, mark my words.   The chicken, for it taking so long, was very tender and juicy but really mediocre tasting. Mediocre to the point where I recognized the jarred tandoori sauce they marinated the chicken in. So not good to do, my Indian restaurantering friends.   The vindaloo was alright...but with really small cubes of lamb and potatoes. I asked for them to make all of my food really spicy, because, well, I'm brown like they are and that's how we roll. But they took it as to make it as bland as possible. Maybe they thought I was an 87-year old English man named Alistair for whom even a sprinkle of crushed black pepper would set his mouth on fire. Who knows.  What I do know is that I was disappointed something huge. An Indian restaurant so close to where I live, and yet so debatable whether if I'm ever going to go back.  So two stars (maybe a little greater than two, like two-and-a-third) for the Indian food and Indian service equivalent of  beige. Decent ambiance and friendly host-owner, though, so hey, if you're in the 'hood and are hankering for some curried meh, you've got your ideal place right here. You can thank me later by performing your own Bollywood video."}
{"text":"I have always been curious about this place, but I feel most wouldn't because of the outside appearance. The service here is OUTSTANDING. Very friendly and very efficient!!! That alone will send me back :) It is very cozy and quiet inside. They have a dish that sizzles and steams a lot when brought out so it has a fun presentation. Food is definitely good. Not exactly outstanding, but enough to keep me coming back. Five stars!"}
{"text":"I woke up late on a Saturday, and I was craving Indian food! To my relief, it was almost lunch time! I remembered that there was an Indian restaurant close to me that I had been meaning to try. I headed to Flavors of India to try their lunch buffet. I walked in and I was immediately greeted. I noted the Bollywood videos playing in the background, I love those dang videos. The host was also my waiter. He invited me to help myself to the buffet. I'm not one of those people that knows the names of each and every dish. As I write this I'm kicking myself for not taking notes. As a whole, the buffet was a-ok. Nothing in particular knocked my socks off. I did notice that nothing was powerfully flavorful. It was kind of a \"safe\" seasoning restaurant. I would visit Flavors of India again. There was plenty of food, the buffet had a lot of variety, and the service was good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the lunch buffet! Everything was so flavorful. Huge menu to choose from also. My favs are Mango Lassi & the rice pudding. Definitely will be back to try dinner here."}
{"text":"Flavors of India is a good small business in westside for himalayan indian food.   At the first glance in the hall, I was impressed to see all locals (not indians) in an ethnic food place. This is usually not a very sign if I am looking for a traditional indian place, most of these places later their recipes to suit the local taste. The server informed us that the chef is from Bhutan, a small himalayan country north east of India. I was excited to have a chance to eat some of the Bhutanese food now.  Ambiance is quite nice. One thing I admire about this place is that no loud bollywood music in the background, instead nice soothing classical indian music. Server was a very nice man who was extremely polite and helpful with menu.  We orderd one of the vegetarian fixed place which was enough for two people and costs only 11$, good deal. Food was different but good tasting. We could not finish the whole thing and had enough left over for next day. The only negative thing was the dessert, it was bad and most likely out of the box.   Overall a nice Himlalayan place for good food!"}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food in Phoenix. The menu is huge, the takeout is quick and always fresh.  The only Indian restaurant that does \"Indian spicy\" correctly.   It is a little quiet, and could do with more ambience, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a couple years now. The Buffett, takeout and sit down. There is always a smile with the service and the food is too notch. We have noticed how good and fresh the spices are. Defiantly check them out!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Indian food. This place just doesn't cut it. Recently I was here and ordered my usual chicken tikka masala and asked for it HOT! Well, what came out was more like an over sugared tomato sauce. It was almost inedible. When we approached the server to tell her it was too sweet she tried to tell us that \"that's the way tikka masala tastes\". Ummmm, negatory good buddy. Nice try though.   We also got lamb korma and the meat was really, really tough. Sauce was decent.   For what you get and the price (side note: why the H is Indian food so expensive?!?) it's not worth it.   I don't recommend this restaurant. There are too many other amazing Indian places in the Phx area. You money and time are better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love them!  Whether it's take out or dining in.  It's amazing!  My first time trying to Flavors of India I ordered take out, a yelp recommendation   It was almost 9pm and I had a craving for either Caribbean food or Indian Food.  I Yelped Jerk chicken first, nothing in my area and opened during that time.  So I yelped Indian food.  Flavors of India came up .. with only 3.5 stars.  I wasn't intimidated by the 3.5 star review because I really had a craving so I gave it a try.  SO GLAD I DID!  I ordered chicken samomas, and chicken marsala to go.  The lady on the phone said it'll be about 20 mins.  I only live about 5 minutes away.  I left my house in 15 minutes.  Everything was ready, hot and waiting for me when I arrived.  The chicken samomas were so hot that I couldn't bite into them at all!  It was poppin hot!  No worries, that's such a good sign!  The minute I got home I opened the chicken marsala, put in on a plate and feel in love.  My eyes rolled in the back of my head as I chewed.  My heart smiled and my stomach was full after I finished my meal.  This was a Friday evening.  The portions sizes are huge.  I had plenty of leftovers for lunch Saturday for me AND enough to share with my boyfriend at the time.  He loved it!  The next weekend, the next Friday.  He said ... Let's go back to that India place you went to last year.  I said sure.  We dined in this time, shared chicken simosas and both of us ordered different chicken dishes.  I don't remember the name of either dishes but it wasn't chicken marsala this time, but it was served sizzling and saucy.  It's allll about the sauce ... and the bass   That was from a song I think! We also shared the Indian house beer.  It was light and paired so well with the chicken.  I highly recommended Flavors of India to everyone."}
{"text":"So good! I went with my family (including some toddlers) and everyone LOVED the food. Great options for sharing and overall fun experience!"}
{"text":"so the wife and I love to get Indian buffet at this place. The food is always fresh, the service is always good and BONUS*** They always play those Indian music videos with everybody dancing!!!    I prefer doing the buffet thing because I only know a few dishes that I like. It's about $10 a person, and you will not leave hungry. The Tandoori chicken here is the best I've ever had and they have plenty of vegetarian dishes, if that's your bag. I sometimes get buffet takeout, and eat Indian food all day for about $10. If your looking for some good Indian food or never tried it and are looking for some variety, this is the place!"}
{"text":"The food was flat and not overly fresh. It is worse than its Uptown competitors by far. The portions, however, were generous, but that does little good if the food isn't great. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I am in Phoenix for business and I always have a craving for Indian food. I asked around the office where I could find some great Indian Food! I am pretty simple when it comes to indian food, all I want is butter chicken rice and naan oh and Mango Lassi. I ordered the food to go and was so excited to get back to my hotel room to devour this food.   To my surprise, the butter chicken taste like Tomato soup with chicken in it. I know the butter chicken is a tomato base but this butter chicken was not very good. Maybe I went on a bad day."}
{"text":"Was in the area and hit this place for lunch today. Every thing was very good, especially the nan which was brought to my table fresh and hot.  I have eaten here many times before but not lately. Some days they have stuff I like better than other days but it is always pretty good."}
{"text":"I actually used to eat here when it was Kashmir Palace.  Seeing it under new ownership I had to give it a try.  I ate buffet and I will always acknowledge that buffet isn't the best example of the made-to-order food from the menu.  Having said that, the previous ownership had an awesome buffet.  This buffet now isn't necessarily bad, but it's not great.  It's just kind of good.  What really ruined it for me is the dirty water glasses.  I tend to discredit the entire establishment when they can't serve clean water.  Makes me wonder about the conditions in the kitchen if the best glass you can give a customer has stuff floating in it.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Top 10 (maybe even top 5) best meals I've had in Phoenix. If I'm being honest, the generic name kept me away from this place for years, but I am thrilled I finally decided to check it out. We had the chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, samosas, naan, and garlic naan and every single bite was delicious. The staff gave us just the right amount of attention and allowed us to take our time as we enjoyed the delicious meal. Prices are what you'd expect for your portions, but flavors go beyond expectations! I highly recommend this place and will surely be adding it to my list of most frequently visited restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"This appears to be a family owned restaurant.  The food is very very good.  I had the lunch buffet.  It didn't have as much variety as some, but everything I tasted was fantastic.  They could make my review a 5 star review by communicating a little better.  Two suggestions:  1.  When you seat someone, ask them if they are there for the buffet.  If they are, tell them to pick up a plate and start.  2.  Sometime during the lunch, let the customer know that they just need to pay at the register when they are done.  I waited for a check that wasn't coming."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food, the vegetarian entrees and naans were prepared really well and great service! Would definitely visit again next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ordered take out so I cannot say anything about the service. I got chicken tikka masala, vegetable pakora, garlic naan, and side of raita.   Chicken tikka masala was delicious---especially for here in Phoenix. It's hard to find good Indian food around here. This is the best in the surrounding area.   Vegetable pakora was pretty good.   Garlic naan was a bit soggy. Could be better if you ordered it in house.    Raita was flavorless---I'm from Chicago so I've had some really good ones. Wasn't bad. Just not worth the money. Maybe ok if you need to cool down the spice in your meal but not if you're adding flavor.   Overall would have given 5/5 if just judging on the chicken tikka masala, went down to 4 because of raita and naan."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with Norm R. and Rand H. and after trying almost every indian buffet in the valley ,this one is got to be in the top 5.The buffet itself is layed out nicely and the food is always real good.This visit the onion cauliflower pakora was the big hit ,I could have ate just a big plate of those and been happy. The naan bread that was brought to are table was not the garlic type but was very good as well. The desserts here were great to they had mango pudding with fruit cocktail mixed in and rice pudding. (no monkey balls today)?Anyway it was a great lunch and 5 stars for them today."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm not a huge Indian food fan, but I am addicted to their garlic naan, and spicy vegi dal... Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Have went here for Dinner before, it was okay but not great. Went to lunch buffet and it's terrible.  Not spicy. The dishes taste nothing like they should.  If you must eat here, the Tandoori Chicken isn't bad.  However, if you really like Indian food, stick to Chutneys in Tempe, or the really good Indian Market with a buffet on 7th street near Thomas."}
{"text":"Good solid Indian food. Nice flavors. The space seems a little run down and could use some sprucing up, but the food is good. I've done both dinner and the lunch buffet. I found the dinner much better quality and freshness of ingredients than the buffet."}
{"text":"Great service!! Excellent food! I think I just ate the best chicken dish I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place- went again today and found out they have a goat curry!  How very unique- I enjoyed it, though it probably could have been braised a little bit longer.  Love the buffet and its a good value.  You'd never find it except for Yelp- great find guys.  Hope they do well- they deserve it.  Nice to get cultural food in North Olmsted."}
{"text":"The take out biryani was good! The lunch buffet was AWFUL! AWFUL! Dry chicken. Bland sauce. Everything was lukewarm. No paratha until we were almost done. Very difficult to get service, although the server was very nice. Would NOT go again for the buffet, but WOULD order the take out."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years over multiple owners.  The service has always been good, lunch buffets fantastic! When I worked in the area I stopped in once a week for lunch or dinner and always had a very fresh and flavorful meal.  Great place to stop for good Indian food."}
{"text":"The bread served was either left overs from other customer or was eaten by some rodent , when we brought this issue to staffs notice ,  The staff was very very rude . when we asked for owner , The owner itself was rude and asked us to never visit the restaurant again .  So be careful what you eat"}
{"text":"So I just moved to Phoenix not too long ago and have been trying out new places. I love Indian food, and a friend recommended this place. I'd been to other Indian restaurants here and wasn't too impressed. This place was different.  The food was very good, though since I went for the lunch buffet it probably wasn't as fresh as it would have been ordering from the menu. That said, I saw the staff bring fresh stuff several times and it tasted great. The place smelled just amazing- I think my sweater smelled like Indian food for two days (in a good way!). The staff were very attentive and helpful, even though they were obviously very busy, too. Good service, great food and reasonable prices...what more could I ask for? This place is definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I have never eaten in the restaurant and only ordered their food to go. I LOVE Indian food. Did I mention, while I am writing this review, I already placed to go order and will be picking it up shortly. :-)  When I first tried Flavors of India food, I ordered to go and had Chicken Tikka Masala, Basmati rice and Vegetable Samosas.  The chicken was superbly tender, masala was delicious and spicy enough, just how I ordered. Rice was cooked perfectly and Samosas are crispy on the outside and soft inside, perfect!   Excellent service! They make you feel welcomed. I picked up food from this place several time and always had great experience. It is bit dangerous that they are walking distance from my place as I can't never get enough of Indian food :-)   I can't wait to make it into the restaurant for dining in experience and also want to try their buffet one of these days.   Until then, I highly recommend this place! ~Namaste~"}
{"text":"Walk across the street to Nirvana II and save yourself  the disappointment.   I usually get the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chana Masala (chickpeas) and it has always be just 'OK'.  Last week I order the Chicken Tikka Masala and the gentleman served me two, lousy, small pieces of chicken- overboard on the sauce and rice.  Upon noticing this, I walked back in and asked if this was typical meat portion sizes and he responded 'Yes'.  After giving him the \"really, are you kidding me?\" look, he gave me a few more pieces.    Just not worth the $."}
{"text":"Everything was burned and the samosas were a Joke I'm Indian and this was not good $13.00 for lunch buffet"}
{"text":"Service and Food is R&R!  I make this short and sweet. Lets find the real places in Phoenix and lets support the authentic, creative, and traditional restaurants.   True, it feels a little awkward because of the metaphysical transportation from USA to India. After 10min its like you are in India. Cliche, but lets be honest, if you have have been there its kinda the truth.   Service: Very approachable, knowledgeable and sincere. The table next to us for some odd reason didnt like the food, she said it was \"too different.\" Uh? Ok..its Indian food! Its meant to be different. Nonetheless, the ?manager? insisted on offering dessert. The patrons denied his generous offer multiply times. GREAT SERVICE!! (Our service was *5stars*)  Food: Sadly, I don't know what I devoured because I arrived late and they just placed the food down as soon as I sat down. That being noted, what ever it was ...it was goood!!!!!  The chicken fell of the bone, the sauces were savory and spicy, and the rice was moist.  Well R&R (Recommend & Return)  R \_  NOte: Lock your doors, the Flavors is in a exasperated area."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Indian food albeit an unadventurous one.  I always get the Chicken Korma.  The creaminess of the korma just soothes my soul, especially when it is the right amount of spicy.  And there is garlic naan to be had.  I have been to Flavors three times now and each time I have left with the best kind of fire in my belly and smile across my face.  This place is almost never crowded and the service is pretty decent.  They play Bollywood movies for an added cultural effect."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for food but turned out disappointing. Ordered naan and paneer tikka masala but the confusing menu meant it was paneer tikka dry and not paneer tikka masala with curry that you eat with the bread and the naan-bread was also very very thick. Samosa was decent. Might be a for dine in but i wouldn't recommend for delivery."}
{"text":"Located in an unassuming strip plaza and apparently under a new name, (previously known as Kashmir Palace), Flavors of India Restaurant is fantastic. All was quiet on a Friday evening with a few regulars but the place seemed steady with business between diners and takeout orders.   Prices are fair, food is good quality, an the portions are good.   The services was attentive, but not overly so. The staff continued to check on us, even after we had paid our bill. They made excellent recommendations, and asked pertinent questions concerning our tastes and the spice level.   The menu is nice and has something to please carnivore and vegetarians alike.   I would love to go back during lunch to try the buffet; I always have a hard time choosing my meal and love the idea of trying lots of things!   I would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a good Indian meal!"}
{"text":"Been into Indian food lately, a friend suggested this place..i was skeptical because its hard to find good indian food places..however once i tasted the food i was delighted, i have finally found my favorite indian restaurant in Phoenix. The food is very flavorful & rich.."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Indian place in the area. Everything I've had has been delicious. You can't go wrong. Samosas, veggie or chicken, tikki masala, vindaloo. It's all been amazing!"}
{"text":"Really good Indian food for bumble-foo Ohio. Highly recommend if you're in Oberlin--it's closer and better than the place across from Crocker Park."}
{"text":"I never thought I would find better food than The Saffron Patch until I ate here!  The food and service is excellent!  I ate here twice this week.  The lunch buffet is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever in a restaurant!  First, the service was lackadaisical at best.  It was very slow to have our order taken, and it took almost 40 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. The food itself was tasty enough, once it finally arrived.  However, the worst part about this meal was the COCKROACH that we discovered on the wall over our table.  Immediately, my friend and I began to point at it and talk loudly. We tried to get the attention of waitstaff for several minutes.  Finally, the cockroach fell onto our table. That was it. We leapt out of the booth and exclaimed \"COCKROACH!\" Is this the worst part of the visit?  NO.  Waitstaff then came over, pulled back the table, squashed the cockroach, and then gestured for us to resume our meal and said \"Cockroach gone.\"   At least the manager comped the meal.  But,  if there is one cockroach allowed to crawl around the dining room TABLES, I can only imagine what the kitchen might look like. I definitely can't imagine going back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided last minute that we wanted to go out to eat last night instead of staying in. Since it was a holiday we didn't want to try our luck at any of the restaurants nearby so we headed over to Flavors of India which is right down the street.   The place was a lot cuter and nicer inside than expected. We were seated right away at a large booth and the hostess gave me a rose for the holiday. They had a special of a large plate of grilled meats for $13.95 which our waiter said was enough for 2. So we split that and also ordered our usuals, Paneek Pakor and Naan. Our waiter also suggested Indian Beer, and I can't remember the name of it, but it was very good.   The food was all very, very good. The naan was much better than the other Indian restaurant we frequent. I can't wait to go back to try my favorites (butter chicken and tikka masala) although everything they had looked so, so good.   I was really impressed overall and I love supporting local businesses like this one."}
{"text":"Sorry, should have gotten to this review; because I am a fan of this restaurant.  Love the Rice Pilao; every time must get this dish.  All the curry dishes are great; especially for someone who dines with people who either don't like spicy or crave spicy dishes; they will adjust to your taste.  Been here about 5-6 different times every time left very satisfied and ready to go back."}
{"text":"I'm finding more and more great places to eat in the central Phoenix area and I can add this to the list,  thanks to fellow yelpers Rand H and Mike C who invited me to join them for lunch buffet here. Seating is ample, with booths available. Lighting is toned down to a comfortable level and the TV screen playing Bollywood dance videos had the sound turned down.  I enjoyed pretty much every item in the lunch buffet. The main dishes were really savory; I especially liked the onion and cauliflower pakora. The  heat level of the dishes that were spicy was just right for me. The two desserts offered - mango pudding and rice pudding - were superb and an excellent way to cap a great meal. Service was very efficient, and the cost of the buffet was 10 bucks, tax included - truly a great deal."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food in North Olmsted. Nothing fancy, but they do the basics really well.   I suggest the lamb vindaloo."}
{"text":"SUPPORT THIS RESTAURANT!  Like many of the reviews have mentioned, Flavors of India has been under new ownership since Jan 2011. Turns out, the restaurant is owned by some friends who are new immigrants to Ohio from the refugee campus of Nepal. As Joe F mentions, they talk about this on their facebook page and their story is quite powerful. After coming to Ohio, they have been able to open up this place and it's my hope that they are able to sustain their business!    They include a delicious Indian menu as well as Nepali cuisine. My bf and I ordered wayyy too much food for 2, but we were happy to take home leftovers. Here's what we ate, family style:  -Vegetable momo - plate of 10-12 vegetable dumplings with a sauce -Chicken chow chow - thin noodles with chicken and a south asian flavor -Himalayan set meal (lamb) - the lamb was cooked perfectly and the spice was very flavorful and good. we asked for medium spicy and it definitely had heat! I loved the potato dish and the cooked veggies. I'm also a huge fan of lentils, and that was really good. The set meal is definitely enough for 2! It came with chai at the end.  The naan was delicious!!!  The owners are very friendly, always checking in with how we were doing. I'm very happy with the place and hope to come back again soon.  For next time: apparently, there's a dish that looks like Taiwanese beef noodle soup, but it's with lamb! My friends have also said that the Indian food is really, really good too."}
{"text":"I feel bad.  This place seems to be much better with vegetarian dishes than chicken (or bread) ones.  Chicken Tikka Masala: Very flavorful, good density, nice portion,  I would get again in a heartbeat...without the chicken, which was overcooked, tough and dry (even sitting in that lovely sauce).  I removed most of the chicken and gave it to the dog.  I should have gotten the Chana Masala...  Tandoori Chicken: Flavorful, well spiced sauce.  Overcooked.chicken (again...)  Dry and tough under the lovely sauce, bell peppers and onions.  Shameful...  Naan Bread: So I think those saying this place uses too much butter on the bread have got it wrong.  They are UNDERcooking the bread and the ingredients are possibly not balanced right!  It is doughy, internally damp and dense.  The undercooking makes it a bit gooey\chewy and not the flat, airy perfection that is should be.  Super disappointment as naan is always delish!  Samosas (non-meat): Delish!  Seriously, even my young daughters liked them - though they thought they were a tad spicy.  I would get again, no problem!  Mango Lassi: Average - I let the girls and my husband finish as I wasn't super impressed.  Ugh, and please keep it chilled!  Aloo, Chole & Paneer: So so good!  Well spiced, right thickness, evenly cooked, wonderful flavor and aroma.  Such a keeper!  OVERALL: Like I said, I think this place needs to learn how to cook chicken and bread.  Then they would be a solid 4.  As is, the more I think about what a travesty all that undercooked, too dense, limp naan bread was, the more I am thinking a 2 is still being kind...  Still looking for a go-to Indian food joint..."}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan.    I'll be honest, I don't venture too far out of my comfort Zone with Indian Food, the above I had is great and I could eat every day.    The Staff is polite, the place is clean, and the prices and portion sizes are perfect.  You get more for what you paid for.    This is now my resident take out place for Indian Food."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, clean and comfortable. Everything on the menu is delicious. They have a great lunch buffet, and large dinner menu"}
{"text":"If you enjoy an Indian buffet, this is your place. This clean, no frills place always has a good number of standard Indian dishes like chicken tikka masala, chicken curry and more. There is always a lentil dish and spinach or Cauliflower.  If I had any complaints, it would be too offer more than an array of chicken dishes and to mix it up more with lamb, beef or fish. However, the spice level is relatively mild and they bring fresh, hot Naan to your table. The staff is very pleasant and service is prompt. If you're in a hurry, this place will have you in and out during their lunch buffet in no time flat.  We will return again and again over the coming years!"}
{"text":"Small Indian takeout spot in Latta Arcade with pretty good food, although my veggie entree was a bit watery.  The naan was fresh which is always important.  I'll probably go back and try something different just to make sure they're legit."}
{"text":"I mostly do take out. I love the food and the service. I have tried a lot of Indian restaurants but their Samosa, Garlic Naan and Chicken Tikka Masala are great.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to drop in for a quick lunch.  Everything is served buffet style, so you can arrive and immediately start eating.  I would give 5 stars, but the service is super slow and getting some naan bread brought to your table can be a chore."}
{"text":"Really loved the papadum they served as the bread! I have a wheat allergy so this a huge perk for me.  We ordered the rice and aloo Chloe as well as chicken tikka Masala and Lam vindaloo.  We like spice, so 7 was a perfect level for the chicken & lamb.  For the appetizer we ordered the onion Bhaji; if you like onion rings, go for it! Delicious.  The service was gentle and attentive and we had a wonderful evening.  Try this place!!"}
{"text":"Have been here about 15 times, and I can offer the following:  affordable,  delicious, and quick/attentive service.  This place has \"it\".  Just go there, don't delay."}
{"text":"Very good tasting buffet with variety! Ambiance and atmosphere is great. Attentive service as well. Did I say the food is good? Yes!"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming from offering refills, clearing plates, and paying the bill. We stopped in for the lunch buffet and it was ok. I am not a big fan of buffets so I will definitely need to go back and order from the menu. I tried a little bit of everything and left full so that is a good sign. They also brought out a basket of naan for the table which was quite good."}
{"text":"Welp,  based on the previous reviews a month ago figured i would try this Indian place. Got there and it's no longer opened.   It is for rent in the plaza it is in.  Drove past it and couldn't initially see it with the lights all out and the for rent sign in the window."}
{"text":"Y'know, I had to give myself a while to get over the figurative gastronomical blue balls I suffered at the hands of Flavors of India.  So here's the scoop.  I'm a business guy. This place isn't much to look at from the outside and there weren't but a couple of cars outside. They've a banner touting their differentiating advantage... \"Ice cold Coca Cola served here.\"  Ok, you have Coke..grand.  1965 is jealous.  But I loooove Indian food & even though I couldn't tell if they served alcoholic beverages, specifically Indian beers, from the online menu (they do) we throw caution to the wind & go on anyway.  We could always leave, right?    So upon entering we're immediately seized by the most pleasant aroma... Imagine the aroma scent finger seducing you to scarf down the big steaks like in Tom and Jerry.   Seriously, I saw that. It smelled delicious.   The gentleman who greeted us was pleasant and I assume the owner.  I've driven by here dozens of times and like I said, I seldom see more than a couple cars here.  Today was no different.  There were a total of 5 tables being occupied.  The people at 2 were eating and 2 were wrapping up in idle chatter.  At first I figured the lone server, who I figured to be the owner's wife as they were close in age, was simply being conscientious in not wanting to rush us to order.  After she passed our table a half dozen times and managed to avoid the eye contact we tried to connect with, we were able to ask what the really good looking food the couple at the booth next to us was.  Maybe it was my imagination, but the answers was curt and she seemed slightly annoyed. Again, as a business person I'd be excited.  Clue: those are buying signals.  We'd been there 10 minutes or so now and hadn't ordered.  Again, there are just 5 booths/tables occupied and all are nestled together in a tight cluster and I'm situated between two of them.  After another 4 or 5 passes from 1 to 3 and skipping me at table two, I wave, say \"excuse me\" and the lady puts up the \"hold on finger\" before I finally get her to let me order a beer and appetizers.  Clue: I'm buying alcohol and appetizers, we're polite and well coifed.  We may be a good table.  The sales guy in me is screaming inside at her inattention by now.  After 25+ minutes and having not been able to order an entree in a relatively empty place, it's a wrap. I ask for the check.  They tell me they were changing over their oil to explain delay. What's that got to do with paying attention to a customer? Nada.  I take the samosas to go and head to one of my fav restaurants instead.  It's a shame really, because I ate one of those samosas in the car and it was damned good. I mean, it was frickin' delicious and I suspect the solid reviews they've had on food would hold up. If only these guys could get selected to go on Bar Rescue to learn to attract and keep new customers."}
{"text":"This place is a run down dump. I felt like l was going to get a mersa infection just sitting at the table. The food is terrible, even for lndian food. The buffet is over priced. There are some great Indian places in Phoenix and this is not one. You can just tell that they do things as cheap as possible and don't care about quality. My guess is that the chef is mexican and not lndian! Move along."}
{"text":"I had a \"bogo\" from my credit card points and was looking for something other then the usual burger type restaurant to try out in Phoenix. Flavors of India popped up and I went with a friend. The decor was nice, service as well and the food ok but I was perhaps hoping for something a tad tastier. It's not located near me and therefore not one I would put on my \"let's drive to xyz\" for dinner but if you're in the neighborhood it's good enough to make it your \"local Indian restaurant\". Look forward to discovering more in the Valley and seeing if I was wrong in my first assumptions."}
{"text":"It was a nice restaurant. Coming from bay area what surprised me was extra money for salad, extra chatnis etc. Food was pretty good when i compare it to india delhi palace. What we ordered: Dal tadka: was pretty good Gobi Manchurian: was hopeless Paneer was tasty   All in all the food was good and i would recommend people going to Phoenix to have food at this place once."}
{"text":"Bad restaurant.... Never come again Food was very bad... Don't come here We came from California and owner was so rude"}
{"text":"Love to come here for the lunch buffet when I'm in the area. Great Chicken Marsala and Naan. Service is great to."}
{"text":"The food tasted very old. Rice was had hard pieces in it, as if it was from the day before. Chicken was dry as if it was frozen and then re-heated.  The water container that they filled with water. had stuff floating in it. It was very hot and humid in the restaurant and when confronted they had nothing to say. I will never be back. My first time here was in 2010 and I thought it was good back then. Now"}
{"text":"Thank you for the most amazing dinner tonight - we are from Chicago and we were incredibly impressed. We will be back. Thank you so, so much!  Highlights were delicious fish, peas and potato, chai and dessert. Elegant, sumptuous and friendly. Pure gratitude."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the reviews, only because I found the food to be very bland. The naan was burnt and I couldn't taste any spices. The staff was friendly, I liked the decor and the music was fun. I think next time I'm skipping the buffet and trying a plate from the menu."}
{"text":"My visit to Flavors of India was the first Indian buffet I've visited although I've been to other Indian restaurants-just not buffets.  The food was good.  The number of dishes was limited to about six including vegetarian and chicken.  I was disappointed that there was no meat except chicken .... no lamb or goat.  Service was non existent since it is a buffet.  There was a man who delivered water but not happily.  He also brought nan which he put at the farthest end of the table.  No further contact with him and that was fine with me.  The woman seemed to be the binding force that held the restaurant together. The building was older and in need of remodeling but the establishment did the best it could with indian motif draperies and statues. There was no price list with the price of the buffet.  I thought $11.00  was a bit on the steep side.  I only had water and I did like the fact that the man brought a small pitcher of water for the table.   When I got home I yelped Indian Buffets again and found that $8 to 9$ seemed to be the standard price. Won't make that my \"go to\" place until I check out other Indian restaurants and have a comparison.  Until then, I won't go back regardless of the number of reviews."}
{"text":"This is a pleasant Indian restaurant. During the week they have a lunch buffet for ten bucks. It has limited offerings and is not especially spicy, but nevertheless the food is tasty & I managed to get my fill!  The staff is pleasant, which is a plus for an Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Recently got take out (chicken kadai and onion kulcha) and was a little disappointed. The meat was a bit fatty which is not OK!!! And, while this is supposed to be a spicier dish, which I would normally love, I found it to be spicy but not entirely flavorful. The onion kulcha was fine. Considering it's proximity to my apartment I may check it out again (perhaps stay away from the meat)?"}
{"text":"First time dining here. This review is strictly in regards to their dinner menu and not for their buffet. Personally in my experience, I've never enjoyed any Indian food buffet I've ever tried. Starting off, our party of 3 found the service to be very inviting and gracious. They really had a family business vibe. The cook, which I assumed to be the dad or patriarch, personally helped to deliver food to the table. We ordered the sampler (non-vegetarian) platter for an app which consisted of 2 chicken samosas, 4 chicken pakoras, and 4 shrimp pakoras. Delicious! Do not let the description of the pakoras defer you from order it. \"deep fried fritters\" yet they do not taste oily and the batter is made from scratch! For entrees, we ordered the sag chicken, lamb vindaloo, and paneer masala. Overall we liked the sag chicken the most because we thought the vindaloo could have been spicier (we requested 8/10 spice level). The sag was requested to be 10/10 spice and still wasn't up to par but made up for it due to its delicious flavor. We ordered the garlic naan and the peshwari naan. Garlic naan was a hit with the whole table. The peshwari naan was still decent (had coconut shavings inside which we thought to be a bit odd). Everyone had leftovers which definitely was a welcomed surprise. We do not know when we will be back but I know we will be sometime soon."}
{"text":"I truly love Indian food and I wanted to like this place more, but I ultimately couldn't. I wound up at the lunch buffet and didn't think too much of it. The dishes at the buffet really lacked the oomph that I am so used to at Indian restaurants, and unless the pot was personally stirred, some of the dishes were room temperature. As far as pricing, it wasn't too bad; it was just around $10.   After reading other reviews (Mainly Lisa O's) I would consider trying this place after the buffet is put away. But until then, I'll probably just be staying away."}
{"text":"In the past, these guys have been hit or miss. The last few times however the food has been excellent. We always get grubhub delivery because we are too lazy to pick up or eat there and the food always arrives fresh and hot. The tandoori chicken was super moist and flavorful. The eggplant and samosas were outstanding and the naan freshly baked. Overall a definite  star!!"}
{"text":"It took me a long while to write this review because I really wanted to like this place... And I did in a sense. I liked their cleanliness, ambiance, and just on service alone, this place should be 5 stars, but I had to leave room for other important things.... Like the food:/ I have been in an Indian Buffet tryout lately, and this one sadly scores the lowest on food. Which is funny because it is the one with the highest price tag. So, they charge an extra dollar or 2 than others ($11) but they offer no lamb... Or goat! It was very disappointing to find not many options of meat, except for the curry chicken and the chicken leg. I was actually moving all around outside the buffet thinking I was missing a line of other buffet options, but nope... That was it! I tell you something though. Their chapati (flatbread) is the best. It has like a hint of garlic and butter on top, and it was hot and fresh, so that most definitely saved the day, but not enough for me to be back. Just personally."}
{"text":"Very clean and warming atmosphere. The service was prompt, kind, and helpful - they all worked as a team to ensure customers were well taken care of and had everything needed to enjoy their experience.   The food was unbelievably delightful. We ordered the #55 Navratan Korma (veggies cooked in a creamy curry-like sauce). The #55 Korma with the rice was money - I would recommend it every single time. We also ordered the #53 Baigan Bharta (mashed roasted eggplant with onions, green peas, and tomatoes) and paired it perfectly to dip with the garlic Naan bread. Word of advice to diners - always get at least one garlic naan order per person - and yes, definitely go with the garlic.  Overall it was a fantastic experience and it's so conveniently located near the Camelback shopping areas. So next time you're in the area, certainly stop here for excellent service and phenomenal flavors. Looking forward to visiting this place again soon."}
{"text":"Quality has really gone down the past few years. I've been coming here since the day they opened up in 2003. Please bring back the original cook!!"}
{"text":"This is just another curry house. Yellow daal and chile pakora is pretty good. Unfortunately for us true lovers of authentic indian/pakistani/bengali food, this place is one of many very average restaurants"}
{"text":"Quite the ironic name for this restaurant.  I think their name should start the term \"Americanized\" or \"subdued.\" The dishes on the lunch buffet were standard but they lacked the vigor that good Indian food has.   I have gone here a few times for lunch with co workers, the vegetarian selection is decent. The fried items can be a bit soggy from sitting out too long.  The lunch buffet now is topping $10 which is pretty steep of a mediocre lunch. I feel like there should be a discount at places like this for vegetarians. The Naan, and water is brought tot you by a server so you may feel the need to tip on top of the buffet price.   There is the stereotypical bollywood music videos playing on the TV, with their psychedelic colors and lavish garb. Many of the serving trays make extensive use of aluminium foil which I doubt meets health code."}
{"text":"Yummy ,tasty, affordable and fun!!! First time here and got the buffet it was awesome, there is so much to try , lamb , chicken, really good , will be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of best Indian restaurants around especially the curry and naan very well cooked and great hospitality overall very well put"}
{"text":"Lunch is a great deal at Flavors of India: buffet style with an excellent variety of food. Dinner is more expensive. Their food is very good except for anything with beef in it. Honestly, you can't expect a culture that believes cows are sacred to know how to cook beef for American diners. Theirs is boiled to the texture of tough shoe leather every time. So, avoid the beef. Everything else is delicious and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Worst Indian in the entire phoenix valley, the lunch buffet had only one chicken dish, one meat, one daal, one vegetable, are you kidding me and nothing was exceptional, it was just average. Not at all good and value for money, Compare the menu with Chutneys on baseline and Ray.  I will never come back again."}
{"text":"They bring the heat when you ask for it:  score!  I love places that don't distrust me when I say that I want something hot.  I asked for hot for a reason, so give it to me.  Luckily, on my last few take-out orders, Flavors of India has trusted me.  We're both pretty happy to finally be in a trusting relationship.    I've only ever done take-out here and to be honest, it has always been the same dish- paneer tikka masala.  I love that they add chopped onions and cilantro to the masala mixture.  The rice is your standard Basmati.  My interactions with the employees have been efficient and friendly.  This is my current go-to for take-out Indian."}
{"text":"I would not go back to this place.  The mixed grill was horrible, very little flavor and chicken was very dry.  The manager there stated it was because the chicken is white meat...have never heard that before and have been to many places where the chicken is white meat and yet very tender and juicy.  I asked for the lamb grill instead, and was disappointed again.  Staff was friendly but the food was not good, I left both grill orders uneaten."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Great food and the owner Sima is a sweetheart. Tikka masala is the best in town not to mention the perfect flaky and delicious samosas"}
{"text":"The buffet is wonderful.  A wide assortment of Indian food at about $10.00 per person.  The chicken dishes are simply terrific.  They also provide bread on the table and a fountain drink for $1.00.  The decor is inviting and the staff are nice.  I recommend."}
{"text":"Not happy with this restaurant at all. Placed an order for take-out, and every single dish had an issue. We ordered paneer & potato masalas and palak aloo. Unfortunately, the best part of our meal was the plain basmati rice. Our masalas were made with the most disgusting over-microwaved potatoes I have ever consumed. The sauce was pretty good, but a little too sweet and since the potatoes were rubbery, tough and dark, it made it difficult to eat. The palak was even worse. We had to keep removing some ingredient that was woody and fibrous from the sauce. It was under salted, extremely bitter and tasted more like ginger and cream rather than spinach. I love ginger, but this was so overwhelmingly bad. For some odd reason, the potatoes in our palak were not microwaved like the masala was. I know that the paneer & potato masala is not on their menu, but I'd much rather them say that they cannot make it rather than give me something so awful. I'd expect so much better after paying $60 bucks. Sucks since this is the closest Indian restaurant by far. I'll just have to drive the distance next time. Boo."}
{"text":"The family that owns this restaurant is so sweet and friendly! I went with a large group and it was perfect serving sizes to share with everyone!   We ordered the Samosas and loved them! They were perfectly cooked. Crunch on the outside was amazing!   We also got what they call their Mixed Grill. It had chicken and shrimp on it. It is cooked in their Clay oven and comes out on a sizzling plate. Loved it!   We also got their chicken tikka masala, 3 orders of it! I sat and drank up the rest of the left over sauce when the chicken was gone - it was that good!   If you haven't tried Indian food and want to explore it, this would be the perfect place. I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy things, so it was great that they offer different spice levels. The people with me can handle spice, so they were able to order to their taste buds. So we were all very satisfied with our dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey for dinner. Chicken vindaloo, rice, and naan ran me $17. I ordered spicy, but it was closer to a spice level of medium. Portions were about what to be expected, maybe a touch small on the vindaloo. The chicken vindaloo was good but was nearly half potatoes, not what I am used to. Naan was warm, tasty and not undercooked or served cold like some other restaurants I have been too.  I would like to rate this place higher, but the price makes justifying that out of the question. It is standard Indian fair that is good, it just simply isn't great."}
{"text":"Great Indian food here. It's been almost 6 years ago since I've eaten here. Their buffet food never disappoints. Even their gulab jamun (the little donut hole-like dessert) tasted fresh. Unlike the ones I've had before from other Indian restaurant in the valley that was cold and stale. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for many years!!!! Glad I came back. Great Punjabi food!!!! Very clean, fresh and reasonable. The staff is courteous, polite and prompt..."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times and the food was good. Then on our last visit we opened our menus and baby roaches fell out.... NOPE!  haven't been back since."}
{"text":"The food here is AWESOME!!  The Chicken Curry is especially delicious.  The  staff is very attentive, and the decor is very nice."}
{"text":"First impressions aren't everything, but ours was certainly not positive when entering this completely empty restaurant around 6:30 on a Friday night. The host station was abandoned, and the lights weren't even turned on in the foyer.  When we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by a very shy teenage boy in baggy jeans and tennis shoes who seated us, gave us water... and then proceeded to stand in the kitchen door and look at us while we sat. Very, very loud dubstep music was blaring from a boom box hidden under a pink plastic tablecloth at the buffet.  Speaking of the buffet, we opted for the that, as it looked serviceable, but also because we wanted our time in the place to be as brief as possible. The mood was definitely not positive for us.  As for the food... some was not bad, and some was, shall we say, edible. The non-meat options fared the best. Chicken tended to be tough in each of the buffet entrees we sampled, and the naan was very dense and doughy with no discernible flavor at all -- nothing like the puffy, crispy naan we've had at most Indian restaurants.  Two other parties came in, but the place was still dead for a Friday night. Throughout it all, the dubstep music kept blaring away, and the young waiter stood in the kitchen door and stared. It almost felt like an SNL skit at times.  Bonus points for refusal of our restaurant.com gift certificate. I was told that, even though it didn't have an expiration date, I couldn't use it because it was purchased in 2014. Okay."}
{"text":"Just delicious!  Got the chicken Korma and the sag chicken, medium spice, with a mixed bread basket.  So flavorful and well prepared, with some leftovers (I was there with a friend and we shared the two).  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I could say that this was the worst meal I have ever eaten at a Restuarant, definitely the worst indian food I have ever had. If there was an option for zero stars, I wouldn't even give it one. I came here for the lunch buffet, and was thoroughly scared for my health after eating a few bites. In fact, if I hadn't been in the company of two others, I may have gotten up and left after getting my plate of food.    The food must have been sitting out for a long time because the raita was spoiled. It was sour and bubbly. The mint chutney was also bubbly and sour tasting as if it were fermenting. None of the food on the buffet was hot. It was barely luke-warm and the tandoori chicken was like a rock. I am appalled at the quality of the food here.  I LOVE indian food and was hoping to find a good place in this area, this is not it.  If you notice, all the photos on yelp are 3-4 years old. Must have been ok at one time, not anymore. There was NO ONE else here at 12:30pm - prime lunch time - and I can see why."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet! It feels authentic with music and decor. Staff have always been very helpful and warm."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here! Excellent food ... Service is good and quick! Love the lunch Buffett!!!"}
{"text":"Reading through the reviews, I have a feeling that this place has changed over the past several years.  I went in for lunch about three years ago and was very disappointed.  I went in again last week and had an excellent experience. The buffet is extensive and flavorable.  My only reservation is that the spice level is 1 or less, but the management seems to be eager to help with that issue or any others.  I will be returning with my wife for dinner on Friday or the weekend due to the excellent food quality, the attentive staff and the eager to please management."}
{"text":"I live in the downtown Phoenix area, love Indian food, and have NEVER gone to this restaurant for dinner. I've been there billions of times for lunch. That should tell you everything I think about this place.  The lunch buffet is decent. It doesn't vary much so I know exactly what I'm getting every time I go. Since it's the only Indian place downtown, if I'm craving Indian, this is it. It's standard Indian. Nothing terrible, nothing spectacular.   For the best Indian eats in Phoenix you need to try Jewel of the Crown (a Scottsdale oldie), and the brand new Tandoori Times (also in Scottsdale)."}
{"text":"When I lived in the area, I would come by here for dinner, and occasionally lunch.  The buffet at lunch is ok.  Nothing stands out and grabs you and says \"THIS IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER TASTED\", but by far none of it is bland.  It is a buffet so my bar is not incredibly high.  For dinner, I have never been disapointed.  The curry is spicy, the masala is sweet and delicious.  My only true complaint about the place is the decor and the music.  I have come in on a few occassions and the place looks dirty, or the Bollywood Best is cranked up to the point of annoying."}
{"text":"Flavors of India transferred ownership around January 2011.  Prior to this, the food was usually good, but was sometimes inconsistent.  A group of us often go for the lunch buffet which isn't huge, but has the essentials.  The new owners have since added a few items to the buffet menu including a couple Nepal dishes.  They do a good job with my favorite Indian dish, Chicken Makhani - a flavorful buttery, tangy, sweet and spicy curry.  The buffet usually also has rice, naan (delicious flat bread for dipping), Tandori Chicken along with an assortment of  other curries and dishes such as Palak Paneer (spinach with cubed cheese - tasty).  They often have a couple sweet items that are suitable as a dessert, I usually go for two plates loaded with Makhai, rice, naan, etc. which is more than enough for lunch and I have no room for dessert.  For anyone not familiar with Indian food, the buffet is a good way to sample items and then go back for items you like.  The restaurant is clean and the servers are attentive, often bringing out plates of fresh warm naan.  Besides the buffet, I have gotten carry-out which has always been tasty, well packed, and met expectations.  The prices are about typical, although the buffet is a better value than ordering off the menu.  Thumbs Up!     Oh, and great Photos from Katie M.  Makes me want some Flavors' food now.  :)  2/23/11 Update:  Got carryout of my usual favorites and decided that instead of getting the typical Samosa appetizer, to order the chicken Momo-Cha instead.  These are Nepali dumplings that come with  separate sauces.  They were very tasty.  Also, while I waited, they offered me water.  Twice!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet! This place is delish all made from scratch. The only Indian place I will travel to from Gilbert. If you love Indian food, please stop by here during lunch it's $11 and it's amazing."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time trying Indian food (don't judge meeeee!) and I'm now HOOKED! Anyone who hasn't tried Indian food, or is curious and wants to sample - go here.   This review is based on the lunch buffet, which beats out Chinese buffets any day of the week. You have a selection of 9-10 choices, plus dessert. The neatest part is the variety of food switches every day, so you're never eating the same thing over and over. Yesterday's buffet consisted of chicken masala (chicken, spices, tomato sauce cooked), daal makhani (lentil soup), bhindi (bombbbb okra!), chicken curry... and a ton of other goodies (dessert was shahi kheer - basmati rice pudding with almond and pistachios).   My only complaint was the bread, as it felt like it was covered in oil. However, for $11.99 and all you can eat - I don't really care.  Side note: they play this channel on their TV that's an Indian version of MTV - so freaking entertaining."}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed owners and chefs multiple times in the last year or 2. It used to be wonderful, but recently it has gone down hill. Now I refuse to eat there after being told by the giant sign in the window as well as the host that all of the meat is halal. No thank you. Time to find a new Indian restaurant ."}
{"text":"i like the quality of food here and icome here every 1-2 weeks. My favorite dish is chicken Makhani. chicken Masala and some of the lamb dishes are also worth trying. Good atmosphere and kind owners. downside is that it takes about 20-25 min for food to be served. prices are somewhat high.  did not like their buffet because there is no variety of food."}
{"text":"This is the first Indian restaurant we've tried in Phoenix since we moved here from Washington, D.C. I wouldn't say it was the best I've had (nothing tops the Clay Oven restaurant in Frederick, MD-we may be biased because of a huge indian community there), but it was good enough to suit us. We're vegetarians-we ordered the eggplant dish and lentils dish, both which were tasteful.  The naan bread was a bit too crusty compared what we've tried before. The samosas  were unusually small, but good-I liked the spices they used on them.  The huge plus was they put fresh herbs on the dish.  The prices were reasonable for two dishes, and we had plenty to left over to bring home. I was fairly entertained by the Bollywood playing on the tv. (I just LOVE bollywood dancing!)."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Lunch buffet is so yummy, fresh and full of choices (meat & veg). Dinner menu is hard to choose from due to the extensive variety. The chicken tikka Masala is rich and flavorful. Definitely a favorite. Garlic naan is also a must! The atmosphere is clean and open, and the wait staff are attentive and sweet. I lololove this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh food. I ordered the chicken curry medium hot. Mind you, India and Pakistani food medium (hot) is Hot! Goodness gracious. The curry cleared up my sinuses for sure. Next time, I will order mild. Other than that my food order was good.  Also the customer service was excellent and friendly. Great customer service at any establishment is super important to me. In addition, the delivery of my food order came out in adequate time! Something any customer can appreciate.   The only things I didn't like about the establishment, is, it needs a renovation and/or makeover. The resturant's decorations appeared 1990ish!   Key B's Recommendation: To appreciate good customer service. Also prompt delivery of ordered food. Desire to eat something different, I recommend the Taste of India!"}
{"text":"For my first time it was excellent !  Chicken Masala was yummy! I had the buffet which was pretty good. They bring you fresh Naan bread so so good. Mango pudding was delicious."}
{"text":"Reliable, quick and accomodating.  It's probably not the best or most authentic out there, but when you hae a hankering for chicken tikka masala, they really do make the best.  They are good at accomodating changes (I always get half chicken, half paneer) and they have a great mango lassi that doesn't taste like it came out of a premade tub.  Little pricey though."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I haven't tasted anything this delightful in years. Service was impeccable and friendly. This restaurant is a MUST VISIT!"}
{"text":"We have been going to flavors of India for about fifteen years.  It almost always is a very pleasant experience.  We went during July of 2016 for a family celebration dinner. The rest of the family had chicken dishes and they said they were delicious.  Even my incredibly picky and spice phobic son found their chicken Tikka Masala was good. Not chicken mcnuggets but good.  My daughter really loved the Mango chicken.  They made up a special vegan jalfrezi for me and my wife had the chicken vindaloo.    Don't be afraid of it being too spicy.  They wouldn't have been in business this long if they didn't know how to cater to all pallets.  I actually thought mine was mild and they had to bring chili chutney.   The atmosphere is pleasant and the prices are fair.  A family dinner for four with tip and no alcohol but with lots of happy tummies was under only $80 as of this writing.  That is absolutely everything including the tip."}
{"text":"Had lunch buffet while travelling on I-80/90. The quality of food was incredibly bad. They had very limited options and also mismatched dishes. Didn't even like the ambiance of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place made me cheat on my other favorite Indian place in Phoenix. Actually, I left my other favorite Indian place in Phoenix. Their Paneer Tikka Masala is that seductive.  This place is great to go for the buffet, but don't let that distract you from their amazing entrees on the menu. They might seem a bit heavy on price, but they're easily large enough to split with another person, or split into two meals. They have so many for all meats and tons of vegetarian options. This place also has great garlic naan, but don't let that distract you from their amazing regular naan.   I also want to point out that the service here is really good. The staff are so friendly, especially if they start seeing you regularly, and you can just really tell that they love their business. If you or a friend loves Indian food, I would make yourself a friend of Flavors of India.  Also, they're a coke place!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Phoenix this was the favorite destination for Buffet of anyplace in town. Always economical and delicious. Reasonably good service and air conditioned. The dining room can be quiet and intimate when the place isn't in buffet mode and is reasonable for a date."}
{"text":"My husband and I always drive by this place on our way to work so we thought we would finally stop in as we love indian food. There was a group of five in the center of the restaurant that was enjoying themselves it seemed but other than that it was empty. We were offered some thin flat and crispy cracker type thing and a dipping sauce which was nice and some water, it didn't take long for our server to ask what our order was. We got the masala and butter chicken. We had to order the rice and naan separate, other places gave those along with the meal. The food was ok, not amazing but not bad either, the naan was only one piece and the prices were kind of high for what you get. Service was friendly but not enough to make us go back."}
{"text":"Super expensive take out. $18.45 for an 8pz portion of Tika masala and 1 piece of naan. Sauce was a little too sweet and tomatoey. If you go only do the buffet. $12 all you can eat."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim last week with my son. It's nicely decorated and I enjoyed the Bollywood music videos on their tv. We ordered Lamb Vindaloo and the Chicken Tandoori Murg Masala...both were very good, loved the spices, chicken and lamb were tender. We also had Basmati rice /Vegetable Biryani which is my favorite and Mango Lassi to drink. It's family run...they are very friendly, eager to give advice on what to try and just make you feel at home. I do recommend coming here. It's a little bit pricey but we don't have Indian food very often. I will come back to try their buffet sometime soon."}
{"text":"This is probably our favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix. As always, we had great food and great service. Papadum crackers were brought to the table with 2 Indian dipping sauces to start. They were very busy last night - It was a Friday night. My husband had the combination tandoori dinner with chicken, lamb (which were meatballs), and shrimp. He said it was excellent. I'm vegan, so had an entree with chickpeas which I ordered medium spicy...very spicy and yummy! We ordered a side of rice and roti bread. My husband enjoyed a cup of their chai tea. It is already made and served with milk in it. We had way too much food so happily packed our leftovers to take home. We had an Entertainment Book coupon which we used, but will definitely be back more times in the next year."}
{"text":"A sampling of their food at this year's Asian Festival plus the high ratings on yelp have convinced me to step out of my comfort zone once again to try another Indian restaurant. It should be noted that I know little about Indian cuisine. I know I love the safe flavors of Saffron Patch in Beachwood, and when I'm in the mood to be kicked in the mouth, I know I love the extremely potent flavors of Taste of Kerala in Mayfield Heights. Two restaurants that took different approaches to Indian cuisine, but both very successful in their endeavors.  Enter Flavors of India, which in my experience attempted to go the \"safe\" route and ultimately came up short. Let's start from the top, though. It is a quaint spot with good space and very simple d√©cor. We opted for the lunch buffet, which had a smaller selection than I expected. There were 6 different stews, including 3 meat (chicken curry, goat curry, and chicken tikka masala) and 3 vegetarian. Other offerings included rice pulao, tandoori chicken, pakora, naan, vegetarian lo mein (wat?), and lentil soup. There was also a DIY station for \"papdi chaat\" (fried crackers topped with veggies and sauces) and \"panipuri\" (thin flaky puffs filled with various toppings). For desserts, they had gulab jamun and rice pudding. They also had some salad offerings and fresh fruits for those of you that want to waste valuable stomach space with generic food. Unfortunately, samosas were not on the buffet menu.  Much of the food I tried was bland. All of the stews were pretty disappointing in that they lacked flavor and heat. The tandoori chicken was okay but that's pretty much the ceiling for tandoori chicken anyway. The naan was good and the pakora decent. The papdi chaat and panipuri were a little confusing to put together and ultimately didn't really stand out to me, but I thought it was a cool idea and at least fared better than the curry dishes. I'd say the high point of the meal was the delicious and refreshing rice pudding and the gulab jamun, which I tried for the first time and reminded me of Little Debbie's donut sticks (not a knock). Unexpected cake-like texture, very sweet, with an unobtrusive hint of a sweet spice (I guessed cinnamon, my girlfriend said ginger. She's probably right.).  Overall, I'd give this place a 3.5. Maybe I need to order off the menu next time."}
{"text":"Flavors of India serves up a decent lunch buffet.  I've been there a couple of times though and it seems some days, the food is better than others.  Also, I wish they offered a bit more selection.  I've teetering between a 3 and 4 star but because of the reasonable price and friendly service, I'm bumping up to a 4 star.  I'll have to go again to make a final decision.   See ya there!"}
{"text":"Now this comes from a foodie Indian..The management just changed...and the food got worse. The food got worse but the service got a little better than earlier. The butter chicken is way off and was sweet and the Buffet wasn't that impressive. Although,I would recommend you go there for the buffet, because of the varieties offered."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. You are always greeted with a smile and it only takes a few visits for them to remember you. The food is always delicious and there's a good selection of vegetarian dishes. I've only been here for the lunch buffet. They do a great job of making sure all the dishes are full and fresh. I will continue to come here whenever the Indian food cravings hit."}
{"text":"Flavors is easily my favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley. With friendly wait staff, good prices and fantastic food you can't go wrong. Don't be fooled by it's humble exterior; it's the food you're there to enjoy. I prefer to skip the buffet as I like my food XXXX-Indian-hot, but I have never been disappointed at dinner. In fact, the staff recognize me and my daughter and often ask if we'll have our regular, even if it's been months since our last visit.  My absolute favorite is the lamb vindaloo while my husband has chicken korma and my daughter goes for the chicken tikka masala and a mango lassi. Don't forget the rice pudding (kheer) for dessert. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"My mother and I had their lunch buffet.   The restaurant was comfortable and well-decorated-- a nice break from the asphalt and traffic outside.  The food was flavorful and delicious.  I especially liked the spinach and the chicken curry.   The rice was well done.  The staff were friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"After searching for six months for the right kind of Indian restaurants that we're used to in New York this place has been just a wonderful place to eat.  What I specially like is the fact that there are so many choices and the food is prepared to perfection. I have been to India twice and I cook Indian food so I know what I'm talking about. I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody that likes Indian food, these are really really really good cooks!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! We especially love their buffet. Clean, and the service has been very nice. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful.  We have always ordered takeout although the restaurant looks very clean inside.  We don't do a lot of in restaurant dining.  The food is excellent and the family run staff is friendly, courteous and in all ways a pleasure to deal with.  I would suggest this restaurant to anyone.  The Biltmore area has some great lower key dining spots we want to point out to locals and travelers alike.  This is definitely worth a drive South of Camelback."}
{"text":"Ugh, had to change my rating of this place... sorry to say.  I've eaten here several times over the last few months.  Over the last few months and several visits, I've experienced the following:   - No or little heat.  It's been fricking cold in this place. - No music.  I know not a big deal, but still it's very weird being in the restaurant with an awkward silence, sitting there with my coat still on trying to stay warm. - Non-friendly service.  They aren't rude or inattentive, they just seem fairly robotic. - Lukewarm buffet items.  I sampled the noodles, the pakora, the rice and a few other dishes.  Not cold, but defenitally not anywhere near hot.   - The lentils had obviously been sitting a long time because their was a congealed film on top... - Rice was not fresh and all clumped together. - Ugh, bathroom is not cleaned very well.   - Overall compared to other Indian buffets I've been to, food is overly salted.  It doesn't taste 'bad' per se, but I am incredibly thirsty after.    On a good note, their dessert (rice pudding and fruit pudding) was simply amazing.  After my lackluster meal, I did quite enjoy the rice.  So I'm being nice, giving them an extra star for this."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and think its cool that there is a bar there too.  The owner is very gracious and accomodating.  The food was very fresh and I like spicy...which is how they made the food.  I like the Bollywood videos and the ornaments around the room.  Very comfortable and good food!"}
{"text":"This is in reality a 4.5 rating. Very friendly service, just based on that I will be going back. Buffet: Best tandoori chicken, very juicy. I'm not eating bread, but temptation got me  and it was by far the best naan I've had. Fresh selection, except for the fried section, it seems it needs a better heat chute.  Update: I went back to this place, I'm not changing my stars, and I feel bad because the lady in charge is so nice. My comment has to do with one of the guys taking care of the food. He was probably sick and he was walking around replenishing trays, clearing his throat loudly, without covering his mouth. That made me uncomfortable, plus it's unhealthy. I hope they address the issue."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian spot in AZ! I love everything about this place. The owners have always been super friendly to us. I've never tried their lunch buffet but their dinner service is phenomenal. The chicken vindaloo is my favorite dish along with the garlic naan. I love that you can choose the spice level on anything you order. I like my dishes spicy... Even extra spicy and they always accommodate."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere with a wonderful and knowledgeable waitress. The food was amazing and a large menue with reasonable prices"}
{"text":"They've changed their chicken tikka masala recipe at least twice since my original review, and each time I've liked it less. The sauce used to be creamy. Now it looks like there's no cream in it, and it separates easily so the fat floats on the top. I'll have to find another restaurant to sate my chicken tikka cravings."}
{"text":"I love this place! I love Indian food and this is seriously the best I've ever had. The service is superb, the servers and owner are attentive and kind willing to take the time to explain each exotic dish. I live nearby so I order take out often and my order is always perfect and prepared in less than 10 minutes. I recommend the Paneer Makini which is a spicy tomato and butter sauce with homemade goat cheese baked into it and served with basmati rice. Delish!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for indian food in the 85016 area, this place is great. The lady who works at the front was very friendly and helped me with selections for my future visit. I tried the chicken Tikka Masala and the Paneer with spinach, both were outstanding. Here are my only complaints (but they wont deter me from coming back because the food was great):  1) they charge for rice 2) the food is pretty pricey  I would come here more often if it was a little bit cheaper, but if I am in the mood to splurge on something out of the ordinary or special this is a good spot. The portions are a reasonable size but still do not justify the expense."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian buffets in the valley.  Love their chicken makhani (butter chicken). It makes an appearance on their buffet table fairly frequently (as much as i love tikka masala, it's a nice change). Their naan, palak paneer, and chana masala are all perfect cooked and seasoned.   Service is quick and friendly. One of my favorite spots to go for lunch. Go now:)"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place! They have a great, comprehensive buffet, and the owners are so nice and helpful - read about their story in the other reviews. It's delicious Indian/Nepalese food not just for Ohio, but in general. And their naan bread is amazing. I support this restaurant so much!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery at the recommendation of a friend. I was not disappointed. I've never had Indian food so I was a little nervous. I had the Butter Chicken and it was amazing. Can't wait to dine in one day."}
{"text":"Best Indian Chicken Vindaloo that I've had in a long time! Got it medium spicy and it was so good - better than my homemade curry! One of these days I'd like to come for the lunch buffet which is available 6 days a week. The service was excellent & the owner is kind & gracious. Been coming here for 8 years & food has been consistently good. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"\"A whole in the wall\" would be a good way to describe this place. Mostly because the restaurant environment wasn't that nice, which is why I am not giving it five stars in my review. However, they make some great food here and I don't think many people have heard of the place, but after you get through the cheap/rundown exterior, the food inside was actually very delicious.  I ordered the Neelgiri Korma with a side of garlic naan (extra charge), and I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it. One of the waitresses' first questions was how spicy I wanted my Korma, and I usually don't like/get spicy food, but I got medium and felt like it was cooked to the perfect level of spiciness for my taste. The sauce on the chicken was very creamy and they brought us 2 plates of rice that they freshly cooked.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking for good Indian food."}
{"text":"I think this place is 3 and a half stars. It is a fair-to-good, family-run restaurant, and because it is the only Indian place I know of in central Phoenix, I've been there quite a few times, only for dinner.  The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed, with kind service, booth seating and Bollywood videos to entertain you. It's not the kind of place to take a date you want to impress, but it's the kind of place to go with your friends for a pretty good meal.  Last time I tried their frozen dessert (forget the name of it) and it was lovely, a delicate blend of spices that was the perfect finish to the meal."}
{"text":"Came here a week ago and this was a return visit, and as always they do great.   For a small mom and pop place, this is a great restaurant that has an amazing selection of Indian food.   I come here and have no expectations of a fine dining or amazing service, but I always get it. The food was awesome and the Naan bread is to die for. they check on us enough to make sure we are doing okay but they do not over do it, so it is appreciated.   Our waiter was good, not talkative or welcoming, but got the work done, and I was fine with that. The hostess who I believe is the owner or wife of the owner is very friendly and asked about how we were doing and how we enjoyed the food.  I definitely recommend it, and make sure when they ask you how spicy you want, go with medium, it is still spicy enough to enjoy the flavors and the spiciness."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Perfect portion to price ratio. Friendly service and relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Indian cuisine.  We had  a chicken dish an lamb curry.   Choose your level of heat - we had 4.   Friendly service."}
{"text":"Good food...staff was courteous and helpful. I would recommend this place highly. Food was prepared according to the spice level ask d for and we had a variety of spice level in our group, everything cane out good"}
{"text":"Wide range of vegetarian options. Great chicken tikka masala! Very friendly and attentive staff. If you're into Bollywood, this place plays videos too."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have very minimal experience with Indian food so I have little to compare it to.... BUT a friend and I decided to venture out and snag something new. Honestly, the food we had was amazing. I was upset I got full because I wanted to keep eating. And the people there were not overly intrusive by constantly coming up to us and asking how it was. Attentive without being overwhelming.   I came away with two thoughts: 1. Why am I not Indian so I can make this confidently at home? 2. How has it taken me 24 years to consume something so delightful?  Overall we both had a great time and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Great place! Came for the lunch buffet and they are so polite and nice. Good is amazing and freshgreat selection"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot that I hardly ever remember! A styrofoam takeaway joint in Latta Arcade.   The food is basic but well thought out and seasoned nicely. The samosas are a delight. Looks like a family owned restaurant, they're super friendly, no trouble telling me what's what behind the glass. It's a good little spot to drop in on for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I've been for dinner and the lunch buffet, and I prefer the variety that the lunch buffet has to offer.  The first time I went for dinner, I asked for spicy, and it was a bit more than I anticipated, but I can't complain because it is what I asked for, I just wasn't ready. The lunch buffet was delicious, there is an excellent variety of food available, good for vegetarian and meat lovers. Everything was flavorful, and spiced perfectly. I left perfectly satisfied. I have only two complaints. 1. It is beyond cold in there, so make sure to bring a sweater or something warm with you if you are sensitive to cold. 2. I notice that the staff only asks Indian patrons if they would like roti's or naan with their buffet. I was just given naan without a question, which I ate, but I definitely would have chosen a roti had I been offered the choice."}
{"text":"Excellent! I love the chicken shahi korma! I get it every time. My girlfriend gets the baneer makhani every time!"}
{"text":"I miss this place!  We used to live around the corner from Flavors of India and went here at least a couple times a month.  Favorite dishes were Malai Kofta (sp?) and Palak Paneer. My husband loved their lamb dishes.  Their lunch buffet was just okay. Could have a better selection.  Service was always good. They are sooo nice. One time we ordered takeout and my husband who was sick at the time picked it up. The girl at the counter offered him a little baggie of spices to help with his ailment. How sweet and thoughtful!   When we eat in for dinner, we enjoy the Indian beer, and my husband REALLY enjoys the Bollywood music videos. Hmmm... could it be the completely gorgeous Indian women dancing around in saris?"}
{"text":"Worst food ever I had in my life in all Indian resturant I tried in my life I ordered tikka masala and mix grill platter each chicken piece was more than half pound worst garlic naan... I was hungry but I Cudnt eat anything my money was wasted"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Indian restaurant.  Anywhere.  I had the lunch buffet, which was delicious, and after that I have mostly ordered Palak Paneer with naan and rice.  Their's is fantastic!  So delicious!  I love this place because it tastes so good, and because it is close to home, but the reason this place stands out among its peers is the service.  This place has really, really good service by any standard.  Waters get refilled promptly, waiters are helpful.  Orders are accurate and the staff is really friendly.    Yay!"}
{"text":"The 2nd time was better than the first! It's our favorite Indian restaurant now  the chicken tikka masala is excellent. The garlic and cheese nans were fabulous. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it wasn't the first time I've been here but I was still pleasantly surprised by the food which was amazing! The chicken makhani, which in most places means big chunks of tough chicken, was surprisingly tender and delicious. The vegetable pakoras were absolutely delicious, the best I've had in the valley. The mushrooms and eggplant dish were both very good. The mango pudding, although sounds plain, was absolutely delicious and tastes fresh. The chai tea actually tasted like chai tea and not like tea with milk, you can actually taste the spices in this one.  I was very pleased with my meal. The only downside I can say is that for a buffet it is a bit more pricey than other buffets, but this delicious food is definitely worth the extra expense. This place really does live up to its name Flavors of India. If you love Indian food you must eat here."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for their weekend lunch buffet.  The food was good but I like very spicy Indian food and this was not that.  It was however flavorful and they had a good variety of vegetarian and chicken dishes available.  If you like less spicy Indian food this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times but I wasn't so impressed when I ate there for lunch the other day.  I guess the thing to remember about this place is to get there early.  If you don't, you will be waiting for food and nan.  My wife and I got there at 12:30 and every container was at the bottom or empty.  Asked the lady what was up and she said that everyone came in at once. Uhm, yeah, it is called a lunch rush.  Really pissed me off that she said that.  Waited for food and waited even longer for the nan.  Even though the service was really lacking this day, I will be back because the food is good."}
{"text":"I order from here via Amazon delivery and the food has always been amazing. Today I actually decided to eat in and was completely blown away. The food is made to order and is served piping hot and fresh. I honestly did not think the food could get better than when I had it delivered, but it did. I am absolutely thrilled that I found this place."}
{"text":"The food was OK.  The Nan Bread was good and so was the Somosa.  There wasn't really that much choice.  I got the vegetable curry and it was bland.  Normally Indian food the spices that stand out and really give good flavor to the food. The Chicken Masala tasted like Chicken with coconut milk poured over it.  I would go back there again if all the restaurants in uptown Charlotte closed."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet today. All the food was hot and fresh.   Not a huge variety, but everything was up to scratch. The paneer spinach here is extra good. And I liked the meatballs too, kind of a sweet and sour taste. The dessert gulab juman balls were hot. They tasted fine, but I like them better cold or room temp. But all said, an enjoyable visit. Buffet costs $10 with ice water and free naan."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into this place the staff here was so welcoming and kind (I was wearing some cloggs coming from a pedicure and they still welcomed me) and sat my friend and I right away. Great food! I got the chicken curry and a mango lassi yummy!"}
{"text":"Lamb tikki masala and garlic naan are delicious. I try to come at least once every couple weeks for lunch. Great food every time and the owner and his wife are hands on and very kind. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"$10 for a delicious lunch buffet?  Yes please!  The owners are super nice and the food is quality.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Gave this another try because it was close to a friend's house and she chose it for her birthday. Surprise! A \"new\" batch of Nepalese selections greeted me as soon as I opened my menu. Very exciting. I chose the vegetable thukpa, a simmered noodle dish with assorted veggies. The noodles were al dente and the whole dish was really flavorful. Definitely a nice departure from their Indian menu. Their garlic naan was outstanding again, and I tried and liked the paneer pakora as well."}
{"text":"If not for the slow naan bread delivery this would most certainly be a 5 star review. The food is delicious and for the price it can not be beat. The lunch buffet is always a smart choice and I feel I have to specifically point out how fresh and insanely tasty the naan bread is. I would come here for that alone."}
{"text":"Substandard at best. Garlic Nan was a regular nan, and out of the 4 pieces, 2 were like hockey pucks. Of course I was charged for the garlic nan. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Being super close to where I work will do wonders for them because I eat a lot of Indian food. Still the food leaves a little to be desired in the flavor department. Things just don't taste that strong and the naan is kinda soggy. On the other hand the portions are generous."}
{"text":"I got tiki masala and chicken korma for takeout from them the other night and the flavors are great as I is the price but the chicken had a funny taste. I love Indian food and I like to try new places but honestly probably won't order from here again because when meat tastes funny that's not okay."}
{"text":"Perfect authentic food. Generous portions. Relaxing atmosphere. Just beautiful! Great  service. I want to try everything on the menu. Just go!"}
{"text":"Brought my mom here even though she was very reluctant after previous bad experience with Indian food. The server was patient and helped us navigate the menu and we enjoyed our dishes greatly. Hooray--another ethnic cuisine down!"}
{"text":"Being away for almost a year it's nice coming back to something familiar . I can even say improved. The lunch buffet was flavorful and items hot. The female bus staff were friendly and attentive. The three diners in my party left happy. And that's what Indian food does makes you happy!"}
{"text":"I used to be scared...I used to be petrified.  I was never one to branch out with my variety of cuisine, which meant that I never had Indian food before...until a couple of months ago when I was invited to a dinner party. And at Flavors of India...my Indian Food cherry was broken.  I decided to review this place now...since I have experienced other restaurants since.  I tend to always come back to this location.  The place seems very clean, I love the Bollywood videos that they play, and I love the service.  And I think that they have the best buffet!    Now, I am really bad at names of the food that I order there (which is why I end up at the buffet...I may not know the names, but I know what I like looks like)  See me there at lunch real soon :)"}
{"text":"Great Indian food and great people. They have to be the nicest people in Phoenix! Try the vindaloo - if you can handle the spiciest ask for a 10."}
{"text":"What can I say? I've been coming here for years for a reason... The food is fabulous. Lunch time buffet for $10 all you can eat. The best tandoori and mango losi you will ever have. The atmosphere is perfect. Indian TV is soooo cool. ;)  I'll be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"TLDR: 10/10 would recommend. Great food. Restaurant isn't super welcoming but that didn't bother us.   Me and the fiance went today because I had never tried Indian food before. The fiance was nervous because he has always hated Indian food.    When we got there we were greeted by a mostly empty and quiet restaurant. It was a little awkward sitting there while the workers spoke in a different language to their small child running around, but the kid was cute. We were given some thin bread with some awesome sauces before we even ordered. When we did order we got the \"Chicken Madras\", \"Lamb Do Piaza\", and garlic naan and they were all super delicious.     For the Madras I got spicy and it was so perfect for my taste- almost too hot for the fiance though. The meat in the meals was cooked perfectly- I especially enjoyed the charcoal flavor to the chicken and the tenderness of the lamb. The rice it came with was finer then other rice I've experienced but was still delicious.    In the end me and the fiance decided that we would for sure be getting food from here again. He not only enjoyed this Indian food, he Loved it! It was a pleasant first experience for me and I can't wait to try more of the menu items!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Indian food! The flavors just give me those warm fuzzy feelings, and the food at Flavors of India was no exception. From the moment I sat down and saw the beautiful cloth on the table, I knew I was going to have a great meal.  This was also a FIRST for me. I ordered a mango lassi immediately (no waiting until the end of my meal). When it arrived at the table, it was the most beautiful color, not watered down with ice either, just creamy mango lassi. One slurp and one OMG, and my lassi was ripped from my clutches, making the rounds at the table with equal ohs and ahs from all who drank this elixir. I didn't let go of it after that; my fingers glued tightly onto the glass. Selfish? Yes.  The beauty of four of us is the luxury of family style or tasting four unique dishes. The aloo gobi masala had huge pieces of cauliflower. Yum. The lamb vindaloo was ordered at an 8/10. One of us likes it to burn; since he was picking up the tab, we all silently hoped it would arrive at the table with a little less firepower. Thankfully it wasn't an 8, more like a 4. The chicken jalfrezi was excellent with the onion chutney, and shrimp tiki masala had big shrimp! The plain naan and rice were the perfect additions to our meal to soak up the wonderful sauces.   A TV played an MTV-like station, but as my back was to this, I didn't really pay attention to it. There was too much going on at my table to be distracted. Service was excellent.   Great meal! What's next? Their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Came back to Flavors of India on Friday night for an early dinner.    Hey wait staff:  stop watching TV at the bar and pay attention to your customers when they 1) want to place an order 2) need more water 3) need a to-go box 4) want their check so they can get outta there!    Jeez!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian lunch buffets I've had in a long time with all the favorites! The owner said that the buffet selections change every few days.  I will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"The best Indian buffet lunch this side of Mumbai with a wide variety of flavorful options.  Make sure you accompany your delectable meal with a Mango Lassie."}
{"text":"Not bad for lunch buffet.  Limited options. The sag chicken was quite good. Rice pudding had a different spice to it. Not sure I loved it. The chicken Makhani was good. Found the mushroom mutter to be a surprise. Nice and spicy. Tasty."}
{"text":"We LOVE FOI (as we call it). Just kidding. We just call it Flavors of India. But we do really love it. Their Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Curry are fantastic! You may want to request medium heat because it can clear your sinuses. Here's the perfect meal: chicken curry, an order of rice pulao, an order of garlic naan and maybe some veggie pakoras if you need a little appetizer action! MAGIC!"}
{"text":"Great place for Indian/Nepalese food. Definitely recommend the naan, probably one of the best naan I've had in NE Ohio. The one thing I love about this place is how spicy the food was. I've been to many places in Ohio that claims that their food is spicy when in reality is not for me and this place was spot on. Staff and service was great, clean. Location isn't the best for them as it prevents them from getting a lot of the visibility but I'm not going to complain if they remain open and continue serving delicious food."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a couple of years now. They have a great variety and had just the right amount of spice for my wife, mother, and aunt. It's a regular place for us to have lunch, now."}
{"text":"This place had a hard time keeping up with the modest lunch crowd when I was there.   There were 3 buffet items that were totally out.  Not good since there were only a limited number of items to begin with.  I thought the taste was off, not my type of Indian food. No spice and no heat. Blah.  Come on, it''s a buffet and it's lunch.  Nobody has time to wait around for a piece of tandoori chicken.  Buh bye."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food in the Valley! I can't believe I haven't written a review yet. My boyfriend and I get take out at least a few times a month even though we live no where near the restaurant. We always get chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. The sauce is perfectly creamy and tomato-y. Like, I literally want to call and thank them every time for an amazing dinner.   Went once for lunch buffet, but they had dark meat chicken for their tikka masala and I'm not a fan, but I get why they do it. White meat is used for dinner orders and always perfectly cooked. Yum!!!!! Staff is always so friendly and mango lassi is a must as well."}
{"text":"I said goodbye to a good friend over lunch at the best East Indian buffet in Phoenix, Flavors of India (4515 North 16th Street, Phoenix, AZ 85016). The buffet menu, which is known to change throughout the week, consisted of Basmati Rice, Tandori Chicken, Chicken Masala, Chicken Curry, various vegetable dishes containing spinach, lentils, potatoes, onion, fresh tomatoes and green beans, fried green chilies, mint chutney and Naan Bread. The menu items were served from traditional copper pots. This exquisitely flavorful lunch was capped off with fresh mango pudding and fried yogurt balls in cardamom-infused rice pudding for dessert. The staff provided exceptional service, even though the lunch was buffet style. The facilities were clean and presented an atmosphere of Indian culture. Parking was readily available."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time. It's been a hot minute. Today having lunch at their once great lunch buffet was horrid. The rice was dry and crunchy. The food was of poor quality. The tomato chicken tasted like beef jerky . On top of all that the services was horrid. I had to actually get up from the table and walk over to the bar were there was 5 waiters standing around and talking to ask for a refill of soda. They acted like it was such a bother and barely said two words to us. Never going back again"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Indian. And by standard, I mean this is what you will find at almost every Indian restaurant in America. I am no Genuine Indian food expert, but your average USA Indian restaurant will have the same menu as every other one, no matter what city or state you're in.   That being said, if that's what you're in the mood for, then FOI will fit the bill. It's in a very sad-looking strip mall, and the management of the restaurant must be very anxious about all of the empty storefronts around them. But the interior of the restaurant is spacious and comfortable, and when I walked in to pick up our takeout order, I was immediatelly greeted by a very friendly host.   The food was good, as far as overly-oily typical Indian fare goes. We ordered the Tandoori chicken, Tandoori fish, naan, and a cauliflower and potato dish. All were very tasty and served with basmati rice.   I have two criticisms of the food: 1)the onions in the tandoori dishes were raw. Perhaps if we had eaten there, they would have been served in a cast-iron skillet, which would have improved matters. I'll withhold final judgment until we try it again. The meats were all very good, though.  2)OILY. Oh my goodness, there must have been equal parts oil and vegetables in the cauliflower dish. I wonder if Indian restaurants are under the impression that Americans really do want their food swimming in oil and that's why they make it that way, or if true Indian food, in India, is also as oily as what you'll find at restaurants here? I don't have the answer.   **I will put in a plug here for Bombay Spice, at Tatum and Shea, which is Indian food made healthfully, without nearly as much oil or cream as most restaurants. I wish I could count on that everywhere. **  So, it was a solid 3-star experience, given that it met my expectations of very oily, very tasty average Indian food. It would definitely earn another star or two if someone in the kitchen made an effort to cook with health in mind. It's really not hard."}
{"text":"I had a very good dinner here but the subsequent lunch buffet left something to be desired. Just the most of those were very dry. Also I was in a rush and even though I had not gone back for seconds when I asked if I could take a to go box I was categorically refused which did not leave a great impression with me"}
{"text":"I really like the following dishes from here:  Curry Tikka Masala Buttered Chicken Mango Chicken Naan  Now be warned, several of the dishes, from my sampling of the menu, are essentially identical with perhaps a slight twist that makes it different based on a technicality. It's akin to two soups being different because one has mushrooms but the other one doesn't.   You can't go wrong using naan with the four dishes I listed, their naan is soft and not too thick or thin (though I've had friends say they thought it was on the thin side).  I am not a huge fan of the mango lassi that they make here. It's got a little too much milk and not enough mango.   The chai tea here is decent, but don't get it to go. I've heard that the lunch buffet here is good, but can't make it over here during to daytime to check it out."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and staff are friendly and helpful. Not sure about their spicy scale. Based on previous reviews I ordered a \"non-vegetable soup\" and a lamb vindaloo choosing 8 on their 1-10 scale. Now I like spicy Indian food but the soup was too spicy for me whereas the curry was too mild. Go figure. despite this I would recommend that you eat here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good and close, which is why we frequent it. Not the best Indian I have ever had, but still damn good. The decor is pretty standard, they have a full bar and a couple of TVs, one in the dining area playing Indian music videos which are always fun to watch. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The menu is pretty traditional, as far as Indian goes, Naans, Jasmine rice and Vindaloo, Tandoori, Masala, etc., with plenty for vegetarians and carnivores. Dinner is always good and the lunch buffet is not bad, either. The prices are reasonable and there is never a wait. As many times as I have been here I have never had a bad experience. Give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"Flavors were decent. They had about 7 different tubs of dishes to scoop from and a salad-type bar on the side. All the flavors weren't too different from one another - one more herby or one more spicy. The chicken dishes were well seasoned and relatively moist. They give you naan upon seating and you can ask for more. The naan is plain or... buttery? I typically love love love rice pudding, but this place makes it... interesting. It tasted ok, but it was thick. It had other goodies in it like almonds or something.   Staff was attentive, but don't expect any smiles or warm fuzzy freindly feeling. Also, check your silverware... I changed out my fork 4 times because there was still dried food on it. The last fork I got still had dried food on it... but I was actually able to scrape it off with my napkin for this one. yeah..."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch from Flavors of India today for our office. It was delicious! Everyone enjoyed very much and it is now on our list of best places to order from. The food had amazing flavors and tasted very  fresh.   I phoned in our order the day before because it was a large order and when I picked it up the next day it was ready for me and the order was perfect..and warm!   Great customer service, great food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have great vegetarian options and everything I have tried here is so delicious!!! Very friendly and sweet family that runs it and they always take great care of us when we come in:)  **Try the Mushroom Mutter! Its awesome!"}
{"text":"Recipe for lunch success: park easily, eat immediately, flavorful food, attentive service, quick payment. Favors of India is my go-to lunch spot during the week. The all you can eat buffet for $10 is the bomb.com. I dream about their delicious buttery toasted naan and rich chicken masala. The restaurant is clean, and service is fast and attentive - because we are eating plate after plate after plate. Best Indian food in the area. We walk in and make a beeline to the buffet...like, before even finding a table. Where else can you eat within two seconds of walking in?! Nowhere."}
{"text":"Yum! Best Rogan Josh I have ever tasted! Came here on a Friday evening and the place was empty which is a shame because the food was fantastic. I you love good Indian food you should check this place out."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Indian food spot in town.  I take everyone here, and they are always impressed. The service is absolutely warm and friendly.  10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Flavors of India proves my old adage, \"the best joints for ethnic food are little holes in the wall\".   From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much, just another business in the middle of a strip-mall on suburban side road, but don't let appearances deter you.        My review is for their lunch buffet only, so take that as a caveat as I've never ordered off the menu. But also, don't let the term 'lunch buffet' deter you either, this isn't some huge Chinese buffet with fried rice sitting around for hours under a heat lamp.  Their lunch buffet is small but freshly prepared from the kitchen and has all the standards you'd expect from an Indian restaurant; curries, rices, and noodles.  I did my due diligence, or was just really hungry and loving Indian food- you decide, and tried every dish that was available.  Everything I had was great, fresh tasting, and flavorful.  If you have Indian food and it's bland, then they're a poor imitation - Flavors of India does not have this problem and adheres to it's name.      My surprise favorite every time? Their Indian Curried Lo Mein - absolutely fantastic and a nice spin on the staple.  If you're in the area during and want a quick lunch (or in my case, off work for the day and near my fianc√®e's office) you'll get a good Indian fix with this joint."}
{"text":"This restaurant is near our home so we have visited it on quite a few occasions - always for dinner. The food has always been pretty good, though in recent months, we've noticed that the recipes have been substantially improved. We find that we are more frequent diners nowadays.  Today, flavors are more distinct and better balanced. The Vindaloo has has an appropriate tartness against the spice. The tomato-based curries are richer, with a good balance of salt and sweet. We like hot dishes, but usually order them \"medium\" for our friends - and that has worked very well, with everyone enjoying the dishes.   Their location in a strip mall off 16th street doesn't look like much in the evenings, with all the other businesses closed and standard LED open signs flashing, but inside the restaurant is clean and nicely appointed, though admittedly it can be a little too dim for some folks. We could live without the endless Bollywood clips on the TV screen in the dining room (just the bar would be okay), but they do make for comical dinner conversation on occasion.  Service is always genuine, efficient and friendly. Big, cold Indian premium beers are always welcome on a hot Phoenix night and they are served with tall, cold glasses.  Take it from a long-time Phoenix resident that loves Thai, Indian, Cuban and Mexican food -  if you're looking for good Indian food in the Central corridor, try this restaurant for dinner. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but there's always parking and it's very good."}
{"text":"Even though I ordered the lamb vindaloo at a spiciness of 8, it was only mildly hot. The chutney was hotter. A vindaloo dish is supposed to be one of the hottest Indian dishes. This one was not.  The flavors of all the dishes we ordered was wonderful. Unfortunately, they were not hot enough. I would have needed to order them all at 10 to warm my mouth and excite the senses.   We ordered an Aloo Gobi Masala, chicken jalfrezi, shrimp tikka masala and lamb vindaloo with a side order of naan and rice. To wash down the food we had a Kingfisher beer, a Flying Horse beer, a house Cabernet Sauvignon, and a mango lassi.  We were greeted when we arrived and seated quickly. As it was a Thursday evening at about 6:30, we did not have a reservation, which was not necessary.  The waitress was ready to take our order after we had finished devouring the papadums. The drinks arrived quickly and the food soon after. We had to order a second helping of rice as, for four people, one serving dish was not quite enough.  We had a little food remaining after we had eaten our fill that we were able to pack up and take home for later. Just enough for a snack for two people.  I would return to this restaurant but I would need to make sure that they understood that I really enjoy spicy  food."}
{"text":"I went for the Sunday buffet ($10.95), and, as much as I want to support my Indian brethren in NE Ohio, I was not pleased with the food here. Pros first: naan is buttered and crispy; they had a goat curry (a pleasant surprise) and a decent baingan bharta; and, best of all, they had a do-it-yourself chaat bar (which is Indian street food). Chaat is not always on the menu of restaurants, but it's the food that my girlfriend and I crave the most. Look up instructions on how to put together a chaat dish, or ask the waiter, before you dig in.  Cons: though they had 2 chicken curries and 1 goat curry, they were all too watery. Meaning that not only did they lack flavor, but they didn't give my crispy naan much to grab on to. In addition, their chicken was dry and tasteless, with the red flavor-color just coating the surface, leaving the inside barren.  The three vegetable dishes also lacked enough flavor to salvage the experience. Finally - perhaps worst of all - their gulab jamun was kept on ice :( How hard would it be to keep those little balls warm? Unfortunate.   So, while the chaat bar is unique, I was not impressed by the buffet.  (Given that the other reviewers seem to have ordered off the menu, I might have to revise my review once I try something else)"}
{"text":"I decided to give Flavors of India a try.  Its close to where I work downtown and I work with a bunch of guys from India, so why not give it a try.  It's a very small take out place with about 6-8 dishes.  There are some other things like wraps, etc.  They had a special of 1 chicken dish with rice & naan for $6 bucks so how can you go wrong with that.  I ordered the chicken curry.  The portion size was a little small but the curry was very flavorful.  The naan had been sitting around and could have stood to be reheated a bit.  But overall not a bad place.  Since I'm not too knowledgeable about Indian Cuisine I'll have to bring some of my coworkers here and see what they think.  There are not too many Indian places downtown and Flavors of India is pretty OK."}
{"text":"Was not a real fan of this place. Very few choices during lunch time and I thought the food was a bit bland. Also I think the Raita was a bit sour for my liking. Don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time expierience here and I enjoyed it! I had the buffet and tried a little bit of everything. The food was pretty good although some of it seemed somewhat bland. Really loved some of the dishes and the dessert. Service was alright, but you don't really need help with a buffet, right? Anyway it was pretty good, but seemed kind of expensive to me? Maybe if I ate more it would seem like a better deal. I'll be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It was a nice experience.. And I found that I really like Indian food ! Good stuff !"}
{"text":"OK so maybe I'm just a simple Scandanavian man, with an easily pleasable palette. But judging by other yelp reviews, my first FOI experience stands alone. I get a kick out of most Thai/Indian/Asian strip mall restaurants. The decor is pretty tacky. So, I tend to get my chow to go. I had the friendliest, most helpful lady guide me through the menu. We picked out a vindaloo, a tandoori, 2 orders of naan, some veggie fritters and a tikka masala.  Vindaloo 2 stars Tandoori 3 stars Masala 5 stars Fritters 0 stars ughhh  Naan 5 stars King Fisher Beer 10 stars...can I do that? Service 5 stars False ceiling with stains 1 star To go boxes and packaging on full display behind bar 1 star Decor...Bollywood meets flea market meets storage room Well, as they say in India, um, hmmm...I don't really know what they say in India. So, I settle for see you later yelpers!"}
{"text":"1e weededStopped here for dinner last night, told that it would take 30 minutes. We ordered dinner and an appetizer in anticipation of the wait. After the appetizer came no one checked on us or updated on the progress   of the meal. Finally at 1 hour we went to pay for the appetizer and leave. They tried to convince us to stay.....really 1 hour? Scratch this on off the list."}
{"text":"Good and aweful! Several dishes were fabulous. They special made a vegetable manchurian for my daughter, the lamb korma, chicken vindaloo and nan were all delicious.  The noodle dish with chicken was terrible. Salty Raman noodles with some Indian spices. We had several other mediocre dishes, but I can remember what they were. Paneer was scorched and inedible. No onion chutney!  The worst part is their customer service. We called in the order and it took them 45 additional minutes from the pick up time they gave us, to get the order out. My son complained as we had babies at home to feed and get to bed, and the server was flat out RUDE. No apology, no cutesy. He just kept repeating... \"Come on Dude\".   Won't be back. Plenty of other Indian Restaurants to check out!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the occasion curry for several years now, but not with enough regularity to have a favorite dish.  Enter the Indian buffet.  Previously my favorite in Cleveland was the dearly departed Indigo downtown, and Kashmir Palace was a lesser (but decent) substitute.  When KP changed to Flavors of India, I made a dinner visit and was pretty impressed with the new menu.  Most of the changes were subtle (new menus, monogrammed napkins), but they did seem to class up the joint a little.  Dinner was good, and upon learning of their lunch buffet, I have made several more visits on both weekdays and weekends and have been very satisfied each time.  The number of offerings is small (8-10) and nothing out of the ordinary (tandoori chicken, saag paneer, etc.) but they are all very well prepared.  Though a bit more expensive, I prefer to go on the weekends, as their Chicken Tikka Masala seems to be regularly offered then, and it is superb.  Also, the naan is freshly made and frequently replenished, another very good thing."}
{"text":"First customer and last time customer! Order was for pickup and was incomplete. When speaking to the restaurant they said it's wasn't their fault that it was the delivery company fault. But the delivery company doesn't make the order! They still wanted to argue about and offered NOTHING to correct THEIR mistake!"}
{"text":"Good food....sorry but I love Nirvana II more"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best in Phoenix - my opinion.   Try the yellow Dal, Chicken Biryani and Aloo Mutter in medium.   You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"I have been CRAVING Indian food lately and after hearing about FOI from a coworker and reading the reviews here, I decided to try it out for lunch. Ok it is a buffet, I knew that, but I have been to some very good Indian buffets. When I walk into any ethnic restaurant and I see people of the same ethnicity of the restaurant eating there I get excited. It must be good right?   This table must have been family and eat for free because I have had better. The naan was just ok, the Tandoori chicken, meh (well I have never been a big fan of this anyway because almost anywhere it is usually just dry bland chicken to me). The butter chicken type dish with tomatoes, was ok but looked like they added red food coloring. I enjoyed the flavor of the meatball dish, the palak dish was bland. Honestly the only other dish I found interesting other than the meatballs was the Carrot \"pudding\" which was sauteed sweet minced carrots, went back twice just for that. The sweet rice was ok, it had raisins and coconut.  I generally prefer it without either.  I may go try it one more time and order off the menu for dinner. Give it a fair chance before completely ruling it out."}
{"text":"I tried Flavors of India at the Asian Festival this summer and was impressed by the lamb and vegetable curries. I was out in North Olmsted this weekend and decided to try their weekend buffet for $10.95. The server was a charismatic young fellow and was quite funny. Their credit card machine broke and he handled the situation very well without getting flustered. My favorite dish from the buffet was the veggie curry. There was a decent heat level even though it was buffet. If you ever find yourself out shopping at Great Northern Mall and want some decent food, check Flavors of India."}
{"text":"I have to start out this review by saying I never had Indian food before I ate here, so I didn't feel I could give it a fair review until I tried a few others around town first.  Well, now that I have, I have to say that \"Flavors Of India\" is the best Indian Food in Phoenix, bar none!  First off, when you walk into an ethnic food restaurant, and the place is filled with people of the same ethnicity, and the place is really quiet because everyone is busy enjoying their food, you know it's a good place to eat.    Is it a bad thing when the host/manager recognizes you when you walk in... and remembers your order?  You'd think we eat there a lot or something.  I've found my favorite dish is the Chicken Tikka Masala, medium spicy and if you like shrimp, the Shrimp Tikka Masala is just as yummy!  We usually order a side of the Paneer Kulcha (unleavened bread stuffed with Indian style cheese), which is wonderful to sop up the extra yummy sauce after you are finished.  Portion sizes don't appear to be too large, but we always have leftovers.  And it's always better the second day too!  The service is top notch, the food is excellent, and the best part of the dining experience is the Bollywood music videos playing on the flat screen!  Dinner and Entertainment all in one!  FTW!!!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Indian food I've ever had! We had the yellow dal lentils, a cauliflower and potato dish, rice, garlic naan, and potato samosas. The flavors were on hit. Service was great. Very nice people. Definitely highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The food is incredible and the service is great. Everyone there is so warm and kind. I am a big fan of Indian food and I was very impressed by theirs! I highly recommend the korma."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant. I was taken here first on a job interview when I flew into town. Remained a regular stop for me for last 10 years. I still visit any chance I get when in Phoenix. Lunch buffet has only a few dishes but they excellent and fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the entire staff is amazing. The restaurant is beautiful and very colorful. I got the chicken tiki masala with rice and garlic naan and everything was delicious, perfectly spicy. The owners walk around and help out and speak with each of the guests. They make the experience very nice and personal."}
{"text":"Overall, lunch buffet is REALLY bad and the most expensive across the valley. The rice tasted stale and the tandoori chicken.....man, I don't know what was going on with that but I couldn't stomach more than one bite. The chicken in the other dishes were hard/overcooked. The naan was pretty substandard, as well. They only good food item they had was the dessert rice pudding.  I really wanted to like this place and I would have given it another chance had the lady asking for my feedback at the register handled it appropriately"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, decent prices.  Do you need more?  They have a lunch buffet which ends up being about $13.00 per person after tax and tip, and it has very decent variety.  I tried everything--don't judge me-I suffered afterward, but it was worth it. The tandoori chicken, the onion pahkor, and the mango pudding were serious winners. YUM!"}
{"text":"We went in for lunch today.  Parking lot was full and several people inside -- always a good sign that the food is good.  Was planning on doing the lunch buffet but found out they don't have Chicken Tikka Masala on buffet.   Sad panda.  So, we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with some Garlic and Plain naan.  Service was very good.  The plain naan was excellent, while the garlic was a little too garlic for our taste.   The chicken tikka masala was decent, however it was more of a soupy texture instead of a paste that I'm used to."}
{"text":"Great food, and excellent service as always! This place is always so welcoming and friendly.  They always take great care of their customers to make sure everything is perfect!"}
{"text":"Date night dinner was terrific. Staff was friendly and attentive. Samosa, Tikka Masala, and Peas Palou were sooo good. Really happy right now. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a good night out with some great Indian food. I haven't had any for almost a year (mostly because the places are too far from where I live), but yesterday I decided to splurge and take the 40 minute drive to Flavors of India.  I wish I could say that I had a great time, and that it was well worth the trip--it was not.   My first impressions were not good, as I walked into the place and it didn't smell at all. Now, I know that you might be thinking that that's a good thing--but with Indian restaurants it's generally an indication that something is 'off'. I then noticed that it was very dim, there was almost no one there, there was literally NO music, and all the tables and chairs were wonky. As if no one had put them back correctly after vacuuming.   I decided not to be fooled by appearances, as I've eaten at some great holes in the wall that looked less then stellar. So I decided to stay.   The waiter (who was actually very, very nice and I feel sort of bad for posting this review given how nice he was) placed me two tables away from the only other party in the restaurant. Ugh. Without music there was literally no buffer between them and me. The whole thing was just terribly awkward. It wouldn't have been so bad if I'd been across the room, but we were basically next door neighbors.  The menu I received was very old, worn and covered with stickers. Instead of reprinting the menu they just used a price gun to write over all of their prices. It felt very tacky (literally--the materials felt tacky). But everything I had was clean so I didn't leave (if it had been sticky I would have).   I ordered two dishes, the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chana Masala (chickpeas in spices), along with an order of garlic naan. When the Tikka Masala came out I became nervous because the color was totally wrong. It was bright red instead of being a creamy orange. It tasted just fine, and the chicken was of excellent quality, but that was NOT Chicken Tikka Masala. I had also ordered it medium, and it would be generous to even call it mild. The Chana Masala was very good, but again I ordered it medium and I could taste no hint of heat.   The garlic naan on the other hand was a HUGE disappointment. The texture was wrong, the consistency was wrong, the flavor was wrong. It felt more like a bake-at-home thin pizza crust that someone had popped in the microwave to heat up. It wasn't light or fluffy at all, and the garlic was burnt to hell and flavorless (clearly not fresh, perhaps from a jar). It wasn't even like a roti, or any other Indian bread I've ever had. It was terrible.  I'm seriously so disappointed at this place. However, I think they might know that something is wrong (or they should) as I was literally there on a Friday night during the regular dinner rush time and there were only two parties (me, and the group of three) in the restaurant for the whole time I was there."}
{"text":"Small buffet with some OK dishes. I thought the chick peas were cooked well and flavored nicely. The chicken curry was spicy but executed poorly. The rice in the buffet line was old. The fresh naan was nice but we were ready to leave by the time they brought it to our table, which made the meal all the more sad. Not coming back."}
{"text":"really awesome Indian food. do the chicken rogan Josh. the spice level is often a bit of a mystery ranging from unbearable to pretty mild on the same dish on different days but its an adventure! the staff is always very friendly and welcoming. do it!"}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time for the lunch buffet. It was good and the service was great, very attentive. Will be back for the regular menu."}
{"text":"What a great find.. I've been searching for years for a place like this.. sketchy from the outside but worth the wait and that you will do. Ordered chicken tikka marsala. (6 on spice scale, could have gone to an 8) and the lamb vindaloo (also a 6, more fairly spiced) with the garlic naan... oh la la, that hit the spot.. the restaurant is dim and loud from nearby tables but cute and comfy..we will be back and I'm not sure I would even waiver from my original selection it was that delicious... feel safe with this selection on flavor and atmosphere but step out of the box for more flavor with the spices....."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a generous 4 stars because the food is actually very tasty. I've been here twice now, and I'm never disappointed. Indian food has to be on the top of my list for favorite cuisines, and I am sad to say there aren't many or any great Indian restaurants that I have found in Phoenix. Flavors of India, however, seems to satisfy my palate. I enjoy the chicken tikka masala every time. I have also tried the curry chicken, which is also very tasty. The chicken is very fresh and tender, both the light and dark meat. The naan is a bit flat and not soft or chewy enough for my taste, but it does its job. I really enjoy their basmati rice. It's not the most elaborate or flavorful I've ever had, but for some reason, I'm drawn to it, and even crave it. There's no saffron or cloves; it's a bit on the simple side, and just a tad bit sticky. The samosas are decent, although I have had better. If you are in the mood for some Indian food, and this place is close by, I suggest you head on over. Prices are reasonable. Two can eat for 30 bucks, including multiple appetizers. The food is prepared quickly. It's not the prettiest of restaurants but it has it's interesting Indian decor with a twist of Mexican thrown in. At least that's my impression. I don't like that they are closed on Sundays, since that's when I typically like to eat Indian food. The quantity is definitely sufficient, and you will have left overs, unless you like to \"pig out.\"   Try it, you'll probably like it!"}
{"text":"I was glad when I had heard that this place was opening up under new ownership. Cleveland's got a ton of great Indian restaurants, but we didn't have a restaurant that offered Nepali cuisine...until now!   I had a fantastic experience at this place...by far, it was one of the best meals that I've had in Cleveland in quite some time.  First of all, the owners' story of how they wound up in America is really remarkable. Rather than paraphrase it, I'll just repost what they said on their Facebook page: \"We are new immigrants to Northeast Ohio, having resettled here in 2008 from the refugee camps of Nepal. For 18 years we were unable to return to our homeland of Bhutan.\" We heard their story in person too--their courage and persistence in the face of so much difficulty is amazing and inspiring to me.  I went with a group of friends, and we ordered family style and shared everything. We got one of the Nepali combination meals--I think it was the third one on the list--and it was absolutely fantastic. We had plenty of food and we even took home a sizable amount of leftovers as well. The desserts were the highlight of the meal--we had one dessert with ground carrots and spices (maybe parents should serve this dessert to their kids to get them to eat their vegetables?) and another dessert that was like a rice pudding. I think I enjoyed the fragrant scent of the rice pudding just as much as the taste of it!  I also appreciated the fact that they brought bread and delicious sauces without us first having to ask for it. These days, lots of restaurants are waiting until people ask for bread before they bring it to the table...not here! In my opinion, little touches like this can really make a great meal into an excellent meal.  We did get one Indian main dish--Sheila F.'s favorite is the Lamb Korma, so we ordered a serving of that as well. I loved that as well! We dipped some of our naan in the delicious sauce so nothing went to waste--everything was so delicious, it would have been a shame to waste any of it! We also had an order of the samosas.  My great experience made me want to try to more of their Indian dishes in the future. I have a very flexible schedule these days, and I can't wait to try the lunch buffet!   The service was stellar. The ownership and staff are extremely friendly. We had everything we needed and we were checked up on very regularly--which is key when one needs constant streams of water to quench the fire in one's mouth from spicy food--yet the service was provided in a way that wasn't annoying or intrusive.   It's a shame that this place doesn't get the recognition that it deserves. I know for a fact that if this place was located in Tremont, Ohio City, East 4th, Detroit-Shoreway, etc, it would get a ton of publicity. Unfortunately, it's located in a bit of an out-of-the-way place, but as word spreads about this place, hopefully it will get the attention that it deserves!   I know for a fact that I'll be back, and I hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Finally found my Indian place in Central phx!! I love spicy food and this place had some of the best spicy Indian food I've ever had. Staff is great too!"}
{"text":"It was really good food and the service was excellent...I will definitely return to this place in the future.  The location is centrally located.  It is not super fancy, but the service was so great and the food was even better!"}
{"text":"I have never had anything here that was not excellent. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is great. There is something for everyone and the food is not too spicy if you do not want it to be."}
{"text":"This isnt the most imaginative Indian buffet, but I like it for several reasons. Reasonably tasty fare, pleasant buffet service and AYCE prices around $9-10, but what I really appreciate is the subdued and somewhat elegant atmosphere, just a quarter mile south of the big do on Camelback.   There's a ton of busy Camelback restaurants, but it seems the choice is often between fast food, pizza or pricey event dining in the Biltmore or Esplanade. Flavors of India provides a relaxing, comfortable middle ground - sit down dining with real china and stemware at very affordable prices. That fills a niche this area needs.    Everybody forgets this place is right around the corner. It's rarely crowded and there's something comforting about getting out of the sun and the bustle and settling into FOI's dark environs for a leisurely Indian meal. The drink service. The naan. Chafing dishes being replenished. It's a gentle rhythm that suits me and nothing seems hurried like the corporate factories up the street. The people here seem to appreciate that you went a little out of your way to stop in, too.  I always leave feeling I've gotten my money's worth, and frankly, a little rejuvenated.   If you live in Mesa, I dont recommend making a special trip to find FOI.  It's not that good. But if you're in the neighborhood, stressed out from shopping and traffic, it's a soothing alternative, a bit off the beaten path."}
