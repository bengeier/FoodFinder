{"text":"A little pricy but the quality is unparallel.  And the Beer Den is worth the trip alone.  Not to mention the customer service is stellar.  The remodel is fantastic and I've become a regular."}
{"text":"If only they had Harris Teeter's customer service... it's nice to have more than one grocery store to choose from but the customer service is inferior to Harris Teeter. Deli folks who talk amongst themselves rather than wait on customers, cashiers that stand around rather than offering to check you out, brusque people at the service desk. These things matter to customers."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to start shopping at Lowes Foods because quite frankly, I didn't know what it was all about.  You see, I grew up shopping at Food Lion and Harris Teeter and my first job was as a cashier for Bi-Lo.  Lowe's Foods is totally new to me.
   One day last year, I took the plunge and walked on in.  I am totally in love now.  They've got a great Produce selection, an awesome array of NC dehydrated snacks such as Veggie chips and various nuts, pretzels.  They have a decent selection from their deli and are one of the few places in Concord/Harrisburg that sells Boars Head meats.  They offer a Salad bar daily as well as various loaves of fresh baked Gourmet breads. I frequently stop in on my commute to work and pick up a sub and bag of Utz chips for lunch for under 5 bucks.  
   If you are anything like me and venture off the grid with your grocery list searching for gluten free items and out of the norm. grains then you'll love their selection.  They carry most of the Bob's Red Mill items as well as Full Circle Organic.  They have the best selection of Cage Free, Organic or Humanely raised chicken eggs.  
    Lowe's Foods also offers their Lowe's to Go ordering in which you can order online before 3 p.m. and they'll have your order ready for you by a set time.  I recently used this amenity and I will be doing this more often.  It was a great convenience, especially on a Friday when you just don't want to deal with the lines and people.  Like most other stores they offer a discount gas card which you can use at Wilco and Hess gas stations.
   I've never really loved a grocery store before but I love my Lowe's Foods.  I hope they never close this one down."}
{"text":"Love this place so much more now that they have remodeled. Very charming inside and the beer section is awesome! Just wish they had more of a organic meat selection."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. A bar, free beer samples, a SAUSAGE station, and they let me sample ALL of the mustard (I love mustard). Sean at the sausage bar was great! Thank you so much! I want one of these where I live."}
{"text":"Although Lowes is on the expensive side as far as grocery stores go, their quality is outstanding compared to the competition. It's best to take your time when visiting as the fresh foods departments are what really set this place apart.

Produce always looks outstanding, I've never gotten a single fruit or veggie from this place that was sub-par. In the corner is the 'Pick & Prep' station where they have convenient pre-chopped produce ready for action. They also have an extensive selection of freshly clipped herbs.

Deli/Bakery is the envy of other grocery stores. To my knowledge, they were the first to have ready-to-bake pizzas in the fresh foods case. The pre-made entrees and sides are surprisingly delicious; usually store bought dinners are 'meh' at best. The bakery is where things get really good. Cakes are cookies are made with FRESH CHURNED butter! Who does that? Excuse me while I down a cookie real quick (or 6, but really, who's counting??).

My favorite department, and one that's I'll make a special trip for, is Sausageworks! They have over 20 rotating varieties (usually 6-8 in the case at a time) of sausage ranging from Beef, Pork, Chicken, and combinations. No contest my favorite is the Sicilian chicken sausage. Sweet with a strong herby spice, the fennel really comes out in this one. On the first tasting I couldn't believe it was chicken (because usually chicken sausage is seen as a 'healthier' and therefore less tasty) but I wouldn't change a thing! One negative note, the Cheerwine sausage, eh... just stick to Cheerwine in a glass, not on a bun!

Grocery aisles are what you would expect from just about any competitor. Again, maybe a bit more pricy but if you shop the deals you'll leave happy. Also be sure to check out the Beer Den in the corner of the store near frozen/dairy, all kinds of local and craft brews on tap to enjoy while you shop!

If I lived a bit closer then this would probably be my primary store, but the 3-4 trips a month make it all that more special!"}
{"text":"Always clean, friendly and easy to find whatever you need - you can find me in the Beer Den.

The Beer Den is this fun little craft beer and wine section of the store, beer on tap (up to two pints) and a growler station so that you can take some of your new discoveries home too! They have a few tables, convenient because you can buy food in the deli and come here to eat it with a beer! The staff is great, good with recommendations and suggestions. They usually have something going on - $3 pint night or tap takeover. 

Only wish it was closer to home for me! Cheers to the Beer Den!"}
{"text":"Between the people and the customer service, and addressing any problems, Lowes has got it covered! I would go between Harris Teeter and Lowes, and now I find myself at Harris Teeter once a week, and Lowes 3-4 times a week. I also have a special needs child that runs the shopping cart with me and everyone is so helpful and kind and understanding!  They also have the best seafood!! And Fried Chicken!! And produce!! Need I say more!!"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood and amazing produces selection. 
You can mix your own garden tomatoes and I found a variety of very fresh vegetable and fruit. 
The seafood department was very clean and had great prices. 
The store was very well kept and the staff was very helpful. 
I would definitely come back. 
I wish we had one D.C."}
{"text":"Love the remodel. The store is fantastic looking on the inside. Very clean and organized. If you haven't been in it ... GO.."}
{"text":"I love this grocery store. They just remodeled and it's really, really nice. We frequent the deli when we can't agree on what we want for dinner if I don't feel like cooking. The people who work here are amazing too. Always friendly and very helpful. I always leave with a smile on my face because everyone is so pleasant."}
{"text":"This remodeled version is aesthetically pleasing but it seems like we're paying for the renovations through higher prices. The prices seem higher than Harris Teeter and even Publix. More emphasis seems to have been put on customer service also because employees were more helpful than in the past. 

Very nice bakery and produce selection. I also like the area that focuses on North Carolina/local items."}
{"text":"bring your hubby and let him sit/stand at the beer bar while you shop! ;-) was only in here for a quick second. but looked really nice"}
{"text":"\"When Lowe's Foods pulled out of the Charlotte market, swapping locations with Harris Teeter, they mysteriously left this one - though there's another up around Mooresville, every other store anywhere near Charlotte was closed in the transaction.

Whatever the case, this one seems to soldier on, so perhaps at some point they will return (or try to milk some more money from HT or perhaps even Publix).\"
I LIKE THE STORY OF THE LAST STAND SOLDIER.
Let give them an applause!!!"}

The store itself is nice, as oftentimes their layout makes more sense than either HT or Publix, but unfortunately they are not nearby, so we don't get by there very often. The store is typically clean, and staff seems to typically be friendly as well.

As a bonus, they even have gas."}
{"text":"This store is such a treasure in the heart of Harrisburg! I would describe Lowes as a cross between a public and a Harris teeter. It's a very nice grocery store with a few cool things! The first thing is that they offer planted fresh herbs that u can cut pieces off of. Also when a bell rings the workers come out and do a chicken dance. Speaking of chicken-they have great fried chicken. Also they offer fun things for kids like coloring and crafts in the grocery area. They have some awesome items here and really great looking and tasting produce."}
{"text":"I liked the new look. I went in today to get chicken noodle soup from the salad bar. The container was empty. A really nice guy came to help me and said he'd just clocked in and he'd check to see if they had more. After he discovered there was none, He informed me that he had to \"Take it out of the bag and thaw it out.\" I declined politely. I bought their grape chicken salad, when I got home it was frozen... Like a rock.\" They want to appear \"Farm Fresh\" and \"Homemade\" but if everything in the deli is manufactured at an offsite location, I'll take my business back to Publix."}
{"text":"Almost don't want to post this but here is where you will find the absolute best grocery store fried chicken (way better than Publix) and dare I say better than most fried chicken chains!  While they can't come close to Popeyes they leave KFC and Bonasty (Bojangles)  in the dust!  I pick up a breast and wing every Friday when I pick up pizza from Dinos.  And if the car just so happens to be headed in that direction on any other day of the week you will find it,  under its own will not mine,  headed to the parking lot and me to the Deli counter.  

Last couple of times I've gone they've had two different kinds.  And you definitely don't want to make the mistake of getting the other (dry and utterly flavorless).  Since I can't remember what the better one is called I will update this review when I stop back in this week!"}
{"text":"Great job on the renovation!! Love the store and the sausage factory and the chicken area. The theme is of this store is local. You will see local streets as names for the register lanes and the school names for parts of the store for the areas.

I love the layout of how open it is in the front and how friendly everyone is to assist. If you can, check out the bar in the back and all the awesome selection of beers and beer tastings! YES I SAID BEER TASTINGS!!  Worth the adventure and the money to shop local with these guys. They bring in local products with local prices.

They also accept ApplePay"}
{"text":"This looks like a very well stocked supermarket. It's lay out is very similar to Whole Foods, only Lowe's sell organic and non organic products. You can get a Pepsi here, not at Whole Foods."}
{"text":"This is by far the best grocery store around. They always have fresh produce and great deli foods. The foods to go staff are amazing, they shop for you. All you have to do is order and pick it up. Works great for working parents. You can stop by the beer den and have some beer samples or get a beer or glass of wine and do your shopping. It's a great store you won't shop at another grocery store once you go here."}
{"text":"I'm a big Fan of Lowes Foods, I have to admit one of the biggest reasons I love it so much is they have the best.....Pistachio Muffins ever made !!! It's the only place in town I know that has this particular type of Huge Green Pistachio Muffin with an awesome sugar topping . Sadly all the stores by where I live closed down and the only one left is in Harrisburg North Carolina that I know of . So I guess I will be looking for cupcake and muffin bakeries next to find a replacement. Anyway as far as a grocery store they always have fresh produce decent prices if look for the sales just like anywhere else, and The deli and bakery are always spot on !"}
