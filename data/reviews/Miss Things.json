{"text":"We went to Miss Thing's for my partner's birthday. Our party had 5 people. First, if you have sensitivities to scents please be aware that the smell of the air freshener is very strong and hits you in the face when you walk in. The service was a bit strange. We had two different servers and they knew very little about the menu. 

Now the food...
Our starters were quite good. We had the Hoki Poke and the Shrimp Po' Bao. 
For mains we had the fried chicken which was juicy and coated in a nice rice flour but served with very underwhelming cucumbers soaked in some kind of sauce that non of us cared for. We also had the Pineapple Fried Rice and the Poke Bowl which were good. The most disappointing part of the meal was the Grilled Octopus. It was REALLY overdone and very dry. It is served with pineapple salsa which is delicious but I needed more of it to coat the sawdust tasting octopus. The lentils on the dish were bitter and didn't make sense with the rest of the plate. 

Not the best birthday dinner for my partner."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go too Miss Things since It opened. We finally got a chance last night and it was not disappointing. Wasn't too sure what to expect because of the mixed reviews but we had a fantastic time! Our server was amazing! Attentive, knowledgeable and funny. There were four of us so she said it's a share food kind of place so order a few apps and a couple of mains, so that's what we did. We had the spam pintox which was fantastic, the hoki poke, amazing! That didn't come on lettuce leaves though, it came on a crispy wafer, not sure what it was but it was good! Blue cheese dumplings were really nice too, my friend wasn't a fan but everyone else liked them. We also had the fried eggplant which was also really good. 

For the mains, we got braised short ribs, very tasty and very tender. Pineapple fired rice with jack fruit, oh yum! And the fried chicken which got mixed reviews from people but we all loved the chicken. It was crispy, and juicy and the sauce they make in house was fantastic! Sweet and spicy, just perfect for the chicken. 

For dessert, we tried all three to share. They were all delicious! My favourite was the banana split ( I think that's what it was called). Fantastic! Vanilla ice cream with half pineapple, half banana and crisped up like a creme brûlée, a nice light crunch, just thinking about it makes me want another.
 The decor was lovely. Fun, funky, relaxing. The staff are amazing! If you've ever wanted to go but not sure because of some reviews, go and check it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. The decor is carefully thought out and sophisticated. The pineapple fried rice and the squid were delicious and so were the cocktails. The best thing about this place was the service. Our servers were friendly and accommodating and made us feel so comfortable. I couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"Craving poke ever since my last trip to Hawaii, I was ecstatic to find out that they served it at Miss Things. And so one weeknight,  I came here with a party of two, thinking it would be easy to get a spot for a quick bite. That was the first mistake. They barely had space for us, but we took that as a good indication. Luckily, we didn't have to wait to long for a spot to clear up. 

I was told that this place is like a tiki party, and i was not disappointed. There is a definitely a tropical vibe - dim lit, relaxed decor, and all the right colors. The menu serves lots of Hawaiian classics (Loco Moco, Poke), so it seemed like a promising prospect for authentic Polynesian food. A auick look around and you'll see almost everyone sipping on a fruity cocktail served with an umbrella, or out of a coconut/pineapple. I definitely couldn't resist, and ordered one for myself! 

But the most important part - the food. Unfortunate to say this part of Miss Things didn't live up to the hype. The poke, which I was looking forward to the most wasn't served true to the ones I had in Hawaii, but even that fact aside, the sauces completely overpowered the fish in my opinion. The most disappointing was a 4-piece serving of the fried chicken ($20 dollars...making this $5 a piece) which came very dry, and almost flavourless. The pineapple fried rice with pork belly was probably the redeeming item, where the crispy pork belly made it a bit of a treat tasty. And that Tommy's Colada cocktail served out of a coconut? Well, lets just say a hollow coconut isn't that large to begin with, and when you fill it with ice, you're definitely aren't getting much for your $13. 

Pretty disappointing experience overall. This is really more of a 1.5 star, but it gets a 0.5 star bump for effort on the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food here is really overpriced.  The portions are really small and the taste isn't exceptional.  We all ordered a bunch of food dishes and after we split the bill, my portion came up to almost 40 dollars before tip.  This didn't include a drink.   I wouldn't have given the place a bad review but I used the washrooms and it smelled like sewage.... It was coming from the sink and the sinks were dirty with black marks all over it.  Unsanitary washrooms leave a really bad impression on me so I dropped the stars quite a bit.  The service was also sub-par.  I don't know what happened  but a table that ordered after us received food before us, which was quite strange as we had ordered the same dish and had to wait quite awhile to receive any food."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the fact that my girls hadn't been out in a while and were in a good mood.....nah, this place ROCKS! We shared the conch salad, spam crostini (forgot the name), blue cheese dumplings, flatbread, and shrimp bao. All had such unique flavors. 

The shrimp bao was particularly interesting because of the melded flavors of Thai lemongrass with the Chinese concept which was an amazing flavor combination. 

The conch salad had just the right amount of heat to it, combined with sweet and tart flavors.

 The spam dish was delicious as well, as it played on the sweet and salty. Sweet from the pineapple-type relishing scallop on top of the salty spam square. They took a not so glamorous meat and lifted it up to meet the restaurant standard dining. 

You would think the blue cheese dumplings would cause a huge explosion of bold flavors, however it was quite mild which was good, to match the delicate flavor of the sweet rice flour exterior. 

The flat bread was equally delicious.

 For entrees we split the braised short ribs, pineapple fried rice, and lobster ramen. Oh my goodness! That ramen broth is incredible! Rich, buttery, and unique! 

The pineapple fried rice is so good with both the jack fruit and the pork on top. I didn't find it overly sweet, which I was concerned about upon ordering. It's nicely seasoned and presented so beautifully in the pineapple shell.

The short ribs with gnocchi and kale were so tender and bursting with flavor! Made me want to lick the plate!

 For dessert we tried the short stack pancakes topped with pineapple and rum sauce. Perfect ending to the night! 

I gave this restaurant 5 stars, not only because of their food, but also for their incredible staff! Our waitress (small, brunette haired girl) was so accommodating and kind to us. She was patient and really did her best to make us happy! We had a ton of questions and sat to chat for so long, I was sure she'd have had enough of us...but nope! She was incredible from start to finish, cracking jokes throughout the night. That kind of service is really hard to find these days!"}
{"text":"Great concept, poor execution. I'll never understand why antisocial people insist on getting jobs in front-of-house. Been 3 times, and all 3 servers/bartenders were miserable and rude. Fortunately, this is Queen West, and there are countless other bars to visit where you won't feel embarrassed for, you know, actually ordering something."}
{"text":"*sigh*  I was so sadly disappointed by Miss Things. We have been looking forward to going here for a quite a while and thought New Year's Eve would be a fun night to try it out. We booked a reservation online for 9pm. The next day we got a call to ask if we could change it to 9:30 pm and we gladly changed it because it worked better for them. When we arrived for our reservation, it was very busy and took a pretty long time to get seated. That's to be expected on New Year's Eve but the way it was handled made us feel like we were always in the way. There was a ton of people waiting for their tables and not a lot of space to wait in. When we were sat about 15 minutes later we were presented with a prix fix menu. No where on the website did it say there was a fixed menu that night (we heard other people also comment on that) but the menu sounded good so that was fine with us. 

We sat at our table for almost 15 minutes with no one coming over to fill our glasses with water or take a drink menu. When a server came over we found him to be very rude. He just walked up to the table and said \"ok. This is how it works. Pick one of these and one of these and that's it.\" Then went to walk away. No hello, nothing. We informed him that since we were there for a while we were ready to order drinks and food.

The first thing we got was a fritter or croquette or something like that. I honestly can't remember. It was good though. We were relieved that even though the service and wait had been pretty bad until this point that the food was starting off good. A couple of bites in, our second course arrived.  A different waiter brought this over. Clearly seeing that we had barely even started eating he told us \"well, we were behind in seating you but the kitchen already has this ready so here you go\". We were 3 people at a pretty small table. It was actually ridiculous to have so much stuff on the table. There was almost no room. He told us \"well you're sharing anyways so I'll put these wherever they fit\". We explained we weren't sharing, and had never said we were but that didn't seem like an issue to him. Again, the food was really good. 2 of us had the lobster carpaccio and one had the fois gras. Absolutely delicious. Sadly, eating it was super annoying as we had plates over lapping and the table was so crowded. 

When the server came to clear all the plates from our two courses we'd received by then he said \"where are your side plates?\" in a pretty annoyed sounding tone. The other server had taken them to make room for all the other plates. He actually rolled his eyes at us and left to get more side plates. I don't even know why. When the main courses arrived they were so delicious. 2 people at our table had the steak and said it was great. I had the sea bass and it was amazing. One of the best I've had actually. It was such a shame to have such yummy food and such crummy service.  

The dessert was, meh. It was a trio of desserts. A passion fruit mousse which was good, a very sad almost empty profiterole with a chocolate sauce and rum cake that we found to be very dry.  We all felt like maybe one thing would have been better than a trio of things. 

Anyways, long story short the food was very good. The service, awful. From the hostess to the servers. No one asked if we wanted more cocktails, or even really seemed to care that we choose to spend New Years there. The only time we got some sort of interaction from our server was when we had paid the bill. The feeling we got was \"great, thanks for the money, bye.\" We really want to go back and try items of the normal menu, but I just don't know if we will be able to if that was an indicator of the normal service level. I'm really not hard to please at all. I felt like we were a burden for just coming in and having dinner.  I know it was super busy and New Years, and probably stressful for the staff but all we were really looking for was a \"hello. How are you? Happy new year!\"  Anything.  Food: 4.5 stars, service: 1 star."}
{"text":"This place is fine. Good use of different flavours but missing the wow factor I was hoping for."}
{"text":"We walked into this place by chance. Our plan was to go the shameless tiki bar but they were full and we were told the wait could be a while so the hostess recommended Miss things.

We got there and went straight to the bar. We were served by Robin who was beyond awesome. He made great suggestions and gave great information about the cocktails. We had the fuzzy wawa and Caribbean queen. we had other cocktails too(don't remember the names).
No doubt i'll be a regular customer of this fine establishment"}
{"text":"I loved this place! From the beautiful decor, the attentive staff, and the incredible (and I really do mean incredible!) food, Miss Things did in no way disappoint. Get the pineapple fried rice because I mean wow. Oh and a cocktail! Can't forget one of those!"}
{"text":"I love the theme of this place -- it's totally a refined, classy version of a tiki bar. What's more important is how comfy the seating both at the bar and the regular tables is. You'd be (or maybe you wouldn't be, if you tend to frequent trendy places in hipster hoods) surprised at how difficult it is to find comfy seating!

The cocktails here steal the show. I went once on opening night and again a few weeks later and got to try nearly every drink on the menu -- they were amazing and so unique. Best were Tommy's Colada and Disco Juice, if I had to choose. 

The food is good, just not as good as the drinks. Portions are small as hell. And I know it's supposed to be \"Asian fusion\", but c'mon, don't charge me double on half a portion I'd get somewhere else, on things like baos, scallion pancakes and pineapple rice. The more unique stuff like the watermelon salad and mango conch were really pretty delicious, though. 

I'll be coming back here for cocktails after dinner somewhere else, and maybe give dessert a try :)"}
{"text":"Fun and flirty little spot with cute accents that truly make you feel like you're on vacation."}
{"text":"Great little spot in Parkdale hood. Shared pineapple fried rice, braised short rib and blue cheese dumplings. Delicious! Will be back."}
{"text":"The service was much better this time around. A glitch in the Bookenda reservation App caused our party of 6 some issues, but the host was only concerned with finding a solution and making us happy which she certainly did. She found a spot for us and we proceeded to order. This time I tried the spam appetizer and the grilled squid. Both were excellent. As always the cocktails were great. I had a fuzzy wawa, a Maggie made me do it and a buttercup. My fave was the buttercup cause it tastes just like apple pie. One guy at our table ordered a bacon Cocktail that he really didn't like. He said it tasted too much of pickled onions. We were going to stay for dancing but it seemed kind of cheap that we would still be charged cover even after all 6 of us had spent about 75$ each on supper. 10$ cover wouldn't kill us but we all agreed that it's just not cool to charge cover for people who have had a meal There."}
{"text":"It looks so amazing. was very excited when walking in. but the service was terribly slow. it took hours to get our food. half an hour just to order drinks and another half hour to receive them. we were there for over three hours. and not by choice. we just wanted to eat and pay the bill. almost had to walk out. how many times can we beg to pay. the food was good. but thats it. not great and not worth the price. had so much potential."}
{"text":"Rough times at Miss Things. Sure it looks beautiful, but the experience was marred by the indifferent service and poorly executed food. Even more disappointing was the fact that I really anticipated liking the menu - it's posted on their website and promised good, fresh and simple eats, reasonably priced (for the area anyway). In reality, its expensive due to the small portions (relative to its competition in and around the neighbourhood) and amateurish. Specifically, the poke is oversauced, the delicate and (presumably) fresh tuna overpowered by a thick and potent sauce, perched on a lettuce leaf its basically a mayo-ey tuna salad. The pork buns were good, but overly dry until you got to the last bite and really nothing special. Likewise the loco moco - better versions of both can be found at your average Chinese place. A high note was the Lobster ramen - good broth, great noodles but again foiled by a tough, nearly impossible to chew chunk of lobster floating around - an afterthought that spoils the otherwise good broth.

Too bad Miss Thing's, I was ready to really like this place..."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money here! 
We were excited to try this new spot in Parkdale for the cocktails and the seafood. There were four of us in total. We started with drinks, the Disco juice which sounded so good tasted weird and watery. Apparently each drink had 2-3oz of liquor in it but we couldn't taste any vodka in either of the two we ordered. We moved onto beer and the rum punch cocktail which was slightly better.
The food was horrible. Ahi tuna poke was absolutely tasteless, no flavour whatsoever. The corn fritters and shrimp bao were okay, but super over priced for what you are getting. 
The octopus was not fully cooked through. The scallops were $14 for maybe 1.5 scallops thinly sliced over some beets - so lame. And the pineapple fried rice was also bland and pretty boring for $19. 
Our total meal for 4 was over $200 for an app and main each plus a couple drinks - I'd be totally fine to pay that anywhere else where the food is half decent.
They also cram you into the place, can barely get in between tables if you're in the booth, tables are so close together. 
Go to hanmoto or oddseoul for way better food."}
{"text":"Not a good experience here.  Our reservation was for 8:45, and we weren't seated until 9:30.  There were empty tables that sat open for a lot of that time, even after prodding our hostess to seat us. Our server didn't arrive to take our order until 9:45...and we didn't get water until our meal came.  

The food was cold, the portions were really tiny, and the staff (from the hostess, to the bartenders were indifferent).  

We had the Bau Po Boy, the Squid, and the Steak w/ Duck egg.   The Bau was OK, the squid was too strongly flavoured of black bean, and the Steak and Duck egg were almost inedible as they were served room temperature.  We left hungry.

We asked for our server to comp the drinks that we had while waiting to be seated, which she obliged to.  But really, it should have been offered when our table wasn't ready."}
{"text":"Having read a lot of the reviews on yelp, I was a bit skeptical about the place, especially the service, since I was booking it for a large group. However. I thought the service was absolutely incredible. I got in touch with miss things via email and they were quick to respond, extremely accommodating and they even put balloons on our table to celebrate my husband's birthday. 

The food and drinks are slightly expensive, but definitely worth it. The eggplant starter is a must. We ordered the poke bowl which was great too. Towards the end, it felt like our server was getting a little short with us, but that might have been due to our high decibel levels. 

The interiors are an added bonus. The bar looks gorgeous. 

Must try."}
{"text":"Was here last night with a large group of girls for a bachelorette. This place was really cool and had excellent food, but it was pretty pricey. Because our group was large, we had a set prix fixe menu ($55/person). The set menu included samplers for the table: pineapple jicama salad (tasty, with a bit of a kick), hoki poke (ahi tuna on taro chips - not my favourite, but I don't eat a lot of seafood), fried coconut shrimp and tempura corn fritters (my fav of the four dishes). I opted for the fried pineapple rice with jackfruit as my entree. It was delicious, but I was so full from all the appetizers I could only muster a few bites :( For dessert I had the coconut white chocolate semifreddo which was delightfully tropical and the perfect portion size considering the already large meal. Pretty much everyone at our table was ordering cocktails, so I opted for the Disco Juice - a vodka/watermelon concoction with thai basil syrup. It was enjoyable, but dear lord it was $13! In the end our group decided to split the bill and my portion was a whopping $120 - for my meal and one cocktail. Ouch. Good thing the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great Hawaii vibe inside and cool menu options. We ordered scallops and watermelon crisp, tempura corn fritters, pineapple fried rice and loco moco. I was hesitant on the fried rice because I imagine Malaysian restaurants probably do a better job (or at least more aligning to my preference) but it was quite decent here and their large pork belly serving really added to it.  I preferred it more than the loco moco personally, but others felt the opposite.

I also tried the fuzzy wawa drink which comes in a coconut. However it's quite shallow so not much to sip on. 

To the owner- my friends suggested you should consider passing out leis to all customers!"}
{"text":"I went here in November 2015 for a small family dinner to celebrate my mother's birthday. The atmosphere was nice but the service not so much and the food was okay (good but nothing to write home about, lacked seasoning and was a little bland). We were given a table but not served right away, the waiter seemed pretty indifferent throughout the meal. I mentioned to him at the table that it was my mother's birthday and he didn't even wish her a happy birthday. The food took a long time to come out which is strange because the restaurant is not that big. Overall my mother felt it was a good experience which is what was most important to me but I left disappointed. It was not really worth the money. I kept hearing about how great the cocktails were and I tried the coconut one but it was lack luster. It was also very loud and I had to start really raising my voice to talk to the people right in front of me. Food was decent but they seemed more concerned about their cool attitudes than giving the customers a pleasant experience. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"After hearing my friends rave about it I finally made it here on a Saturday during TIFF for a mother-daughter day. We didn't make a reservation so were seated at the bar for both drinks and dinner. 

I love the vibe, decor and the food. The service was exceptional! People were cheerful, professional, attentive. 

We ordered : 
Flamingo drink - very creative. tasted a bit watery for me though. 
Shark Drink
Mushroom wrap - loved it, will order again
Deep fried eggplant - loved it
Poke on yam chips - tasted like ceviche on yam chips
Pineapple fried rice - tasty, I found the rice a bit too chewy for me. Probably won't order again.

Our bill came to $101 including taxes and gratitude. I would say it's fairly reasonable for downtown dining. 

Will probably come back again with a bigger group!"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10
Food: 8/10
Atmosphere: 8/10
Service: 8/10

It could have just been my mood, but MAN was I ready for some tiki-style cocktails and food! Miss Things is everything you get from the name - it's fun, it's girly and all around something that will probably intrigue you enough to continue coming back. 

What they serve their cocktails in can only be described as Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 100. You could get a traditional cocktail glass, a coconut OR a slammin 3-unicorn-like mug, umbrella and straw included. 

Overall, the food is good. There are things to pick at if you're looking for perfection, but I was totally digging everything as a whole. Flavours were definitely big and bold; they don't skimp on spice or sauce!

Top 3 recommended would be: blue cheese dumplings (sounds simple but they use that Chinese sticky bun dough!), shrimp po bao (if there is a weakness for carbs and shrimp), and the pineapple fried rice, as it's something I feel you just have to get. 

PRO TIP: ask for the secret sharing cocktail that comes in a gold pineapple cup!

THE BOTTOM LINE: I wish Miss Things was my friend: she's tasty, fun-loving and always has fantastic cocktails!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here with excellent customer service! The hostess moved us from a shitty table to a nicer table upon vacancy unlike other places. I was a bit surprised at the sweetness of my drink and the server was kind enough to switch it for another drink free of charge. They really prioritize the customer experience here, which is great! Plus the decor and vibe is awesome!"}
{"text":"To the tune of Lauryn Hill's Doo Wop -

Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
Miss Things, Miss Things, Miss things

We had a mid-week girls night here and it was such a fun place!
It's like a tiki bar but for hipsters. 
They do take reservations and I recommend making one!

We ordered a few items that were popular:

The blue cheese dumplings were surprisingly not so cheesy.
The sauce was sweet and delicious!

The pineapple fried rice ($18) is served in a half pineapple.  It's made with brown rice, cashews with sriracha.  The pork belly was the best part.

Another popular item is the fried chicken ($20) for 4 pieces.  This dish was okay but not something I would order again.  I found the chicken a bit dry and the pieces small.

I think my favourite part of dinner was the Mai Thai in a giant metal pineapple.
It's meant for two people.
Haha, they wouldn't serve my friend until I arrived.  

The bartender was telling us about his cocktail inventions and that he was flying to Vegas for a competition.  No wonder the drinks here are a hit! :D

Come here for pineapple everything!"}

{"text":"Expensive, but quality drinks... regular beers available but u must request... the food needs a bit of fine tuning... for those reasons, 3 stars"}
{"text":"This place is over-hyped. 

We had a big party so we had a set menu. 

Shared Apps:
Mango Salad
this is rare mango so it's sour tasting, kind of tasted like normal coleslaw but more tart

Hoki Poki
This is ahi tuna on a taro chip, this is the only thing I ate that i would be willing to eat again 

Fried Shrimp
nothing spectacular 

Blue Cheese Dumplings
this is what westerners may see as a pierogi/perogy and a yellow person like me would never call a dumpling. if you've been to dim sum and had a doughy football shaped thing that is fried with pork in it (both sweet and savory) this is exactly the same doughy outside but with blue cheese in it. (a fusion that I'm not impressed with)

Choice of: ( I of course got to try all)
Lobster Bisque Ramen
The thought of it seems like a win, but execution... not so much. The lobster bisque is really rich and buttery and it made the dish really filling 

Loco Moco
Flank Steak, duck egg over rice... so the flank steak was overcooked and marinated like Kalbi but extra salty. The duck egg was done sunny side up this is kind of a more expensive rendition of steak and eggs with a bit of Korean flavor added. 

Pineapple Fried Rice
standard Pineapple fried rice, can get similar quality at a fast food joint

Dessert:
Lemon Tart
this is a deconstructed tart, pretty much a cookie with some custard and ice cream with a berry compote. I found this way too tart

banana Split
This can't really be done wrong, although portion is tiny 

Drinks:
Carribean Queen
This is pretty much a sangria but in a fun cup, seahorse or flamingo cup and they were all used up by the time we got ours. The waitress kindly took our drinks back and switched cups once they were available. 

Birdy Num Num
This was recommended by the bartender and it was really good.

Don't think I'd be back. Overall a decent experience, yay on drinks and service and nah on the food."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambience and is a good spot for a gathering. Their drinks are served in cool glasses and their food is well presented, however the taste is lacking. 

Among almost all the menu items we ordered, there were some good dishes, like the pineapple fried rice, the tempura corn fritters and the hoki poke. The remaining dishes lacked the punch.

I would definitely consider this place for an experience but not specifically for a meal."}
{"text":"The food is bomb, the atmosphere is really cute. Came here for my birthday and had a lovely time"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed date night. I made reservations earlier in the evening and after an appointment in parkdale we walked over. We got there earlier than the reservation but our table was there waiting. The hostess greeted us and sat us right away. We got a small table close to the bar. I usually hate the small tables for two but I didn't seem to mind it much. Our drink orders was taken within a few mins of settling. We ordered the great gazoo, a watermelon, rum and some other stuff mixed inside a hallowed watermelon was really good but didn't take the alcohol. It might have just been disguised with the juices. Dave for a guava and rum drink. That was very good. 

We started with a shrimp bao. Delicious. Tangy from the green mangos, spicy and the shrimp has a nice crunch.

Then we tries the pineapple fried rice. The Pork belly was tender and melted as soon as you bit into it. The rice was tastey and pineapple was the right amount of sweet. I wish there were like green chillies in it or some kind of spice. It would've gone nicely with the pineapple. 

We also tries the fried chicken - that was Dave's doing. It was okay - light coat and crunchy. But the chicken was bland and needed something more. 

 Everything cost $110 incl tax and tip. But it's lots of food and we're full with lots of leftovers.

All in all the meal was great. We enjoyed the food and drinks and the atmosphere. I'd like to try their entire drinks menu, everything sounds delicious. I love their presentation for the food And the drinks... Makes you want to try what your neighbors (next table) is having! I guess there will have to be a next time..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I'd describe it as a place to go with the girls for fun tiki-themed cocktails and shareable nibbles. The beautiful hand painted flowers on the walls, combined with the super chic chairs/decor make it a very instagramable place (though once it starts getting dark appealing photos are kind of impossible with the dim lighting).

We ordered the watermelon salad, spam pintxo, blue cheese dumplings, pineapple fried rice and the pork buns. My favourites were probably the watermelon salad (refreshing but a nice mix of flavours) and the spam pintxo (i would get two orders of this! the spam and scallop combo was unreal). The pineapple fried rice was very disappointing despite all the hype it's gotten online - I think it's just the wow factor of it being served in a pineapple because the actual fried rice and pork belly itself was very undeterwhelming. The more traditional loco moco (which a table next to us ordered) looked much better!

Service was great, not amazing (could have been a bit more attentive with keeping our glasses filled and coming by to ask if we wanted to order anymore) but nothing glaring."}
{"text":"Very good food and nicely presented! However, the VERY uncomfortable bar stools curtailed our time in the restaurant. Could've lingered longer and eaten and drank more but my thighs , back and butt ached after sitting on those stools for just over an hour. Apart from the dodgy bar stools, Miss Things was just fine."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautifully decorated and they've done a great job with the space. Staff was accommodating when I booked the only available slot for a Friday night and asked to be notified if an earlier table became available. They contacted me right away and got me moved up to an earlier reservation.

I was expecting sweet and rum-y cocktails like the ones found in other tiki bars, but they were all extremely boozy and underwhelming (couldn't taste the pineapple in the Pineapple Reviver, and the Campari overpowered all the other flavours in the Disco Juice). Food was nicely presented but overcooked, oversalted, and overpriced."}
{"text":"Heres the 'thing' - yes food is good, drinks are good if a small pour, however the service is bad.  There is a real disparity in the quality of servers.  Their reservation system is bizarre, they said they barely could fit us and then we proceeded to arrive and be the only diners in the restaurant for almost two hours.  Miss thing needs an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor - great for a ladies night out dinner. Food and cocktails delish! Hoki Poki was scrumptious. A Hawaiian getaway if you can't really getaway. Dress up, get here early and make reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"The gold chrome door handles and pineapple decaled doors had me curious as too what this place was for the longest time as I passed by it almost every day. The name \"Miss Things\" spoke to me. I went there and entered a completely different world. They have done an outstanding job of doing the \"Hawaiian\" décor in a chic and glamorous way and have taken no shortcuts continuing this theme throughout the restaurant. From the cushions on their seats, the menu and the postcard accompanied with your bill. 

If you don't go there for the food this place is a MUST for a cocktail. The waitress passionately explained how each bitter and syrup was made in house. I was impressed but overwhelmed by the selection with unusual ingredients and pairings but she helped us navigate each cocktail to our preference. I decided on the Caribbean Queen. As I got lost in the conversation she presented a ginormous three seahorse figured bowl to which was my cocktail- which was AMAZING. I was speechless. Each time I've gone I've not been let down by the cocktails delicious in their own but always presented in a unique way; full coconuts, glamorous glasses and brassy pineapples topped with ornamental straws and umbrellas. 

Okay the food. THE SHRIMP BAO IS THE MOST AMAZING THING I HAVE EVER ATE IN MY LIFE. Each bite was a completely different flavor. I can't explain it to you, just get it, you wont want to share. Also, I ordered the Pineapple Rice with Jackfruit. What the hell is jackfruit? I had no idea what jackfruit was when I went but the waitress gave me a rundown and I just had to try it. Amazing flavor and made the Pineapple Rice a decadent rich dish instead of a simple one, also it was presented in half a pineapple. No details are forgotten here is a MUST go especially if you're looking for an above average dining experience in Toronto and I need of a mini vacation."}
{"text":"This a great place to go for a \"girls night out\" or just to have drinks with a couple of friends. Drinks are pretty strong, worth price and has nice aesthetics looks.

Food wasn't really amazing I got the pineapple fried rice with pork belly, and the flavour was definitely lacking. My friend got the fried chicken pieces and she also said the flavour was lacking as well. But the food does come under 10mins so that's a plus.

You'll definitely spend $30-$60+ per person definitely one what you get. 

The service is 10/10, everyone was super nice and generous.

Do not come here if you coming for just the food.

But definitely come here for the drinks and the aesthetic!"}
{"text":"I went there tonight w three girlfriends. The restaurant had a lot of issues with service and getting food out on time and in a proper order..... Was really disappointed initially until the manager/owner, Nav totally redeemed the restaurant by exemplifying good customer service and addressing our concerns directly."}
{"text":"Miss Thing's is Parkdale's ray of sunshine! This pan-Asian, Polynesian-inspired restaurant/bar is a fun and welcoming place for individuals or groups.  The décor is on point with classy furnishings, playful colours and sophisticated hints of tiki culture sprinkled throughout.  Barman Robin Wynne offers a refreshingly delicious Hawaiian themed cocktail menu and serves his liquid creations in elaborately tacky glasses, which not only adds humour and magic to this spirited restaurant but also makes for a great selfie! The service in this establishment is fantastic and prices are reasonable. I definitely recommend Miss Thing's if you're looking for a change from the ordinary!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, very ista-worthy with their menu, drinks and interior decor. The main reason I came here was for their cute drinks and an insta worthy post. The food was very different from what Ive tried before probably because of its non typical fusion offering. Im surprised there isnt that many reviews or nice pictures of this restaurant. Their cute drinks should be advertised more through pictures rather than descriptions, I literally wanted to order 4 drinks because of its presentation but held off because I didn't want to be too full to try their food. Overall a great must try! They play music rather at a high volume which helps with awkward conversations but not great when you actually want to talk because you'll have to yell."}
{"text":"This place gets 1 star for the cocktails. I have been here before 8 months ago for a friend's birthday. Food was decent and drinks were amazing. This time I don't know what happened but the food quality has gone down. DO NOT COME HERE TO EAT. I waited over 45 mins for first course. They weren't particularly busy. I commented to the server and she discreetly told me that they changed the chef. That's perhaps the reason why the Seasoning /soy sauce / sesame oil ratio, was very off. Asian CONfusion food."}
{"text":"the décor is NICE! You will definitely take a little time admiring the colours. Love what they did with the place. 

After hearing the social media world go on fire about this new establishment.

Thought I would give it a try.

Walked in about 8-ish and was very fortunate to find a table. This place was rammed. It seemed like people were there to stay. I was there for an hour and a half and groups that were already seated and enjoying their meals were still carrying on while I was leaving.

Which makes sense- since the cocktails were pretty amazing. I had tried several different ones and they were all awesome.

Honestly- the food was BOMB! No Lie...the fried chicken was very different from anywhere else in the city- and trust me I am a connoisseur . I was blown away- also the kimchi based pickles that accompany them were fascinating. The pineapple fried rice was extra delicious and the presentation alone makes you feel good. The fried shrimp was marinated perfectly. Only thing I didn't particularly fancy was the Bau. Maybe cuz it was a little bit heavy with the garnishes. Barely got that wonderful feeling of biting into a soft bun in order to get to the juicy meat.  I was greeted with a bunch of crispy lettuce or cabbage instead.  Luckily I had the delicious fried rice and chicken to run back to.

Overall-definitely will be back . Cool Place. Great Staff. Music was dope. 

Enjoyed myself!"}
{"text":"A very hip and cool place, and especially cool drinks! 

This place is packed all night long and even though we made reservations for a late dinner and drinks, we still ended up waiting a long time. Didn't help either that the staff gave away the table that we were supposed to get to accommodate for the manager's friends -_- 

Besides that, the drinks are good and really bring that tropical vibe to the city. 

Reservations are a must, despite still having to wait, but without, you'd have a very slim chance of getting a seat as it was literally packed from the second we arrived to late into the night."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

This is one of those Instagram famous spots in Toronto where people flocked here in the summer for its signature watermelon drinks and Hawaii-inspired decor while the food in general is Asian fusion themed. This place is also actually bigger especially in the back than it looks because on weekend nights after 10pm it turns into a lounge/club. The combination sounds a bit odd to me. 

Without holding a high expectation, we came on a Friday night. The restaurant was busy. There were 4 of us and we ordered 1 small plate - the eggplant, and three big plates - the pineapple fried rice, loco moco and lau lau. We also got bunch of cocktails - one of them was is in a cute shark-shaped container and the other is in a tiny fresh coconut. 

Overall, we think the food portion is decent. Price is not in the typical Parkdale range but King St range. The drinks are okay and more suitable for instagram pics (lol). One thing we really liked is the eggplant appetizer - it was delicious! The pineapple fried rice was flavourful but the rice is definitely undercooked...you can taste the uncooked dry hard bits in every bite. The loco moco is standard. Lau Lau is an interesting dish which to me looks like inspired by the Peking Duck Wrap dish popular in Northern China. Instead of wrapping sliced Peking Duck meet with chives, you are wrapping Pulled Pork shoulder with fish and mushroom (yum) , pickled carrots and daikons, and mashed taro (nom nom nom). It's a pretty cool idea. The wraps were extremely not proportioned to the amount of the stuff you can wrap though. We asked if we could get a side of the wraps and apparently there will be extra charge for that, but they offered to give us free lettuces to wrap, which worked too. 

Whether we would return is a good question because I'm not sure what this restaurant is exactly good at. We didn't have any negative experience, but we didn't have anything stellar either and it's not exactly that affordable. Maybe it's a much cooler spot in the summer since the scene and the drinks would be much more appealing."}
{"text":"The much anticipated visit to Miss Things finally happened last night. Overall, my girlfriend and I agree that this place was worth the try but will explore other restaurants before coming back to Miss Things. 3 stars for a lack of true identity and sub-par service.

THE GOOD:
- Three out of the four dishes we ordered were excellent. The homemade spam, shrimp bao and the pineapple fried rice were all very well-balanced dishes with great textures and full of flavour. I would not recommend the fried chicken as it was bland and the dipping sauce tasted like straight hoisin sauce.
- Intimate but not crowded. We sat opposite to the bar along the wall with about 7 tables for two. Although we were close to our neighbours, we didn't feel like our elbows were rubbing. Those tables are a perfect size to enjoy an intimate conversation with space still for your food.

THE BAD:
- Getting to our table. The hostess seemed very flustered by the complex iPad reservation system. When we mentioned we had arrived for our reservation she spent about 30 seconds navigating the iPad before guiding us to our table. 
- Service basics ignored. When we sat down our server filled up our glasses of water but didn't greet us until 5 minutes later when she took our order and asked \"Have I said hi to you yet?\". Also, please don't clear my partner's plate if she is done and I am still eating. The little things mean a lot!

THE UGLY:
- The decor. I thought this place was a Hawaiian fusion restaurant? The interior is dark green and the light fixtures and tables/chairs look antique. The only tropical-ness I saw were some flowers painted on the walls and some mini drink umbrellas on the tiki-isn bar."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night for dinner with the girls. I saw pictures of this place online and thought that the decor would be super cute, and it was... if you sat at the front of the restaurant. The back of the restaurant was less appealing. We were seated at foldable tables (the plastic ones) and it just didn't give off the same vibe as the front of the restaurant. That being said, there were 8 of us, and maybe they couldn't accommodate bigger tables at the front.

The food was good, but nothing special. The rice in the pineapple fried rice was also a tad undercooked. If you do come here, I'd lay off the mains and order just the apps - my whole group enjoyed the apps/ small dishes over the mains.

The one thing I really did like were the cocktails. I thought all the cocktails we ordered were adorable and tasted good."}
{"text":"Super cute establishment. Another one with the island feels -- I'm definitely digging it!
They've got poke on the menu (delicious) and the drinks are pretty darn good. We also tried the braised short ribs which comes with gnocchi -- yum! I was dressed very casually, and even though I probably should have been a bit more put together, I didn't feel uncomfortable at all! The service was super friendly and very quick. Although it we did not make reservations (on a Saturday night no less), we were seated right away at the bar. We never felt ignored by staff, and actually we found it to be more entertaining hanging out by the bar and people watching (and noticing how the bar staff interact with each other and the customers).

I seriously cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best.  I'd perhaps go back solely for their tiki drinks with friends visiting from out of town for the novelty.  Despite the fact that they severed my same drink orders in different sizes and the prices were not consistent.  The pineapple rice with jackfruit was severed lukewarm and tasted day old.   This place is way overpriced and overrated"}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  I came here with a group of girlfriends to celebrate a birthday.  The atmosphere is fun and casual.  We were seated near the back and noticed the back half of the restaurant can be used for functions.  It felt weird to be at a restaurant steps away from what could be a club (when we were leaving the restaurant we could hardly get out the door because there was a long line and a bouncer ...)

My friends all liked the cocktails.  They had a creative names and were presented in cool cups (think alligator, coconuts, etc.).  I wish I could say the same for the food.  There was no overview of the menu so it was difficult to discern how many dishes to order.  All of the appetizers came out a once which was annoying because the table was hardly big enough to accommodate our tiny plates and all 4 appetizers.  In tapas restaurants where sharing is encouraged, I appreciate when food arrives at the table in waves.  The plates were also so small that after each appetizer we had to ask for them to be replenished.  

I liked the fried eggplant, fried chicken and the pineapple cake.  I found most of the other items just fine.  It was a friend's birthday so I had discretely gone to the front of the restaurant to ask that the hostess tell our server to bring out a dessert.  Between clearing the dishes and bringing out the dessert it was at least 30 minutes to the point that another friend had to ensure they had not forgotten, which was a bit awkward because we were trying to be discreet. 

I would not return but definitely would not deter someone from giving this place a try."}
{"text":"So many things. 
Ambiance was beautiful. (Be a pretty and casual guest- ppl wore runners and/or elegant dressy items!) Music was lovely, lighting perfect, design was beyond thoughtful! So many beautiful and romantic touches! The drink menu is rum/tequila heavy so I'm a happy lush - fuzzy wawa comes in a coconut, all the kitschy happiness! Any of the different cocktails I ordered landed nicely (5) but the standout was the 'Madie Me do it' a refreshing and vibrant take on a blissfully sharp tequila mojito. My sweet server directed me to it. 
Speaking of service- one hundred percent professional- but fun! Super quick, from the hostess to the bartender to the lovely servers! (Bit of a lack of bussing) now with all this brown nosing you may be wondering why I left off a star (no u r not, but I think just that highly of my reviews ;'p) it would be that the food was really 4 out of 5. The only dish that landed for me was the poisson cur, a delightfully effervescent fish salad with a coconut pate (my wording not the restaurant) it was challenging and bright and had all the tropical flavours of this Polynesian fusion restaurant focused and with the lightest touch. There was snapper, red onion and the sweetest infusion of the beach. Beyond compare. 
Now... the shrimp po'boa - meh, comforting and yawn
(I know I'm a bore!)
The scallion flatbread - densely delicious, like a high school jock - strong and forgettable aside from when you feel like a bit of throwback. 
The fried chicken- no. Boo. Over brined, too soft and mushy, my date was looney in love with it. It was what I would have if I had an ulcer and couldn't eat fried chicken anymore. I'd eat this. Bc it's the softest, least crunchy fried chicken in the city of toronto. Soft, nearly sweet put for the gentle salt flavours. 
The dessert- Bruleed banana split - ice cream was not very flavourful, again date enjoyed it, but the banana was a lovely surprise, crisped out with sugar and love. And really that's the take away from this restaurant. Every single element is crafted, created and poured over with absolute love. Soulful love. There is nothing banal, it is sweet and fine and loving. Omg... I think... why I think I'm in love! :')"}
{"text":"I rarely review, but always mean to. I try to get out to Toronto a couple times a year lately and booked a friend's bday gathering at Miss Thing's a couple weeks after it opened. The space is amazing, the music is pumping, and the service is impeccable. But it all boils down to the food. And drink . The drinks are delicious and strong. Between our party we sampled all cocktails on the menu. There wasn't a bad one. But the food. Oh the food. We had a couple orders of the shrimp and wings and squid and the pineapple fried rice and Loco moco. Every one exceptional. But that rice. Holy snap. I've been dreaming of it since.  My friend who's husband was of Asian descent and a killer cook in his own right said this was the best rice she's ever had. I agree. Go for the pork belly. You won't be disappointed  bravo Miss Thing's! Oh and they noticed we were celebrating and sent over a round of Shots  this restaurant made the night memorable."}
{"text":"It's pretty atmosphere reminds me of something in Yorkdale rather than a tiki lounge. 
Food was tasty (shrimp po'bao and chicken yakatori), drinks were a let down. They tasted weak and we were excited about maybe getting a coconut or something fun to drink out of...no just a regular tumbler glass. If I'm paying $15 I want a fun \"tiki\" drink! Also ordered pineapple cake shots which had to be reminded to arrive.
Back to the food, it was ok. Nothing I couldn't find elsewhere for a better price. 

Bill was around $70 and I felt the regret. Not really an exciting atmosphere, not feeling tiki.... feeling my parents watered-down version of tiki. It seems like the other bar down the street knows their stuff(fun drinks, fun decor). 

Two stars because it was pretty inside, food was warm and fast."}
{"text":"I went here to my 25th birthday with a couple of my friends. I heard nothing but great feedback from my friends and family that have gone to this restaurant recently. However, I felt the complete opposite after this visit. The food that we ordered all came at different times. Two of My friends recieved there poke bowls first, 25 minutes later another dish arrived. 30-35 minutes after my friend who ordered the same dish as me got her dish. After waiting another 20-25 minutes I finally got pineapple fried rice with pork belly. Overall the food was underspiced and bland. The only good thing about this experience was the cocktails and unique interior."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night for date night, however the place was jam packed! We had to grab a seat at the bar so you should definitely make reservations before you go, especially if your crowd includes over 2 people. The food was delicious and the drinks are pretty. On the left is the fried chicken (4 piece) - just comes with the chicken and sauces, for $18 I'd say that's a bit over priced. Then on the right is the shrimp po bao - delicious and only $12!! Overall, great experience. I'd say it's the perfect place for a girls night!!!!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday my friends and I were excited to celebrate our best friends 30th birthday  and chose Miss Things as the venue to host the party. 
Guests started to arrive around 9:30pm and I was excited to buy the birthday girl her first shot of the night. Since she doesn't really drink hard alcohol, we walked up to the bar tender and tried to order 3 porn star shots (her favourite drink!.) After ordering, the bar tender responded with an immediate \"no\". 

We starred at him blankly and were obviously confused by his abrupt refusal as he did not continue with an explanation. When I asked \"why not?\" he said \"we don't serve sweet shots\". I've never heard of that, but if that is the case, fine. But there is no reason to be that rude-  To customers or anyone. 

We tried to ignore it since we were there to celebrate a special occasion and told him it's my friends birthday - pointing to the birthday girl. He starred blankly at us for a while not even suggesting another drink, finally after asking what else he can recommend, he said \"I can put pineapple juice in a vodka shot.\" We ordered 3 of those. His overall demeanour was disinterested and downright rude.

In the meantime, the birthday girls younger brother joined us at the bar and started reading the names of the drinks on the menu. We were laughing and joking at the tiki themed drinks... all which looked pretty SWEET by the way... just saying.

Just as the birthday girls brother decided on one of the drinks to buy for his sister the  bartender looked at him and yelled \"you are wasted there is no way I'm serving you a drink, you're done!\". He did not ask how much he had to drink (although the answer would have been 1 beer) instead, he thought it was appropriate to point him out of our group, the only guy with 5 other girls and refused to serve him for no reason whatsoever without even having a conversation with him first. 

The birthday girl was shocked (as was myself and her brother, the innocent bystander) and became defensive of her brother. We explained to him that he was definitely not \"wasted,\" not even drunk as he hadn't even had more than 1 drink at that point. Our friend calmly tried to explain to the bar tender that he was with her all night and had not been drinking but her brother, the victim in this, honestly explained that he had a beer with dinner - which was 100% true. 

The bartender turned to my friend, pointed right in her face and actually SHOUTED  \"you are a liar!\" He began to belittle our group of friends and tried to get the birthday girls brother kicked out of the bar for absolutely nothing as soon as we got there! The whole thing ended with him trying to tell us none of us could be sereved(?!) when we were the first of 25 people to arrive for the birthday celebration. We were all shocked and appalled! 

The birthday girl was in tears and left immediately with her brother who felt completely victimized for no reason. I have to say out of my 30 years I have NEVER encountered such a rude, ill-mannered, discourteous bar tender, in my entire life! By 10:oopm ish our party had left Miss Things before the rest of the invited guests had even arrived. Our whole night was ruined as it was too late to find another venue to host 20+ people who would have happily purchased food and drinks all night as planned. 

Though I shouldn't even have to defend myself here, we are not a rowdy, obnoxious bunch of people. We are young professionals who were excited to celebrate a very special occasion, and were really hurt at the way we were all treated by this man.

We all felt horrible for the birthday girl and sadly her 30th birthday was ruined because of a bar tender on a power-trip. The birthday girl did not even receive a call or email the next day and as of today there has still been no contact or apology from the management team of this venue who seemed eager to help plan this party with her. 

Our friend, who helped organize the party, sent an email to management outlining the above, and has yet to receive a response.

It goes without saying that no one in our party or even friends of their friends will ever step foot in this place ever again and we warn any one reading this review who may consider planning an event there to re consider or consider yourself warned. Worst service I have ever experienced in my life."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner party, and it was awesome. Our waitress was great and the food was great. Everyone ordered drinks and loved them. Our food orders were delicious, I ordered the steak and duck egg on rice. Very tasty, others ordered the pineapple fried rice. We ordered appetizers and they all tasted great. I cannot rave enough about this place. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a yummy cocktail or a yummy dinner."}
{"text":"I went into Miss Things on the weekend and had the time of my life. The food was amazing the drinks were to die for and the service was great. All I can say is you have to try this place for your self."}
{"text":"One of my friends was raving about this spot so i just had to check it out. Definitely exceeded my expectations. 
The interior decor is unreal (from a professional perspective). The atmosphere is perfect for a date night for cocktails or a girls night.
The drinks are so unbelievably unique!!!! This spot brings something exciting to Queen st and is never a dull moment.
The food is different than your usual so if you're going to eat make sure to check the menu before hand to see if there is anything you like. But the selection is delicious. 
I give this spot a heavy 9/10."}
{"text":"It was so much fun and the food was incredible! Plus out waiter Alex was fantastic - he made all the right suggestions and was always around when we needed him, not a small feat considering the place was absolutely packed and he seemed to be covering almost all of it! Highly recommend for a fun date, just don't forget to make a reservation if you're going there on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of people for a birthday.  Highly recommend you make reservations as the place was packed well into the night (we left close to 11pmish and it was still packed).  Located on Queen W, you can find this place by the pineapple on the door!  The food is a contemporary version of Pan Asian/Hawaiian dishes as per their website.  Having been to Hawaii several times I can attest that this is good food. 

We tried several different dishes to share - the pineapple fried rice, grilled octopus, chicken skewers, and grilled eggplant.  Everything was delicious but the portions are small so keep that in mind if you are super hungry.  The drinks are delicious and their names are hysterical (All night oolong; Maggie made me do it, acceptable in the 80s....LOL).

My only one thing is that service is sloooooooooooooow.  It's understandable because it is packed but if you come here super hungry just be prepared to wait.  Might be a good idea to put your entire order in upfront to avoid further delays.  

The décor here is definitely interesting - check out the pictures posted - huge flowers on the wall, dimly lit, very tropical themed.

I'd come back for some small bites and a large drink!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and decor. I came here with my husband and we got:

- Hoki Poke - 3 stars. It was missing lime juice and flavour. 
- Shrimp Pi Bao - 5 stars - amazing! 
- mushroom Bulgogi - 3 stars. Just okay.
- silver needle noodles - 5 stars - really good and slightly spicy!

Probably won't come again but it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Cute for the gram and decent food! 

Upon arrival they couldn't find our reso so we had a drink at the bar and waited for a table to open up. It wasn't too long of a wait even for a Saturday."}
{"text":"The decor seems a bit slap-dash, and the food is hit and miss. We really wanted to like it, and had a pleasant experience, but wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday. He wanted to find a place reminiscent of our honeymoon in Hawaii. The drinks are delicious and and served in very fun ways! The shots were delicious! The food was amazing - everything ordered was different and delicious! Alex our server made bread recommendations - the pineapple fried rice delicious with the jack fruit!"}
{"text":"Fun, fun, fun. This cool little restaurant delivers big on fun and flavor. Made a reservation for 4 for Friday night. Highly suggested because the place was packed. Everyone was drinking wild looking cocktails, they were out of watermelon drinks so I ordered one in a coconut. My friends drink came in a seahorse chalice. Very fun. 

All the foods are made to be shared. We ordered sooooo many delicious things. 

Pineapple Jicama Salad - yum
Tempura Corn Fritters - mega yum
Chicken Yakitori - delicious 
Poke Bowl - outta control 
Grilled Octopus - wow 
Fried Chicken - the most amazing thing on the menu
and a few oysters to boot - mmmmm hmmmmm 

Fun friendly atmosphere with banging food and drinks. I highly recommend you check out this gem."}
{"text":"Have been several times here but realized I've never wrote a review!

The cocktails are always on point with amazing presentation but also so delicious.

My favourite is the Rum Manhattan which is barrel aged. Some amazing complex flavours.

I love that they have Kona Brewing Co on tap and Robin behind the bar is amazing!

Haven't tried any of the food other than the fried eggplant which was phenomenal!

Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"So I just might be the first man to leave a review for this place, and for good reason. I was the only male patron in the entire place for most of our dinner. I thought it was a fluke, but when I asked my server, she told me this is a common thing in that restaurant. I'm not sure why or how it came to be; possibly they market towards the female clientele - but there no discernible factors that would lead one to that conclusion.

That being said, I had a very enjoyable experience on all levels: Food, Drinks, Service and overall ambiance. We ordered the below dishes and they were all recommendable:

Fried Eggplant
szechuan chilli glaze, smoked paprika aioli, pickled radish, scallion

Pineapple Fried Rice
brown rice, toasted cashews, sambal mayo on half pineapple, with choice of braised pork belly or sweet and sour jackfruit

Lau Lau
pork shoulder and salt cod wrapped in banana leaf, taro mash, steamed pancake, lettuce wrap, pickles, housemade hoisin sauce

FUZZY WAWA
daiquiri in a coconut with havana club 3 year rum, coconut lemongrass sake, kaffir lime syrup, coconut bitters

SCHOFFERHOFER grapefruit radler"}
{"text":"Great place for a large group party! I planned a bachelorette dinner & drinks for my friend here. 4 stars for the food, drinks and party vibe, +1 star for their customer service. Emails during the planning process were prompt and professional! They even asked for the event name, so they can print it on the menu and offered to decorate with complimentary balloons! 

For large groups, it's a prix fix menu for $45/ person, which offer several appetizers and mains to be shared across the table (approx 1 set for every 4 people). I especially like the Hoki Poke which is an ahi tuna poke on taro chips, the Fried Eggplant and the Sea Bass. The drinks are really fun and social media worthy and really contributed to the fun everyone was having. The rest of the food were mediocre. My friends thought the appetizers in general were better than the mains and would have preferred more appetizers over main dishes. Our server was super awesome and friendly! After dinner, the restaurant transforms into a tiki disco party. Overall though, everyone thought it was a great experience and had a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Miss Things was far and away the most delicious place I ate in Toronto during a recent visit. The tempura corn fritter appetizer was crunchy and sweet with a delicious spicy aioli. For main courses, both the poke bowl with coconut rice and the braised short ribs with brussel sprouts and gnocchi were amazing. Be sure to try the delicious cocktails too, so good- and some of them are presented super cool (banana dolphins, coconuts!). The staff was nothing but kind and attentive, and the decor manages to be fun yet sophisticated simultaneously. Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"A very cool place with great drink options. I love the cocktails like disco juice, electric banana 
Great service friendly staff."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for a birthday dinner and has a sweet and sour experience. Firstly, they make you have a 3 course prix fixe menu for any group over 5 people. This seems a bit excessive to me and was disappointing as I really wanted to try the pineapple fried rice. Next, the drinks are quite expensive. I wasn't even drinking alcohol and my small pipettes of ginger ale were $4 a glass, coming to over $12 total as they kept refilling while neglecting to mention they were charging for each refill. The food itself was pretty good, the main flank steak dish was tender and delicious although a bit salty. The deconstructed lemon tart dessert was passable. It also took almost 2 hours for our first dish to come put which is pretty unfortunate."}
{"text":"This was such a fun culinary experience! It's not everyday you (and by you I mean I) find a delightful little Hawaiian restaurant in Parkdale. The place is a lot smaller than I anticipated but apparently the back of the restaurant is rented out for special events and maybe particularly bumpin' Friday nights. I'm not sure. I'm pretty sure it was 7pm on a Tuesday when I was there so understandably, not bumpin'.. but still busy enough to make you think 'hey, if this many people are here at 7pm on a Tuesday night, they've got to be doing something right\". They were doing a lot of things right! Starting with the decor which was simple and classy mixing Polynesian with Art Deco. I had a cocktail called 'Becky With the Good Hair' which was one of the best cocktails I have ever had, served in a tall glass with a gold straw. This place oozes effortless elegance. The presentations of all of our dishes were on point. As an entre, we had the fried eggplant - crispy and delicious in a sweet and tangy drizzle and the pineapple fried rice, served in an actual pineapple! Both had a very authentic, naturally sweet taste. I wish there were a few more veg friendly menu items. Regardless, I will definitely be back, especially during the impending winter months for what Miss Thing's is servin' up - the culinary equivalent of a Hawaiian beach vacation."}
{"text":"Not the hostess with mostess! !

Had the most delicious meal with amazing cocktails and our waitress was delightful! 

We had said we would be getting dessert but were  just having a break.

Then the hostess comes to our table and tells us we need to leave as they have another booking.  She was not polite about it. We informed her we would like to have dessert and she said well unless you sit  at the bar it's not possible. 

Perhaps if you know you have a booking you should have informed us with a decent amount of warning. 

Such a shame,  a sour end to the evening!!"}
{"text":"Website says invites walk-in, had a small hiccup with the host since we didn't have reservations. Staff were polite and accommodating, seating our group of 3 at the bar. Really nice interior, great feel. Menu was delicious and cocktails fantastic. Nothing but rave reviews for our bartender, as he was simply the best. Recommendations, have reservations. Or hope for the best and have a backup plan."}
{"text":"Had been meaning to check out Miss Things for quite some time. The decor is lovely and atmospheric. A little loud, and a little tight.

Watermelons are out of season, but they managed to get a cache of small ones for a splashy tropical drink (meant to be shared between 2 people). $22. Tasty.

The Hoki Poki (tuna on taro chips) was reasonably good, even for someone who doesn't normally enjoy fish.

The Pineapple Fried Rice was just okay, and a bit overpriced at $19. Not a lot of flavour. The pork belly was chewy and fatty... should've gone with the jackfruit, I think.

The Fried Chicken was reasonably good, but again, a bit overpriced at $18 for 4 pieces. It came with house-made pickles, which tasted like vinegar and sesame oil; we weren't feeling it.

+ Good atmosphere
+ Good service

- Wobbly table
- A little overpriced and overrated
- This restaurant is pro-gratuity"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night around 6. Had a reservation which seemed like a good idea as it got very busy within half an hour. Server was kind and very efficient. He explained that the food was Polynesian inspired and it was recommended to share a few plates. Ordered the eggplant, famous pineapple rice and lau lau noodles. The food was very sub-standard. Bland, cheap on the meat and overall underwhelming. Considering you can get similar dishes at cheap Thai restaurants in the area for half the price I'd avoid this place. That being said, service was good and decor is cool."}
{"text":"All the dishes here are amazing I can't say more great things. I only wish the service was as good as the food. I came here this past Thursday to celebrate my friends birthday, and we were shocked at how disorganized the servers were. Maybe they were under staffed, I don't know? Anyways we started off by ordering a round of drinks and the scallop and coconut laksa (perfect dish!! every flavour was superb!). Then we had the grilled octopus, pineapple fried rice, fried chicken and miso lamb shank. 

While the food was delicious, we were disappointed that our dishes didn't come out at the same time. We also waited forever for our fried chicken. We followed up twice about it and when it finally came it was the wrong one, so we waited even longer for the right order to come (annoying). After we were done we had to ask a different server for our bill because we couldn't find our initial server. And after waiting 20 minutes for someone to come to us, we ended up just settling the bill at the bar. 

What was even more frustrating was that a table next to us, that was seated maybe 30 minutes after us, was able to order food, get all their dishes brought out at the same and in a reasonable time, paid their bill before us even though we had asked for ours before them. 

We spoke to the bartender about our experience and he tried to get the manager to our table but apparently they had already left for the night, so he advised us to write a review in hopes that someone would reach out. All in all, I will probably be back because I'm weak for their pineapple fried rice. Hopefully the service will be better next time."}
{"text":"Visited again with a friend the other week. Again sat at the bar because I hadn't made a reso in time. I enjoy sitting at the bar here! Robin served us, and made a great recommendation for the first drink. As I had to drive home he made offered to make a mocktail, which ended up being so ridiculously delicious. I'm not big into sweet drinks - more an old fashioned kinda girl - and he got it exactly right. So. Damn. Good. Robin was a great host and I'm looking forward to my next trip to Miss Things!

Only things I'd change are the bar stools - or maybe my legs are too short! And add a hook for my bag. 

Side note; though I wasn't blown away by the pineapple fried rice last time, almost every table (and fellow bar dwellers) had an order so maybe I'll give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but you're paying for the concept. We made reservations which were not honoured in terms of timing (we were waiting for about 30-40 mins), and overall, the dishes are super expensive for the portion you get."}
{"text":"Came here for some late night drinks on a Friday. Drinks were a bit on the pricey side but the cocktails were good, creative and as flashy as you'd expect from a Hawaiian themed restaurant. Only downside was that the place was dead and the chairs were super uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Not joking when I say this is the worst place. Yes the drinks look cute but first of all the derive is terrible. The waiters give you the dirtiest looks, literally snapped at us for taking \" too many photos\", and we're constantly rolling their eyes at us. Made me so uncom. The food was gross and expensive as well"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We had a giant drink in a watermelon and an order of corn fritters. The drink was super refreshing, big enough for two, and absolutely delicious. The corn fritters were crispy and flavorful and fresh. I would come here every day but I don't live in Canada. You should come here every day if you do live in Canada."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends and won't be coming back ever again. I get it, the drinks are fun and the vibe is live but the place in general is okay. We had a whole bunch of food brought to the table which was amazing cuz there were over 10 dishes for everyone to share. The Fried Eggplant was the best thing I had there and the dessert.

I was excited for the fried chicken which I had high expectations because of other reviews but when I tried it I wasn't sure we were eating the same fried chicken because it wasn't anything special or people haven't had real fried chicken to compare it to. (I love fried chicken) but not from here. The Hoke Poke I was excited to try but it was a little warm which threw off the taste, and the pineapple fried rice was under cooked. This is not a complaint this was from my own experience and if you've read any of my reviews I'll tell the food how it is. 

The decor is nice and the environment is live I see why there was a ton of women who come into this spot way more girls then guys. 

At the end we had a fun night but our food kept coming out every half an hour which took forever and we were hungry! Will I come back? Never."}
{"text":"We walked quite a way to enjoy a drink and appetizers with four of us.  We entered at 6:40 pm and there were numerous tables open; however we were told that they were all reserved for dinner customers only and there was no room at the bar for us either.  While we understand this fact, the attitude of the hostess was quite disappointing.  She just appeared to shove us along and out the door and as a result, we will never attempt to return."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The vibe is so cool, and the drinks are top notch! The staff is also very helpful with the menu incase you aren't sure what to get!"}
{"text":"Equal parts fun, adventurous and delicious have pushed my emotions over the edge to give Miss Thing's five stars. With playful boozy cocktails, a fantastic menu and a cute Polynesian vibe, there's nothing to not like about having dinner here.

- Cocktails - everything we had was very tasty and while there were variations of the standards you'd expect in a tropical-inspired restaurant (rum punchy-type stuff), the variety was good enough to please everyone's liquor preferences. And spectacle is a huge part of the cocktail experience here. I was enamored of the Caribbean Queen which is served in an enormous seahorse chalice - for once I got a sense of what it must be like to be as baller as King Triton in The Little Mermaid, which isn't something I typically expect to feel when out for dinner. Thank you Miss Thing's.

- Dins - we ordered a mix of appetizers and dishes to share. I was delighted by all of the creative choices and knew I couldn't have everything I wanted to try in one meal. We went with the pineapple fried rice, which I recommend you get only with the sweet and sour jackfruit (you have a choice of jackfruit and/or pork belly); we got a mix and while pork belly is dime a dozen these days, the jackfruit is totally unique and delicious. The rest of the rice was incredible, with a strong red pepper flavor anchoring the sweetness of the pineapple and all of the other savory things coming together. Also, it's served in a pineapple. 

The fried chicken was the highlight for me as one of those people who needs to eat gluten free. There was so much meat on each piece I felt like the chicken must be regenerating as I was eating it, which wasn't as disturbing as that might sound since it was amazing. As other diners have mentioned, the batter is softer than normal friend chicken, but it's still crispy, and I think the really down and dirty star-anise spicy glaze you dip the pieces into complements the sweet, soft batter perfectly. I'm going to be back for this chicken! I'm also going to be back for the rest of the menu items. The service was prompt and friendly and the ambiance as I have mentioned is nothing but the retail manifestation of a Hawaiian print shirt - all party, all the time - though still appropriate for a \"nice date\" out. 

Anyway, I'm surprised it doesn't have a higher rating! It's easily as good as--and certainly more interesting cuisine-wise--than some of its super popular neighbors. I say hula hoop those hips on down to Parkdale for a memorable meal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, the service was great and the atmosphere was perfect for a girls night out.  The fried rice in a pineapple was awesome...too many good dishes to list them all.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pros: interesting food, a beautifully designed setting, friendly service, good cocktail selection, fun vibe

Cons: portions are somewhat small for the price, some dishes are a miss (eg the octopus was quite rubbery, poke appetizer is a bit skimpy on the tuna)

Worth checking out but not necessarily worth going back to."}
{"text":"What to try?

Their drinks. There are over 15 cocktails to choose from on the first page and some of them are served in these really cool glasses. Just look at my pictures. Makes the experience so much more fun. Not all the cocktails come in nice glasses though. Fuzzy Wawa comes in a coconut. Only a select few like the Caribbean queen, electric banana, and the left shark. The food is great too but if you're planning to share, I'd say go for the mains because the sizes are big enough to share nicely with a group of two to three. I recommend the pineapple fried rice and the silver needle noodles. Very tasty!! I absolutely love the vibe here. The walls are covered in hibiscus and the waiters are dressed up in Hawaiian shirts and tops. The music they are playing are retro disco music and you can really groove to it while you eat or drink!! 

Last tip?

They also have a secret menu which doesn't have drinks on the menu. One includes the Great Gazoo and the Our Tai Drink. It's always disco Saturdays where they play some retro disco music and they have the disco ball and dance floor going! Best of all, they have a party area that can accommodate up to 300 of your guests in the back. Isn't that just awesome?"}
{"text":"Went here for the firs time last night. I heard of all the hype and how difficult it is to get a reservation or just drop in to eat. I was looking forward to the experience as I wasn't quite sure what to expect. 

The atmosphere was pretty cool. Very relaxed vibe. The hostess and the servers are really good at making you feel at home and taking care of your dinning needs so this is a plus. 

The drinks are fun and creative. Very different from what you would see elsewhere so that was a pleasant surprise. I ordered so pineapple drink which was pretty good but it tasted like black licorice which was a bit unexpected. I think the drinks are a bit overpriced for the amount that is served in the cup (full of ice). 

The food was mediocre. First it came out quite cold. Was not hot like it should be. We ordered the shrimp as an appetizer which came in a soft squishy sweet bun. It was ok. Not my favourites. We also ordered the steak with coconut rice and the beef short ribs with gnocchi. Both were so so. The one thing I did like was the coleslaw that came with the steak and the sauce for the short ribs. The sauce tastes like oxtail gravy (West Indian style) that was a big plus!! However the sauce over powered the meat. 

All in all this spot was just ok. I don't think I would rush to go back."}
{"text":"The tiki-theme made Miss Thing's seem promising upon entrance, but the experience did not live up to this. Our waiter was pushy and rude when we asked to change our order and the food was incredibly overpriced for what it was (overcooked ramen noodles and $19 for fried rice??). Would not recommend. Miss wrong bar."}
{"text":"Top-notch service on a weeknight. Awe-inspiring cocktails and terrific presentation of some food. The only weak point was the crab crostini. We would totally return for dinner, cocktails and/or a birthday party!"}
{"text":"First time here! Found the place while browsing Google maps. Always expect to find some gem out in Queen west. It's a cute restaurant with lots of floral designs, funky cups for drinks, and hosts DJs on Saturday nights.The menu is a mix of Asian and  Hawaiian fare, we ordered the pineapple fried rice and a noodle dish, besides other appetizers and everything was tasty and flavourful. The servers are nice and helpful and we were celebrating a friend's belated birthday and everything went smoothly. Will come back in the near future."}
