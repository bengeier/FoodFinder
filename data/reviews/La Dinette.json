{"text":"Horrible, ordered the waffle and it was raw and the strawberries were brown with the stem still on"}
{"text":"Quelle belle surprise. Déjeuner exquis service impeccable. Je le recommande très fortement."}
{"text":"Très joli petit restaurant qui a récemment ouvert ses portes! Accueil chaleureux ! Vent de fraicheur dans un coin de la ville où il n'y a pas beaucoup de restaurant qui se démarque!"}
{"text":"Délicieux! Nous avons déjeuner des gauffres ce matin! Nous avons déjà hâte d'y retourner. Belle place!"}
{"text":"Très jolie restaurant avec un accueil super. Les gaffes et les crêpes étaient excellente. Le service rapide mais nous avons trouvé le tout un peu dispendieux"}
{"text":"Very charming little spot where you'd least expect to come across an independent café/brunch spot (Radisson Metro station). The owner is also the owner of Bon-D on Masson.   Portions are generous and the menu offers a selection of mostly waffles and grilled cheeses (both sweet and salty options). We spent most of our meal chatting with said owner's mom, who takes orders, makes coffee and is basically the sweetest lady ever. All meat is cooked daily at Bon-D and prepared at La Dinette.  Not the best food and coffee in town but best option in the area for sure. Comforting experience, and expect to walk out of there smelling like a giant grilled cheese. But hey, isn't that what Sundays are for?"}
{"text":"La Dinette is close to the Radisson station and therefore very accessible. I was greeted very warmly, the decor is beautiful and rustic, everything that I like. I started with a cappuccino...hum twice and then ordered their fried chicken, BBQ sauce and cheddar on a waffle (customers can choose between a crepe or a waffle). Usually, I am reluctant to order waffles since nobody has ever managed to reproduce the soft waffles that I like so much... well now I know where to go: The waffle was excellent on all sides, it was delicious and absolutely not dry ... Did I mention that I loved it? I will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem :). This was the first time venturing into montreasl-eat/anjou and was excited to try out a brunch place in the area so that it would be close to home/our airbnb. The place is quite cozy with beatuful decor that made you feel as though you were in a country home with the pastel touches and the gorgeous statement wall.  The menu was small and savoury. Both savoury waffle plates i had were divine! And it included a drink of your choice :)! The host/server/owner was so warm and inviting and although we were english speaking for the most part, she picked up that we could understand and attuned to our comprehension level quite well. The atmosphere, the service and the food were top notch and made us repeat offenders throughout our trip. (i recommend the egg pesto waffle and the apple bacon waffle). Merci beaucoup la dinette :D!"}
{"text":"Si c'etait possible je donnerais un 2.5   bon le concept est cool, mais il manque un petit quelque chose pour rendre l'experience le fun !   De plus, les plas ne sont pas vraiment extra... nous avons commandé le grilled cheese aux saucisse fumées et ketchup maison et je vous jure que c'etait un grilled cheese au saucisse hot dog et au ketchup heinz ! Le pire la dedans cest que le grilled cheese est genre a 12$ !  Leurs spécialités cest les gaufres et je ne peu même pas vous dire que la gaufre que jai mangée etait bonne ! Elle etait ben ordinaire !   Finalement, un gros bof pour ce resto !"}
{"text":"Very cute diner. The sandwiches come with potato or macaroni salad as well as a drink. We ordered a ham/Brie/mushroom sandwich panini, macaroni salad, and cappuccino - all were delicious. I would have rated 5 stars, but the table was a bit sticky and I got cold when a back door was opened for ventilation."}
{"text":"Went to this cute little restaurant on a Saturday morning. Luckily we had seatings because we didn't reserve (plus came with 2 babies). Small restaurant with only about 8 tables. Love the decor. Was served by the owner s mom, charming lady who really love children.  They have a good menu selection. Either crepe/waffle or grilled sandwich. My husband and I shared half our plate. We had the jambon sur l'os on waffle and porc effiloche grilled cheese.  Super tasty! And we were both satiated!  We also enjoyed their special coffee (latte, cappucinno, espresso or americano) included!!!!  And the grilled cheese came with homemade macarroni salad or 2 other choices. Definitely recommend this restaurant. There is also a Private Parking lot in front of restaurant."}
{"text":"Meilleure gaufre à vie!!  Gaufre bacon braisé, cheddar et pommes caramélisées!  Petit, max 20 places.  Super beau décor!  Francine la proprio est tout simplement incroyable, service hors norme et haut delà de toute attente! Chapeau, je reviendrai!  Best waffle ever!  Bacon confit, caramelized apples and cheddar!  Small place, 20 seats max. Super cute! The owner Francine is simply amazing, incredible service!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a surprise!  A pint size breakfast restaurant with matching price tag. But a decor as gorgeous as the plates.   They have a very limited menu, but every item looks good.  I had the fried chicken waffle with BBQ sauce. Which was delicious. I wasn't sure about the BBQ sauce for breakfast, but it's maple syrup based."}
{"text":"We walked from our hotel, after reading the great reviews.  The kind lady took our drink orders - delish latte for me and an Americano for my boyfriend. We then decided on my ham, cheese, red pepper crepe for me- he got a cream cheese strawberry crepe. Gorgeous presentation for both plates, you could tell she really enjoyed cooking and was delighted to see us happy with the look. But taste is everything and both crepes were amazing.  I want to go as far as saying best crepe I have ever had.    I love eating at tiny little places like this.  And if she is the owner- she takes pride in what she serves.    100% recommend this place if you are staying close by."}
{"text":"Excellent service, la bouffe est succulente, tout est fait maison. Que vouloir de plus?"}
{"text":"Amazing food - really stunning. We had the bacon and apple crepe, which was a thick, smoky braised meat with sweet cooked apples, and the fruit and cream waffle with lemon zest, whipped cream and cream cheese and tons of fresh fruit. Best of all the owner was just super sweet, friendly and kindly explained things in English for us. The decor is charming and and clever. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Such pleasant service and delicious food. If you're looking for a great breakfast when in Montreal, look no further than La Dinette. Chicken and waffles was fantastic. The addition of melted cheese and the BBQ drizzle as opposed to maple syrup were BRILLIANT. My partner had the bacon grilled cheese and it was equally, if not more so, spectacular. Merci beaucoup La Dinette!"}
{"text":"D'abord, si j'avais eu à juger le décor seulement, je lui donnerais 5 étoiles, c'est tellement beau que ça te donne le goût d'y rester pour la vie.   Sauf que, la bouffe est vraiment décevante. D'abord, il faut savoir que c'est un restau qui offre seulement des gaufres/crêpes ou des sandwich déjeuners style \"grilled cheese\". Les prix sont élevés (environ 15-20$ pour l'assiette) donc on s'attendait à de la qualité. Malheureusement, j'ai pris le sandwich avec le cheddar et aux saucisses fumées et ketchup maison.... Le cheddar ressemblait étrangement à des tranches de fromage kraft, la saucisse était une saucisse hot-dog coupée en deux et le ketchup était clairement une sous marque de heinz. Terriblement déçue! Le goût n'était pas fameux (bien évidemment) et le prix beaucoup trop élevé pour rien.   Mon copain a pris la gaufre au jambon, pesto et fromage. D'abord il y a une goutte de pesto, à peine. Ensuite, le jambon est bon, mais rien de fou et il y a des bouts impossibles à manger à cause du gras. Le fromage? On le cherche encore... La gaufre était vraiment très ordinaire. Je connais 1000 autres places qui offrent de meilleures gaufres et c'est supposé être leur spécialité!!  Bref, je déconseille ce restau à tout le monde. Malheureusement c'est seulement beau. Rien de bon."}
{"text":"Définitivement mon restaurant déjeuner favori! Un décor digne de Pinterest avec du papier peint fleuri, des cadres et meubles vintages. Petit mais intime et chaleureux et c'est parfait comme ça. Le personnel accueillant et souriant, il me semble que c'était la propriétaire (je ne suis pas sûre) qui était là et c'est une adorable femme rayonnante qui a à coeur la qualité de notre expérience. La gaufre cheddar, bacon et pommes est à tomber par terre. Je n'ai jamais mangé un déjeuner aussi délicieux dans un autre restaurant. C'est à essayer absolument pour encourager nos commerces locaux. J'y retourne c'est certain!!"}
{"text":"I have Canadian heritage. I felt like I walked into my aunt's kitchen. The sweet lady that greets customers helped us reconnect with the French language. Wonderful strawberry and cream waffle with fresh sliced berries. My wife had a ham and pesto waffle great creative dish. This a small place 5 tables. Can't help but notice how neat and clean everything was. I like to have real maple syrup. When I asked about the syrup the owner brought out the container authenticating the source. She had me at bonjour!"}
{"text":"Found this lovely family owned brunch place when I was deciding where to eat near my place. It's a small restaurant with home warming decor. The waitresses were very polite and nice. Though we don't speak French, they tried their best to accommodate us in their best English as possible. Thanks for the effort!  I ordered bacon apple waffle I think. The bacon was amazing!!! The dish combo was very good! Never really tried bacon with sweet maple sauce! Waffle was fresh and puffy! I really like my dish.   Though there weren't much people there when we arrive, the food took a little longer than expected. But there were only two people working, and they make everything freshly; waffle, bacons, etc. so I cannot blame them, it is a family business after all!!"}
{"text":"Très bon petit Resto ! Intime et donne l'impression de manger des repas de maman!  Nous reviendrons assurément"}
{"text":"Petit café indépendant sympa, ouvert depuis août 2015, localisé dans un mini centre d'achat, servant crêpes/gaufres/grilled cheese/parfaits, prix abordables, belle déco, 2 minutes de marche du métro Radisson. Bel ajout dans cette zone d'HoMa, pour le brunch ou un café. Découvert par hasard, je reviendrais essayer leur menu encore une fois. Ouvert tous les jours de 8h à 16h. Wifi gratuit. Carte de crédits acceptées.   5/5 visité en décembre 2015."}
{"text":"The location of this little restaurant is just out of reach for a lot of people, it is located in the eastern side of the city and it is a family run restaurant that offers dishes made with local ingredients. The service is really the highlight, the owner of the restaurant is really super sweet and offers candid and warm advice for hesitant clients. She also patiently and passionately share how she prepares her dishes and why they taste so good. I tried their smoked ham waffle and it was indeed super good, but it was so filling that I spent a lot time finishing the whole thing. I fell in love with the cute decor inside the restaurant, the old style pantry is definitely the biggest attraction for instagrammers. Their coffee is also quite good, but the food is the most amazing part. I would recommend this lovely place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place and friendly people. It's been a few weeks since I last went so I'm not sure if it's been changed but when I went they only had like one waffle machine so if you're a big group and multiple people order waffles then everyone will get their meal at different times. Apart from that the food was really good and it's a cute and small place."}
