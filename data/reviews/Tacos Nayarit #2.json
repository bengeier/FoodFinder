{"text":"Just had the beef and chicken tacos, and they were excellent.  Didn't know what to expect from a food truck, but these are probably the best, authentic tacos I have ever had.  They were good and spicy, but not overbearing.  The veggie and onion toppings were very fresh.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for authentic Mexican tacos; I will be going back to try everything else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic tacos ($2) burritos ($6) etc. I tried the pollo, carnitas, barbacoa, alpastor. All amazing. Will be back often!"}
{"text":"Much better food than other dine in restaurants in Charlotte area. Visit them and try for yourself and this is a must try food truck in the area. I recommend take out from here than dine in."}
{"text":"Waited for over 45 min to get an order of torta and one taco , i was late going back to lunch never again"}
{"text":"As a native Virginian who lived a Colorado for a little while, I've had about everything in the spectrum of tacos from the good, to the bad, to the worst. These 3 tacos I just finished were far and away the best I've had in a very long time. Quite a pleasant surprise as I never know quite what to expect. If you're nearby and love authentic tacos and Mexican eats, definitely make a pit stop here."}
{"text":"This is my go to taco truck!  The only one that I frequent because they have tacos de tripa!  Yes, tripe!  And they are delicious!  The truck is clean, the service is friendly and fast and the food is made fresh to order, each and every time.  In addition to tripe tacos, I get the cabeza (head) taco and the sopes!  I've tried the burrito once and it was hearty and filling and reasonably priced.  Each taco order comes with grilled onions, a roasted jalapeno, a wedge of lime, radish and green and red hot sauce at about 2 bucks a pop.  Get your plate, squeeze some lime on your taco, pour the sauce of your choice, take a bite of taco, a bite of the jalapeno and partake in taco heaven.  I end my meal with the radish and a nice cold horchata (they sell that too)!  And when your done, go get gas because it's parked right at a gas station near the back.  They also have sheltered picnic tables so you don't even have to eat in your car.  And if you see those crispy, pinwheel looking things (Chicharoones de Harina/rinds of flour) in the ziploc bag, BUY THEM!  Deep fried, light and crunchy!  Buy a bag, grab the bottle of hot sauce sitting there, shake, shake, shake it into the bag and eat these while you wait. So good!  My stomach is literally growling right now but I can't even go because I am on short term vegan adventure but when it's over....watch out!  Until then, have a taco(be adventurous and try tripa or cabeza), an horchata and some Chicharonnes de Harina with hot sauce and thank me later!

FYI...Horchata is a ground rice drink that may include spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cocoa, vanilla, etc..

That is all!"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty tacos. I love the way they put slices of cucumber and radish. I will try the less traditional meats and non taco dishes next time."}
{"text":"It's about time some authentic Mexican cuisine came to the area!  This arrived in the form of the Tacos Nayarit #2 Truck.  We got a Barbacoa burrito, an Alpastor Pork Taco, and a Carnitas Taco, all of which were phenomenal.  The burrito wasn't just flavorful because of the tender and well-seasoned beef - the rice was the best Mexican rice I've ever had.

All dishes were served with a grilled hot pepper (one was mild, the other much spicier) and grilled onions.  There is also Valentina hot sauce & a green/Tomatillo-based hot sauce on the tables, as well.

I'll be more adventurous another day - other meat options included Asada, Pollo, Lengua (beef tongue), Cabeza (beef head), Tripa (beef tripe), Chorizo, Campechanos (beef, chorizo), and serving options were Tortas, Sopes, Tostadas, Quesadillas, Tacos, and Burritos.

I first tried to go at lunch on a Friday, and all 4 picnic tables were full, with about 15 people waiting to order - best to go on an off-peak time, or on the weekends.  It only took a few minutes from order to having the food hot at our picnic table, under the awning at the back of the gas station/convenience store/post office/now taco truck.  Well worth it, and will be back often."}
{"text":"Loved my Tacos tonight! These were the most authentic I've had in a long time! I was cautious at first just because of the location but I'm so happy I stopped to try it out! Had the beef tacos and will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. Just like being in California! Better than most of the sit-down Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This taco truck is amazing. I ordered 2 tacos barbacoa(slow cooked beef) and 2 tacos campechano (beef & chorizo). All tacos come with onion & cilantro as well as cucumbers a jalapeño and sautéed onions. The size of the tacos for about 2 bucks is definitely worth it. All tacos were cooked fresh and tasted even better. This taco truck is family owned and the kids even work here. It's really amazing to support local family latino businesses. They really work hard and take pride in their business which shows in the taste of their food. Will be back very very soon!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST Mexican food I've had in my life! It's authentic, full of flavor, and fresh! If you want real, good, home made Mexican food this is the spot. It's hidden behind the gulf station. On top of the great food, the price won't break your bank either. Go! Go now and change your lives!"}
{"text":"So so good! We eat here as often as possible. The food is always great...nothing else like it around. And the guy who works the window is extremely helpful and kind. If you like authentic Mexican food, this is an excellent stop."}
{"text":"You hear about hole-in-the-wall places, but one on wheels rolls into place every day except Sunday immediately off of Hwy 160, in Indian Land, at the junction with Hwy 521. Tucked into space along the back side of the MJ Mart, you cannot miss the large awning/tent covering the picnic tabled eating area.  I know, eating from a trailer parked in a gas station?  Yep and you will not be disappointed.

This is a Taco Truck.   And Nayarit is a town in Mexico, so don't beat yourself up trying to find it in dictionaries.

And there will be lots of workers with their lawn care, plumbing, landscaping and other vehicles of the trades.  Much local color and a great place to practice your Spanish.  And be prepared to wait as many orders are \"to go\" or \"papa llevar\" to a work crews nearby.

The lady taking the orders speaks English, so have no fear.  And there is a friendly air about the place.  And it is very clean, both the truck and the eating area. 

The menu is simple, with photos of each item and a price next to it.  Tacos are $2 each, burritos more.  Plan to order at least two tacos, and they can be filled differently, so experiment.  The different meats, from beef, pork, head (cabesa), tongue and tripe are listed on a poster.  If you don't know what it is, ask.  And just walking around to look over what others are eating is a good way to simply ask, \"what is that you are eating\"? 

You get a jalapeno pepper, a wedge of lime, a radish and some grilled onions on your plate.  Just like in Mexico. Hot sauce is on the tables or on an outside shelf of the truck.

Beverages are Jaritos, a commonly found soft drink in Mexico and there are also standard American beverages.  I have seen people using credit cards but am not certain as I pay cash.  

If you are there early you will see plastic bags of fried orange looking things.  They are chicharones of fried flour.  A form of Frito maybe.  Sounds different and they are, but in any case they are great for a snack, they sell fast and you will enjoy them. 

Truly an authentic Mexican fast food experience.  Bring friends or make it a first date.  Your date will always remember the experience and you."}
{"text":"How can you not agree this permanent food truck has the best most authentic Mexican in town? These pics don't lie, the taste will bring you to mexico. Get the Sopes too!!!"}
{"text":"Moved from Southern California last year. My wife and I have tried many restaurants to find a authentic street Taco. 
This is the real deal! 
The taste, flavor and smell are authentic LA."}
{"text":"Finally! Authentic Mexican tacos, tortas, and sopes in South Charlotte, and the best part is that it comes from a food truck. Once I saw that their menu included lengua (beef tongue), cabeza (beef cheeks), and tripas (beef intestines) tacos. I knew I had to try it. I was not dissapointed. Lengua and cabeza meat are not easy to cook and season, but here it is done the right way. It is tender, moist and mildy seasoned, yet flavorful. I did not ask, but the tortillas seemed hand made. At two dollars a taco, this is a great deal. Simple, authentic and delicious tacos. I will be coming back to try the rest of their menu, but what a great find this turned out to be."}
{"text":"I am a taco truck enthusiast, and I have to say this place is amazing!  It is my go-to taco truck when I am in Charlotte. The taco truck is clean and the staff is friendly.  The food tastes great and is relatively cheap!  Each entree comes with sauce (green is pretty hot while red is really hot), sautéed onions (delicious), jalapeño, and slices of radish and cucumber.  You can pretty much cannot go wrong with anything on their menu, but my meat of choice is Alpastor (spicy pork).  You should definitely try it.  If you decide to come, make sure to bring cash since they only accept that method of payment!"}
{"text":"Just driving by the other day and saw the food truck. Noticed the high rating on Yelp!   My boys were talking about taco Tuesday and knew just where to go!   2 beef tacos for me burrito for one son and quesadilla for the other!   Have to say the best most authentic Mexican food in the area!!! Totally impressed with the food service and the people who joined us on the patio!!!  Food truck at it's finest!!! $20 goes a long way !!!"}
{"text":"Couple of work buddies & I stopped here for a lunch break. We each got a couple of tacos with the meats being barbacoa, pollo, & chorizo. Very tasty, quickly prepared, an alright amount of food for $2.00 a taco, even though the board said $2.50. Forewarning, this is a cash only food truck."}
{"text":"Look, I'll cut to the chase.....Taco trucks in the parking lot of gas stations have a certain, let's just say stigma about them.  You know, the whole \"roach coach\" thing? 

That does not apply to Tacos Nayarit!  This food truck is wonderful.  I consider myself a foodie who is not scared to try anything and I love a good, authentic place to get some Mexican food.  This fits the bill.  Walking up can be a bit intimidating since there is a lot of Spanish on the menu but the nice ladies inside speak English and can certainly take care of you.  

What I like about this truck is the variety!  When you go to the \"other\" sit down Mexican places you get chicken or beef for your protein.  That's it, you know what I'm talking about \"I'll have the #3 chicken and refried beans is what you can hear most people ordering.  Not at Nayarit!  They have everything \"Asada, Carnitas, Chorizo, Pollo, etc...\" They also have other more adventurous fillings like Lengua.  

I've had the burrito with asada & chorizo and they are excellent.  The meats are cooked and spiced well along with the other fillings and rolled perfectly.  These ladies know what they're doing.  I've also had the different tacos which have wonderfully fresh cilantro and onions to make them the best in the area.  They provide little cups of salsa verde and another \"red sauce\" which is quite possibly the hottest stuff south of Ballantyne so be careful.  They give you a lime wedge and some sort of hot pepper along with a smidge of grilled onions.

If you have a hankering for something authentic and tasty I suggest pulling into the gas station or the sketchy cigar bar parking lot when the windows up and giving this place a try.  Please try to be orderly with your parking so you don't have a fender bender!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after reading all the great reviews and I wasn't disappointed.   Authentic street tacos!   Steak was full of flavor and chorizo was equally good by itself and also with the steak.  Very simple tacos garnished with onion and cilantro.  There were 3 sauces with plenty of kick.  Service was very friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"Yaaaaaassssss queeen yaaaaaassssss!
Ok I never say that, lol. But when I eat the tacos here that's all I can say (to myself in my head, obvi.) born and raised in SoCal, more specifically in the San Gabriel valley where it's predominately Hispanic, I know Tacos. These tacos taste authentic, the workers are so sweet. They're from Nayarit, Mexico so they know tacos too. Moving to Charlotte has been a struggle finding legit Mexican food, but I'm so glad I found my spot! Gracias, tacos Nayarit. Buen trabajo."}
{"text":"Holy heck! We have wanted to stop here for so long and we finally did. So worth it. We got a taco and burrito with beef and chorizo. So spicy and delicious, with fresh cucumber, and radish on the side with jalapenos and a lime wedge. It was so good I basically just shoveled it in. There was avocado in there, which surprised me, and just the right amount of lettuce and rice. I'm already dreaming of when we will come back. They have a covered area with picnic tables in case you want to stay and eat. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Most food trucks can be a bit of a bear because you have to find them, and to find them you have to figure out how to find them. Is the schedule posted on Facebook? Instagram? Twitter? Elsewhere? When you do, and find out it was posted last week or at the beginning of the month, you have to wonder if it was up to date then, or if it's up to date now, or if the truck is even in business any longer.

Not the case with Nayarit. They are in business all day every day. They have tables. And a tent. They are parked next to a gas station (in case you need to fill up the car too). So there is no problem finding them or finding a place to sit. This isn't to say it's all going to be easy, however, because they do not speak great English. That's not all on them - there are certainly times we should speak other languages, and this is probably one of them.

Also, their menus are not great. Most of them items on the board are written in chalk and have a tendency to be blurred at best. So you may have to guess what you are ordering (tacos are probably a good bet, but they also have plenty of other things).

Once you order the food, you can also get drinks from the cooler immediately below and they will also offer sauce if you're interested - you might have to ask for this. On a hot day, you might want a couple of drinks, because it can take a while.

As to the food, be prepared because you don't get a number and they don't ask your name. They somewhat yell out what you ordered, but it's in a bit of a hispanic drawl, so you'll need to be listening. It's made worse by the traffic sound and the fact that the window is really small. You might also want to watch the people around you since orders typically seem to come out in the same order they went in. I say typically, because sometimes people come from vehicles on the other side of the truck to pick up an order and you had no idea they were even waiting. I don't know how this works. It's like call-ahead seating at those steakhouses, but you apparently have to be in the know here.

Eventually you will likely get your food, and the tacos are reasonable. They do seem to take a bit longer then expected since you're just getting a taco at a food truck. I'm all for freshly prepared food and all, but it just seems like it takes too long, but that could be me. If you were sitting in a restaurant it would probably be fine."}
{"text":"Most importantly order at least 3 tacos. I honestly couldn't have eaten 4 but only ordered two. The asada was better than the pollo which might have been better with one of the many sauce choices. I just grabbed my plate and ran. Next time I'll sit at a picnic table. Also want to try a torta and a quesadilla. Cash only. Feel free to try the beef tongue or beef head and let me know how those are."}
{"text":"Found this truck on my way home. It's hidden away right behind a gas station. I got the barbacoa, asada, and pork tacos. The barbacoa tacos were the best however not the best. I think I'd try them one more time during their peak time, which I'm sure is lunch. Honestly wasn't seasoned and wonder if it had to do with time of day or freshness."}
{"text":"Oh my word, what an awesome taco truck. I had the pollo taco and a sope with alpastor. So delicious and great value. My lunch cost me $4.50. Great service and the truck is super clean. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"God himself made these burritos. If you haven't ever been here, you're seriously missing out. I would eat a burrito from here every day for the rest of my life. If you love yourself, come here and get some of the best Mexican food around. Cash only. $6 for a burrito. $2.50 tacos. Seriously so good."}
{"text":"Don't let this location fool you!!! Stopped here randomly & so glad I did!!! Tacos were on point & cant wait to go back to try other options...burritos, quesadilla, tortas. Also, if you like extra spicy ask for the spicy roja on the side. Amazing!!! Also, they are cash only."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic!  It's hard to find \"real\" Mexican food in the south, but this little stand delivers.  I tried three tacos--beef, barbacoa, and spicy pork.  All three were great!!  plan on returning soon to try more menu items."}
{"text":"It's really good. Probably some of the best tacos. Several options, quick preparation, great taste."}
{"text":"I came to see what the 5 star hype for this food truck was about and luckily wasn't disappointed. I asked the lady which was the most popular taco and she said asada, but hubby suggested I try one of each, so I had 3 - pollo/chicken, carnitas/pork, and asada/steak which were all DELICIOUS. I actually liked the carnitas the best, so I had a 2nd one of that. I sprinkled the lime on each of them which made them even better. They all came with cilantro and onion and a side of radish/cucumber slices. They also have green and red sauces. I liked the green better while hubby liked the red. He described it as spicy, but not too spicy. He had an asada quesadilla which he enjoyed as well. It came with a tiny salad and he also asked for sour cream. This is definitely authentic Mexican food, which I had a feeling it would be when I found out it was a food truck. They had more adventurous offerings which neither hubby nor I were comfortable trying haha, but I'm sure if I was open to it that it'd be good as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tacos were lit son, bless up! Eat here every Friday, cash me outside. Speaking of, it's cash only."}
{"text":"Wow very delicious tacos OMG better the many Mexican restaurant around here . Also very busy lots people here today around 12:00 . May be next time I will be visiting this place later. Me and friend love it . We got chicken tacos"}
