{"text":"Very homey and comfortable decor, the food is very good, although I don't understand some of the short cuts, such as not pin boning the cod, reasonably priced.  Here's the catch, the owner.  It is almost comical just how unaccommodating he can be.  Twice I've been refused at the door, once, no take out (yet they'll pack a doggie bag for you, in other words, they have take out containers), no staying just for dessert and an absolute policy in no deviating from the menu.  My request being a starter for a main course, with a side of rice and a side of veg, both those sides being on the menu.  I'm completely serious.  Furthermore, my table was the only one in the dinning room.  
I go about once a year because it's so close to my place and there isn't another licensed establishment in the immediate area.  Every year they do not have a wine list printed up because they are in the process of updating it.  Coincidence?"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! Best authentic Portuguese food in the city! 

Unlike the other reviewer, I have found the owner nothing but accommodating. I am not Portugese nor do I speak the language but he was great to us and spoke English well. From the relaxed atmosphere to truly great authentic Portugese cuisine to that old-school Eurpoean flavour, this place is one of those hidden gems in the city. They have a great rating from many more reviews on Google and the people I know go there all the time always rave about the place."}
{"text":"great authentic portuguese food including awesome deserts, very quiet atmosphere for lunch, great for conversing and meetings"}
{"text":"I feel lucky I have been to many restaurants in my life, and this was by far the worst service I ever got; don't go to this place, especially if you have kids, terrible service"}
{"text":"Gotta echo the previous review, the little guy who runs the place is the best. The food is as good as Martins a few blocks away, but the ambience is nicer, quieter, calmer, and not as busy. I think the prices are also slightly less. All in all I'm glad I discovered this place a few years ago and have been back a few times since."}
{"text":"First of all, I became a fan of the awesomely skilled man who attends all the tables (at least 20). He seemed to be the manager/owner&host of all the place. I admire his energy, good vibe, and kind attention. He treated us like if we were invited to a celebration at his home. He must be one of the most professional people I have had the honor of being attended by in this TO city. 

I felted even more lucky when I saw that the grill was managed by a woman that could easily be the wife or relative of that amazing character I described. 

Have you seen bees on action? Just perfection and inspiration. I want to be like them, seriously!

The wine came after a chat of the flavors we wanted.

The seafood was not only aphrodisiac, perfectly cooked, fresh, or respectfully balanced; it was crunchy in the shells, and easy to peel out... so they must have a good provider, which seems to be difficult to find in the middle of this City.

The attendance: 90-95% Portuguese, so don't feel weird or attacked if all the eyes turn to you when you get in (they like to pass the scanner repeatedly on ppl, more if  they feel you different, but don't take it personal), just hang your coat if winter, breath, and don't imagine they look at you cuz you are famous.

They have some vinhos verdes, but get more adventurous than the classical Aveleda... 

Don't hesitate. In between 2 of the classics: cod or meat with the fried egg, I hope you'll enjoy more the cod with those chubby chips I wrote about (I still can't forget them, and Ms Vickie's passed to 2nd place). Those chips are chasing me in dreams, so as the whole half of lobster I enjoyed like if it was going to be the last one I'd ever try (at least in this month or with this gentlemen); It had the brains, coral, and all the things a lot of places remove because some Canadian ppl don't like.

Authentic Portuguese or Spanish places just ask you if you would like your lobster to be cleaned (but watch it, the smell, taste, and knowledge about seafood will tell you that things like the heads of fish, lobsters, shrimps, etc., indicates you if it is about to spoil, spoiled, or just frozen (why you think frozen molluscan in bags at supermarkets have no head?)..\" If they have the head take it (specially on ppl).

I broke a bottle of empty wine, and the magic character came to clean everything and made me feel relieved of any guilt. I just wanted to make a hole and bury my head there... But for him seemed not to be a big deal, so I just behaved fat, chubby, and waved while smiling saying goodbye (I put extra 10 tip tho). Thanks."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the owner is really rude and not  accommodating. It ruins the dinning experience, and the owner refuses takeout."}
{"text":"My Portuguese friend took me here for dinner.

WOW. Really awesome and really authentic. I didn't understand  word of what was going on (all the ordering was being done in Potuguese, but they do speak English)

We shared a mixed seafood plate which was absolutely to die for! Giant shrimps, lots of lobster and mussels. The food was incredible. Bread, olives and cheese were served before the food arrived.

Service was fantastic, they were over constantly refilling water, topping up the wine and making sure we were enjoying our meal. 

The other clientele seemed to be all Portuguese. I'm assuming they come for a reason.

It wasn't cheap, but I didn't pay, and I really enjoyed it :)"}
{"text":"i've been to a few portuguese restos considering i am portuguese. This is one of the best so far, i mean we have only been here once but i loved everything i ate. I am looking forward to coming back. I got the garlic shrimp app, ad it was yummy just like moms. My BF got the caldo verde, and it was very good; not smothered in a bag of potatoes; like other restos i've been too. Then we got bife a banaboia, very delicious house made sauce, the chips were great and plenty of everything. The prices are reasonable for the plates of food that you get. They also playd classic portuguese music in the background, and the decor inside was very classy. I can't wait to come back and try their seafood plates. everyone in thre spoke portuguese and looked like they came straight from there, i love that."}
