{"text":"Highly recommend . . . what a pleasant experience !  We ordered the Friday night special (Mughlai Chicken) and loved it !  We also enjoyed the innovative d√©cor from the unique lighting to the inspiring 'blue wall'.  The service provided was top notch and made us to feel like we were part of the family.  We can't wait to return to try more of their delectable dishes . . :)"}
{"text":"Check this place out. It's new and amazing. The flavours are the best and service is awesome. Prices are good too!! They have daily specials. Portions size is bigger than usual. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! The owners are wonderful and this place is definitely a place worth supporting! If you want authentic fresh food definitely come here! The design of this place is so unique and so wonderfully done! The owners and designers definitely nailed it with creating the right ambience. Great job!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The bhel puri was perfect. The chicken tikka masala was excellent. Raita had some tasty cultures in it. The malai kofta had the best sauce. Not a huge fan of the malai balls though. That sauce would be good with anything however. Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Evanston... Super authentic and just delicious. Comparable to UKs Indian cuisine! Definitely the best I've tried in Calgary."}
{"text":"I didn't think there was good Indian food in Calgary but this restaurant has really far exceeded my expectations. The tiki masala and butter chicken was really good. The food is almost as good as England's Indian food and that says a lot."}
{"text":"So so good. Love the lamb curry and butter chicken. Generous portions. Good spice level. Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Really not sure how this place had a 5-star score; either folks have low expectations for Indian in this part of town or we ordered on a bad night.  We ordered the three usual dishes we get at any Indian Restaurant: Palak Paneer - The actual paneer was good but the sauce was just not good. Butter Chicken - The sauce for this dish was actually excellent but the chicken terribly dry. Lamb Korma - Relatively dry meat yet again; Korma sauce was ok  Saffron rice was exceedingly floral (might just be personal preference) and the Garlic Naan lacked any real garlic flavor.  I would suggest Tamarind if your in the Evanston area or Moti Mahal if your closer to the downtown core."}
{"text":"I am not sure how this place getting five stars. My experience at this place was horrible, from service to food to timing. Lets start with positives: Got seated right away as there were no one else but us at the time we went. Our order was taken right away. I liked their unique simple decor and cleanliness of the place. We wanted to try their butter chicken as we heard good things about it. We ordered one laccha paratha, one naan, butter chicken and chaat papri (appetizer).   So now the waiting part began...   Our glasses are empty, couldn't get any attention from the server was busy , i am not sure with what, she was just not in our sight. Because at that time only one other table had customer. we waited for good 30 minutes before we got out appetizer, chaat papri. Which was not bad, good portion for two people.  We got our water after asking for it. Thank god. Now more waiting time began for our main dish which was just simple naan, paratha and butter chicken. it took 40 minutes to come to our table. no apology from the server, no acknowledgement. I was just wowed at their service. so I just thought maybe food will recover for the time we have waited.  Chicken from butter chicken was dry and no taste, with so much color. Laccha paratha was soaked in oil and burnt at the back ( you can see in my picture ) . I am still confused how can these two dishes take more than 40 minutes to come to table and still not edible. The server came twice at our table, once to take order and give water and give us the bill in all those time.  I am sorry I dont think I can recommend this place from my experience, maybe we had the unlucky day at the restaurant but then that can not be an excuse!!"}
{"text":"Great for groups and individuals. They are very accommodating and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this gem quite by accident on our way to the airport. Now, this will be on our list every time we're in Calgary. Every dish was uniquely flavored and served piping hot. Hostess/server were friendly and very accommodating. Highly recommended - butter paneer, chicken curry, egg plant bharta and veggie trio.   Special nod to the artwork and the very clean restrooms!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this placed, based on Yelp reviews available at the time. Well, I guess that brought in too much business for them, as when I tried to use my Groupon they refused to honor it. As a matter of fact, they stopped accepting them a week before they expired. I can't imagine they will be successful with this business model. Would obviously give them no stars."}
{"text":"Very happy with the take out. Tried butter chicken, saffron rice and tandoori roti. Everything was delicious and was prepare very quickly! Friendly chef. I will be eating here again."}
{"text":"The food here was very good, a little pricey, but not unreasonable.  I would have given them 5 stars but the service was poor ... the Waitress (middle aged lady) acted as if she had better places to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate in. The food is your typical mall Indian type buffet food. Nothing stood out, no fresh flavours. We felt the staff were trying to push us to order their alcoholic drinks and they lacked a true warmth. There are much better Indian restaurants in the vicinity and I urge you to try them. The only plus would be the location if you live in Evanston. It's really too bad they don't live up to the expectations based on the reviews on Yelp."}
