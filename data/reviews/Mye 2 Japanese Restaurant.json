{"text":"Have eaten here several times, the dishes are as fresh as the downtown location. The menu and customer service are slightly different when compared to the downtown location."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch in January and was quite impressed. I'd call this the more casual sister of Mye downtown Oakville. 

I had the chicken teriyaki lunch. What a far cry from the typical sushi joint teriyaki bento box. This was a real chicken breast, skin on, that had been cooked to perfection and marinated/glazed with teriyaki sauce. It was so moist, I devoured it with a side of rice. I did miss the cabbage that you often get in combination. 

Also shared a spicy tuna roll with my husband and it was excellent however next time I'd go with nigiri. They seem to have high quality fish here so a nice piece of fish would probably be heavenly.

Quality green tea as my beverage made for a very enjoyable lunch!"}
{"text":"Mye 2 had a total disregard for food allergies.

I have eaten at Mye 2 three times. My first 2 experiences were positive. My third experience was completely disappointing.

I made a takeout order, and ordered a sashimi dinner and a sushi dinner. I notified the server taking my order of a shellfish allergy. She even called back a few minutes later to verify the allergy.

When I arrived there was shrimp in my order. It was sent back, and they swapped out the shrimp for salmon. I ended up with an assorted sushi order that was 50% salmon. It also left me concerned that the rest of the order had been contaminated. And they charged $2 fee for the substitution.

To add insult to injury, the meal was a disappointment. The maguro was poorly cut. The fish was ragged and had a mealy texture. It was unpalatable. The rest of the order was mediocre at best. It definitely did not live up to Mye's reputation or quality.

I don't know if I will give Mye 2 another chance. The experience was that bad."}
{"text":"Mye 2 has always been my go-to for great sushi. I am hoping my recent experience is a one off and not a trend. Went on a Tuesday night at 6pm, only a couple of tables occupied when we arrived. We ordered 16 pieces of sushi which took an hour to be served. We sent back the spicy scallop as it tasted awful, clearly not fresh. 
The booth seating needs a makeover, the vinyl seats are worn and torn and very uncomfortable. 
Hopefully they are able to remedy their problems!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good service. Food is excellent for the most part. Sushi and sashimi are super fresh. Food from the kitchen were light and delicious. However the maki rolls were average at best. Definitely would go back again, just not for the maki."}
{"text":"Service: Excellent

Food: Avarge, nothing interesting about since they only serve one kind of ramen. The portion of our order is small i would say, we ordered a eel dish and it came with 65% of salad dressing and 35% of eel which was even smaller than my palm size, and the it was $15 for that little thing. 

Ambiance: the light was dim, with candlelit on dining table. It could be a good place to bring your date if the food serving is good."}
{"text":"Great food - more casual than the downtown location, and a simpler menu. Ideal for lunch or a casual dinner"}
{"text":"I love Mye from Downtown Oakville, the food is great and services is also superb. But Mye 2 ? I don't think so. I went there in two occasions and both times I realized the services was very very slow. The second time I actually walked out of the restaurant because the servers failed to acknowledge us for 10 minutes. Don't get me wrong, I know they are trying to be attentive to the guests who have already been sat. But by no means they should ignore the ones standing by the door. 4 different people have acknowledged us walked into the restaurants and they actually looked at us but instead of greeting us and sitting us down, they just went straight to the tables that have guests sitting there. There was another couple sitting by the bar area and even they felt terrible for us the way the server ignored us. My brother actually thinks they are racist because of the solely caucasian guests that were being sat. So I'm sorry but by no means I will return to this restaurant in the near future."}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer of original Mye location on Church st. Came to Mye 2 to try ramen. It is delicious! Savoury rich broth, ramen noodle with just the right texture, and finally melt in your mouth pork belly. It is perfection and I don't have to travel all the way to downtown Toronto for ramen anymore. The rest of the items are made with the same standards as the original location, fresh uni, sashimi, and rolls. It is definitely a success and I hope it will continue the success of the original location."}
{"text":"Food is great as expected from Mye. While the servers are lovely and polite, service was way too slow. It took 45min for our appetizers to arrive and the whole meal took two hours."}
{"text":"Food taste pretty good but it is quite expensive.  Had to spend a lot of money to get full.  Rockefeller oysters were tasty.  Meal came with either salad or miso soup...not both.  I found this to be kinda cheap and stupid.  Every other restaurant comes with both.  How expensive is a vat of miso soup anyways??"}
{"text":"My Wife and I ate dinner at Mye 2 on a busy Saturday.  Compared to the original Mye in downtown Oakville this location is the better of the two IMHO.

The dinner started with a complimentary marinated bean sprout salad with an odd combination of cubed chicken (left overs?) and not too fresh bean sprouts.

We then had the purchased salad (tasty) followed by three rolls all of which were fresh but not overly inspiring.  Also not sure of the Salmon Skin roll as it tasted like it was burnt with a propane torch or something (kind of bitter).

The highlight of the evening was the Moshi Ice Cream balls for desert, but they looked like they came out of a box.

We wanted to give it a try as we liked the old restaurant \"Tako Japanese\" that was the prev business in the same location, but won't be back.  Will continue to go to Dai Ichi Sushi at Winston and Dundas."}
{"text":"Seven of us sat there for half an hour and waited for service.  Nobody came to our table.  It was kind of busy with two waitresses. We signalled at them but they ignored. We were fed up and walked out."}
{"text":"Very high quality food!! Every time we come we really enjoy the plates we try.chicken teriyaki is excellent!! Highly recomended for a quiet good meal."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day. What a huge disappointment. Luckily didn't bring mom along. The service was really really slow. We told them 3 times that we were ready to order before it was taken. They were seriously under-staffed and other guests were left waiting in the front. Food also took a very long time to come. When the food came it was disappointing again. First, the sushi only came with soup or salad, not both. The sushi and sashimi pieces were also tiny and expensive, cheapest set being $17.50. Finally, checking out also takes along time and I needed to get another lunch after. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"MO's drunken chicken is the gold standard in chicken karaage!!   Best ramen in Oakville."}
{"text":"All you can eat quality at a premium price. Come try it out if you feel like getting ripped off and waiting an hour for your food"}
{"text":"It's nice to finally have another place to dine on Japanese food in upper Oakville.   The space is much bigger inside than it appears from the street view.  Decor is clean and simple yet elegant.

Menu is quite extensive with a large variety of appetizers, hot entrees, and sushi and sashimi to please the most finicky diner.

We ordered edamame, sushi dinner, spicy tuna roll, and the pork belly ramen noodle dish.  Ramen noodles were al dente and the pork belly was a good sized fatty and tender piece of meat although the broth was a bit too mild in flavour.

Spicy tuna roll was really fresh and delicious.  The sushi rice was cooked perfectly and the roll was ... Well... Perfect!  Sushi dinner was good and the quality of the fish was excellent which also justifies the prices.

Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Good ambiance, great service and fresh sushi. My new favorite in the area."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night on the way back to Toronto. Considering it was a Friday night, Mye 2 was not that crowded. In a busy shopping plaza, I was able to park my car as the lot on site is quite big. Back to the restaurant. I like the decor here - it's minimalistic and super cozy. Service was okay - they all seem to be high schoolers. As for the food, it was okay as well. The menu consists of Classic Japanese home style dishes. Anyway, I'm never in Oakville so I do t know when I'll be back. If you are though and you're looking for a Japanese restaurant that's actually run by Japanese, Mye is it. There's another location by the same name in another part of Oakville.

Good for: Japanese food, lunch, dinner"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice and clean. However it is a bit overpriced with small portion size.  I was told this is restaurants is running by Japanese. ( authentic) But I feel everything tastes just mediocre. Not bad but not great ."}
{"text":"I went here on a Monday lunch with my cousin. Given it's  a Monday, the place was not that busy. The place is very formal and clean. We were seated right away at a booth. This place is also the second location of the more established Mye 2 on Church which I haven't tried yet.

Granted that I wanted to try this place because of their ramen so that's what I ordered. Also, given that it's the closest ramen place near my parent's house, I needed to know of I'll have a closer alternative of getting my ramen fix than venturing to Toronto. On top of ramen, my cousin got a katsudon. We also ordered tempura and dynamite roll for the table. The ramen was very light and I found that there's nothing special. My egg was not soft boiled and I don't like that. I want my gooey soft boiled eggs. The katsudon was better when I tried it. The tempura was good. The dynamite was okay. Definitely not enough to get my ramen fix that's close :( if I come here, I'll order the dons instead. They have 6."}
{"text":"Ate there a few weeks ago. The food was really fresh. A bit more expensive than other Japanese restaurant nearby ... but for freshness and great tasting foods ... it is worth it."}
{"text":"I feel that price we are paying for 2 people is expensive. We ordered 2 entree and a roll.  I was asked to choose either soup or salad.  Every other Japanese restaurant I been to always come with both. I was surprised that wasn't the case. 

The fish is ok, but not too many selection. If you go to downtown Toronto and you can go to TaKe sushi which I feel it's much better value with the same price range. 

At the end, there is no dessert such as Green tea ice cream. I was surprised again. 

Overall, I would not go back. 

The waitress service is professional."}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh food with amazing presentation. Service was also excellent.  Came here for lunch on Mother's day and was seated within 5 minutes. I ordered an appetizer carpaccio and ramen. Everything was delicious, I will come back"}
{"text":"Good Japanese food.very limited non sushi menu. Need to add more non sushi. Alcohol  beverages are very expensive . Service is very good and timely. Food quality is high."}
{"text":"What's an authentic quality Japanese restaurant doing in a place like this?
On the corner of Dundas up the road from the farms across from where they are building the same old same old cookie cutter houses and next to a Longos, a Starbucks and a chain pub that calls itself a \"neighbourhood pub\" sits an authentic Japanese and sushi restaurant that is the #2 of the chain of 2 and even open on a Monday... in Oakville. Yes, Japanese chef, Japanese owner and Japanese waitresses.
The quality is good too. No, it is not the best of GTA, but it is very good.
We had the sushi deluxe with rolls and sushi and everything was good except the fake wasabi.
We also had the Myegozen which is a mixed assortment of sushi, sashimi, tempura and meat. They stayed true to the Japanese recipes and did not go all Canadianized on us.
for fans of all you can eat nonsense this restaurant is too expensive. For fans of actual Japanese food Mye 2 is a very clean and special centre for goodness.
Very clean restaurant, clean washrooms, good food, authentic Japanese flavours and recipe and lots of parking. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Every bit as good as the downtown Oakville location and nowhere near as busy. Mye 2 deserves better than to have only a few few tables filled on a Saturday night.
We'll be back."}
{"text":"I got the tuna roll and full size ramen. The tuna roll was good, but nothing special, and likewise with the ramen. However, it's probably the best ramen you'll be able to get within 40 km of here; and as a result, is a solid option for Asian food dining in Oakville."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to come here very regularly. The food is definitely above average (especially for Oakville Japanese) though not great, and the staff is pleasant. The service is TERRIBLE though. Absolutely terrible. After 3 meals of having to wait like 30 minutes to get the cheque, or an hour for food when the place isn't even packed. Won't return sadly, I wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"Came mainly for the ramen, so this may or may not be indicative of the other menu items. Ordered \"Mo's Famous\" with extra pork which was $14.50; the regular ramen with a single pork slice was $12.50. Overall, I would not recommend the ramen here, or if you were strapped for time.

Ramen quality: -1
For $14.50 ($16.39 after tax), I would expect higher quality ingredients. I'm not disappointed in the choices of ingredients use, because what they depict on the website is indeed what you get: broth, 3 pork belly slices, ramen noodles, a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoot, a piece of baby bokchoy, garlic. Rather, the noodles itself felt very similar to instant noodle quality. Pork, for that price, was slightly smaller than the palm of my hand.

Price: -1
Again, $14.50 with meat portions you expect to match the added price. Compared to other, similarly priced ramen offerings like Momofuku ($14+, which even boasts locally sourced meats), Kinton($11+, much larger portioning), or Kenzo($11+, 24hr stewed broth) you'd probably consider Mye2 because you won't find a lot of options in the surrounding area.


Wait time: -1
I came a little before 2:15pm on a weekday because I saw the lunch menu was until 2:30, but apparently that's when they close as well, so I ordered as soon as I sat. I was the last person to be served, and customers had already finished eating, but it still took 15min for me to get my ramen. Now, I don't know if it's because it was close to closing and no one else was ordering food, but I would not expect it to take that long (seriously, last call at 2:30 -- at the SAME time you close? If the reason it was slow was because you're packing it in early, make last call sooner than that). Also, maybe this score could have been salvaged with the side of salad that supposedly comes with the ramen, which I never got!"}
{"text":"I love coming here whenever I'm home - I always get the vegetable soba noodles and their daily special (spicy BC tuna roll last time I was there) and both were delicious. They were generous with the soba (also comes with a salad) and the spicy tuna roll was so fresh. All for around ~13-14 which is a good price. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here! It's hard to come across a good sushi restaurant in Oakville, but the fish here was fresh and tasted great. A little on the pricier side, but the service and the decor was very nice! I would definitely recommend this place for a nice date night dinner!"}
