{"text":"OMG I don't know what happened here. THE worst Italian food I have ever had, east side marios would have been better, spaghetti o's or canned pasta would have been better. Everything except the pizza that was at least edible had to be tossed within 5 minutes because the smell was making us feel sick.  Ordered from uber eats as we have been trying to find just a decent Italian basic place to order from.   have to say it came hot and fast. The pizza was akin to those dollar slices in new York not good but you can dose with hot sauce and consume.  The rest of the food, bruschetta, pasta, chicken parm were inexcusable and inedible. My boyfriend who regularly eats at panda express and Costco haha said he was sorry that he just could not eat his chicken because it simply tasted awful. I couldn't argue with him my pasta tasted rotten,  every element worse than the next almost like they tried to make the worlds worst pasta. I don't understand how these cooks don't taste their food. No one with taste buds could have thought what we got was in any way sellable or even edible. I also just don't understand how a pasta can even possibly taste so bad like it scares me to think what they could have done to it. My 12 year old cousin could make a decent pasta.  For your own good stay far away not worth the paper the receipt was printed on."}
{"text":"Finally! A neighbourhood restaurant with good, reasonably priced Italian food. 

The good: yummy food, reasonable prices, attentive and helpful staff (willing to make modifications), parking a block away (green P), kid friendly (high chairs).

The so so: I may be asking too much, but I wish home made gnocchi was on the menu."}
{"text":"I come here for the lunch specials regularly. At $10-12 for pasta, sandwiches or meals that come with soups or salads it's very reasonably priced. The decor is lovely and it has a more casual feel to it than other italian places in this neck of the woods. The tiramisu is to DIE FOR! I wish the bread served in the restaurant was warmer, and came with butter that wasn't rock hard. Fresh baked bread with butters, oils and vinegars is just such a staple."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ordered food from here through Ubereats. We ordered veal Parmesan, gnocchi, and cannelloni with veal and cheese. I am an Italian food LOVER and I was so impressed with the quality, taste and portion sizes. I will re order again and again from this restaurant! :) Amazing! My husband says you must try the cannelloni"}
{"text":"Good choice if you feel like a local restaurant serving standard Italian fare. The portions are generous with a tasty side of pasta. Attentive wait staff; pleasant atmosphere and nearby parking. Good choice!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been frequenting Terre e Mare since it opened.  It feels like I'm at home but I don't have to cook.  Miguel and his staff are not only attentive; they will bend over backwards to cook your order with any changes you may request. As a matter of fact, I find the service better here than at their sister restaurant, Parmigiana.  Due to the ongoing construction, the restaurant is not as busy as it should be. I hope they can hang on and remain for a long time."}
{"text":"Finally tried this restaurant and would never go back. The order consisted of minestrone soup, Pasta Bolognese, Pasta Primavera, salad, Eggplant Parmigiano:

- The Pasta Bolognese was served in a wide bowl. Lucky it came that way since the amount of sauce made it more of a soup. Also it should have been served with tagliatelle not spaghetti even though it said spaghetti on the menu.
- The Pasta Primavera was nothing to write home about and was quite dry and tasteless.
- The salad had beets, feta cheese and Arugula.
- The Eggplant Parmigiano was a mess. The eggplant was just mushy with a side of tasteless Penne.

Luckily for my comments I could put a blanket statement for all the dishes. Bland, tasteless just terrible. It might have been the worst Italian restaurant that I have ever been to. Mall food would be a relief.

I ate the Eggplant since I was very hungry. The side of Penne was way over cooked with a tasteless tomato sauce. I left the Pasta and told the waiter about the over cooked pasta and he never offered me a new dish of pasta. In-defense of the waiter I would have refused.

He offered us a free piece of Tiramisu which we refused and an espresso but he brought it anyways. The cake wasn't that great and was very wet which I do not like. The flavour was acceptable at most.

When the bill came he charged for everything except the Tiramisu. I think in fairness he would of offered a small discount since he did agree about the food not having any flavour and the overdone pasta."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, the waiter was very attentive. I have the goat cheese salad which was well dressed and the rack of lamb. Both were excellent. The atmosphere is lovely too. I was shocked at how empty the place was. I would return."}
