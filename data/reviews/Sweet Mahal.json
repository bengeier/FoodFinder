{"text":"To start with, their prices are very reasonable. if you are like and like to try different cuisines i will suggest you to try your typical punjabi food here - saag and makki di roti. They have the best saag here. We went there again thinking other food here will be great too. Well not really it was just alright. 

I will definitely go back there for saag and makki roti!!"}
{"text":"Last week my soul was yearning for curry so I thought I'd take a chance on this place in Rexdale and I called for take out. Chicken Tikka Masala, Vegetable  Biryani, Chana Masala and some plain Naan. Got there 20 minutes later and my order was packed and ready to go. Around  25 bucks out the door for a dinner for two. 
This place will not let you down, everything was delicious and the portions were quite generous, the Chicken TM was about as good as it gets. Will definitely hit this place up again when I'm in the mood for take out, they have an extensive menu with plenty of selections."}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic! Portions are great. Staff is friendly. My friend has food allergies and they made sure that she could eat certain dishes and they remember us when we come in. The portions are great. Suggestions are always made. The place is clean with Bollywood music videos being played. Always had great food here and am a returning customer! And yes, their Indian sweets are great!"}
{"text":"Good food with decent prices.  Naans are great...  Butter chicken was delicious.  I'm a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Value for Money Meals. Food quality is pretty decent. Their Thalis are quite filling and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The ambience and decor is not very good but the prices are more than reasonable and the food & service is great. 
Cafeteria style, self serve offers Veg Thali for $6,99. We also liked the Sarson Ka Saag with Makki Ki Roti served with sweet/salted lassi. The Sheekh Kabab was very good too. 
This was my first time here and I would definitely come back for the good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Best butter chicken in town!!! Naan's are really good as well. 
Papri chat is really tasty. And everything is reasonable. Been visiting Sweet mahal since 2 years. The consistency is always the same. Quality and quantity for the price is amazing.

Ambience is okay.
Must visit Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent. I love going here!! 

It's a nice quiet place to eat at a reasonable cost.

I love their daal and palak panner. It goes excellent with their garlic naan.

I like that all their chicken dishes use all boneless, white meat. 

Their sweets are also very delicious and they serve one of the best mango shakes I've had.

The servers are very friendly and welcoming. 

I could eat here everyday if I had the chance. :)"}
{"text":"Every so often, we like to check out a different casual mom 'n pop Indian cafe in search of our favorite comfort food... channa bhatura! So, last Sunday, we were in the area and checked out Sweet Mahal, located in a strip mall in Rexdale.

For those of you who don't know what channa bhatura is... channa is your typical \"channa masala\" dish made of chick peas in a spicy, tangy gravy and bhatura is a fried bread made from white flour. The dish is served with onions and carrot pickles... 

First , the prices were very reasonable (4$ for a bowl of channa and 2 bhatura). Remember you are not paying for ambiance or downtown rent! 

Second, the food was good. The bhatura was very nice, light and fluffy. The channa was missing some of the usual tanginess but we covered that up by eating all of the pickles and onions! Overall, good but our quest for the best continues.  

We also ordered sarson ka saag (mustard greens) and makki ki roti to take home with us and we enjoyed them and our leftover channa bhatura the next day. The channa tasted better the day after, the spices having settled in. The sarson ka saag was very flavourful, quite (spicy) hot and very salty, so I couldn't eat it on its own. The roti was made from corn which I had never tried before. The roti went well with the sarson ka saag but personally I wasn't a fan of its thick texture. I like my Indian breads on the lighter side. 

Overall, we will eat here again if we're in the neighborhood! We will try some of the large selection of sweets they had on display and the samosas that others have raved about in their reviews."}
{"text":"Rude and dirty. Feels like you are ignored if you are not Indian. The food is good but the rudeness is so ingrained in this place it is hard to ignore. Don't expect any hospitality here."}
{"text":"Food is yummy but staff is a bit rude. We just tried Veg thali which included almost everything. I really liked mix veg, bharta and gajar halwa."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice and have always opted for the veggie platter option where you can order by the hot table.  Very flavourful variety to choose from, naan is so fresh and delicious and nice to have a small dessert to top things off.  Discovered it by chance after having seen it in the plaza for so long...now our go-to for Indian food cravings!"}
{"text":"This place serves good food but the way it is served is so bad that I cannot dream of visiting it again. For 8$ this place serves crappy portions... I would rather chip in couple more dollars and visit some other Indian places which serves better food for cheaper prices . The staff make faces to give extra salad too as told by the owner I suppose .... Bad experience ... Other good items such as Chana and Chinese combo is bearable"}
{"text":"I never make it to this part of town but when I got here  I knew that I can find authentic Indian food in the area so I pulled yelp out and found this restaurant.
Initially i thought this was a sweet dessert only restaurant but then saw lots of locals enjoying their food.
The food is authentic, the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is casual in a lovely Indian fast food way."}
{"text":"Because of the food I am giving 4 stars. Everything was extremely tasty. Fresh. Full of flavour. Very tender. Lots of options. The salty lassi, mango lassi and mango shakes were perfect. And the restaurant itself is clean, modern and very nice decor. 

The price is average. Portions small. The service is not good. Kind of rude, not pleasant."}
{"text":"Ordered a vegetable thali, the flavours were very well balanced. Not loaded with salt and oil like a lot of Indian restaurants. It was very reasonably priced with portions big enough to fill a hungry hippo like me. Casual atmosphere. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sweet mahal is located in a corner plaza of rexdaleblvd(derry rd) and humberwood blvd facing east. The plaza has lots of car parking and bike parking. Anyways lets come to the point hehe yes food. We have ordered chole bhature (chick peas cooked with spices turned into gravy or curry along fried bread known as bhatura) and Aaloo parantha(stuffed with lots of spices and mashed potatoes basically served in breakfasts in INDIA).
Side order was Mango shake and Chai(tea- boiled with homemade masala and milk) best thing you can ever drink if you go to indian restaurants. 
I know the service was bit slow but the food was amazing. I prefer to wait for good food. Moreover, you can also order sweets if you want to take out. I would certainly recommend you for a visit. 

Pros: good fresh food with lots of choices.
Cons: their service is bit slow but yes you will not regret."}
{"text":"So overpriced for the amount and quality of food that is served. I purchased a portion of lamb vindaloo, which was a pretty average to small sized portion and cost approx $15. It was excessively salty and had very little meat floating in oily curry sauce. No naan or rice was given with the curry. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about the butter chicken ... I honestly didn't like it. Was way to sweet and I asked them to make it spicy. I ordered take out without realizing it's a lunch room style Indian food place


Butter chicken was mediocre to say the least wasn't the worst I've had but wasn't even close to being good.

Mutter paner - this was good but is more peas then paner 

Garlic naan was good

My bill was 40$ and honestly wasn't worth it,

The price went up it's not the same prices as online menu which is what I ordered from my bill should have been 27.94$ but was 10$ more when I got to the restaurant I said fine cuz the reviews where good

For 40$ the food wasn't the greatest I won't be back. This was food for 1 

Tandoori kazana is way better cheaper and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Overall, always a good experience.

I go here on a regular basis for takeout and occasionally for dine-in. Their samosas are the best. 3 for $1 and they are big and you get sauce on the side (no charge). The sweets are very good as well and the display is very appetizing.

For dine-in, I have never hard to wait for a table and they seat you right away. The service is straightforward and they are short and to the point. This can come across as rude but that's that just how it. It could be perceived as a negative especially if you have never been to a small Indian restaurant like this. The food always comes out hot and fresh.  Once you finish you pay up at the front. Last time I paid, their machine did not have an option for adding tip.

Taking away a point for somewhat smaller portions compared to other Indian places. In particular, they need to give better Thali portions."}
{"text":"Food is ok but extremely overpriced.  Their takeout container isn't particularly big and costs $13 to fill with food.  One of the items I got was butter chicken which had about 7 chunks of chicken in it.  Basically paid $2 each! Yikes.  Service was not good.  The first girl I spoke with for help with the menu was less than helpful and the cashier barely spoke english.  There are alot of other places to go.  Do not go here just to overpay.  Again food was alright but who would pay $20 for rice and curry?"}
{"text":"Was taken to lunch at Sweet Mahal the other day by a couple of co-workers. I chose the veg-thali plant, which seems to be much larger than others. For only $8.99, it was quite a good deal and so yummy.

I chose a potato dish, chick peas and okra. All very well spiced and flavourful. Came with 2 huge pieces of naan, choice of plain or garlic. 

We also ordered some veg pakoras for appetizers. I found them to be a bit drier than normal and very salty. And overall, the food temperature could have been a lot warmer."}
{"text":"This is a traditional Indian food restaurant ~ has a cafeteria feel and lots of Bollywood videos playing on the big screen TV's mostly Indian clientele! Great for takeout as well as sampling Indian sweets (hence the name)! 
The food is very good and affordable ~ it's not a fancy place but if you're hungry - it's great and the staff are very friendly - it's always bustling at lunch hour more quiet on off peak hours. I enjoy their Talis, samosas, naan and roti. I'm vegetarian but my friends LOVE the tandoori chicken!"}
{"text":"food: 8/10
ambiance: 8/10 
Service : 5/10
Food is good and worth the price.
Service is bad and confusing .
I wanted few sweets as takeout and wanted to have veg thali there.
So i went counter thinking I had to order and pay before I get my order for veg thali .
Lady at counter helped me with sweets , she got call in between so she just went on answering her call and I had to wait for like 5-6 mins she didn't care .
When I asked about thali she said just order on the serving station. People at serving station told me to sit on empty table (all atble have reserved note ...Strange and confusing)
Server came after 5-10 mins and I asked what option are there for vegetable for veg thali they  said me to go to the counter and select (why can't you ask me when I was waiting at counter? or list the option at place where I can read and select sitting at my table)

My tips:
1) For take out only order at paying/main counter first, else just go and sit at any empty table.
2) for veg thali check option first at serving counter and then go and sit ,so that you don't have to go back to serving station again to select the veggies.
3) Be patient ( you will waste lot time waiting)and if possible order once only when server comes to your table.Servers here are always in hurry and might come back to check when you are done so to avoid waiting better order once only.
4) They don't have paper napkins at table so request them when server comes to take your order .
5) You have to pay at main counter and they ask the table number ,they will get the details from server based on each table number . So note and remember your table number.

I won't go again for dine in will probably do a take out ."}
{"text":"The place is located off 427 North and rexdale in a corner plaza. Restaurant is nicely renovated and food looks fresh, but nothing that gives the wow or yummy factor. I ordered the thali for $9.00 inc tax and got 4 different dishes and a naan bread."}
