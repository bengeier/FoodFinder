{"text":"When I first discovered this place, I came back for the next three days. They offer beef donair meat, chicken shawarma, lamb shawarma and falafel. All options come in a wrap, a platter or a salad. Mixtures of two proteins are also available. 

Their sauces are mouth watering and they never use it sparingly. One of the workers always asks if I want extra.

You have a choice to add cheese, as well as your typical choices of veggies found in a donair shop. 

The way they fill and wrap the donair before grilling really makes a difference. I hate wilted lettuce, but I love having that crispy pita on the outside of every bite. I've never had a bad donair from Pita Corner. 

The customer service is so good it makes you feel bad. It makes me feel bad at least. When did I become a \"sir\"?!

I'm surprised that this place wasn't already on Yelp. It's right by Tucker's on 26 st. S.E. 

Go there now."}
{"text":"This is a cute in the corner shop that you should check out if your in the Dover area.

It seems family owned and they are all super informative and sweet. 

The food is homemade and delicious one of the best Shawarma's I've ever had and at one of the best prices. 

Check them out beside Tuckers!"}

{"text":"Huge grilled donairs and lots of sauce. All veggies were very fresh.They do weigh out their meat which is always a bummer. Small shop, very nice lady. Price was good 12.50 for a jumbo (which was enormous, took up the whole tray) and 8.50 for a large."}
