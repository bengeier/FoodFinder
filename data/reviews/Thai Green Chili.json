{"text":"Easy to sum up this place: Terrible. We had the Chicken Satay Dinner and the Avocado Peanut Stir-Fry. Both dishes were drowning in sugar - to a disgusting degree. The peanut sauce for the satay? Almost positive it's brown sugar with a splash of water and some chopped peanuts. The only thing decent was the plain white rice, and by decent, I mean the blandness was actually a refreshing change from the aggressive sweetness of everything else. We agreed it was the worst Thai food we've ever eaten - food court Thai included."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai here is truly excellent. The dinner portion of it is also a very good size (the lunch portion of it is smaller but you do get a spring roll+soup with the lunch special).

Friendly staff and very reasonable prices given the state of our economy right now. It is on par with and probably better than a lot of places in the Annex if truth be told. 

No other Asian restaurant in the area can compare to their quality and value in my opinion."}
{"text":"If you're looking to try a new Thai place, I strongly recommend you either keep looking or just cook at home. Our usual Thai place was closed and we thought we'd try this one. Although the staff members are kind and the prices reasonable, the food had little to no taste at all. 

We ordered three dishes and each one tasted as though it were microwaved, not freshly cooked. The beef tasted as though it was never marinated and had a rubbery consistency. The curry, which should have tasted spicy, was more like warm coconut milk with a bit of curry powder tossed in.

I hope the restaurant makes more effort to improve their food because they really are very nice people. Unfortunately, there is nothing Thai about this place."}
{"text":"This place is simple and great. The food is good. The server was nice. The price was right. Fulfilled that late night craving for Thai. I would come back and I recommend."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I am NOT a food snob, and I can get get down with some crummy cheap food as long as it delivers the flavor, or the crunch, or the salty, or the sweet, or whatever it is that the given cheap food is generally expected to deliver. 
This restaurant is on almost every Toronto delivery website and app, but delivers none of the above. (HAR HAR!).
I'd remembered a bad experience with their food a few years ago (yes: a MEMORABLY bad delivery experience!) but figured if they were still kicking, maybe something had improved. I put my order into Foodora, paid the delivery fee, and pre-tipped my delivery fellow 15%. 
The fact that the order was accepted and then on the road all within 5 minutes should have been the first hint something was wrong.

* Veg. pad thai: flavorless save for the addition of lemon and the peanuts. 

* Veg spicy noodles: not spicy at all, and about half the serving size of the pad thai. Seriously, not spicy AT ALL. Tasted like nothing except semi-burnt cooking oil. Granted, sometimes friend grease is tasty. (I TOLD you I'm not a food snob!).

* \"Thick curry\" shrimp: the coconut flavoring tasted macaroon-level sweet. I only had the veggies so can't comment on shrimp quality. All the veggies in all the dishes were either undercooked or wilted and soggy.

* veg. spring rolls: this was the really upsetting item. The spring roll I tried was for-sure spoiled. You'd wonder how this was possible with something that was obviously once frozen and likely vegan, but it's possible.  I tried covering it with \"thick curry,\" hot sauce, everything.. and I couldn't finish it.  It was mushy - which I initially blamed on the delivery journey - and was almost sour in taste.  Since reading other reviews about microwave sounds in the restaurant, the mushiness makes new sense. My dining friend wanted to try it to see if I was crazy. When he tentatively smelled it, he put it back on the plate and looked concerned and confused.

Seriously, don't do it. For greasy fast food, you should at least get some flavor reward. And you shouldn't risk food poisoning. There are plenty of other Thai delivery spots in Toronto. Try any of them."}
{"text":"Awful food. Awful service. Avoid if possible.
Soups are extremely greasy and underseasoned, nearly inedible.
Beef and chicken rubbery and unpleasant.
Shrimp tasted like freezer and was so overcooked it was chewy and also nearly inedible.
Spring rolls were burnt, extremely greasy and tasted like the deep fryer oil had not be changed in weeks.
Some items obviously and audibly reheated in a microwave giving a mushy, unevenly heated quality to them, unacceptable.

Any and all complaints were met with an uncaring attitude, responses were: \"well then why did you order it?\" and \"what do you want me to do about it?\". 

Awful. Clearly these people do not care about food nor the people they serve it to. 
Be advised to stay clear."}
{"text":"First of all- there are no pad Thai joints in Bloorcourt Village and that's what we had our mind set on. We ordered the chicken and shrimp pad Thai, to go (as we are close and had other things to do) and were surprised to open it to minimal chicken and 2 shrimp!! The tofu was hard like it was reheated and the onions were so thick we were surprised this person even obtained a kitchen position. Finally, no forks or napkins on a takeout order. Waste of money for a meal of 90% noodles, with little meat, veggies, and tofu. I want to support local restaurants but I want good food in return for hard earned money."}
{"text":"Huge lunch special selection but none of it is great - the curries are watery, the stir-fries are too salty, and the soup that's served with each special is terrible. Reasonable prices and okay service, but against all odds I think the Thai Express in the Dufferin Mall tastes better."}
{"text":"Having forgotten to bring snacks with me, I had to find a place quick to feed my hungry hordes of children (ok just 2/3 little ones) before they started going bonkers.. 

We sat down outside on the patio (much needed with younger children-place to move), where we were the only people. QUickly ordered and received our tofu satay, and cashew tofu w veggies and rice. The satay was ok, peanut sauce was good. Children had veggie spring rolls (they gulped them down-perfect size, flakiness). The cashew tofu was ok, but the sauce was a bit.. lacking in identifiable flavour..

A good go-to place during the week at lunch (lots of lunch specials). I don't think I'd do this as a dinner spot.. 

Ok choices for vegans and veggies."}
{"text":"We used to order from this restaurant frequently. Dinners and also lunches a lot. The last three times the food has really gone down hill to the point that we won't order or go anymore. 
Sketchy chicken grosses me out in the Green curry lunch special. The cashew nut chicken had no flavour. The glass noodles with chicken also had no flavour at all and sketchy chicken chewy bits. The spring rolls are good but the soup seems to have too much gelatin in it.
It's too bad we really wanted a good thai restaurant in the neighbourhood but we won't be eating here anymore."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The food is delicious, the price is right, what more could you want? Me and my friends head over here when ever we need some good food and a decently priced pitcher."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the second time and I think I would not go back again.

When I went to this place a few years ago,
It was not that bad but this time a bit Disappointing! 

I ordered grilled squid from seafood meal section from the menu but the squid was from very cheap seafood mix low quality one.
I usually order squid meal when I go to thai restaurant but this was the worst squid ever.
And there was mostly veggies than squid.
Poor decoration, too.

Gave 3 star because The tom yum soup was not bad.

And sever was attentive but little bit slow.

Anyways they need to be improved for the squid quality!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, having a well versed knowledge of the eats in your area can be yelpful when you don't exactly feel like getting out of your PJ's and emerging from your cave - Showering is a pain, and being social is a drag. Lets be honest we've all hung out with friends and had \"the chat\" where we ask for hours on end \"what do you wanna grab for dinner....i dunno what about you\".

For all these reasons thank goodness that TO has some great take out and delivery options, most notably was recently finding (with Yelp app aid) Thai Green Chili. 

Not being familiar with my friends area of the city and both of us being too lazy to venture out in search of sustenance, we fired up the old Yelp app on my iPhone machine and searched \"thai food\" closest to our location. 

After reading through a couple options we came across Thai Green Chili and user reviews inspired us to give it a whirl. Being the total human sloth's that we were, we searched their website and called our order in for delivery. A quick phone call and order in and we were assured that our order would arrive within 40 minutes.

Our order arrived as promised (which for me is bonus points as its near impossible to get delivery on time these days I find) and exactly as we requested.

I ordered: Chicken Cashew with a side of White Jasmin Rice (ordered it extra spicy).

My friend: Thai Spicy Noodle (with chicken added)

My friend enjoyed her meal, however being the self proclaimed thai food expert that I am I was slightly more critical. Her meal was good, I agree, but I found my meal to be extremely SAWCEY, which as many of you know is usually a good thing, but in this case the SAWCE was NAT BAWSE, and covered the other ingredients (chicken, nuts....THE THAI CHILIS). I had trouble distinguishing one item from the other which led me to an unfortunate experience of chewing and swallowing a hidden pepper before realizing what I had done.

You know when you are suddenly blinded by pain and your whole life flashes before your eyes only moments before you realize that what you thought was your life is really streams of tears and perspiration?

Ya that's what happened :s

However I can't fault them on this it was my error for not looking at what I was eating so I will share the pain blame. Word to the wise - their chilis are HAWT!!

All in all we did enjoy our meal and the price (@ approximately $27) was right. Before awarding extra stars I'd love to see the restaurant for myself.

I'll get you next time Gadget...errr I mean Thai Green Chili"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out. 

Pad thai was over-cooked so that the noodles were falling apart. The green onions in the pad thai were whole (not chopped up), including the roots. Way too much green onion in the dish. 

The hot and sour soup had a piece of tin foil in it which I bit down on. Plus the soup didn't taste great anyway. 

The server was VERY nice.  Only good point I could think of. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Walked in last night to order pickup and was bowled over by the stench of chemical air fresheners. I wish I had walked out without ordering, because every bite of the meal was ruined by the thought of what all that air was doing to my food. Please get rid of the poisonous fumes, Green Thai Chili."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this restaurant but it was a total surprise. The food was amazing. Coconut rice and a chicken soup are superb ! But the waitresses here seem to be not very attentive. First she ignored us and then she forgot our order. But as long as the food is great, I would like to return!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I go here with friends, my man or by myself and have never been disappointed. The best dish ive tried is the Thai avocado chicken. The fresh garlic and lime sauce is unreal. I could slurp it like a soup! Amazing portions and delicious flavored. Try the fish cakes as well. I ordered a glass of masi Soave once and it arrived as about 8 or 9 oz! Looove this place!"}
{"text":"Yes if it's possible support local but not when the food is awful.  We ordered for take out the crispy beef, the mango salad and the Tom yom soup.  The first item was inedible and cold.   The mango salad was passable but so there was so much sugar it tasted like dessert.  Finally the soup was again strangely sweet and was a teeny portion with two shrimps.  After paying 32.00 for the worst Thai food ever I'll make sure next time I walk right on by."}
{"text":"I like this place. It was fast service, the waitress was nice, the prices were average. It wasn't an amazing experience and the environment is not fantastic, but it was solid. If I were craving Thai food or in the area, I would definitely go again but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. 
The menu was clearly written and easy to find what you are looking for or to find something when you don\t know what you want. I had the Tom Yom soup which I had never before tasted and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I just went for a soup- after travelling to thailand.

My standards are VERY high for thai soup and it has been very hard to find that quality in Toronto- so the quest continues."}
{"text":"Ordered via Uber Eats. Got the curry pad thai with chicken and shrimp. Large portion but awfully dry and bland. Not even a good curry flavour. Wouldn't order again and don't recommend to anyone. There are much other better Thai options!"}
{"text":"We got delivery from here, as we live pretty close by, and we all wanted Thai Food. 

I wasn't too impressed with the food quality. It all either seemed bland or spicy. There wasn't enough flavour. 
We got Spicy Eggplant, a Coconut Curry, Spicy Noodles (came free with 3  dishes ordered), Crispy Thai Beef (not crispy at all) and a Fried Rice. 
($46)

None of this came with rice, which was a little annoying, although we quickly made our own. 

I also found it strange that the women on the phone, when telling her the street name, she didn't know where it was. I said, it's 3 streets from your location. 

Maybe the experience in house is different, but I wasn't too impressed with the food."}
{"text":"The worst most bland Thai I have ever eaten. AVOID! I would suggest the Sri Lankan chef converts the menu to something he know (South Indian/Sri Lankan food) and save us the heartbreak of paying $10+ for rubbish pseudo Thai food."}
{"text":"Nice spot for an affordable lunch special.
Service is good and nice, Pad thai is always Good 

Recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten in the restaurant here once, and ordered delivery a couple other times. 
I'll give them credit that they've got a pretty wide menu of options to choose from, and most of the food I've had was all pretty darn good including thai staples like pad thai, singapore noodles, green curry, etc.

Nothing overly groundbreaking to report, but its a safe bet and probably some of the better thai food available in the area, so it gets my thumbs up of approval."}
{"text":"I like this place. I've grabbed take-out from them a few times since moving into the hood and they've not let me down since. The staff is very friendly and if it's not too busy you can get your order in less than ten minutes!

So far the only thing I've had is the Ginger Chicken and the Pad Thai. Both are quite good and you get a pretty hefty-sized portion. They also have a relatively inexpensive beer selection as well. I think a bottle of Heineken is like five bucks?"}
{"text":"Fairly decent Thai food. Good lemongrass soup. Good Pad Sew. Good Basil fried rice."}
{"text":"This place is a-ok. Could be tastier, could be a little cheaper, but overall totally fine for a neighbourhood Thai place. There are always beer specials, so you really can't go wrong on that front. 

The service has always been speedy and friendly and the pad thai is totally fine. I'm particularly fond of the shrimp chips and peanut sauce. Don't skimp out on spring rolls because really, if you're having Thai always go for the spring rolls."}
{"text":"I loved that they had a big menu to chose from. Every thing I've tried here was good. And it is affordable."}
{"text":"After poring over the menu here for 10-15 minutes and finding that it had exactly what I was looking for, I called to place an order just after 10pm on a weeknight.  Although their website clearly states that the restaurant is open till midnight daily (and till 11pm \"online\" whatever that means) the person who picked up abruptly told me they were closed.  When I pointed out the fact that their website seemed to indicate otherwise, the person basically told me that it'd been a slow night, followed by \"we go home now, bye\".  So much for dinner.  Thanks Thai Green Chili."}
{"text":"Key Features: $11.50 (after tax and tip) Lunch Specials

I have been let down by the Thai food in Toronto time and time again.  When I found myself headed to Green Thai I was not expecting much.  However, going in at lunch I was able to feed myself, full to bursting, on one lunch special.

I had the Chicken Pad Thai, which came with a side of Hot and Sour soup (a most delicious rendition of it too, it should be noted) and a spring roll.

There were no chili shakers on the table, and no sugar either - which is somewhat of a letdown with Thai food, but there was chili sauce behind the counter, just waiting to be asked for.

Not only that, but the Pad Thai was very flavourful and went well with the peanuts on the plate. 

I don't think I've ever eaten in a Thai Restaurant that I'd wanted to return to before, but this one?  It did the trick.  The food was great - the price was right."}
{"text":"Well if you're looking for something authentic, this isn't the place for you. Its a nice place if you have a group of 3+ people looking to go for a night on the town. I work close by and they have a lunch special which has a bunch of classics and reasonable prices compared to the fast food restaurants in the immediate vicinity.

Food was fresh, and had decent wait times though I did find it a bit too sweet for me. Regardless it was a decent experience for the city and I'm glad I popped in"}
{"text":"Thai Green Chili can't be missed for its bright orange and green signage.  I find the seating area a little dingy, so have never actually eaten in before, but a steady flow of regulars seem to keep the restaurant at least half full each night. The nearby Dufferin Grove is a fabulous park to go al fresco in or taking your food home and parking yourself in front of the television is always a good option too. 

The food is great and the portions are humongous. I usually prefer to phone ahead so that I can immediately pay and leave upon arrival, but on the occasions that I have lacked the foresight, the wait is never longer than 5-10 minutes as promised. Pad thai and fried rice were my most recent and trusty fall back dishes. Both were generous enough to be shared (or saved for leftovers) and topped with fresh green onions and lemon wedges.

The servers are consistently friendly and efficient - So much so that I could probably be convinced to finally eat in one of these times."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but I just didn't like it. Only got take out from it once but the pad thai I ordered was not very good. Granted I travelled around Thailand for a month so I know what authentic Thai food should taste like, but this just didn't hit the mark at all."}
{"text":"There's nothing worse than finding a place with good food, only to be let down with absolutely terrible customer service. I worked in the industry for years, and this was some of the worst customer service I have ever seen.

In the middle of our move, we ordered takeout for four people on a Friday night through a 3rd party system (OrderIt, or similar). What was supposed to be a 40 minute wait turned into more than 2 HOURS.  

When the food arrived, it was cold. Not hot, not tepid, but COLD. I had to reheat most of it in order for it to be edible.

We called the restaurant to talk to them, and the owner's response (verbatim): \"What do you want me to do about it?\". That's completely unacceptable. We paid over $60 for ice cold rubbish. We contacted OrderIt and told them about it, they got the exact same indifferent response and were told \"deal with it, we're busy\".  I get that, but the restaurant has the option to refuse an order or be more realistic about delivery times - they didn't.  We live three blocks away, they COULD have replaced the food, or refunded the money. But they chose to be stupid about it.

It's a shame, too - the food was actually pretty good. But you can't expect return business if you treat first time customers so poorly.  We will NEVER go there again or suggest them to anyone, unless they want to be treated like crap."}
{"text":"Never trust an empty restaurant! Dropped in for a chicken pad Thai. Edible, sure. But with tax and tip it was $18.50!! I didn't even have a drink. Awful. I won't be going back and you should find somewhere else to eat mediocre noodles."}
