{"text":"I love this place , it is so much Fun to Surf there everyone is really friendly and it's clean, I dident eat there but I seen the food and it looks good, definitly coming back when I'm in Montreal"}
{"text":"I hadn't surfed for more than 10 years  and  roecently spent an evening dining and surging here. I had surfed for 3
40+ years in the Santa Cruz area and a I'm 65 now. The people there were cool (if a little skeptical of my story.) So first time on synthetic wave and did the orientation then later the 4-5' left curl. Weird but I got familiar very quickly. This is definitely on my to do list next trip to the area in a few months. Good food and beer and the crazy scene is a gas, peeps riding about 10-12' from the tables. Hear there's a skate bowl upstairs. If you and fam are planning a warm beach trip from Montreal, Oasis will work to save you time starting out in real surf. Trust me."}
{"text":"Cool place, very unique decor, pina colada it's a must have, prices are a little bit high, the service it's ok but it could get better, the waitress took 25 min to bring three JÃ¤gerbomb and she wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Fun place, great staff! The restaurant was a pretty good rewards for all our efforts on the board!! Slow service but food was well worth the wait! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service !  Ordered a drink for 22 dollars and was not worth it at all. Refused to pay and they threatened to call the cops. The \"manager\" also took pictures of us so he can show the cops, which I find very unprofessional . He was blabbering to us in French when he knew we spoke English. I will never be back!"}
{"text":"Came to a bday thing and I was very skeptical going in about the food, but glad I was dead wrong! The food was really good! I had the surf and turf, and tried everyone else's food of cos and they were all good. The entertainment of watching people trying to surf while you eat is pretty fun too!

Will come back and try to surf one day."}
