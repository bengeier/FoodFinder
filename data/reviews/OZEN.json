{"text":"My all-time fave.  Fresh, tasty, great prices, gluten-free options, clean restaurant, nice staff~ Very satisfying.  I crave it allll the time!! No one has rolls like these guys.  Try the Bien Hua and thank me later for changing your life...."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food.  Had a bowl meal with soup that was fresh, delicious and a beautiful presentation.  Flavors blended very nicely and the veggies were so very crips and fresh tasting!  It is counter service for eating in (or outside patio) or take-out.  Manager speaks fluent English and French (as well as Vietnamese I'm sure).  Very reasonably priced for the food quality-- $32 CDN for 2 meals with soup and a single soda and tea.  Would gladly return!"}
{"text":"Nous avons commandé en livraison les crevettes citronelle, le poulet sauce aigre douce avec des wontons frits pour essayer ce restaurant. Très satisfait du délai de livraison, de la qualité et de la quantité des plats. J'ai hâte de commander à nouveau."}
{"text":"Microwaved chicken, badly thrown together food. Really sad considering how good this place was when it first opened. Back then, the chicken was cooked properly and you could barely hear the microwaves doors. Now it's *beep* *beep* *beep* *bang!*."}
