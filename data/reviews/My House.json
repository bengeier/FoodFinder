{"text":"Placed our pick-up order online last night for My House chinese restaurant. Went over 10 mins later.. 45 min wait for food. So had a glass of wine at Frys while we waited :) \"glass half full\"  While we were there, the (young) owner came out.. stressed as all get out.. about having to close again at 6:30. He hasn't slept in 2 days and he's super worried about food quality and customer service.. people have been commenting about his restaurant on Facebook so more people have been coming out.. he's been open for 6 days.. Let's say you've been working on a job for 6 days and your boss tells you that you suck at your job, do you quit and give up? No way!!!!    If you happen to be hangry today, please choose a different day to try these guys out.. you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I tried placing a take-out order over the phone and kept getting a busy signal for over a half hour so decided to just go there to see what all the fuss was about.  They are in a small location in the same strip mall as the new Frys store.   Arrived at 7pm on a Saturday and the place was packed with 15+ people waiting to pickup their takeout orders. We went right up to the counter and told the gentleman that we had a rather large order (feeding 10 hungry adults) and he told us the estimated wait time would be 35 minutes. After placing our order he revised the amount of time to 45 minutes.  We returned and waited another 15 minutes and the place was still packed (keep in mind that they do not offer table service).   The wait was well worth it as all of the food was excellent with generous portions and fresh ingredients.  Everyone was very pleased with everything we ordered from the crunchy egg rolls to the General Tso's chicken.  The consensus is that we will be ordering out from My House a lot more in the near future as even though we ordered numerous dishes, their menu is very extensive.   Good advice is to give them 45-60 minutes to complete your order as they seem to be overwhelmed with return satisfied customers."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh Chinese food. Best BBQ boneless spare ribs ever! We highly recommend the lo mein and veggie fried rice & orange chicken! Brown rice is an option without an extra cost."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've had in years. Moved to AZ from NH 10 years ago and this is the first place I've come across that actually tastes like the Chinese food back home."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  Good, fresh food and they will prepare however you want it.  Delicious and so glad they came to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese restaurant!  Everything we had was freshly made and tasted delicious. Great balance of tender meat to fresh vegetables.  The sauces were light and flavorful.  The chicken fried rice was filled with pieces of chicken breast. Large portions at reasonable prices. Everything was prepared quickly and packed in quality take-home containers.  They have just a few tables for dine-in, but they are very busy with take-out customers, so the atmosphere is not great for dine-in."}
{"text":"I have been eating Chinese food for over 20 years and this place is the best!!! The prices are amazing, the restaurant is very clean and the food/staff is the best!! Highly recommend this place. The variety is fantastic also. I'm on day three eating at this place. Spring the owner is so friendly and really strives to make all customers feel welcomed. A MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you, this place is awesome!!! Their food is excellent and they always take the time to accommodate my pickiness and substitute vegetables. And you can't beat the prices, especially for the quality of their food!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money drive two blocks south to Hong Kong Bistro its family run and consistently good. This place has already gone to the kids running it. Ordered the house fried rice they didn't even try to cook it up. It was some chicken, shrimp and over done dried up pork bits just thrown in a bowl with rice not even warm. Oh by the way I ordered house lo main so didn't even get what I ordered. They couldn't even give us some soy sauce or a lousy fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Minus 1 star because they still need to work out their timing. I believe they are so busy because they deliver and that's rare with Chinese here. The food is good, the price is great. My favorite is curry chicken and shrimp and scallop. My husband on diet so he is impressed with their steam chicken and veggies, my daughter loves the won ton soup because they are generous with the won ton.  I tried Szechuan chicken and I think I'll leave Szechuan to the experts on that one, you Need the lip numbing peppers and heat, but that's not their specialty so they get a pass. Note- during dinner rush on weekends expect a long wait for pick up they told me half hour I suggested more like 45? They were 1 hour!"}
{"text":"Purely average, standard chinese take out. I think Chandler residents are a little starved for half decent chinese food. A few places around here, like Singing Panda for example, use much higher quality ingredients. This was not bad, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Awesome food that tastes fresh. Everyone in the family enjoyed their dish. If you prefer gluten free their chow fun was a delicious option."}
{"text":"Wierd experience.... they've only been open 6 days, and this explains the chaos in the kitchen. Just after I got there (standing in line to order) a cook came out of the kitchen, and told the cashier to turn off the 'open' sign. Anyhow, the food was really good."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places my family and I have gone to for Chinese food, and it was decently priced too (we ordered from the lunch menu). The service was really great and our food was just coming out as we walked in, since we ordered online through the yelp app. Needless to say, we will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing like New York Chinese food. The egg rolls are like any typical AZ Chinese restaurant. There  duck sauce is sweet and sour. The garlic shrimp was sweet. The crab puffs were ok. My husband got mongolian beef and my son had orange chicken they were both too spicy and they didn't really finish it and threw it out. I usually don't write reviews but I was really disappointed and was looking forward to a good NY style Chinese food."}
{"text":"I searched Yelp for a Chinese food restaurant and found this one very close to my home. We ordered online which was very easy to do and then went to the gym and picked up our order on the way home. Very good food, probably better than any of the others around. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The best chinese food in Chandler! Everything I have had has been delicious! The owner is always there and is always helpful in picking out a menu item."}
{"text":"Excellent all the way around!  Tried the egg rolls, pot stickers, chicken wings, pork lo mein, general tso chicken, garlic chicken, shrimp w/broccoli and cashew chicken and were NOT disappointed with anything.  This is by far the best Chinese food we've had since moving to Chandler 6 years ago.  The owners work the kitchen and it shows in the quality of the food.  MY HOUSE ---- our go-to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"My son and I just finished dinner here... and all I can say is wow. The food came out fast and FRESH! We just moved to the area from Chicago and have tried a few places here that had 4 star Yelp reviews and have been sorely disappointed.  I can tell you that this is THE place to go. The dishes were so flavorful and had quality meats and vegetables. The orange chicken and Mongolian beef are to die for!  On top of that - you have staff who truly care about food quality and your overall experience.  Last - the place is clean and has calming decor that makes you feel right at home. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"The house lo mein was AWESOME, lots of meat and the flavor was intense!  My husband got the Kung Pao shrimp, no peanuts extra sauce.  Unfortunately, it came with peanuts and without extra sauce but he still enjoyed it. The eggrolls were great!   Busy restaurant but the front staff still had a smile on their face and there were lots of people coming and going! Looking forward to trying the spring rolls and chicken and broccoli next time!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty here, but we were disappointed in the experience of eating at the restaurant. It's definitely more of a takeout place. We were eating in with our two young kids, and we weren't able to find a high chair. It was crowded of people waiting in line, and we felt very much in the way while eating. We're not big take-out people, but if we were I wouldn't be opposed to ordering their food to-go in the future."}
{"text":"We have been 3x since they opened. Food is always hot and fresh. Nothing has been greasy and nice portion sizes too. Great friendly customer service.  This is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Alan (owner) is great!   He loves talking to you so he can help figure out something different that you will like.  Some of his recipes he learned from his grandfather, which is why he spends time talking to his customers to see what they are hungry for.  He wants to share the history he has brought to his restaurant.   Back to the food.  We got the Mongolian chicken and Ma La chicken with basil. super fresh ingredients with tons of veggies.   The restaurant is nice, clean and has a few tables to sit at if you eat in.  We will be back to try more of his families recipes.  Thanks, Alan!!"}
{"text":"Don't try to order on a Friday night as you'll be standing there waiting for an hour. However, they are very nice, just new. Food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food! Fresh and less salty than its traditional counterparts. We had Broccoli Beef and King Lao chicken with lots left over- very good flavor. Both my wife and I would come back. Highly recommend. It is small so if you're dining in plan for a wait. Their takeout business is strong and may be worth looking into."}
{"text":"My four stars are calibrated to the fact that I don't think there is one great Chinese restaurant in this whole backward tasteless state. That said, My House is currently serving the best Chinese food in the East Valley. The two guys who run this place are very sincere in their efforts to satisfy customers, serve generous portions of high quality food at decent prices, and make no pretensions of palatial Chinese splendor! They also let you decide how much hot mustard and duck sauce you want to take instead of acting like miserly gatekeepers over condiments (GOD, that is so pathetic and insufferable when Chinese restaurants - like 3 I know of in Chandler - do that!). Two suggestions for My House: Use the WIDE fried variety of \"crispy noodles\" for customers who buy soup. The skinny variety of crispy noodles currently being used is like the wiry stuff that used to come with La Choy Chow Mein kits in the supermarket and it tastes like rolled oat bran! Also, the \"Cold Spiced Sesame Noodle\" appetizer (a staple of New York City style Chinese food) must be served COLD (just like the name says!) with lots of sesame seeds and some scallions added on top. Hope you're listening!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff, food was very good we will definitely be trying again.  Spouse had the chicken and green beans and it was excellent green beans were very fresh and had a snap to them.  I Had the Teriyaki chicken bowl which was also very good although next time I might ask them to hold the pineapple."}
{"text":"Meh. The food tasted OK but was not hot.  Another mediocre Chinese restaurant in Chandler."}
{"text":"So good New York style Chinese food and the lunch specials are cheap! Great service nice family owned business. We got there around 11am and the owner said that it was a good time to come because it gets busy! They had a delivery driver wanted poster out front you know it's good!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Chinese food in Chandler & the East Valley.  Wait time was a little longer than I am used to, 30 minutes at 6 Pm for Takeout. It is a new restaurant and kinks will probably be worked out. Staff is very pleasant. We are from NY and this is NY quality & taste!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Fast, affordable, and most importantly delicious!  I would highly recommend trying it if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and the quality is very good.  We have only had two dishes but both were exceptional.  We look forward to a return trip!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, very kid friendly, and accommodating. This is my first time eating dinner here and I'll be back. Thank you for great meal!"}
{"text":"Not sure what NY style Chinese is but it was not my favorite. The pork fried rice had very few pieces of pork and didn't see any egg. Tasteless. Not to my liking.  Broccoli and chicken was good.  Would really have liked to had soy sauce in the to go order but none was in the bag.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I think they must have run out of fried rice, because we all got something similar to brown Minute Rice. Also, our egg drop soup came with flavorless chow mein noodles instead of the crispy wonton strips most places offer. Other than that, everything was tasty. The kung pao chicken is a little spicier than most Chinese takeout places, so they get bonus points for that. The portions are generous and we have plenty of leftovers. It's not a place I'd recommend going out of your way for, but if you live nearby you should definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is so fresh. I am not even that crazy about Chinese food but I love this place. The price are reasonable. This will be a place we eat at weekly."}
{"text":"Best in Chandler. Since everything is cooked fresh just order ahead.,so don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service here.  I have tried three times now to get food and the wait times are over an hour or they are out of food.  I am already frustrated with this establishment.  If you can't get your act together to service the public hand the business to someone else."}
{"text":"Terrific food! What a surprise find kind of hidden! The owner made special dishes for my two friends who were with me who had fish allergies! He was so accommodating!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff & food is always good no matter what I order! Finally a Chinese place that's delicious near my house!"}
{"text":"Disappointed, I thought the 4, almost 5 star rating would be great food. It was awful!   Let just say I would rather eat Panda Express instead of this place. Head to Singing Panda or Yao's if you want Chinese Food."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to impress me, considering I live nearby and my husband and I occasionally like to get Chinese takeout but, sadly, no.  I called ahead a single order on a sat, dinner time. She told me 20min. I arrived and there's a ridiculous line of people ordering and others waiting. Folks eating-in looked annoyed with the wait and folks in wait with me also kept checking watched and phones.  My food finally arrived and for what I paid, I should've had a respectable amount of protein in my container. It wasn't. The rest of the veggies in my dish were so coated in grease, I couldn't even enjoy them. It was quite disappointing.  All these people that night, annoyed, waiting, and eating sub par food.. How does this have so many stars??"}
{"text":"Even though the eatery was clean, the staff was friendly, I can not give it more than two stars.  For our dine in experience, the three items we ordered arrived at our table 11 minutes apart .  Vegetables in my entree arrived room temperature while the meats in the same dish were a tad warmer. The brown  sauce was tasteless.  Their beef chow fun was lacking flavor and had snap peas that were coated in so much oil it left me clearing? my throat afterwards.  I am sorry to say that after hearing all the hype,  \"My Place\"  will not be one of \"my places\" to frequent."}
{"text":"Do NOT order the chicken fried rice!  It didn't have any carrots, onions or vegetables.  About five strips of tiny strips of chicken."}
{"text":"Always very tasty. I do like the fact that you choose one item for lunch special. I am sure this keeps down waste and cost. The only complaint I have had is that one time they did not have brown rice cooked yet for the lunch special."}
{"text":"What a great find!  I visited during lunchtime, and had a meal from the lunch menu.  I ordered Tofu and Vegetables made extra hot and spicy.  Yum!  I had the Hot and Sour Soup with my meal, and it was very tasty - and the quantity was very generous (big bowl).  Service is great.  The restaurant is spotlessly clean, too!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place opened up! I stopped by here tonight and was not disappointed. I ordered online and my food was ready right on time. The food was still hot when I got home. The portions are larger than I expected! I got a small soup and small chow Meir which could feed 2-3. I also got coconut shrimp and orange chicken which were large portions as well. The staff were nice and the restaurant itself was very modern and clean."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times since they first opened. I went there once for lunch and their lunch specials are perfect! Price and proportions are perfect! Their dinner entrees are bigger and you will have plenty to take home and enjoy the next day! The food is fresh, comes out hot, and is very delicious. Everyone who works there is super friendly, out going, and you can tell they take pride in not only their customer service but their business as a whole. If you have not tried My House you are missing out and need to get on it as this restaurant has put Chandler back on the map for AMAZING Chinese food!"}
{"text":"It's plain American Chinese food. Nothing to rave about. The fried rice is extra bland, I tried it three different times and it's still just way too bland. The other meats are a typical Panda Express flavor. It's location is convenient though and the people are nice!"}
{"text":"Tried them last night since I tried to order last week and they were out of food. After reading the current reviews, it seemed worth the wait...it wasn't. Service was extremely long as we waited an hour for take out. Egg rolls were bland, dough was thick and it lacked in size. They served the cheapest duck sauce out there and so that didn't help either... by the way where's the hot mustard.The cold noodles came hot in temperature, but did have good flavor. Usually this comes with something else but it was just noodles. Back east it would have been garnished with scallions, toasted sesame seeds, maybe even fine shredded carrots. We also had chewy beef sticks, gummy won tons and very good tasting boneless spare ribs because they ran out of the regular spare ribs... at 6:00 really?"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I find myself craving their food throughout the week. It is terribly hard to find decent Chinese let alone great.  I have lived in AZ for 15 years and this place beats all other casual Chinese restaurants.  The cooks are all Asian, you know it's going to be good! The garlic chicken is spot on. The best dish is their Mongolian beef. Super tender and super spicy, They add a ton of peppers and onions. The quality of the food is very good.  The guys who run the counter are always friendly which is a plus.  Super impressed, will definitely spread the word."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and very reasonably priced. I went at lunchtime and didn't have to wait at all! Owner and his wife were very friendly and inviting!"}
{"text":"First visit to My House. We got crab rangoons, hot &sour soup, pork fried rice, broccoli & beef, lemon chicken.  Everything was excellent!!  Wish hot & sour soup had shrimp and meat in it but the flavor as is was very good. Would highly recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"My husband walked in tonight to place an order for our family. The person at the counter said \"Look at all these orders, I can't take yours right now. Maybe try back in an hour.\"  While I'm glad this new business is doing so well, that's a really crappy way to treat customers."}
{"text":"What's on the menu you asked! Just go in and try it for yourself you will love this chicken dish.! If you have a Chinese craving tonight?! Head to this fantastic restaurant that you will be satisfied.! This Will be your new Chinese food spot!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I'm allergic to peanuts, I told them that. They brought my food out with peanuts. Sent it back, 2 mins later they brought the same plate out. Sent it back again and they kept it longer but now I'm having an allergic reaction and my throat is closing up. There is no excuse for blatantly ignoring a food allergy."}
{"text":"Just tried dinner at this amazing New Chinese Restaurant...It was outstanding! Young friendly & fun Owner!  We tried beef & broccoli, chicken with Chinese eggplant & garlic sauce and vegetable lo mien.  The beef & chicken were lean, tender and succulent and the sauces were delicious!  Everything high quality and fresh.  I would equate the food there as comparable to a high-end Chinese restaurant.  Nice clean and modern atmosphere.  Just not allot of tables to sit at.  This place is worth take-out any night of the week!  #supportsmallbusinesses"}
{"text":"Took my kids and my mom to dinner here last night. Not only was the food so fresh and delicious, but the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming! This is by far the BEST chinese food restaurant in the state of Arizona. NY style in the desert FINALLY!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood place run by a husband and wife team.  Food is very good and consistent.  Eaten here about 10 times and used them to cater a party.  We highly recommend this place if you just want good honest Asian food."}
{"text":"Drove over 20 miles to take a friend out for a much needed Chinese food fix based upon all the GREAT reviews and honestly: Not worth the drive. :(  It is crowded and busy. The place is a cute cafe that has few tables and seems more like a coffee shop than a restaurant. We wanted to eat there so when asked, we said it was for here and still they bagged up our stuff to go. Somehow, the food loses its appeal when you are eating out of Togo containers with plastic forks. Also, the table was FILTHY and I asked for a rag to clean it since she was busy and she said for us to give her a moment and she would clean it - never did. We ended up wiping it down with a wet paper towel.   Was the food good? It was no better than any of the other Chinese food places that are waaay closer to home and they lost me when they served it in plastic."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in chandler in the 23 years I've lived here. I used to live in the Bay Area (San Francisco) and was spoiled by all the great Asian food. Until now, all we've had is generic Chinese food, nothing outstanding. The owner (Allen) cares, everything is fresh, and the prices are reasonable. Real crab rangoons, excellent Mongolian beef, all rices good. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't know about New York Chinese, or what, but it's good takeout Chinese, for sure. We'll order Chinese maybe twice a month, and we've just begun trying My House. We've been pretty pleased so far. I ordered the Tso's chicken the first time, and it was alright. I got the hot spicy chicken last night, and I was so satisfied that I thought that I should review them. My girl got the chicken mai fun and chicken lo mein, and no complaints from her (she *is* from New York, actually). Clean place, looks like they probably keep a pretty clean kitchen, we'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of reviews saying how this was the best Chinese food place in Chandler. Well, I've had better. The lunch special General Tso chicken wasn't bad, but no where near the level it has been made out to be. But, in fairness, I will return...with slightly lower expectations."}
{"text":"I have been to many chinese takeouts and all have failed except My House...I come from New York,  Long Island and missed the taste of the Chinese Im used, we ordered egg roll, boneless ribs, szechuan dumplings and roast pork egg foo yong...not disappointed in anything..soup was excellent, just be careful very spicy, egg foo yong , fresh and tasty sauce, never had the dumplings before, I loved them!!"}
{"text":"Ive been in search of New York Chinese food in Arizona for years. We tried My House for the first time tonight. Ordering on line was very convient. This place was excellent. Everything was delicious. The portions were generous. The pricing was very reasonable. The service was excellent. If you like New York style chinese food this is the place to get in."}
{"text":"We have done several online take out orders since opening. The food has always been fresh, delicious, and our order correct (which seems to be a serious challenge around here!) Online ordering is very easy, food is always ready when we walk in and we are only one block away. Staff are friendly. Huge portions for a great price, we can never finish a dish. Really glad to have great Chinese so close by!"}
{"text":"Tried My House Friday night and the food is amazing! We ordered pan fried dumplings, crab rangoons, shrimp fried rice, Mongolian beef, General Tso's chicken and even though they were slammed with customers nothing disappointed! So happy to have My House in Chandler. Easiest way to order is online."}
{"text":"I live less than a mile from My House so thought I would give it a try for take out.  This was a Friday night at 6pm and they were busy.  Phone order had a short hold time and was only 10 minutes before order was supposed to be ready. When I got there they had 5 or 6 groups sitting at tables inside and another 5-6 people at the register.  Front area was staffed with 3 employees working 2 registers. Person in front of me asked how long for a take out order and was told 10 minutes.  He said \"Really? Last time it was closer to a half hour.\"  Manager replied \"Look at my kitchen, we have doubled the staff.\"  My order was ready on time.  Food was good quality and price is reasonable.  No complaints on this visit and felt they earned a positive review."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Chinese restaurants around! Food quality and flavor are always consistently good. We even like their takeout containers which are easier to serve out of than the traditional cartons. The sauce in their stir-fried vegetables is? so drinkable? good and truly the freshest chow fun noodles this side of the islands! We cannot comment on their sit-down? service since this is our #1 takeout? restaurant. We do need to confirm that they're not using MSG."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We order online and pick up and never wait. The variety is also amazing. Fave is Pad Thai."}
{"text":"This new restaurant in the Chandler area is a huge win. Great food and service. Will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is great! They are super friendly, it's clean, and the food was awesome. I Got Mongolian beef and veggie chow fun noodles with tofu. LOVED both! :)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and will return. Egg rolls were good, Lunch specials we both had also very good. Food was served on plastic not takeout containers and interior was clean. Cashier was very good. Being from NY I want to try some of their other NY dishes."}
{"text":"I met up with my son for a quick lunch. Found out really quick that dining in wasn't happening. I'd say this is more a takeout restaurant than dine in. Very limited seating. Which is fine. We didn't know the wiser. Ended up taking out. The wait was short and the food was fresh and fantastic! The price was great and portions perfect.  We voted that this will be our new go to for Chinese takeout!"}
{"text":"We really like this place, everything is fresh and yummy.  The people are great. The only draw back is the wait, which sometimes can be long."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times & each time the food has been very good.  The quality & ingredients are so fresh & delicious. The owner is extremely nice & accommodating to everyone.  It was a little crazy when he first opened, but they are getting the hang of it now. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Hot and sour soup here is the BEST! Very fast and friendly service"}
{"text":"After seeing so many people rave about this place, I had to try it. Was worth the hype!!! Fresh, tasty, reasonably priced. Very popular, so don't be surprised if there's a bit of a wait. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Please be patient when you come here. Their food is awesome! They are still getting into their groove and are getting better every day. The owner and his family are so sweet and are trying so hard."}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant that is awesome! The food is made fresh when you order it and is delicious! If you don't see what you want from their vast menu, they will make it for you. The food is also reasonably priced. I predict they will need a larger restaurant as more and more people try this place.   We've tried the coconut shrimp, the Chicken Lo Mein, the fried rice, the Basil Beef, the crab Rangoon, and pork egg roll and the shrimp and chicken with broccoli. It was all delicious!!! Portions were generous, too.   Dine in or take out. Either is fast and fresh! You won't be disappointed. Thank goodness My House came to Chandler!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with family. Several tables available for dining in but several people stopped in for take out while we were there. Meals were excellent, very fresh, tasty. The General Tsao's Chicken was great!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open up and we got lunch togo. The apps were amazing loved both the crab rangoons, pan fried dumplings and egg drop soup. For entrees we got the sweet and sour chicken and beef with broccoli. Hubby's sweet and sour was average and my beef broccoli was so-so. The chicken lacked crunch and the beef sauce didn't seem to meld well. Hoping this was just a busy Saturday and will try again in future."}
{"text":"FINALLY!! God heard my cries and answered my prayers. I prayed God would send a good Chinese food restaurant to Chandler and He more than delivered. Don't let the small size in a strip mall fool you. They are cooking up a storm here. Don't blink because you'll miss it. Hell we use to drive to Singing Panda & eat with the blue hairs & silverbacks. With this place being only 5 minutes from my home we will either eat here or get it to go all the time. This is NOT Gold Chef, Beijing or Panda Express. It's not doughy chicken covered in sugar water with food coloring. The chicken is breast meat chicken battered & cooked just right. The food is fresh, hot & bursting with flavor. The vegetables were brights, charred just right and maintained the snap we all look for. The portion sizes are stupid big and priced just right. We had the orange chicken, the boneless BBQ ribs and mongolian beef. EVERYTHING was amazing. If you want chinese food that taste like chinese food, go to My House. You might see us there!"}
{"text":"I don't typically ever review food places, but I had to make an exception for this place. The food here is phenomenal, very fresh and very delicious. The service is amazing as well, from when I walked in the door to when I left I was never disappointed. The owner and the staff made the experience even better by being so welcoming and helpful. My House is definitely my go-to Chinese food place from now on and I will 10 out of 10 recommend to my family and friends. A giant THANK YOU to the My House staff for the exceptional food and service!"}
{"text":"I think this place is okay. I had heard so many great reviews from neighbors. The egg drop soup and hot and sour soup is pretty plain tasting. The fried rice in the lunch combo, I'm not a huge fan of. It had beansprouts and pork chunks...just a weird combination. The grain of the rice is a thicker sushi kind of grain. Not jasmine like I'm used to. The entrees that I got were delicious. I got a szechuan pork and chicken and green beans. Both had a nice, tasty flavor and generous meat to vegetable proportions. I would certainly go again but maybe just order entrees. I've heard this place gets packed and they have only 5 tables in the store. I find that a bit puzzling considering how busy the area is."}
{"text":"We went the other night and ordered takeout thinking it would be pretty fast to get our food (if we would have known about the wait we would have grabbed Little Ceaser's). The restaurant was pretty full but almost everyone had their food and was eating. Over 40 minutes later (when we were told it would only be 10/15 minutes) we where finally told that our food was ready. We got home, and taking into account I had low blood sugar by that point, the food was only \"meh\". Based upon the wait, the food not being amazing we probably wont go again which is really disappointing considering how close the restaurant is to our house. :("}
{"text":"Only ordered from here one time so far, but my new favorite Chinese restaurant in Chandler!!!"}
{"text":"We have had multiple people refer us to this restaurant because it's \"sooo good\". I don't know, we had it this week and it was ok. Nothing I would write home about. I feel like we just get the same food at the Chen's down across the street from us. Maybe I'm missing something but it's just regular old Chinese food. Not bad, not great."}
{"text":"Service and great FRESH food!! This is the place to go to if you love Chinese food! Owner is great and staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Very good food and authentic! Clean place and the staff is very friendly.  Very easy to order online as well!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  What I wanted wasn't on the lunch menu, so I paid full price for the Lemon Chicken.  First, it was overpriced for what it was.  Secondly, and most importantly, my meal came out in three separate bowls: one with my chicken, one with the sauce and one with the rice.  It was like eating take out in a sit down restaurant.  And, it really wasn't that good.  Disappointed in yet another lack luster Chinese restaurant in South Chandler."}
{"text":"With (currently) 4 1/2 stars, I certainly hope there's no \"ballot stuffing\" going on here.  My ordering experience at My House involved two people.  The first was a very pleasant and helpful young man.  He seemed genuinely interested to help by offering to answer questions about the menu and he did so with a smile.  I also got the impression he's the only person there with any notion of customer service.  The second person I dealt with was someone who may have been an owner or manager.  When I asked the first person about the House Beef Bowl (Number 54 on the paper menu) the second person jumped in and said they weren't offering it anymore because it would take HIM seven minutes to prepare, and HE felt it was too much time, especially when they're busy.  Keep in mind 1.) I was the only person in the restaurant 2.) the item is listed on the paper menu (see photo) and hadn't so much as been crossed out and 3.) after ordering alternate items I was told it would take 10 minutes which, I believe, is three minutes longer.  I'm trying to be objective with this review, but I have to say, I feel sorry for the first person.  The first person spoke in such a way as to defend what may be his employer and, possibly, his job when trying to explain the second person's decision about not serving what was on the menu.  He did so as tactfully as anyone could expect, but I doubt he gets paid any extra for it.  I hope the first person was, at least, the recipient of the entire tip I left.  As for the food, the fried rice didn't seem fried and the Buffalo Chicken Wings weren't Buffalo style at all.  Next time I order Chinese food, I hope to encounter the same first person ... at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Great new place for Chinese in south chandler. Just make sure you order early. If you order before the dinner rush it will take about 15-20 minutes and anytime after 6pm it will take about 30-45 minutes. I have ordered the chow fun, hunan chicken, and Mongolian beef. They all were great. Can't wait till the next time we go. Again they are very busy and wait times are much longer than quoted. Friday nights are hard to get through to place order so order early."}
{"text":"I love Chinese Food, I have tried dozens of places, I have found MY Chinese Restaurant. My House Chinese.  I'm allergic to msg, I sneeze, makes me drive home fast, stomach hurts.  I've now eaten here a half dozen times, no problems. I met Allen and Zack, Allen told me they don't use msg he uses chicken broth for flavor and other spices.  If you want GREAT Chinese Food, My House the corner of Ocotillo and Gilbert Rd, Southwest corner East side of complex."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and tried the orange chicken with pork fried rice. It was AMAZING! The best orange chicken I have ever had hands down. My dad had the pork with garlic sauce and really liked that as well. The staff are incredibly friendly as well. I'm so glad to have a good Chinese restaurant that delivers right around the corner now!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We ordered three different meals to share as a family. One was steak, another chicken and the last was shrimp and scallops. All three were excellent. I was able to order online which helped with the wait time. Considering they just opened and its the latest hot spot they did great with the frenzy of people waiting for orders."}
{"text":"One of the best New York style Chinese food Restaurants I have ever been to, outside NYC. The Chicken with Broccoli was spot on, brown sauce was full of flavor and broccoli was cooked to slight crunchy perfection. I thought for a mention I was back Downtown. Don't pass this restaurant by it will not disappoint Have to add fast, friendly and courteous service make MY HOUSE a new favorite spot for me."}
{"text":"This place was recommended in a FB group I belong to. They gave them rave reviews ... have to  say I agree.  The food was delicious and fresh. The place is clean and the staff is friendly . What more can you want ?"}
{"text":"I have been using Yelp for years and have yet to write a review because I am lazy .   This place deserves 10 stars, amazing New York style Chinese.  We got Orange Chicken,  General Tso's Chicken and Crab Rangoon and everything was out of this world amazing!"}
{"text":"Wish I had 10 stars!   After 5 years in the valley FINALLY an awesome Chinese restaurant.   They rock on everything. We ordered on line take out twice.  On time and beyond our expectations in food quality, freshness and taste.  It has become a weekly dinner for us.   Many choices and 4 out of 4 that we have had is excellent.  Best to order ahead of time on line as the wait can be up to an hour if you walk in for takeout. Thank you My House!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, the best I've had since moving to AZ 7 years ago and is definitely east coast goodness! To the people leaving negative reviews due to wait times....there is a reason why. This is a brand new, just opened a week ago, small business and the volume of business they id getting ridiculous. Can't fault them for that...food is going out the door faster then they can bring it in. My wife and I were there at 11:30 for lunch on Sunday and there was a constant flow of people already just a half hour after they opened."}
{"text":"Oh em gee!!!  This place is amazing. Great prices, wonderful food, not too spicy and so clean. The owner is super nice and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The best in the area for sure! Never disappointed, even my 5 year old loves it.suggested by a friend and I actually want it almost every week."}
{"text":"I stopped in tonight to get dinner for my family. I had never been before but heard fantastic things. I asked them for recommendations for my family. They gave us excellent recommendations (Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken and Basil Chicken). It is delicious, and the entire family is happy. The team is incredibly kind and thankful for the business. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have tried the Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shanghai Shrimp and Chicken crispy noodles. Don't necessary like the atmosphere at the place, but for takeout, it is great. Not too many good Asian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I love My House. The staff is so friendly, prices are reasonable and the food is great! What more could you ask for?!!"}
{"text":"I really like their food. They are so flexible and accommodating of my kids \"pickiness\".   I usually order the chow fun and the lo mein (I think I like noodles). My son loves their fried rice with \"extra\" eggs.   Love the convenience, staff, and speediness of the service. The quality doesn't suffer."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Cute, small place with a few tables...most people there came for take-out. Loved watching the kitchen work...and man-oh-man they were busy! Saw lots of bowls of fresh veggies.   We had egg rolls, Rangoon's, cashew chicken and pork in garlic sauce. Service is as quick and the food was fantastic! Fresh and great flavors.  Egg rolls were not greasy and there were pieces of pork in it. Rangoon's had a slight sweet taste and were light and flavorful. Loved the sauce on the cashew chicken which also had zucchini, carrots, snow peas and a ton of big fresh mushrooms! Garlic pork was a tad spicy in a good way and again had lots of fresh broccoli, baby corn, onion, etc.  We will be making this place a regular!!!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of rave reviews on a Facebook page I am on so I tried it tonight.   I ordered to go off their website and when I got there, my food was ready and I just had to wait in line to pay.  Everything was all bagged up and handed to me.  I wasn't given soy sauce or sweet and sour sauce, nor was I asked if I needed any.  I am used to it being in the bag at the other local places I go to.  Aside from that, the food was good.  The egg flower soup was not a favorite of ours.  It seemed a bit oily.  But the rest of the food was good.  The pork fried rice was great and brought all the other dishes together."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have possibly every had! The owner is a super cool guy and made sure everything we had was amazing! The food was very clean and fresh. I had the Kung pao chicken and my wife had the orange chicken and they both loved it. The prices were great and the restaurant was very clean! Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"First time in. So far they are doing great. Gave recommendations for my wife who is gluten free. Then manager came out and let her know they can customize anything for her,even soup. Food tasted great and the portions were huge for the price. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough positive comments regarding the high quality and great tasting food that comes from this little place. We sampled the fare for the first time around a month ago and quickly realized that this would be our go to place for chinese dishes. We drive about 19 miles to grab food from here once a week or more. Alan the owner is meticulous about the quality of food leaving the kitchen. He insure each guest is satisfied and is more than happy to suggest menu items to try. I'm a sucker for orange chicken extra spicy and fried dumplings. The chicken is crisp with a sweet and Spivey orange sauce that will not disappoint. The dumplings are some of the best I've had and definitely the best in the area. His egg rolls are crisp and a special treat. You can't go wrong with any item you select and the prices are a bargain, especially during lunch."}
{"text":"Owner is very nice guy , always working hard this place is very good quality food compared to all the other Chinese places around here !"}
{"text":"This place is very close convenient & very good. I can place an order on line & be there in 5 minutes. They have a huge menu that offers schezwan style Chinese which is not real common. It's a small place with limited seating & they do a lot of to go orders. Still exploring their huge menu but we have been there 4x now & it has consistently been friendly, fast, & good."}
{"text":"Really fresh and delicious Chinese food!  Have gone three times and it's always been really delicious! The owner is very friendly and service is great!"}
{"text":"My family and I went last night for the 1st time.  My wife ordered Shrimp Pad Thai, my son ordered General Tso's chicken, I ordered Mongolian Beef and my daughter ordered beef chow mein fun. In addition, I ordered the wonton soup and we split an order of pan-fried meat dumplings.  My wife tasted the pad thai and it was very spicy. My son tried the General Tso's and it was not spicy enough.  The owner came over and asked how it was and we mentioned it.  He immediately replaced my wife's with a version that wasn't spicy and then gave my son some hot oil to dip his chicken in. Both of those solutions satisfied them. After that, we all loved our food.  My mongolian beef was not too spicy but was very flavorful. The wonton soup was good and the dumplings were as well. My daughter loved her chow mein fun and we voted as a family to keep this restaurant on our list."}
{"text":"A home run so far! We've ordered from them 3 times and each time we've had fantastic food! Finally a good Chinese restaurant in our area!"}
{"text":"We've gone for lunch at least 5 times now. Very friendly. Recommend the Chicken with Garlic Sauce."}
{"text":"Really nice little place. 20 seats. Great for take out. They are new and still working on timing and getting orders out but the food is sure worth it. We tried a little bit of everything. The crab rangoons were great and I personally loved the general tsaos chicken. Shrimp in lobster sauce was good with very large shrimp."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Wasn't a fan of the sweet/sour sauce. Everything else we had was good. Thought price was pretty comparable. Around $80 for family of 6 to eat."}
{"text":"Brooklyn  Chinese food is their claim. My claim is that they have food as flavorful as one can expect. Tried three different dishes and would get all three again. Don't miss the homeade spicy mustard...yum! Owner is someone you want to support as a local small business. For sure it is my new go to Chinese take out!   Take a minute and ask to speak with the owner. He is full of spice and can't wait to go back to help support his young family!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. It's really hard to find high quality family owned Chinese food and this place has it. I called ahead for takeout and they had it ready in 15 mins during dinner rush. It all tasted great.   To the 1 star reviewers below - a restaurant gets busy when lots of people like it. If your obese body can't wait 10 minutes to ingest more calories then maybe try the Taco Bell drive thru next time."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! Delicious clean tasting food. Probably the best Chinese food I have ever had. We got to meet the owner and he is as awesome as the food is. The cashier also amazing. Very much appreciate being told it would be 40 minutes and totally worth the wait! We had hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, house Lo mein and crab Rangoon. Each dish was better than the next. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Overall disappointed at the experience:  Pros: - young owner tries hard at winning new business - decor of restaurant is clean...and you can sense that hard work is being put in place to make the restaurant succeed  Cons: - i got the sense that old ingredients were being \"recycled\" versus using fresh ingredients everyday....for the sake of profits.  I ordered walnut shrimps.....and you can definitely tell the shrimps were recycled from several days ago - owner needs to recognize that shortcuts for the sake of profits will win him profits in the short run.....but will be detrimental for his reputation and growth for long term.....because guess what.....i will be telling many of my friends about the experience - overall the cost for this takeout experience is above average....it's even more expensive than similar takeout from east coast......my advice is use fresh ingredients.....treat your customers honestly......reduce your costs and pass on to your customers (versus 10% coupons on already inflated prices).....customers are not dumb.......strive for long term growth and honest business practices...and demand the same from your employees"}
{"text":"What a great place to get some fantastic Chinese food!  We hit the jackpot with this place!  Mongolia Beef was the best I've had in AZ.  My wife and I can't wait to try some of the other dishes on a menu built for everyone.  5Stars!"}
{"text":"Typical Americanized Chinese fare. Nothing to write home about. I give it a 3 stars because it's decent food for good value. Plus they have Pad Thai which my mom enjoyed. I had higher hopes for this place because of all the raves on Ocotillo Friends and it's close to my house, unfortunately my palette for Chinese food just isn't Americanized."}
{"text":"I have been craving New York style Chinese food. This right here is just that! Amazing flavor, the owner greets you at the door, they've also been so busy they've had to close early! Such a great place to go and grab a dish to go! Tiny inside for eating, but is perfect temp to eat when you get home!"}
{"text":"We just tried this place based on reviews from Living Chandler on Facebook. This place is great! Food is awesome and the owner was incredibly nice. He explained that he is new and trying to stay up on demands. Never expected to be as busy as he has been as quickly as he has... He is busy so be patient on how long it takes for your food at the moment. I think every new restaurant experiences that. Overall a great experience and I will be a regular"}
{"text":"Not too bad, but not too good. When this place first opened there was a line out the door, and was so busy they didn't answer their phones for pickup orders. That's way too busy for my patience, so I waited until the buzz wore off & decided to try it.  Meh... I had the Mongolian beef and sesam chicken. Mongolian beef was mostly green onions and cheap slices of beef deep fried before being mixed with green onions....a lot of green onions. The positive was I got a great workout on my jaw muscles trying.  Sesame chicken....meh. Basically sweet and sour chicken with a different sauce. Not horrible, but definitely not the crispy-but-chewy sesame chicken I'm accustomed to."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Where do I even start? Everything was sooooooo delicious. No complaints. Excellent food, amazing/friendly service (including the very nice owner who introduced himself), clean establishment with really nice modern decor. Super cute place! Everything we got was really, really good. We got the sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, teriyaki bowl, chicken lo mein, sautéed string beans in garlic sauce, and also egg drop soup, egg rolls, white rice, and pork fried rice. Impeccable!!!! Fed 7 people for under $50 and had leftovers! We got there before 3pm so we were able to eat off the lunch menu. I love that you can do that even on the weekends. We will be regulars here from now on. Super excited to have found this place. Think I'll be back tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that and the day after that!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food places around Chandler. Fresh plates. Large portions. Very tasty. Lots of options. I recommend the boneless pork spare ribs. The beef and broccoli is fantastic. The Mongolian Beef is very  good!   Allen the owner is friendly, he'll remember you agree a few visits. I've been here a few times and haven't had a bad meal here yet."}
{"text":"Real Chinese food in a white part of town. From what I ordered tonight, it was delicious. I grew up eating very authentic Chinese food and this is good stuff. The reviews are going to be bad in this part of town because well, it's not Panda Express or your local Buffett. I'm just happy I found some good food near by."}
{"text":"Super clean restaurant. They're tiny but we got lucky and were able to get a table at lunch.  Tried their beef fried rice and chicken lo mein. Loved the lo mein! I hope to go back to try more!! The lunch special was only $7! The guy at the desk was really nice and informative."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened and has amazing food! We had the house special chow fun, the egg rolls, and the Mongolian beef. Although everything was delicious, you must try the Mongolian beef - so flavorful! It is family owned, and the owner is extremely nice. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My House Chinese Cuisine just opened up around the corner from me. I've been waiting patiently for them to open and am glad they finally did! I have a weak spot for Chinese take out, and always welcome any new places to hopefully add to my rotation.  I left this morning to find a menu to My House on my doorstep..... I took this as a sign that I HAVE to try this for dinner. I had plenty of time to peruse the menu, and decided on walnut shrimp, green jade vegetables, and crab rangoons.  Here's my verdict on each of my menu items I ordered:  Walnut Shrimp - generous portion! Large shrimp,  lightly  breaded and flavorful on their own. Complimented well by the walnuts and the white sauce. I especially love that this wasnt drenched and drowning in sauce. It allowed for the other flavors to shine through.  Green Jade Vegetables - as you may have guessed it.... this is an entree of green veggies. Green beans, broccoli, snap peas tossed in a white sauce. Again, lightly sauced not soaking in sauce. Very flavorful for a side of veggies, I was pleasantly surprised.  Crab Rangoons - Aahhhh yes, crab rangoons, my guilty pleasure. One of the deciding factors I consider whether I will return to a Chinese  restaurant is how much I like their crab rangoons.  These were top notch. The wonton wrappers were fried perfectly. Light crunch, good texture.... not hard or too chewy. The cream cheese filling was seasoned/ filled with something magical that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Needless to say, I'll be back. I wish this business all the luck. If they keep up with the quality food they served up tonight, they will do extremely well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it's so close. Had heard it was like New York Chinese food. First time I ordered shrimp with lobster sauce. It had fake crab meat in it ? Not New York style at all. We tried to give them a second chance and ended up ordering different dishes which were way to sweet and just not good. Maybe get a new chef ?"}
{"text":"Best Chinese place that the hubby and I have found! Wonton soup is awesome although if you order late they tend to water it down so make sure you ask first. They are honest about it. Sweet and sour chicken, the house special , egg rolls, homemade mustard ,any lo mein dish, crab Rangoon, beef and broccoli and all their diet dishes are great!! The owner is always super cool and friendly with my husband Jim! You should definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I am spoiled when it comes to food. I had been reluctant to try a Chinese restaurant since moving out here, tried a couple and wished I hadn't! We stumbled across My House when we were in that area, and since trying it the first time we have been back countless times! My kids love it, my family from Chicago came out for Thanksgiving week, they loved it; the food is amazing!! Allen is awesome, he remembers my girl's, always talks to them and makes everybody feel welcome and that their food is exactly how they like it. We are so glad we found My house!!"}
{"text":"D E L I C I O U S.  and fast and local. Always good to have reliable Chinese food nearby."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed with My House after reading rave review on Yelp and Living Chandler. The sweet and sour chicken was bland bland bland. The pork fried rice seemed to have no spices or flavor in it - no onions or scallions to give it flavor! To add to our disappointment when I got home with our take out bag- they hadn't put any of the usual sauce packets or fortune cookies so we couldn't even enjoy the fortunes! So disappointed- there's definitely some better options here in Chandler."}
{"text":"Honestly this side of Chandler needs a good Chinese restaurant. The menu of My House is very typical Chinese American fare. After reading the reviews, I was anticipating much better food. Though I only ordered the Egg Rolls, 3 of them to be exact I found them on the smallish side, and bland as a few Yelpers described and not appetizing when served with the really cheap duck sauce and no Chinese hot mustard. On a side note: I asked the owner if he puts authentic Chinese ingredients in the Hot & Sour Soup (Chinese Cloud Ears and Golden Needle) and he assured me they do. I will give it another try in hopes that it's better."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Chinese Restaurants in my lifetime. In places like San Diego, Boston, Chicago, to Chinatown in San Francisco and all points in between. I've tried a lot of places in Chandler, Mesa, Tempe, Scottsdale, Gilbert and Phoenix, Arizona. There are very few that stack up to the quality that My House in Chandler, Az provides. They are newly opened in the area. In a area of low quality Chinese places, this establishment stands out. They serve high quality meats and vegetables. I ordered Mongolian Beef with Pork fried rice and an egg roll combo. Plus a order of boneless BBQ pork ribs. These are 2 dishes that are VERY tasty. I spoke with Allen, the owner, a very delightful young man today while I was placing my order. He   said that he wasn't expecting the response he has gotten to his new restaurant being opened. People are flocking here like it's the 2nd coming of Chinese food. At 11:30 am on Tuesday August 8th, this place was already full, and orders coming out of the kitchen to go and such. While I waited at least 3 people called in orders. I would rather wait an extra few minutes to get my food, as long as the quality is like this. They are working out the kinks of the response to the food, I am sure they are doing their best to keep up with the demand. In a sea of bland and low quality Chinese food in the Chandler area, from Riggs to Germann and Arizona Ave to Val Vista, this is the best around. No longer do I have to wonder if I can find some good Pork Fried Rice or BBQ Pork ribs. I have found what I have been looking for. Congrats to Allen and the staff at My House, they are doing something right. Keep up the good, hard work.  ** New Update for August 14, 2017!** Went to lunch today with my wife. This time I had the Beef & Broccoli combo with Pork Fried Rice & Egg Roll. And MORE BBQ Boneless Spare Ribs.. Adding pics soon. The beef is VERY tender, and the sauce is super flavorful. The BBQ pork was once again fantastic and very tasty. My only problem is they serve Pepsi drinks. Other than that, everything is great."}
{"text":"My House opened at Gilbert and Ocottilo (just down from the TMobile) and it has lunch special everyday before 3pm for $6.25. Portion sizes are excellent and if your choice is the soup be ready for a bowl. Food is tasty and I was not dissapointed. Will definitely stop in again sometime."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is probably one of the worst I've been to.  The food Taste all the same. Very boring. Kong pow chicken was horrible not even spicy at all. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. Pad Thai is my favorite! However my noodles were all stuck together. Which made it difficult to eat & not much flavor. Maybe I caught them on a bad day? Shrimp fried rice was oily & the onions weren't cooked all the way."}
{"text":"We have been there about 6 times since it's opening. The food is perfect each and every time. The owner is a great guy very friendly and he will custom make an order if it's not busy. But if you go during busy times have some patience because they get really busy. Thats because it's so good you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After reading a lot of positive things in FB groups about this place, we decided to give it a try, since we just moved here from NY a few weeks ago.  It was REALLY good!!   We had the food delivered, which I was just a slight bit concerned, since I had read about how sometimes the service is slow...but the delivery came 20-25 minutes after we ordered, which is excellent for a very busy place.  I called to ask something and spoke to Allan (sp?), the owner.  He is originally from Bklyn.   He was very nice and let us know that he can make whatever his customers want.  He was telling me about a spicy sesame chicken that he makes.  My son loves spicy, so he'll try that next time!  Definitely recommend and will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh, well prepared food.  The place is packed with to go customers but does have seating for about 20.  Very clean and nice atmosphere.  Huge variety of menu items.  A family business and they are very friendly but very honest about how long it will take due to their popularity.  Don't be rating them on the wait.  If you want steam table chinese quickly go to Panda.  If you want tasty, hot Chinese food come here.  Seriously call it in about 30 minutes ahead of time.  I had hot sour soup, meat dumplings and szechuan beef combo.  Nothing was remotly salty, the portions match the pricing, the beef was tender,loved the broccoli and probably one of the best fried egg rolls I have had.  Their use of oils is just right, none of the plates demonstrated an oily sheen when emptied.  ???"}
{"text":"We ordered House special, and vegetable spring rolls. They both were very good. Tasted fresh, and large portions. The service was perfect. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh goodness this place was packed yesterday and they were not expecting the crowd but i will tell you this place is worth it.  Yet small the food portions are perfect and the staff just makes you want to move in with them..we will be repeat customers for sure since we live right across the street."}
{"text":"Great Chinese fast food! There are many dishes to choose from and their Hot and Sour Soup is my favorite go to soup when my allergies are kicking in!"}
{"text":"I ordered cashew chicken, mongollion beef.  excellent flavor and sauces.  Chunky fresh vegetables  and mushrooms.  I cant wait to eat again soon.  I called in the order which was ready for me when I arrived."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Chinese!  You won't be disappointed! Young motivated owner doing everything right on food and customer service.  I had the General Tso Chicken which was perfect. Pork fried rice was a nice side with it!!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here after reading all the reviews on living chandler. We drove all the way from Dobson and baseline to try this place out.  It was well worth the drive and the 20 Min wait for food. The lady at the register was extremely helpful and patience with our ordering.   We decided on the kids sweet and sour chicken -excellent and great portion for a kids meal. Chicken was perfectly crispy.  Beef lo main with rice noodles instead.  Very generous portion I would probably get 3 meals out of it.  Very flavorful.  Crab ragoons man they were huge and had a good amount of cream cheese. Chicken wings wow is all I can say sooo delicious. Some wing place need to learn a thing or two from them.  Very crispy very good flavor.  Lastly the veggie fried rice was a good portion and had chunks of veggies which was great as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food and easy to order online, ready for pick up at the time you select. Super convenient. They even allow special requests online"}
{"text":"We have found a few good items on the menu but we have had some duds,(hot and sour soup, beef with broccoli), too. Our expectations may have been too high based on the positive reviews that came out when they opened. It's convenient but not good enough to make a regular stop. Also can be a long wait even if ordering ahead and being given a time estimate. We were told 10-15 minutes and it was closer to 40. No apology. Just oh that Item takes long to cook. Well if it did then you should have told me 40 minutes and I have ordered that before, picked up in 10-15 minutes and it was ready. Don't make excuses just say sorry we misquoted we got busy!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent!  The food is very fresh, the decor is very nice and the owner was so friendly.  Will definitely go back to try other items.  I got the shrimp and vegetables in garlic sauce.  The egg rolls were good and crisp and the dumplings were tasty.  This is the best Chinese restaurant I have found in Chandler."}
{"text":"We went when it first opened and we were very disappointed. The rating that was on yelp was well over what I would have given it. It's a typical Chinese restaurant, but the food was bland and not flavorful. They messed up on our order twice... they ran out of one item and completely forgot another. Hopefully they will get all of their ducks in a row soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best addition to the Chandler community in years! They have great food, fast and friendly service and plethora of options to order. Since the grand opening it has been such a success that its been challenging for them to keep up with the demands, but I personally feel they are doing an excellent job!! If you have to wait a little longer then you are used to waiting for your food, please know it's absolutely worth every minute."}
{"text":"This has become our new go-to Chinese? place.  I know one of my friends thought it was bad, so maybe a ?question of preference? but we love it.    My go-to is the sweet and sour chicken.    Food is always ready super fast."}
{"text":"Did a take out order online, which was easy and fast. A few minutes later, they called to tell us it would be a little while longer because they ran out of brown rice, which was fine... glad they called and didn't just wait for us to show up. Food was well packaged... which I feel is important for a takeout place.  Now for the food... portions are generous. Great value for your dollar. The hot and sour soup and the meat dumplings were REALLY good, but the Szechuan chicken and sesame chicken were just ok. The meat and veggies were fresh and well prepared, but they lacked seasoning. The egg rolls were bland and not cooked through. Not sure if they use purple cabbage in the egg rolls, but the interior of the egg roll was a very strange, off putting color.  I think this place just needs time to iron out the kinks. We will be back to try other things."}
{"text":"We've had many people tell us about My House Chinese Cuisine. We went right at 6:00 one evening and the line was out the door! Good sign!  I ordered the Chicken Lo Mein that was delicious. It has a little bite at the end but could use a little more chicken in the bowl. My husband ordered Szechuan beef. He said is also had s little bite to it. We love that!  We will definitely be going back, but maybe on an off time and then just heat it up. It was packed!"}
{"text":"We've ordered take out a couple of times since they opened. I am very picky about Chinese food and it was delicious. We called after ordering on line to confirm the pick up time (about 20-30 minutes) and it was ready pretty close to arrival."}
{"text":"It was great !!!!!!   Fast, clean and egg foo yung had sauce like it should be....east coast style    Saw duck sauce packets"}
{"text":"The house fried rice we ordered used what I think was long-grained rice which to me is tasteless, dry and like chewing paper. Almost every Chinese place I go to uses some type of broken or short-grained rice that has flavor and chewiness, is moist, not dry.  The type of rice used is my biggest complaint. Other dishes can come with white rice which is better, but not fried rice. What do you think about their fried rice??"}
{"text":"The flavor of orange chicken was great but they use a very cheap meat that you can't even chew"}
{"text":"Picked up takeout last night. Tofu chow fun and chicken in spicy garlic sauce. My 3 yr old, my babysitter and I have all had diarrhea and cramping since. Was hoping it was a coincidence but we all had the same food. Really disappointed :("}
{"text":"Can you say...addicted!!  Best Chinese food in Arizona!!!  Everything I have ordered is good, prices are so reasonable and made fresh..."}
{"text":"If you miss New York style  Chinese cuisine, this is the NEWEST and honestly the best place to go in Chandler Arizona. We placed an online order at 4 PM, with a pick up at 6 PM. To my surprise and delight, we received a phone call from the restaurant asking if we would mind substituting an item they were out of. Kudos!  The last time we had food so delicious was in Hong Kong. We ordered egg drop soup, wonton soup, moo goo gai pan, roast pork lo mein, panfried dumplings, and fried rice, they were all amazing. The best however, are the eggrolls. They even make their duck sauce from scratch.  This New York girl and her family are excited to recommend My House without a doubt. Their menu is extensive, their prices are very reasonable, and the food is amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"One word.....\"Amazing Chinese Take Out\"......PF Chang Quality, but not PF Chang prices...we have tried it twice now ordering on line over 2 hours ahead of time and walked in/out with hot food to-go!  Extensive Menu options and super fresh 'hot' food.......  No one in the East Valley (Gilbert,Chandler,Queen Creek) compares......  Try it....you will NOT be sorry you did!  My House ROCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy this place. Excellent and freshly made food. Very clean restaurant with friendly service.  Only negative is that seating can be a challenge since it's a small space."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered take out and I was not disappointed! I ordered Kung Pao Chicken, chicken lo mein, orange chicken, egg rolls & house fried rice.  The food was fantastic- so far the best I've eaten in Chandler in the 10 1/2 + years we've lived here!!  Best of luck to the owners!"}
{"text":"We couldn't decide what to eat so we wanted to try them out since they're super close to our home.   We ordered the walnut shrimp, beef chow mein, Mongolian beef, and pork chow mein. The sauce for the walnut shrimp was good but I felt like they shouldn't have breaded the shrimp. If they just put the sauce right on the shrimp then it would've tasted better. All the other dishes were good.  I would probably come back to try some more items."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great prices. I love coming here after a long days work and boost my morale with any item on the menu. Hard to make recommendations on what to get when all the food is so good. Like their slogan says, it's a little place but it has huge taste."}
{"text":"Really tasty Chinese food, the chicken lo mein especially. Lots of great options and you really get a bang for your buck. Small seating space but I prefer takeout anyways. Not a great place if you're coming to sit down with a big family because of the limited seating. It's very clean and unlike most Chinese restaurants I've been too. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this place and their customer service is deplorable. The woman older woman who runs the register is absolutely rude. The portions on to-go orders are sized for children. Definitely not worth the price with so many other great Chinese restaurants in the area.  I wouldn't waste my time with this restaurant, Hong King Bistro has better food at a better value just to the south of this place. I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Placed order online, no problems. Went to pick up and within a couple of minutes, my order is ready. Cashier very pleasant. Egg rolls, thick and greasy. Crab Puffs average. Mi Shu pork pretty good, the pork strips were tasty. Overall, food was average, as was the price. They are convenient.  Nothing special here, but not bad, hence, 3 Stars."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I had the moo Shi vegetables that were served with plum sauce and pancakes. The owner gave me instructions how to properly reheat as there was so much left over. Everyone else at the table loved there food as well, including my 6yo who considered herself to be an expert at judging good Chinese food!"}
