{"text":"Went there on a chance after target place was closed, no named please but it was Spectators.  Had some great margaritas and chicken wings that were done perfect.  Ashley took very good care of us, went back yesterday and it was just as good.  Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Small portion sizes, food just ok, still old Beef O' Brady tables inside (tacky), and I didn't really get the Happy Hour vibe when I went in.  Friends of mine decided to do their FF draft there and I was surprised that no specials were offered for that, apparently it's time to switch venue's boys!!  Great location near the ball park with not many options since Wing Warehouse closed.  If they can get some rockin specials going then I can see this place making it."}
{"text":"the people that work here are among the rudest people ive met in my life. specifically, one girl with tattoos and glasses was the worst. she handed me my food with an unlit cigarette in her other hand. she was by far the rudest person here. i will never eat here again and would tell anyone the same."}
