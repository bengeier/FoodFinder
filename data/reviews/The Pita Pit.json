{"text":"I have been here a few times in the last 2 years or so always with a very pleasant experience. The food here tastes better than any other pita pit ive had including the one on campus at york. AND they always stufffff my pitas with everything. I went there tonight not long before closing, I had an annoying complicated order but the two people working were still so nice even though i was kinda snappy with them at first cause I had a bad night... Their patience and extra little things they do whenever i go there turned my night around! And the pita was amazing :D"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Pita Pit. Great pitas, friendly staff, consistent and delicious food. There's tons of space to eat-in. You can tell the staff really cares about getting everything right. The addition of veggies on the grill brings the quality a step above other fast food sandwich places. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I got a flier on my door and decided to try them on a Sunday afternoon. 

I read reviews about the parking and although I found a space, the lot was cramped.  I also read that they are understaffed.  But the staffing would have been adequate if it were not for the UTEP women's soccer team arriving just before I did. 

I ordered the Dagwood.  It was awesome.

It has the \"university\" feel."}
{"text":"Good portions and always fresh! The salads there are amazing and healthy. Also, love the fact they are with Ubereats - cannot get more convenient."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Champaign-Urbana. The pitas are amazing, the service is fast, and the employees are friendly. I see the owner working in there every time I go, and he is always happy and friendly. I hope they bring one to my home-town! Two thumbs up for the Pita Pit!"}
{"text":"Pita pit is great food, that is cooked right when you order it, so you know it's fresh. It's never too crowded, which is good for me, because that means I get the yumminess that is Pita Pit that much faster. :-) Lots of choices that are made to order. My favorite is the chicken Cesar pita. Delivery takes a little while, so it's best to pick up.  It's open late...I think until 3ish."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Pita Pit locations to grab food at a very reasonable price. The staff is VERY friendly, and very patient with your order. The owner is also extremely nice and pleasant. The franchise is always really clean and quiet. Perfect place to grab lunch in the area!!"}
{"text":"24 hours, delicious and a wide arrange of options. I wish I had tried this place earlier. I've tried many different options, and haven't been disappointed yet. I highly recommend this place for people who want to sit down and enjoy a healthy meal, or someone on the go. Very delicious and worth the price."}
{"text":"I'm usually a regular of Extreme Pita, but thought to give this place a try since I was in the neighbourhood. This place was not at all busy when I visited in the afternoons. When trying new places, I usually look for customers coming and going so I know that the food being served is fresh and that the business is doing well. This place on the other hand, was almost too quiet. Serving sizes of the meat fillings is on the small side   (imagine 2 tablespoons of chicken strips, max) and it was difficult to find the meat and flavour in amongst all the lettuce. Sauces aren't anything that you couldn't buy or make yourself. All in all, I woudn't come here again for atmosphere, service or the food."}
{"text":"Very fresh food and veggies. The pitas and salads are great. A very clean and well maintained place. Excellent customers serevice."}
{"text":"Great place! The service here is excellent! You cannot beat their Pita. Store is clean, bright, and well stocked. Nothing better than friendly staff to make your experience wonderful. Highly recommend this place for takeout, or eat in. No complaints."}
{"text":"This place is over-rated.  It's a place that opened up after my time, but I had heard great things about it and I tried it the last time I was there.  It was just like the \"2 star\" thing says... \"meh\".

I'm sure it does well with the student population down in school, cuz it's pretty fast and cheap.  But if you want real pita sandwiches, falafel and what not, come up to the Chicago-area and you'll love some of the stuff up here."}
{"text":"The best service with a smile! Best fresh wraps with a fresh variety of toppings. I really love the warm atmosphere at this location along with the great wraps. Healthy food on the go with a great friendly touch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I often come here for breakfast pitas before buying groceries from the Wal-Mart next-door. The people are always welcoming and friendly, and the food is delish. I highly reccommend the sausage sunrise!"}
{"text":"They have 24/7 delivery! And the food tastes awesome after a night out! First was introduced to this place after an night out in Flagstaff and it was the only place open in downtown after the bars closed. Found this location in Tempe and it is just as good as the one in Flag. Personally, I'm partial to the Philly Cheesesteak pita."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Pita Pit...in the last 3 days. I'm blown away by: 1. Options available for personalizing a meal 2. Awesome customer service. I have never had an option for a pita free pita, what does that mean? Essentially a low carb bowl with everything you would find in a pita...without the pita. I really love this place, it's a super healthy fresh takeout option and I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This is no doubt the BEST PITA PIT IN THE FRANCHISE!!!!

The cleanest, nicest, best franchise of all types of franchises I've ever been in.

The people who own and operate it are also some of the nicest people I have ever met.

The food is unbelievable. Made with care and served in generous servings.

GO HERE NOW! I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Pit. I used to eat at the one in Syracuse all the time. Unfortunately, this location has some serious issues. I called to order a pita for lunch today for delivery. I was put on hold for a couple minutes and then apparently the phone was picked up but no one was there to help me. So in the end, I wasted five minutes of my life listening to their employees take other people's orders and completely ignore that I was on the phone. I would have possibly gone in here or ordered from here again, but now that will not be the case. The management should teach their employees phone etiquette."}
{"text":"I love a pita that's done well and was satisfied with my visit to Pita Pit. I had a coupon for $5 for any pita, and got the falafel with all the toppings my heart desired. (So glad they have sprouts, Tzatziki and feta!) The portion was HUGE, ate the whole thing and was ready for a nap afterwards. The quality of ingredients were good and service speedy."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see the Pita Pit had reopened after being booted so ASU can continue its construction frenzy.

I had a gyro pita--authentic, I know. (Not). Friends had the roast beef and chicken crave. They thought they were okay, but I was really disappointed because the pitas were dry and ripped from being rolled. I also remembered the pitas have more in them and being better tasting overall.

I'm hoping that if I visit again, which I'm sure I will with it being across the street, they will have gotten over these grand opening jitters.

Oh, man, I hope so."}
{"text":"One of the better fast food experiences I've had. Fast service, very friendly staff, lots of seating. Great stop for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Love pita pit,, wish there were more around. Always found them filling, taste great, and worth the price. Chicken pita is my fav. Prepared in front of you and pretty healthy compared to most eat outs."}
{"text":"Best.drunk.food.ever.

I fell in love with Pita Pit as a student at Ohio State (we had one near campus) and when we moved out here last year, I thought I was going to have to break up with Pita Pit. But luckily, I didn't have to because there is one here! My husband and I have had it delivered to our apartment since it reopened and it was very quick and arrived about 20 minutes after we placed our order. On our walk home from Mill Avenue after watching the ASU-Georgia game at Tavern on Mill, I got a craving for Pita Pit and since we had to pass it to get home, we stopped in. We were the only customers, so service was so quick. I got the BLT pita (so original I know) and it was delicious as always, although I would have liked if they had cooked the bacon just a minute longer, but it was crispy so I was mostly happy. The pita was $5.95 which for the size is a fair price.

Since it's open until the wee hours of the morning, it's the perfect pit stop after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"The staff there was friendly, especially the guy assembling the pitas. I got the chicken breast pita and the chicken was grilled perfectly. They have a large selection of veggies and sauces to choose from. You can even add cheese to it. I didn't realize nor was it posted that pineapple was an option. It was an unpleasant discovery. Love pineapples... just not in a savory pita. I also wish they would heat up the pita bread. It is sort of weird biting into this rather cold pita and warm piece of chicken. It would make the pita more mailable and taste less dry. Including tax it was $6.19. It is fair value, not great. After a couple hours at the bar I was hungry again. Noticed on the way out that they are open 24 hours. I would definitely come back if I needed a relatively healthy fix after a night out."}
{"text":"We got it for work and everyone loved it. The ingredients are so fresh, you can add all kinds of toppings, and it's absolutely much cheaper than other salad places. For example with double meat and almost all the toppings plus extra cheese it was around $15. Which is the price for most regular salads at places like Freshii. The sauces were great and the steak was fresh. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Surprised this place isn't closed by now. Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back.

Their ingredients are not fresh, gyro meat tastes old and decrepit. They really need to hire better pita makers who don't resemble drug addicts and derelicts. My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me. Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to get a pita, but still pretty good. 
I usually get the caesar pita with chips and a drink.
The staff is USUALLY friendly. Every once in a while I'll come across a grump. However, when you're open 24 hours I don't expect you to always be chipper at the crack of dawn. 

They're usually pretty steady, not too busy, but definitely not slow. The atmosphere is okay for being located in a college town.
I hate their parking lot. 

Overall, though, I like Pita Pit."}
{"text":"The good: the hours here are fantastic. Stroll in at four in the morning? No problem. Here's a pita.

The bad: A long night of drinking + pita from the Pita Pit = Serious stomach issues. 

The indifferent: The food is ok but I've never been overly impressed. 

Final Verdict: Three and a half stars for effort. It ain't easy being open that late."}
{"text":"This place is a cool idea. Its like Subway for Pitas. Only, its like Subway for Pitas. 

The staff can be downright crotchety at times about what 'kind' of pita you are getting. There is also an issue with the staff knowing how to make a pita at times. I've watched them roll the pita with absolute horror at times! The pita is supposed to hold the food, not just be around it."}
{"text":"I am falling in love with this place. A friend gave me some buy one get one free cards for this 24/7 joint; yes I said it 24/7. A caveat to my review is that I love making my own food. Here at least I get to choose what is in it! The staff is very friendly and if you are a first timer they will help you create your masterpiece. But as I always say, spice up your life and be your own creator. Ingredients are ultra fresh and they have all the condiments you could want. Minus A1 :-) By the way it gets even better because they deliver!"}
{"text":"I never actually got to eat at this place, as they put a flier on my front door. I called to have some food delivered, during their hours of operation... No one ever answered the phone. Guess they must not need the business."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that everything about this place was HORRIBLE.

First we walk in to an empty dining room, to my right a homeless man watching TV, not that I have anything against homeless people it just kind of set a weird vibe. Then to the left a dog curled up on the floor. The whole order layout is confusing and it was hard to know where to go first. We stood around looking for some sort of sign from the people working there and then a guy walks behind the register and tells us he can help.
We order our pitas and then walk down toward the end of the counter again to add toppings. There is a girl walking around who seems bitchy and has scraggly hair wiping sweat off of her face. She proceeded to fill up the lettuce bins with un-gloved hands. Apparently she doesn't even know we have an order and asks us to tell her what we got. She starts cooking up the meat like normal. Then she comes over and asks me what I want inside. I tell her and she rips the pita open and shoves my condiments on carelessly. the Tadzhik looks like a cross between mayonnaise and sour cream. All of the veggies looked old and the counter was extremely dirty. She shoves the meat in after it is done and then wraps my pita up with her used gloves, I watched in horror and she shoved and pulled everything together.
 The worst part is when she hands me my food and says be careful eating it because the pita is brittle...
I will never go to this place again, it really needs to be shut down. The service is horrible and the conditions are nothing close to sanitary. NEVER eat here, horrible!

We ended up eating at Cheba Hut instead, should have gotten our money back."}
{"text":"I absolutely used to love coming here when I lived in the area. The owner was crazy nice and he always offered me new things to try. Quiet place, cozy and literally the perfect spot to eat and go. I wished I still lived around the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a late dinner delivery and decided on Pita Pit as it was already 9:45pm. I called the number twice and it just rang and rang. Third time someone finally picked up and I could barely hear her because their rap music was playing so loud. I ordered a Philly and a Caesar pita, a side of hummus and pita (enough to feed 2 people), and 2 cokes. The ordering itself took 10 minutes because the women couldn't hear me and didn't understand that I wanted Pita with nothing on it to dip into the sides of hummus!

45 minutes later (My friends home is only 1.3 miles away from Pita Pits location) a guy comes with \"our\" order. I close the door and realize I didn't get any drinks, but by then he'd sped off. I call back and explain that not only did we not get drinks, but upon further inspection we got cookies instead of extra pita! 

The guy had a thick mexican accent and didn't seem to understand what I was saying. Again there was music playing so loud in the background that I had to yell so he could hear me. He tells me they didn't charge me for the drinks so basically why should I care (at a total of 16.00 for two sandwiches, they obviously charged me for it). I tell him that I'd like the pita and drinks and he then mumbles \"shit\" while trying to find my order. he says there's no drinks on the order (I have a copy of the order that has my drinks and pita scribbled at the botom) but he can see if they can get the driver to come back.

He says he can't and that's when I go crazy. I work as a food delivery service dispatcher, so I know that its almost mandatory to send a driver back if they have forgotten something. I tell him this and he says \"no\". I then tell him when they DO bring my order that I want my money back for the horrible F*cking service. This man then tells me to watch my mouth and to \"not talk shit\" to him. I repeat that I will be getting my money back and if they don't come in a timely fashion that I'll drive down there and make a formal complaint. 

20 minutes later: no drinks, no pita. I call back and get a girl again. I explain who talked to me last and she goes \"that little f*cker I know who that was\". I'm again asked if I want them to bring our drinks (YES) and she puts the delivery man on. He explains that no one told him to make his way back down and that he will and it will be THIRTY MINUTES. I tell him we'll just come down cause that's too long to wait. He then tells me it'll be more like 10 and asks if I'm sure I want him to come by with just drinks (..YES). 

15 minutes later (midnight on the dot) I get my drinks and pita (1 pita..to share between 2 people) and he looked totally uninterested in apologizing for the 2 HOURS of bull. 

The food was good (who knows if they spit in anything because with the way they were acting its quite possible) but that part of the experience was totally trumped by the horrid customer service."}
{"text":"This PIta Pit is located on Brock Street just South of Dundas Street tucked in among a few stores. Note that parking for this location is on the street only and can be difficult, so parking on a side street is often the only option for days where Brock is busy.

My boyfriend and I come here a few times a month for a healthier option than most of the fast food that's available in Whitby. And the food is always great - Pita Pit is a place where you get high quality ingredients and a superb final product every single time. I've taken to getting a chicken breast pita with their ancho chipotle sauce and its TO DIE FOR. Tastiest pita ever! Another thing worth noting, like any other Pita Pit, you can get green peppers, onions and mushrooms on the grill. And after asking a few times whether they had sprouts (which at the time they did not) they've started carrying them again, which is awesome!

My only minor beef with this place is the management or the staff (not sure who is who). They're very detached and usually distracted, still very nice, but usually not too engaged. They're great at making subs, but the woman who's the owner has been less than happy every time that we've had her making our pitas. I'm not sure why but she often seems to be miserable. The last time we were there she seemed to be in better spirits so here's hoping that continues going forward.

Otherwise, this is location is bang on and you cannot go wrong getting some tasty pitas from here. Be sure to check out the random custom pita that they offer that's almost $15 with multiple cheeses, at least three meats and crazy sauces!"}
{"text":"This was my first Pita Pit stop--so to speak--so I don't have another to which to compare. However it was inviting and clean, the gentleman who prepared my food was very friendly and attentive, and the falafel was great (recommend the green olives, really gives it some extra flavor).

It definitely beats Quizno's (its rival across the parking lot)."}
{"text":"Seriously, this was my goto spot in college. They deliver late night which is really convenient if you are in the area. I live in Scottsdale now, so I am so incredibly  sad that I can't get delivery. I always get the chicken Caesar pita with diced tomatoes. They cook the chicken to perfection and you always get the perfect juiciness of the chicken combined with the crunch of the fresh romaine lettuce. I like to sauce it up with sriracha on every bite and it is...what's the word...DIVINE."}
{"text":"I love pita pit and was sooooo excited when I spotted this while having drinks at Barney's right next door. My eyes lit up when I saw the Pita Pit sign as I yelled \"PITTAAAA PIT!! WE'RE GOING THERE AFTER!!\" I ordered the BLT and of course, was extremely satisfied with my choice. They're open 24 hrs with the option of delivery! Does it get any better than that? But while munching on my delicious pita I realized that I would shortly be returning to orange county, Ca where Pita Pit does not exist.. I was moping and texting my boyfriend about how I wish we had one when he responded with \"there's one in newport, we'll go when you get back on sunday.\" Just imagine how ecstatic I was to receive such life-changing news!"}
{"text":"Yum I love their pitas but the service wasn't that great. They seem understaffed and could use some friendlier employees, possibly a female? The men I've encountered working there were rather short and unconversational. I'll go back, but I usually get my meal to go."}
{"text":"Chicken Shawarma looks nor tastes nothing like the real thing.   Ended up in the washroom after their sandwich. Never again."}
{"text":"Pretty straight-forward deal here.  Parking can be a bit tough, but what isn't around ASU. Food is good, reasonably priced and is made quickly. Plus they have 50% off everything on Fridays."}
{"text":"Best Pita Pit I've ever eaten at. Everything is extremely clean and the customer service is first class. I get the sense that the staff really value an all around positive experience for their customers. They always load up my pita with everything I like and it makes for a great little meal with lots of veggie options and various sauces. I always go for the spicy black bean (not that spicy) on a whole wheat pita, which is great for vegetarians or people like me who want more veggies in their life! I'm also a full time athlete and this place does a great job at curbing my hunger! I really don't have anything bad to say about this place. I always have a pleasant experience and walk out with a smile on my face!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch as my favourite spot(Triple Z)was closed;I really wanted to like this place as its so close to my work and the reviews are great, sadly I wont be going back.. had the chicken souvlaki and  although it was moist the flavor was bland, no zest of lemon, no zing from garlic..tasted like something I'd get from a hospital cafeteria ..I guess I was expecting something comparable to Extreme Pita who do an amazing  lemon souvlaki-ill go out of my way and stick with EP when I need my pita fix"}
{"text":"This place is set up like a Subway sandwich shop.  You pick what you want inside and they make the pita.

It's literally a sub sandwich minus the sub, plus the pita.

I didn't find the food good at all... but I am one who hates eating sub sandwiches (except for Italian Beef or Philly Cheesesteaks... but those are in their own class).

Two stars because it was clean and fine.  Had I known what to expect, I would not have eaten here."}
{"text":"I usually love pita pits. However, every time I try to give this location a second or third or fourth chance it disappoints. The employees do not know what they are doing. I had the guy making my pita ask me FOUR times what type of meat I wanted ( I was the only customer in the store) and I kept saying black bean veggie and to not cross-contaminate. Well then another customer comes in the store and he *accidently* gets some of their meat in my patty area, and also uses the same knife and spatula even though I kindly asked to use different ones. The pitas I get always fall apart and are a mess, the bread is always dry and they don't cover the vegetables. Oh- and as I was sitting on their patio outside trying to salvage the mess made of the pita, they were blasting music with awful obsecenities that seriously offended me. Talking about getting high and f*cking bitches with wet p*ssies.... seriously Pita Pit corporation needs to either close this location or fire everyone... oh and I didn't go in the middle of the night, I went around 2 p.m. 

I usually don't write bad reviews but my experience here was so, so awful. And this isn't just one experience, it is the culmination of about five bad experiences but this last one pushed me over the edge. I want to like pita pit....I used to like other Pita Pit's. But this location, the employees and their general disregard for ANYTHING serioulsy has soured me."}
