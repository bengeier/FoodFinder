{"text":"Food was good and the sweet potato tots were awesome.  I liked the atmosphere and the prices were very reasonable.  If I could do 3 1/2 stars, I would. But since I can't I bumped it up."}
{"text":"I happen to love BBQ ribs, and they had them on their \"specials\" menu. I'm a lightweight when it comes to spicy food. I mean pepper is too spicy for me. So I asked if they were spicy and was told it's a sweeter sauce. I asked if the meat was rubbed with a spicy mix. Was told that they weren't. But, they were a little bit too peppery for my taste. I liked the sweet potato tots. It made me feel like I'm making a healthier choice. LOL. We ate outside on the patio, probably the last chance this season. It is nicely blocked from Lee Road with evergreens, so very pleasant, other than the smokers out there. I will return and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual drink. Non-pretentious bar. The food was actually really good! And our waiter was quite pleasant and eager. Also, they brought us a giant bowl of candy for dessert. You had me at chocolate."}
{"text":"Clean, great service, great food. I wasn't sure about this place because it looks like a diner, yet has some really nice upgrades. Turns out that it's pretty great. The mac & cheese is delicious, the soup was excellent! She made me fresh coffee which wasn't bad considering I'm a coffee snob. The potato skins were ok."}
{"text":"Fun place. Watched a few a browns games here during the fall.  They have two dart boards too that we use sometimes when we go there"}
{"text":"We went today for the first time and tried the haddock and waffle fries. The fish was cooked perfectly. The fries had a nice crunch. The coleslaw was nice and creamy. Neither my husband and I were very hungry so we told the waitress we would be sharing and she actually separated the meal on separate plates for us. Much appreciated. Portion sizes were very good. I was on my lunch hour and we were in and out in 45 min, plenty of time to walk back to work. Excellent service! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I just had to do a review on a place where, in response to comment that the chips were out of a bag, the chef(?) comes to the table and says to spouse and I \"you want homemade fries? I got a potato...!\"  I said sure!....
Back now. This is an interesting place worth a visit. Basically a sports bar but with really good food and a respectable beer selection. Spouse had avocado  club. Chicken was moist. Avocado was fresh. Dressing was a tasty mayo based horseradish aioli garlic herb mix. 
I had portobello gyro. Firm fresh portobello and other mushrooms with cucumber in a tangy brown balsamic sauce. I thought the tzatziki sauce was redundant. Great with a Bells two hearted IPA. I said the beer list was good.
A fun finish was the bowl full of snack-size candy. It's a tradition 
My only complaint was a smelly bathroom. But the urinal has a shelf for your beer.
Thursday nights is \"geek trivia \" for you CWRU students. Note the jerseys on the wall the the memorial in the corner. 

And the chips? Awesome. Thin, crispy and tasteful. But you have to ask for Kelli (the owner) to get them. Tell'em I sent you."}
{"text":"Food: Some would call it bar food but it's actually a level above that! 

Parking: lots and street parking on Lee street

Bar: good cocktails and beer selection for typical night out. Also very cool staff that will make requests. 

Atmosphere: patio seating available. Big open room indoors that's fun for hanging out. 

Summary: I wouldn't take a girl here for a proposal but great for a Tinder drink date"}
{"text":"Great place, you still get an honest pint here for a good price and a decent menu. Draft selection could be a tad better, but the atmosphere is always good as is the service and bartenders."}
{"text":"Way over priced for the portions I got. Fried pickles was $7.50 and I got 9.... 9 pickle chips for $7.50??? I also got the loaded tater tots and that was an additional $3.50 for the loaded. $3.50 for some cheese sauce, ranch dressing and bacon pieces?! My bill was $20 for fried pickles and loaded tots. Ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and dinner. The newest and nicest bar on lee rd. They have great flat screen TVs all over. The draft selection is on par with the other bars on lee rd. They are vegan friendly! Amazing sweet potato tots and vegi wrap. Not as popular late night as some other bars on the street, but a very nice addition to the Bar scene on lee rd."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and nothing has really made it stand out or made it my first choice for Lee attractions. A friend and I stopped in for beers once. It was strange because everyone was crowded at the bar and the literally gigantic dining space was completely empty. My husband and I once got dinner here and it was just OK. I had a reuben that was normal. Nothing spectacular. Another time, we got an assortment of fried items and ate them on the patio. I would say that was probably the best experience because we weren't inside and the fried food was super delicious...because it was fried. 

I feel a little weird being inside this space. It's so cavernous and strange. I think I'll only come back for some patio beers and munchies."}
{"text":"This was my first visit with my wife and kids.  I felt like we got nickel & dimed for ordering off the standard menu. An extra $1 for this and that. Including an $0.75 up charge for my daughters BBQ sauce, and without being told.  It's not the money, it's the point if you ask me.

The food was fine given the price point, and the service was good.  My daughter has a gluten allergy and the staff was accommodating to ensure she could eat right.

Overall it's a standard Lee Road pub, and will fit in with the Tavern Company and Brennan's Colony."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Just had a steak ceasar salad that really exceeded my expectations. Looking around at what other customers are eating, it looks like the food here is very good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this place continues to impress me. At first I thought - just an attractive bar. Another visit unveiled their amazing sandwiches. Tonight I delved into the guilty pleasure of Chicken Fingers - good grief - they're actually real chicken made right here like everything else!
Bottom line: this is an excellent, clean neighborhood bar that actually serves high quality, natural food. Oh, and has excellent service."}
{"text":"4 Stars on the food.  Always very good.  Service is always great and they treat you like they appreciate your business which many places don't do these days."}
{"text":"I have eaten her 4 or 5 times the past two years and was usually disappointed with the food or service.  I had lunch there yesterday with two friends after discovering our first choice was closed, and was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent service we received and how good the food was.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed hands a few times over the years, and this time, I think they really got it right. 

Funny story; when we went there, we were seated at the back by an old gentleman who had a HUGE bowl of candy next to him. This puzzled us, so we finally asked him what the candy was all about. It turns out that the woman who owns the place, had been a friend of his for years, and she always brought him over candy when he visited. The candy was for sharing, so we got to have a piece or two as he regaled us on how the owner made cookies that were free for customers one day a week and how she also had memorials to local police officers in the place. It was heartwarming, and that was BEFORE we got food!

That alone was enough to endear me, but the overall feeling of the place was really good. The Grill is all in one big...well, HUGE room. No dividers between bar and eatery, but you don't need it.  The noise level is what you'd expect, but not too bad and may I say, the food was GREAT. You have options for all sorts of sides, foods (from pizza to great sandwiches,) drinks (full bar,) and the service was great. 

So, if you want a place with food, atmosphere and some HEART, get your fill at the New Heights Grill:)"}
{"text":"Happy Hour 11am-7pm

$1 off all Drafts

Excellent wings regular and boneless...

Awesome candy bowl after you eat."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick dinner on our way to a movie across the street and didn't really know what to expect.  We had, of course, scouted the menu a little bit online and knew that there were tons of sandwiches to choose from, but when we got here, the menu was much bigger than we thought!  Now, for a person as indecisive as I am, that leads to quite the conundrum... everything sounded delicious and I couldn't decide what to get.  

I actually ended up with the hotdog and tater tots after all my deliberation.  They won me over with the cheese on the dog and the pretzel bun.  The dog itself was huge! It came out toasty and covered in cheese sauce, and the bun really made it.  The tots were heaped onto the plate and were nice and crisp- nothing worse than a soggy tot!  

My friend got the buffalo chicken sandwich and licked her plate clean as well.  It smelled delicious and was definitely a great sized portion.

The service was really friendly and quick, and had we not been going to see a movie, I would have liked to stick around awhile, grab a drink, and watch a game on the numerous TV's throughout the place!  Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the food and atmosphere.  Probably my favorite place to eat on all of Lee rd."}
{"text":"Ok let's start with ten dollar appetizer nachos with beef. So cheese sauce really yes squirt cheese sauce and very little beef yuck.  Now entrees I ordered beef mash.   Well for 13.00 I felt I got robbed besides that was so salty couldn't taste anything else except freezer burnt taste. My girlfriend got California club  said same thing about her chicken and was dry.  So then my daughter got boneless wings she didn't like them either I tasted one tasted like they were dropped in deep fryer held in basket then dropped again warm them up taste grease flavored.  The only reason they didn't get one clean place good happy hour.  Service was suspect but one guy handling 4 tables and 12 people at bar.  He gets a pass was a nice guy."}
{"text":"Lovely place. Nice bar and service was great! I got the tuna wrap, which was delicious. Apparently Thursday is also cookie day so we got a plate of free cookies after our meal!"}
{"text":"Friendliest staff, amazing food... What more can you ask for?  They really have everything on their menu (and more) that you could ask for at a bar.
They often have creative Daily Specials too, which most bars in this area do not bother with."}
{"text":"Love coming here!!!! Every single staff member  is absolutely pleasant. Highly recommend supporting this local business!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in here for the first time and honestly, I'm absolutely unimpressed. We sat at the bar and it took 5 minutes and 3 bartenders looking at us to finally serve us. We get our drinks. Great. We're given menus and we're perusing them. We're asked after 5 minutes if we know what we want. We say not yet, we need a minute. 45 minutes later and we still haven't been asked a second time. We have it 15 more minutes after that. Needless to say we paid our tab and left. Never got a refill on our drinks and after being given menus and asked once, we were completely ignored. Not a great way to run a business. I did get to watch a bartender stock his bare fingers in a bucket of cherries and put them in the drinks he was making. Pretty gross, in my opinion. They get 2 stars because the menu looks reasonably priced with things that sound pretty good. It's a shame I didn't get a chance to try any of it. In the future pay attention to your customers. I most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say? Hmmmm... well, I have only been here once but so long as I am in the mood I will return. The place was clean and the waitress was kind enough to tell us that the mens restroom was being remodeled before stuffing our faces.

We all shared a starter of pretzels and cheese. Mmm
I had a turkey wrap with loaded tots. Double mmm
I tried chicken and waffles for the first time here. Triple mmm

Good food, good prices, large TV's for sports, comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great food.  nice place to chill out. Wings good and crispy, my wife's shrimp poboy delicouis"}
{"text":"This is a local hangout in the Cedar Lee area.  Nice selection of beers and mixed drinks.  Burgers, pizzas and sandwiches.  Appetizers, including fried pickles that are great.  Daily specials that are also good.  Portion size is good for the prices.  Service is friendly and attentive.  I'd give this a 3.5 star rating, but will round up because it is locally owned.  Nice local place to hang out."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome.  Great food, great staff, great owners, and great place to watch a game.  Also they have a giant bowl of candy that they pass around to each table.  You can't beat that because you don't have to pay for desert lol."}
{"text":"Any negative reviews on this place are total crap.  I eat lunch all over town (east and west side) daily... And the service and food at this place are nothing but above and beyond expectations.  Kelly the owner is phenomenal and more than accommodating.  Look, they clearly try hard...Hand battered chicken fingers, steaks for a (relatively) cheap lunch salad... All cooked perfect... I have nothing but love for this place."}
{"text":"Good food, service and drinks in a comfortable and clean setting.

Bartenders are very good and personable.  

The  Only con is an occasional cast of regulars that drink multiple shots in one sitting"}
{"text":"Can't rate food - but you can't beat a bar that brings out a bowl of candy to eat while you drink!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time there last night.  Although the menu is slightly limited, it covers all the pub food basics with quality, well made food.  Beer selection was great and the waitstaff was super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is OK, Nice selection of craft beers on draft/draught.  The food is pretty good, I feel the urgency can be kicked up a bit.  The bar tenders are either dry personalities or are just used to the local regulars."}
{"text":"Two words. Food poisoning. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner, wanting to try a new (to us) local spot. I ordered the chicken and waffles, he a Cuban sandwich. My waffle was deep fried--and that was not mentioned in the menu. Waffles are not meant to be deep fried, as they quickly absorb any liquid. We both tried a bite and now we are both regretting it. We don't plan on returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's nice to welcome another neighborhood pub to the Cedar-Lee area. While Lee Road might seem to be innundated with pub-grub options, I feel there's always room for one more, since regulars know each neighborhood joint has its own feel and culture. 

New Heights Grill is definitely a good fit for the 'hood; it's unpretentious, unassuming, affordable, and comfortable. I only visited the space once in its last iteration as a sushi restaurant, and was more familiar with its layout as an Arabica maybe 8 years ago. The new owners have done a great job redecorating the place. The layout is open and inviting.

We visited on a Friday night and the place was packed, which is a good sign, right? We snagged bar seats after a few minutes of hovering, and were pleased to note that the owner herself was working the bar. We recognized her from previous stints at other pubs in the neighborhood, and she was happy to chat for a few minutes. Actually, during the course of our meal she entertained a lot of well-wishers from around the neighborhood. Good signs that this place will get some traffic.

My first impression of the bar was that, at first glance, the hard liquor selection isn't much to write home about, if that's you're thing. But New Heights does have a decent wine and tap selection which more than makes up for anything else.

Food is reasonably priced and while there's nothing totally unusual or striking on the menu, there are a lot of good options available. It's basic burger-and-bar food fare, which is okay by me. I ordered a simple spinach salad and found it to be well-prepared and tasty. Those are generous adjectives for a spinach salad! 

And the sweet potato tots are pretty much amazing. Highly recommend those!"}
{"text":"Went here for an afternoon cocktail and to watch some Cavs playoff ball. Clean place with a good beer and good selection. Ordered an old fashioned. Wasn't the best one I've ever had, but boozy enough to not make me care. Got an ordered of boneless wings and onion rings. Let me just say: these wings were fantastic. They may have been up there with the best wings I've ever had.  Onion rings were crispy and the horseradish dipping sauce was good, not great.  Husband enjoyed his pizza burger. Will continue to patronize this local joint."}
{"text":"It is just a local bar, but a bar with an excellent menu and very good food.  My Cuban sandwich was the best I have had and I've had a few.  My son liked his food also.  Fried pickles- not so much, skip them."}
{"text":"TOTS. That is all I need say, but we all know I will say so much more... Delicious, crispy, covered and smothered, golden tots. Who doesn't love a mouthful of america's favorite fried cousin of the fry? This place not only has delicious traditional Americana tots, they have sweet potato tots. As if that wasn't enough, the added a whole slew of toppings and sauces to kick em' up a notch! 

Today I dove into a beautiful classic tot tossed in a garlic buffalo sauce served with blue cheese dressing. Bar-foodies beware, the appetizers at this newly established hot spot were fierce. We also dabbled in the panko-breaded fried dill pickle scene and I must admit... they were astoundingly more fabulous than I could have imagined. 

My friend and I shared the cheeseburger club and a buffalo chicken wrap. Both of the sandwiches were built-to-fill and tasty. The chicken in the wrap was also panko breaded, which bumps it to the top of my list for favorite local chicken. We both opted out of the fresh chips that come with and partook in the mac n' cheese instead. The M n' C was gooey and flavorful. I also give it a thumbs up based on the use of shells vs. traditional noodles. 

The staff was more than efficient and accommodating. Our beverages never went dry and our exceptionally high demands for condiments were all met. I would give our waitress a 5 out of 5 as far as friendliness goes, and her ability to keep my glass full should be commended. I truly do have camel-like tendencies. 
 

I give them a solid 4.5 out of 5 overall with only a little room to improve in the menu diversity category. There are certainly options that would meet everyone's needs, but I do like to see a larger scale menu. However, with this being a new Lee road staple, I am certain the menu will grow. 

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place for their big screen tvs and their happy hour! You want to watch the football game and drink some cheap beers! This is the place to go! The staff are really friendly and very nice. It is a welcoming bar and food place! The food is delicous as well! Their specials are really good! I love their wings and their burger with either tator tots or waffle fries! This is a really good place to go if you are around cleveland heighst!!!!:)"}
{"text":"Trivia here was fun. I've liked their sandwiches and beer selection. Good amount of tvs if you wanted to glance at a game every now and then. Seems like a good neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Service is terribly slow, food is OK. The staff cannot handle a near capacity crowd, not even close. Tis sad because the food is OK. Get it together and maybe it will be worth a return visit."}
