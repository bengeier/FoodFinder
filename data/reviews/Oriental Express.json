{"text":"The Chinese food is good & the sushi is made expertly & is fresh. There is a \"secret\" Korean menu; kimchi is also available. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My family LOVES this chinese food. We stop in every week and the food is always consistent and tasty! I'm not sure about the review that said the Lo Mein noodles are \"bland\"...we get shrimp Lo Mein every week and it is flavorful, saucy, & delicious! The amazing chicken is also a must-have.  In addition to the consistently good food and reasonable prices, the service is speedy and wonderful.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you're ever in the wexford area!"}
{"text":"Normally a fan, but last order of amazing chicken, not so amazing. Apparently someone spilled the red pepper flakes making it borderline difficult to consume. I've been pleased with this dish in the past and have never said \"light on the heat\". Hopefully I'll have better fortune next time."}
{"text":"Great food, fast delivery, friendly service. Their Hot & Sour Soup has the best balance between the hot and the sour of any I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"One of the cleanest and friendliest restaurants I have been to. The food is amazing (you must try amazing chicken and ginger shrimp) and they modify all of my orders specifically how I like them. They even let me pick and choose whatever veggies and sauces I want. Definitely the best take out in the north hills."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place I ordered the shrimp and broccoli plate with lo mein. The shirmp had no flavor and was submerged in what looked to be oily water . I decided to give this place another try and had their chicken teriyaki which is amazing. Their crab ragoons are phenomenal, and the lady their is so sweet. She is always complementing me :) My boyfriend is actually on his way to pick up our order :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place over 17 years now. They even deliver to my house!  I have been craving their food so much but i had no time to go. Now i can just order at home great foods!  Thank you Oriental Express!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. Pork lo mein was too syrupy and bland. Not sure if that's par for the course for the Chinese food around Pittsburgh, but regardless, I didn't think it warrants the 4 1/2 stars this place currently has."}
{"text":"My husband has been eating her since he was a child. This is our go to for mandarin and house chicken. So good. We live almost 2 hours away and make it a point to stop in when we're on this side of town to eat and say hello to the owners. Amazing people!"}
{"text":"Worst general so chicken ever. Didn't even save the leftovers! Over cooked to shoe leather! Bad enough we ordered pickup and it wasn't in the order. Had to hold dinner and go back to get it. Tastes like they found it and nuked it. Expensive mistake. Ginger chicken and greenbeans was way too garlicky. International chicken was ok but not worth the price. We need more chinese options in Franklin Park."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe how bad the food here tastes. Too much minced raw galic in their food. I'm the biggest garlic fan but this was just wrong. Probably last time ordering anything from here. Sorry for the negative review but is was bad.."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the exit door. This is the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten we ordered chicken fu-young not sure what we got could not eat it it tasted so bad. The pork fried rice was so bland I've never had anything quite like it and sesame chicken well let's just say the wife's on the way to the trash with the rest of everything. I will never set foot in this place again"}
{"text":"Food used to be very good but last few times has been hit or miss. Too bad because the good food was the only thing bringing us back, the HORRIBLE service would have kept us away without it. Now that the food is hit or miss it's not worth dealing with some of the worst service in the valley. Not only are the people unfriendly, rude, and disrespectful they make it seem like giving you some sweet and sour sauce will be the worst thing ever. Went in and ordered meals for four people including egg rolls, asked for sweet n sour sauce and was only allowed to have two little containers that equaled about 3 TBSP.  At this point I will go to places that don't treat the customers miserably, and where the people working don't seem miserable. If the people are that unhappy I can't help wondering what they are doing to my food."}
{"text":"The key word about Oriental Express is \"express\". You'll get your food quickly, and in styrofoam, bc they don't really care if you stay or not.   I only go for their jajangmyun, which is actually decent. It's better than Cafe Ga Hyang's jajangmyun by far. You can tell the noodles are fresh. The sauce could use a lil more meat, but it's not watered down.   There is an unpleasant sour smell when you walk in. I couldn't pinpoint it, but it certainly didn't make me want to stay any longer than necessary. It didn't used to smell like that, but it appears the restaurant is under new ownership, and they've let some things fall through the cracks.  I'd still come back but only for take out orders. They have a secret Korean menu that you should ask them about."}
{"text":"Stopped in and ordered to go.   Not sure about all the negative reviews? Being pregnant I am extremely sensitive to smells and braced myself after all the reviews. Walked in and was greeted by the owner. It is your typical take out spot, with the basic Chinese entrees however they also offer Sushi and Korean food as well.   I ordered the Chicken & Vegetables and the rice was perfection! Light and fluffy, almost sushi grade. You could eat it with soy sauce alone. Call ahead if you're ordering to go as they do take their time but the portions are generous and made to order.   I ended up staying to watch Judge Judy lol and chatted with the owner and the history of her place. If you need something to your liking they'll definitely accommodate!   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh. Food is delicious. Szechuan, Hunan, and Garlic sauce are all good.  The \"Diet\" sauce is a huge recommendation.  Similar to the Szechuan but with less-to-no sugar.  Goes great with veggies, chicken, shrimp, etc.  Owners really care, and can accept customizations.  I'm especially keen on their broccoli, bok choi, cabbage, bamboo shoots, brown rice & chicken.  Best Chinese around!"}
{"text":"On Friday I came to Oriental Express to have lunch, thinking it was just another normal fast Chinese joint. I was surprised to find plastered on their windows:  (which reads Chung-Hwa Roo - Chinese Food) ... Korean people! So I thought that I might be able to find some good Korean fare. Which I did, in part.  First, the restaurant itself was very clean, very organized. There were two very nice Korean ladies at the counter. One was apparently responsible for the sushi bar, and another was taking food orders. I was disappointed to find the amount of Korean fare very limited. The menu was chock full of the typical chinese dishes: rice plus meat plus sauce. On the specials board I did see the all important  (Bulkogi - Korean BBQ beef) - which I did order to go (due to the short lunch break at work). They did produce the dish very quickly (within 5 minutes or so)   So, the quality of the Bulkogi was a C. It was good, bona fide Bulkogi. It tasted pretty good. But it was average, nothing special. The rice was done well. I did admire their packaging though. They made a little aluminum foil bowl for the bulkogi itself so it didn't bleed into the rice (a very Korean and Japanese thing to do).  The overall grade is a C.   Breakdown: Food -      C            (See above)  Service -  B            Service was good and efficient. The ladies                                 behind the counter were very nice.   Demerits:  Average, typical \"Chinese\" menu, no real Korean food other than the Bulgogi."}
{"text":"A lack of reviews of Lin's Oriental Express is troubling, I sincerely hope this place receives the accreditation that it truly deserves. This is the best Asian budget cuisine I have eaten in my entire life. The prices here are extraordinarily reasonable for the quality they deliver. Anytime that I am not eating at this restaurant I am exersizing the willpower to not go for another day. Delicious general tso's sauce, hand breaded chicken, fresh vegetables and phenomenal daily made eggrolls. Quick, courteous service in a clean establishment that is situated in a convenient location with ample parking.  I would drive 25 minutes to get to this place. Quality and consistency should be rewarded and they absolutely excel in these areas."}
{"text":"Ga-ross!! I can't believe I just spent $30 here! Undercooked egg rolls, pathetic chicken lo mein and just shitty tasting food all around. I don't live anywhere near this place and I will never return."}
{"text":"Better than average Chinese take out. Very good service, quick prep time, large portions, flavorful and appropriately seasoned menu options! Convenient to the North Hills area, Cranberry TWP., and other locations near 910/79. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Monday Memorial Day) we called Oriental Express for take out. I ordered the Moo shu pork. It was very (hot) spicy. I couldn't eat it. I also ordered the Wonton soup. My wife ordered the Beef Broccoli and there was hardly any beef in the Beef & Broccoli. She said the egg roll that came with the dinner tasted nasty so she did not eat it.   This place serves just plain below average - average Chinese Food. As for quality,  sometimes well, you don't get what you pay for. Yet I was torn between giving it \"meh\" or \"A-OK\".  That's because their wonton soup is excellent.  So I rated the place 2 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is my all time favorite Chinese food. Timely delivery, fast pickup. I always get General tso chicken with fried rice and dumplings and they never disappoint. I'll have a lot of leftovers too. If you are looking for a smaller portion and cheaper price, they have good lunch specials."}
{"text":"I kind of like this place. Very clean, good service. I played it safe with some Teriyaki chicken and their chow mein special (shrimp, chicken, & beef), because my girlfriend and her kid think of Panda Express when they want Chinese food, but I got her to admit this food was better.   Also, for those who care, they don't use MSG."}
{"text":"The dining room is very sterile looking and restaurant furniture. So the ambiance is meh.  But it is CLEAN.  The lady at the front counter is very friendly and has NEVER messed up my order. I should know her name by now but I don't. My bad.  My food is always hot and out of all the times I have been there.. I have never been disappointed. My egg roll and crab rangoon are never over cooked.   It is not \"slap your mama in the face good\", but I would never do that anyways. I keep going back because it is consistently good...at least the Mandarin Hot Chicken which is pretty much my favorite dish there. I keep wanting to try the Bulgogi, but I just can't get leave without my Mandarin Hot Chicken.  Plus, I usually pick up dinner on the way home and she has Judge Judy on the TV. I love Judge Judy too!"}
{"text":"Paid 43.00 for a dinner, that was basically uneatable, asked for beef egg foo young and none in the dish to count at almost 8.00 alone with a bunch of semi-raw vegetables!!!!  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this food to anyone I actually lik!"}
{"text":"I only am giving two stars cause the service was amazing. very friendly staff and right on time. It's hard to find delivery options in Marshall so I was super excited that we were in their five mile radius. However, the bill came to almost $40 for just two people! Egg roll was additional 2.50 and we ordered the General tsos and pineapple chicken meals. My husband and I literally eat anything and we couldn't do this- we really tried though! The general tsos tasted like soy sauce and sesame oil. I'm not sure there was any chicken in it. Very leathery texture. The fried rice was also very bland. The chicken in my pineapple chicken looked like great quality chicken, but it was literally chicken (non breaded) with pineapple chunks in a watery broth. I hate to leave a review like this, but just hope no one else loses that much money for something not good. We had to go get food from somewhere else after adding an additional cost."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Chinese food ever!!! We had the Pepper Steak, Hunan Chicken, Egg Rolls and Steamed Dumplings. While the portions are generous, the egg rolls were mostly cabbage and the filling in the dumplings was undefinable. Pepper steak was cut totally wrong and Hunan chicken had little to no flavor. Will not"}
{"text":"Been going here for Mandarin Hot Chicken since the mid 90s. They've gone downhill in the last few years and food quality has suffered, but I still stop by for Mandarin Hot Chicken every once in awhile since I cant find it ANYWHERE else. Its hit or miss, sometimes good sometimes meh. I hope they get the problems under control, since its one of the few places in Phx that actually puts HEAT in their spicy food."}
{"text":"Meh. We ordered the lemon chicken and the orange chicken. We took the lemon chicken back because the sauce was very weak in flavor and had lots of clumps of a clear gelatin like substance. Even the overall appearance of it was not appealing. Kept the orange chicken and worked our way through it, although panda express has more flavorful orange chicken than this place.  A little weary though because you can tell they obviously use the same batch of chicken for all of the dishes, just drench them in different sauces. Since the lemon sauce wasn't as powerful as the orange sauce, you were able to taste the actual chicken better, and it doesn't taste like the freshest chicken.   Maybe it's all in our head since we decided to read reviews AFTER placing our order and while waiting for our food, but we definitely will not be giving this place a second shot. You're better off going elsewhere. Hopefully I don't end up spending the rest of my afternoon in the bathroom. Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and had the kung pao beef and house fried rice.  Veggies were crisp, sauce was great, beef was tough. A tenderizing hammer would have made a big difference.  House fried rice was decent enough, but not spectacular.  Service was great, really enjoyed chatting with the hostess.  Dining area was clean and well appointed.  Its good if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Seems like everything in the brown sauce tastes the same. ps. The term \"oriental\" sounds offensive... should be called Asian Express. -sad.panda, eating alone since 2013"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The rice noodles are tasty and the egg rolls are gigantic.   Clean environment, friendly/professional staff, and low prices--What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Meh, Oriental Express doesn't do it for me. Their vegetarian selection on the Chinese food menu is extremely limited and of that, they only have one dish with tofu.  I gave it another go recently for lunch, ordering up the 2 time mushroom with fried tofu. The tofu isn't breaded or particularly interesting, just cooked and then slathered in some dark sauce with mushrooms and a few other veggies. It's an okay dish and will work in a pinch of you like mushrooms.  The vegetable eggroll was just disappointing. Soggy exterior and not so great.  I will probably go back, just to try out there veggie \"sushi\" rolls, but I'll be going elsewhere for regular ol chino-american food."}
{"text":"The dumplings were very doughy.  The egg rolls were greasy.  The garlic chicken and lo mein were barely average.  This is my second attempt here and I wasn't satisfied either time.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Had the Korean Beef over white rice. What a great dish.   Thin sliced beef in a garlic brown sauce with onions and great taste, served with a side of white rice. NOTHING over the top nothing trying to be something it is not. Just good food."}
{"text":"Express indeed! - Express out of here.....  Not to say it was fast, but the food had a salty taste.  I like to keep it to a pinch, but I think they used the whole bag here.  I had some hot and sour soup and boy it was sour alright!  I also ordered the House Special CK - and that's when the saltiness hit me like a ton of bricks.  Wowza!   The place overall was not appealing to the eye.  I wasn't sure if I'd get sick after eating here, but luckily my immune system is strong enough not to get salt poisoning haha! - Good Luck and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"if i was realllllllllllly craving korean food, and this was the onnnnnnnnnnnnly place open, and i was riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight there, i'd eat here again.  otherwise, i'd pass, and go somewhere else (like, 7th st and bell).  the food isn't atrocious, it's just not THAT great, especially since the prices aren't anything special. it's nice for a quick fix. haven't tried the chinese food, but since the owners are korean, i'd stick with that menu. the sushi is decent, but again... nothing is really that good, although it is on the cheap side."}
{"text":"Oh dear lord no. My bar isn't that high for fast chinese food, and this place is by my house, but I'm not coming back. Tonight, we ordered lo mein, vegetable egg rolls, and ma po tofu (hold the beef). Our lo mein was similar to the picture posted - weirdly gray. 2 of the 4 egg rolls were fine, but the other 2 were white and powdery inside.  I didn't even know that was possible. They weren't cold, just powdery. The ma po tofu had beef (despite requesting none) and a hair.   Ew."}
{"text":"I was craving something last night and couldn't figure out what I wanted. I happened to stumble across this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered the house fried rice and some crab rangoon. Now the crab rangoon were pretty good and I was actually bummed that you only got four but it was only about $2.50 so I cannot complain too much. The fried rice was just ok. For it to be house friend rice, which comes with beef, chicken, pork and shrimp, I can understand not having alot of the shrimp but it didn't have much of anything. I mean it tasted ok, but I was hoping for a little bit more meat than there was. It was a quick meal considering I didn't really know what I wanted to eat anyway. I may give it another try and hope that it's a little better next time."}
{"text":"I ate here religiously from 2000 to 2012. It used to be excellent. It went south fast. I tried about a year ago. Bad. Today I thought I'd give it a try. Horrible. The chicken was unidentifiable. Wow. Really really bad. Maybe the worst food I have eaten in a public restaurant. Better to go to prison for a meal."}
{"text":"The best General Tso's chicken around.  We also enjoy the beef with green beans.  The best part is the option to have either white rice, or brown rice (for a $1 more).  Everything we have tried has had good flavor and is not greasy."}
{"text":"i was happy to stumble upon this place today. 2 entrees and soup for under $20 was reasonable, and the food was really quite good. the hot and sour was flavorful and full of all the stuff that makes hot and sour awesome. my husband's beef with broccoli was good. sauce would benefit from more flavor. veggies (carrots and broccoli) were bright, flavorful and not overcooked. my mongolian chicken was spicy, deep fried and tasty. i don't think they used all white meat chicken, but honestly it was too tasty for me to care. the entrees were served in generous portions. rice was well cooked and as a bonus each meal came with a crab puff and a fried wonton. snazzy! our take out bag was complete with plastic silverware,  a generous amount of soy sauce packets and fortune cookies. i'll be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted Chinese food and stopped here for the first time. Atmosphere: nothing about it other than the sign seems Chinese. Food: subpar: Kung po had a strange sauce that I've never encountered. It tasted like sweet chili. So spicy which is good, but that weird sweet taste that is bad."}
{"text":"I been to this place a few times over the past couple years. As a chef I go through cravings for some traditional Korean comfort food especially since I get sick of eating at my work and I cook all day for others I want someone to do the cooking for me. This place is usually open late so when i'm off work later it seems to be the only option. I always liked some of their dishes here before it changed.  When they changed owners the food was good for a little bit then as expected changed and was horrible now. Some of the dishes were over powered in onions or some other ingredient. The cook in the back should taste the sauce before sending it out.   I would go here again but i'm not in rush out the door for this place."}
{"text":"I had the Egg Flower soup and house fried rice.  The soup had water chestnuts, which I don't really like, but it had a nice flavorful peppery broth.  The fried rice was good, it had a few large chunks of beef, but was a little skimpy on the chicken and shrimp.  The prices were reasonable, about the same as any other Chinese food place.  They also have a Korean bbq menu and a sushi menu.  The resturant is a little ratty looking, but clean.  The lady that took my order was very nice.  The menu also states that they are completely MSG-free."}
{"text":"I wanted to revisit my previous post.  The service has improved greatly. I order lunch delivered several times a month and very pleased with the turn around. Not great Chinese, but good."}
{"text":"This was my my second and final time here. I really wanted to like this place. As I love any kind of Asian food.   My life partner warned me the first time we went here that all was not well. I know how things are supposed to taste having made my own Bulgogi from scratch.   The meat here has absolutely no flavor. I am not sure how you suck the flavor out of meat.   The last time I went here I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was yellow. Where did they get this unnatural color and why in my Mongolian beef. I do not appreciate coloring in my food especially if it isn't supposed to be that color. My boyfriend hated his food so much that he didn't finish. We will never be back."}
{"text":"I went to Oriental for lunch on a recent weekday with a family member who was in town.  I've been here 3-4 times previously, but it had been almost a year since my last visit.  There was a decent sized crowd when we ordered our takeout.  The wait based on the crowd size seemed a little bit long, but not horrible.  I ordered a side of crab rangoon (4 pieces) and a bowl of chicken fried rice.  The rangoon were great.  Nice and crispy, with a very flavorful filling on the inside...I'd say there was almost too much cream cheese filling...but how can that be a bad thing???  The chicken fried rice was ok.  Pretty sure that I've ordered this on previous visits.  One thing that I didn't remember (or maybe it has changed) was that there were bean sprouts in the meal.  Bleh.  I'm not a fan.  Luckily, they weren't too prevalent, but still, I did not like that.    Will I go to Oriental Express again?  Oh probably.  At the very least, the rangoon are quite good, and I do remember having some good chicken teriyaki there.  If I get the fried rice again, I'll have to remember to order without sprouts."}
{"text":"this is across the street from me..   UMMM it just looked scary and it looked like the food was out there forever and i was Not about to eat any of it. i walked in.. and walked out..   im a little bias though. ive lived in Korea and lived in Japan.. i know good \"Oriental\" food when i see it and ... this wasnt."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Asian restaurants in the area.   Although they have seating here,  it's more of a takeout or delivery type of restaurant.   I usually get takeout for dinner.     The food is always hot and fresh.  I usually order beef with broccoli and I love that they add bamboo shoots to the dish.  I always,  no matter what,  order the fried shrimp appetizer.   It's basically a (large)  shrimp wrapped in a single wonton wrapper and deep fried.   I've never seen this anywhere else.  I always dip them in the brown sauce that I get with my beef with broccoli dish. Yum!   I've also ordered the crab Rangoon appetizer before and they are also really good here.    If you order several dinners it can get a little pricey,  I recommend ordering the lunch or small size (it's still a lot of food)  and you can save some money.  Also,  if you join their rewards club you receive coupons in the mail.    Also,  I should note that I have ordered food for takeout numerous times and my orders have always been 100% accurate.   Nothing more frustrating than getting home and your order has missing or wrong items.    So far,  for the last 10+ years of ordering food here I have been completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Great chinese, best delivery in north hills. They even deliver to the Mt. Nebo area. Soup, egg rolls, general tso, amazing chicken, all great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chinese in the area. It's not your average Chinese carry-out. You can tell they use better ingredients and recipes. The staff is extremely nice. Affordable and delicious. I use this place as a comparison for any other Chinese food I eat around the Pittsburgh. I eat lunch here about once a week for lunch. The lunch specials run about $8-9 and I'm stuffed. I would definitely recommend this joint to anyone in the Wexford area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Solid three if not more. Sesame chicken is good. Love the crab rangoons. Not the best I have had but definitely solid! :) easy to get to and fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Two stars for the service (which was friendly and inviting), but that's about all they have going for them. While I'm thankful they guarded me against getting a food born illness by cooking the chicken absolutely to DEATH. Chicken jerky does not go well in Chinese food. The price is a bit high for the quality of food. That being said. You do get a lot. But if you're not happy with the food in the first place, you won't bother with the left overs so quantity doesn't make anyone feel better about the price you pay.  I did enjoy the chicken egg roll, would have been better had there actually been chicken in it. Fried rice was very bland. Well, you live and you learn! ?"}
{"text":"This is by far, hands down and without a doubt the worst food of any kind that I've ever seen at a restaurant.  I got the house chicken and it was bone dry.  It looked like they'd completely forgotten the sauce altogether.  I mentioned it to them when I was taking it back for a refund and she seemed to think that the sauce was now just under the chicken or had been absorbed by the rice.  I'd looked under the chicken and there was not one milimeter of sauce there.  I'd tried the small amount of rice that was browned by some substance and I could barely stomach it.  I have never in my life returned oriental food to the store before today.  Aside from the terrible food, the restaurant itself is a dive.  I will never consider eating here again."}
{"text":"Oriental Express is a good, yummy meal.  In my ongoing search for ul-mein, ccha-jiang mein, jjampong, and tangsu-yuk, Oriental Express has gook jjampong.  They confirm that they make ccha-jiang mein.  I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"The portions are huge, the sushi roll I got was delicious and had people in the restaurant talking, the lady in the front was awesome, I'd return in a heartbeat, located behind the shell on the corner of  union hills and 19th ave"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time. Had the Chicken with Broccoli and white rice Lunch. The chunks of chicken were grey/beige color. The Broccoli was crunchy. The sauce in the dish, had very little flavor....With such a vast menu, I wonder if it is just a hit and miss on certain dishes. There's to many Asian options in this town to ever repeat a bad place. Luckily, there are better places to venture to. It's sad, to crave Asian food & have a bad experience....Oh Well, live and learn."}
