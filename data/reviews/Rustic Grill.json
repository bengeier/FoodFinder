{"text":"Stonewater Golf Course finally has a terrific restaurant on the premises. The Rustic Grill is professionally run, and has a warm, friendly atmosphere in their dining room and patio for lunch , happy hour or dinner. My wife and I have tried almost everything on the menu over the last year, and everything they serve tastes great. Drinks are reasonable, and the food comes out hot and timely. Our favorites are the pistachio crusted trout for dinner, and the cajun trout sandwich on sourdough for lunch. Put the Rustic Grill on your to do list- you'll be happy you did!  Warren And Geri F"}

{"text":"Rustic Grill is such a great addition to highland heights! I absolutely love the renovations they did to improve Stonewater. The ambiance is relaxed, but you still feel like you're dining in a classy place. The food is so good! They offer something to please any palate. I highly recommend the trout, buffalo chicken salad, and the porkchop. The menu rotated seasonally, so you won't get bored! For cocktails they do a mean manhattan and the Pom Pom is so tasty and unique! Service is always great and quick. Don't be a fool, always order dessert. You will be in heaven!!"}
