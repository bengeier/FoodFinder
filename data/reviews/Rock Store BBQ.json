{"text":"Good bbq, but on more than 1 occasion they were out of ribs, today, no ribs and no hot sides... ;(  done rolling the dice, otherwise BBQ stores around that always have food...."}
{"text":"Not the best, and not the worst. Bbq Is a little dry for my taste, but sides are decent and price is right! Potato wedges are pretty good! So is the brunswick!If you wanna cheap lunch and don't wanna drive super far for bbq try here! 

FYI JB's in Waxhaw is worth a try if this place isn't your cup of tea!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place daily and after a year still have not stopped to give it a try until today. I tried both the pork and the brisket sandwiches with hush puppies. Neither was terrible but I was very underwhelmed. Both sandwiches were dry and the brisket was very tough like it had been sitting there all day drying out and getting hard. Sauces were also mediocre. Hush puppies were also dry."}
{"text":"Food is great, but the service gets them only 3 stars. Don't ask a question, if you don't want attitude. More personality from a robot. Good portion of pulled pork and beans, not much slaw though. Sauces are good."}
{"text":"Perfect BBQ. Perfect red slaw. Perfect cornbread. I loved this place, and look forward to returning! Not to mention, the delightful smell of good Q pleasantly greets you when you walk in the door. The downhome of it all was a treat."}
{"text":"PERFECT!  While adjusting from withdrawal from several types of cuisine after 2 years in the Bay Area, (but after spending most of our lives on this side of the Mississippi), we were optimistic that we could find great BBQ in NC.  We did.  As other reviewers have indicated, the pulled pork may seem a tad dry out of the cup - FOR SOME- it's MORE than made up for by the high quality of the super-tender meat and, once you add one of their SUBLIME sauces, that no longer matters.  Ribs are fall-off-the-bone wonderful.  They would be great dry - but add their rib sauce...:)  Coleslaw and banana pudding are great sides.  Sweet hushpuppies couldn't be better.  As is often the case with great homestyle food, the storefront may be offputting.  Hope that keeps it from becoming too popular.  We want to savor the quick turnaround at a new favorite.  Did I mention the GREAT service..."}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE Ordered 2 pounds of the beef total cost was $28.00. When I asked the guy to weigh it he blew me off and started telling me he was going to add extra BBQ sauce to my purchase. Unfortunately, I didn't persist. When I got home, I weighed it (see pic below) it came out to 1 pd 15 oz. I should have done a better job as a consumer and demanded them weigh it in front of me, because $28 is a lot of my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Awful! I stopped by to order 3 hot wing combos, 1 with potato wedges and 2 with cucumber and onion salad with 3 sweet teas without ice.  I get home and had 3 bbq sandwiches, 2 potato wedges, and 1 cucumber and onion salad and 3 sweet teas. I called them immediately and told them what happened and that I was already at home, but that I would come back out to get what I asked for. It was the same young lady who waited on me who answered the phone and apologized. When I get back there, a young man tells me that I ordered sandwiches. He wanted the sandwiches back, but I had not brought them with me when I returned. The young lady took my order down completely wrong and I was told that I would have to pay again to get my order. I gave them another chance after some time because they were ALWAYS out of wings. That was my last time. It is poor customer service when you are being accused of ordering something that you did not order. I can't make this stuff up.  Customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"Pork plate is fantastic! Get the hush puppies along with red slaw and cucumber salad. Super delish and reasonable priced!"}
{"text":"Excellent every time. Love the pulled chicken and the baked beans. 18 bucks for 2 platters, not bad!"}
