{"text":"I was here for the soft friends and family opening, so I didn't have to deal with the crowds and wait times. The food was fantastic, especially the fried cauliflower. Drink pours were generous and the panoramic views from the rooftop were great! This will be a popular spot for Knights and Panthers games."}
{"text":"We were very excited for this place to open, as we have friends who live next door at Circa. Their balcony overlooks the rooftop of GSP. We arrived this past Saturday night at about 6 pm and put our name in for a table of 7 for outside. We were told the rooftop could not accommodate a party that size so we opted for the patio; 30-40 minute wait. We got drinks and found seats near the bar to wait. My friend ordered a glass of one of the wine specials. She got her glass, an average, NORMAL white wine stemless glass, with a pour that was MAYBE 4 ounces. It was pathetic. When she asked the bartender about it, she was told it was a large wine glass. Bad customer service incident #1. After an hour + wait we again asked about our table. We were told the table was ready, but the kitchen was running 20-30 min behind, however no one told us. (#2). We finally got seated nearly 2 hours after we arrived. Our waiter was GREAT, he was most apologetic. Took our drink orders: my friend opted for the prosecco this time, stemless champagne flute arrived maybe half full. She said something to the waiter and he brought her an additional flute (FILLED) no charge. Food arrived in spurts. The Asian cauliflower was fabulous. Portions were decent; we weren't necessarily there for a big dinner. All in all not bad. I gave the rating a 3 because our experience was about a 2, but our waiter was a 5. I am hoping they will be able to work the opening kinks out, because we really enjoyed the vibe there."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to Graham St. pub today with all of my friends- I had seen wonderful pictures of the food on Charlotte Agenda, and was ready to chow down! However, the food took about an hour and a half to get to us- my boyfriend ordered a grilled cheese, which would have taken 5 minutes to make at home. Our friends received their food about 20 minutes before us. While the food was pretty good, it was very small and did not fill us up at all. I was still hungry when I left the restaurant. My friend ordered 3 sliders, which had appeared almost as big as a Bojangles chicken biscuit and with a nice buttery crust online. When they arrived 90 minutes after he ordered them, they were super tiny and burnt. The waiter was super nice and offered the whole table free beers to make up for the delay. However, I don't think management has hired enough staff in order to decrease wait time. I likely won't be coming back unless I hear that the portion sizes have increased and the wait time has gone down."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come to an open air rooftop pub and bar drinks were ok, however food service was not at all up to par. Sliders consisted of more bread than anything else cauliflower sliders had a single stem of cauliflower. All you saw was bread instead of slider contents, not to mention the 45-60 min wait for food, hopefully as this new pub continues to grow and learn it will improve #sadlyDissapoonted"}
{"text":"The waitress was nice and the drinks too.  However the wait time on the food is ridiculous.  Waiting over 30mins to 45mins is not cool.  I feel the best solution is to tell the paying customers the kitchen is behind before ordering.  This is not a restaurant for the food to take so long especially finger food at that.  Or maybe we're not as important like certain customers.  I will not order food ever again."}
{"text":"Views. Spirits. Entertaining. 

HANDS DOWN THE BEST VIEWS OF CHARLOTTES SKYLINE!

You gotta hit the side patio and rooftop bar for summer drinks, corn hole, and quality time with family and friends. 
Summer nights are magical on the roof with the 180 degree view of uptown. You get to see every building in the city, an array of lights and both stadiums - no other view like this in Charlotte. 

A lot of people have been saying the food was slow to hit the table or sub par - I didn't have that experience, but I also understand the difference between a restaurant and a bar/pub, so my expectations matched my experience, which was great. 

We went for drinks with friends and ordered a fresh things to split. We had one drink while we waited for our food. Enjoyed the setting, details in the decor and one another's company as we waiting. When our food came we were very please as we dug in! 

We had vegan taco with falafel, risotto and the peach champagne sorbet to round out the night! 

The wine, bear and cocktail list is long and full of everything you need! 

Go for the views and drinks! I imagine this place will be bumping around Knights and Panthers games; I know we will be there!!"}
