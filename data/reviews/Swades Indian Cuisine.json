{"text":"I love Dal Makhani which is flavourful, never tried any other dish coz I fell in love with dal makhani. :)"}
{"text":"This location, the food was okay but seating arrangement is funky and the smell in the restaurant didn't let me enjoy the decent food. It looks like they bring food from the location and not make it fresh here. I saw them carry in a bucket. Aesthetically this place is not pleasing. Barely above average take out place but don't know how they charge full scale restaurant price. Won't want to dish the establishment but they have to improve the place tremendously before I will return here.  Food: 3* Service:2* Decor: 1* Portions: 1* Price: high for such a establishment."}
{"text":"Not worth at all.....My wife and I had lunch there last month. Being a weekday there were only few people in the restaurant. Service was surprisingly slow for a slow day. There manager cum server was a very rude and arrogant person. he seemed confused...i guess he is a minimum wage salaried worker and may be that's the reason he does not takes his role seriously. Food was good and the credit will go to chef. I would request owner to change is front end staff and bring in some professionals. I will not be going there back ever...."}
{"text":"Had chicken biriyani today. The biriyani was too dry for me. Was really hard to eat it without any gravy. Also it was bit pricey. Paid close to $17 inclusive of tax."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely flawless! The best Indian food I've had! However, It is not a full sized restaurant. The interior resembles a small fast food takeout, not the most pleasing to the eye. My companion was none stop complaining about the condition of its interior. I didn't mind. The food was tasty and service friendly."}
{"text":"Food - 3 star Prices - 4 star Service - 1 star Location - 5 star   Location - It's located on Quuen's Quay near the harbourfront center. So the location is awesome. And that's the best thing about this restaurant.  Service - We visited here last night, reached around 9:45 PM (the opening hours are till 10:30 PM). We asked about the restaurant closing timings, they advised that kitchen closes at 10:30 PM but we may take till 11 PM to finish. So we ordered the food as soon as we sat. The food arrived at 10:15 PM. We ordered extra breads within 5 mins(at 10:20 pm) and they said the have shut down the tandoor and we can only have rice. We were upset as we asked about the closing time before stepping in; the server didn't ask if we wanted anything else. The service was non-existing.  Food - We ordered Dal Makhani which was flavourful but didn't have any salt in it. Once we added the salt ourselves it was good. Paneer Makhani tasted like tomato ketchup based gravy, not good at all. Naan and Tandoori parantha (breads) were very good. Rice accompanying the dishes was good too.  Prices - Food was very reasonably priced. Probably that's the reason they had to cheap out so much on the wait staff, as clearly the wait staff wasn't trained at all.  The Yonge street location is so much better."}
{"text":"I ordered Delivery***  Food was delicious! Loved the Garlic Naan, Butter Chicken and Mattar Paneer. Came with 2 rice as well, which i was not expecting. Food is a little creamy/restauranty but i guess thats why you order delivery."}
{"text":"This place was great when it first opened. I was a regular. It has gone downhill. I'm not sure what has changed. The food is now horrible, portions changed as well. Waiters were horrible, using disgusting rags that smelled worse than a full toilet to wipe tables. Very very gross."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst restaurant I've been to. Stay away at all costs. Dishes were dirty, tables and seating were filthy and the single main we ordered took over an hour to come to our table even though the restaurant was not busy. Maybe 5 or so take away orders were filled before our dish arrived. Talking to the waiter didn't help at all as he just kept coming up with excuses. We eventually just paid for our appetizers and left."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5 Service: -3/5  We waited for over an hour on a take out order, we checked on the order three times, each time being told 'just 2 more minutes'. A table came in 40 minutes after us and were served within 10 minutes. We waited another 10 minutes and FINALLY got our food (without an apology) and an offer of a can of coke... Terrible service, totally unapologetic."}
{"text":"I ordered vegan gluten free. Pretty sure there was yogurt in the mint chutney though.   Aloo gobi also had peas and fresh tomato which was nice. The flavour was mildly cinnamon-y, which is not my thing, but may be yours. The portion was small compared to every other Indian restaurant which explains why the other review found no potato in his order-- there's no room in the tiny portion so I ended up with 2 small pieces. Lots of onion bhaji, but holy cow, was it spicy! And greasy. I ordered the cooked not fried papad but it also came very greasy and not as crispy as should be.   They sent a free white rice. The take out via just eat arrived exactly on time. Overall: ok, but I won't order again."}
{"text":"I would have tried the food if they had properly held the reservation. Called for a reservation of 9 people a day prior to a colleague's birthday and when we showed up they had no recollection of it.  What a waste of time."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible restaurant, run extremely poorly. I place an order of Aloo Gobi and 1 naan for take out. I get home open up the container and realise there is not a single potato in the entire dish? I then return to the restaurant, and express that they are missing potatoes in a dish which contains the two main ingredients in the name. They then proceed to take the container to the kitchen and yell out to the cook (chef would be an overstatement) to add potatoes to the dish.   As each employee seems to be scrambling at this point, none of whom have apologised and i request a refund. They then proceed to hand me cash (even though i paid by credit card) and i leave. I then return home and realise of the $14.63 i paid, i had only been given $14.00 in return.... just perfect.  If this was the first error made by this restaurant i would have been more forgiving. However i live in the building above this restaurant and place order on a weekly basis. Each order is full of surprises none of which are pleasant."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent, the service however is horrible. I have been there three times (as it's close to work so I decided to give them a chance since lunch time can get busy everywhere) but even when it wasn't the service was horrible and slow. Got the wrong order. Then got random extra plates. No water. Then at the end we got the wrong bill (we were getting charged almost double what we should have) and instead of fixing it they just have us cash and said \"you guys can figure it out yourself as we are too busy"}
{"text":"The Staff were very accommodating to my special diet, this is a small, intimate space. Friendly wait staff! When our food arrived to our table I could tell the food was seasoned well and very fresh! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest - as a restaurant, Swades is not much to look at. Located on the ground level of a downtown concrete building, it contains a few plastic tables and chairs, a cooler with drinks, and not much else. Oh, except some pretty killer Indian food. Let that be a lesson to those who choose their dinner based on appearances.   My airbnb was literally steps from Swades, so hungry and travel-weary, I stumbled in for take-out. Best. Decision. Ever. The naan was flavorful and fluffy, and the saag paneer pretty much blew my socks off. The sauce was perfectly crafted, the spinach was fresh, and the paneer was squeaky, as good paneer should be.   An additional perk, for being located pretty much on the harbor in downtown Toronto, the prices are quite reasonable. Get you some Swades."}
{"text":"Seeing not much review here and not sure if I should give it a try, and I did.  Without regret, the curry taste quite good and the server are friendly.  I can ensure you can smell this restaurant from down the street, the curry smell attracts people into it.    The butter chicken is literally buttery, and moderately spicy.  I like their spice in it.  The lamb curry is tasty too, the meat is tender and the curry texture is just right."}
{"text":"Ordered the butter chicken, its like a tomato soup with chicken in it. The rice and the naan were fine. $20 incl tax for a very substandard meal. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I very rarely order blindly, without using my trusty Yelp app, but on this rare occasion, I'm glad I did just that. You see, the dine-in reviews here aren't so great, but the delivery feast my family enjoyed was fabulous.   We enjoyed samosas, mutter paneer, lamb vindaloo, butter chicken, garlic naan and rice. This is one of my most prized feasts in life, and Swades did not disappoint. Rich flavours, large portions and balanced spice. Vindaloo can be a lot for a girl from Nova Scotia, but they bring the sour heat without needing a gallon of milk."}
{"text":"I must admit i have had very bad experience here. The owner and the staff are very rude here and they should not be in this business. This restaurant should be out of business soon. They didn't gives us what we ordered and they were very rude when we asked about it. The waitor refused to split our bills on 2 occasions."}
