{"text":"Line up out the door which is pretty much the only reason don't get 5 stars. Line up went pretty fast, they also grill the meat after it's shaved & have signs everywhere with pricing for add ons & rules by the food & matey board about what the requirements are that you should expect from all Shawarma places. It was very clean & the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This place offers fantastic food. It's a little sloppy to eat but totally worth it. The staff could use some positivity though and some organization :-)"}
{"text":"Have to admit to having anxiously awaited the opening of The Desert Pita for quite some time.  Beyond your typical fast food options, there is not a lot around here to grab quickly at lunch - especially if you are looking to walk.

The Desert Pita is a welcome addition to this industrial area.  As well as being a new place, it is nice to have a new cuisine option as well - Lebanese!

There menu is varied.  Offering anything from little nibbles, to salads, pitas & full out platters of foods.  All the favorites are there - shawarmas, falafel, donairs, etc.

I checked it out on what must have been one of their opening days (balloons & flowers everywhere, with what I am assuming was the owner handing out free cans of pop to those ordering food.)

Service was quick & friendly.  Food all looked fresh.  Being a falafel lover, my decision was easy & I opted for a falafel pita.  However it was difficult to pass by all the other options as well.  Especially the grill, salad display (not to mention the baklava near the till!)  My falafel pita was made to order & then warmed up in a press. Definitely no complaints. Fresh & tasty. Just how I like it.

My lunch partner said that the chicken shawarma pita was most excellent as well. I enviously eyed all the donairs that passed me as well as we sat & ate.  The platters looked to be enormous (definitely more than I could eat!)

Was so happy with my new lunch option that I grabbed a menu to leave in the lunchroom at work.  I was thanked for taking one with me - nice touch!  I like a place where the staff make you feel good about visiting them."}
{"text":"Fresh food quickly prepared, great flavour! I usually order the large beef donair. I'm a big eater but the King beef donair is too big for me. Lunch hour is the busiest, so expect a lineup if you go then. Don't worry, it moves fast."}
{"text":"The food is only OK compared to other shawarma places. 
My complaint is I asked for a beef shawarma plate and they use donair meat instead of shawarma. I previously had the chicken plate and enjoyed it. 
I'll drive the extra 10 minutes to get real shawarma thanks."}
{"text":"The food was good! I ordered a beef donair, which I was very satisfied with. The meat was very flavourful and the pita was really soft and delicious. I got fresh veggies and a big portion of meat. I would come here again. The customer service was really good as well! The guy working the cash register was really friendly and gave my sister and I complimentary baklavas!"}
{"text":"Times are tough everywhere but they seem to be really skimping here. I have always liked this place, donair and shwarma tasty and fresh, but the last few times I have been here there hasn't been much meat. For approx $12 for a super with cheese fill the donair up! Still tastes good and good service."}
{"text":"Foods meh on a good day. Its the only donair in the area which is a plus but the old lady mangles what your about to eat with her man hands and yells at you and everyone within three blocks. If you're looking for a sloppy bland meal with a side of soup nazi, this is the place"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Fresh, good value and the place is immaculate!

I had a falafel pita and my husband had King beef donair.  Definitely get the garlic sauce (and sweet sauce).  

We will return and recommend without hesitation.  Extensive menu and lots of choices including salads and desserts.

Hope you check it out!!"}
