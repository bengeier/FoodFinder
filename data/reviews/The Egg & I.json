{"text":"Today was our second visit to 'The Egg I Am' on a Sunday. We arrived around 9:00AM and not a bad wait to be seated, 30 minutes. The complimentary coffee is a nice perk to have available while waiting. Once seated, it took 30 minutes for our food to arrive (during both visits). It has been over 6 weeks or more since they have been open and it is a shame that at both visits it took over 30 minutes for our food ticket, of just breakfast food. This is a lack of prep in the kitchen. Owners please take note and work on the kitchen staff to speed up the times. The apples in the apple pancake were raw. They fell out of the pancake. The eggs were great the first visit and were cooked just right. Today, the eggs were runny and were not hot. The bacon was cold too. I just do not see a 3rd visit in my future."}
{"text":"I've ordered take-out from this place four times.  The first two times were fine.  The second time they didn't make the order until I arrived and then it was totally wrong.  This morning I had a chance to observe the restaurant for a few minutes while waiting for my food and the management is poor.   The food is fine but I wouldn't expect much for service."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch place! I have a gluten allergy and they have a gluten free menu! My husband has a dairy allergy and they didn't have a menu but they were very helpful with that! The coffee is amazing to! The waitstaff is wonderful! I had a Wisconsin Scrambler and my husband had an avocado scrambler! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Staff is nice, friendly & helpful... coffee is hot & plentiful... prices were reasonable... food yummy! Restroom was kinda strange... shared with other local businesses in building... but kept clean..."}
{"text":"Gilbert needed a new venue to accommodate it's growing population and this place is spot on!!!  The menu is amazing- food choices are unique and tasty and at a decent price.  Staff is still new, but learning and have grown leaps and bounds since opening day.  Try the Cambridge Skillet to start!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times for breakfast and the food and service have been very good. Their Benedict's are very good and just the right amount of hollandaise sauce. Coffee is delish and they put a carafe on the table so you can refill at will. My only complaint is the ranch potatoes...both times I've had them they were way over salted, almost like the potatoes were soaked in a brine. I have one request...make the jalapeno cake benedicts that you had as a special in August a regular menu item!"}
{"text":"Great food, low cost, friendly staff-the strawberry banana pancakes rock!! Kid friendly!!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast there on a Saturday morning (sat outside).  It was busy, but the crowd was handled quickly and efficiently.  Server was great, attentive and prompt.  Food was impressive and arrived at our table in a timely fashion.  Although there is not much out that was as to a great b-fast joint, this place was great.  I would recommend and will return."}
{"text":"I was encouraged to see a breakfast spot open in SE Gilbert since we have so few, but after dining here today, I would drive 20 mins to a place I know serves hot, decent food. We waited 30 mins, not too bad. The server took a bit before she came to take our drink order. I ordered a skillet with no onions, she circled this on her order form to \"ensure she got it right.\"  The food took a while because \"the kitchen was backed up\" and when it finally came I had onions on top of and inside my skillet. When the skillet came out again, the eggs were barely cooked as I am sure they tried to rush the incorrect order. My husband's eggs benedict was cold, especially the hollandaise sauce. The most unappetizing part of this restaurant is all of the flys clinging to the walls and booth partitions, no fans, no air movement, lots of flys... disgusting. We will not return and we wasted $25."}
{"text":"Great Price, Great food.   Very clean, friendly and attentive service.  Be prepared to wait sunday morning."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened so there is a learning curve.  The food was good and the wait staff VERY friendly.  Will be returning."}
{"text":"After reading these reviews I was a bit scared to go but once I sat down and our food came I knew we made the right choice. I had the apple cinnamon pancake which was phenomenal and my friend had the ham and cheese omlette which was just as good as any omlette. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This will be one of our new regular stops! The food is truly amazing and great quality. The service is on point and everyone is really friendly!!  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"horrible breakfast. I ordered scrambled eggs and received what tasted like powdered eggs ! this is supposed to be a breakfast/brunch restaurant.   don't stop here !"}
{"text":"I loved it!!!  I was really surprised...  The portions are huge and tasted amazing.  I can't eat eggs (I know - what am I doing there right??) but I can eat pancakes, waffles...  I thought this would be another breakfast out eating the same thing BUT, they serve lunch for breakfast too - yay for me!! I had an awesome spinach salad with chicken, apple, cranberries, walnuts...  Breakfast salad : )  It was perfect.  My boyfriend had a skillet/scrambler thing and he said it was awesome.  Nice pieces of veggies, good amount of meat...  Service was wonderful!  (Don't miss this just because it's a chain!!)"}
{"text":"The best thing I can say about breakfast here was the food was average (at best). The service was absent until I finally asked if we might have menus. The hostess's attitude was indifferent but a waitress did eventually appear. The waitress was nice enough  but told us \"our waitress\" was busy. A look around showed less than half the tables occupied. There are several better restaurants for breakfast in the area and for the price. First and last trip to this Egg!"}
{"text":"20 minute wait in a Sunday at 11am- not too bad. Must mean food is good.  I got chicken egg white omelette with avocado & green chile with a side of fruit $9-huge & good Kids got rasberry granola pancakes with yogurt on top $6-incredible  Hubbie got Mexican burrito smothered in green pork sauce- $9 really great  Drank waters-$32 total with tip Service excellent  Will be back  ;)"}
{"text":"Tried this place on Sat.  It was packed but they still got our large group of 6 adults and 5 kids seated in about 20 mins.  The menu seemed great, lots of choices, I wanted to try everything on it and I will, eventually.  Everyone at our table loved their food.  I got the breakfast Croissant, I had them add bacon to it but I wish I would have had them add bacon and sausage to it, it was lacking in artery clogging delicious meat.  It was good though.  It did seem like the food took forever to get there but they were super busy and its a new restaurant so I'm sure they are getting the hang of things still.  Server was wonderful and kept checking on us and apologizing for the food taking a little longer then expected.  I will be going back and recommending it to our friends.  I would recommend trying to go on a week day though, may be a better experience."}
{"text":"What a difference a few months makes. Had a great breakfast meeting and the service was OUTSTANDING! Tentative, efficient, no waiting. The food was superb and the service matched the quality. I love a restaurant that responds to a complaint by making adjustments. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I've had a few good experiences here, but after a terrible one this morning I may not be back. My food came out wrong and had to be remade while my friends ate. A friend ordered a side that didn't come out until he'd reminded the waiter twice after the rest of the food came out. We got charged for two extra items we did not order. We approached the cashier to pay individually and tried to tell him one at a time what each of us had, and he clearly was not understanding what we were asking. The food is solid, but today's experience was far overshadowed by the blunders."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice, clean atmosphere. Not too busy, especially since Saturday brunch-time, were seated right away.  Good price and very friendly staff. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Have been here for breakfast several times, and the food is always very good. So is the service. Especially liked today's  special :eggs benedict with jalapeno corncake-please keep it on the menu!"}
{"text":"Wonderful  food, good service.  We went for breakfast, and can't wait to try lunch. The buttermilk pancakes are so light and flavorful- best around of any of the places we've tried. DH had the  Valley of the Sun omelette - delish!    The place was busy... waited about 15 minutes, but well worth it."}
{"text":"It's completely impersonal, it's packed on Saturday morning and the service is kinda awkward. My food tasted completely bland and nothing in it is home made or local. It's just fine."}
{"text":"Not the best but pretty good. I wouldn't make this place my fav rest but still ok with every once in a while. Not good service."}
{"text":"Owner is a jerk. I would not recommend this place to anyone whatsoever. There are plenty of other places to have breakfast in town."}
{"text":"Have been here several times, usually Saturday mornings (depending on the time you get there, you might have a slight wait, which is a positive indicator) and the food and service have always been very good bordering on the excellent if you are fortunate to have one of the 'veterans' be your server.   I usually get the garden frittata and it never disappoints, it always arrives hot and the veggies are fresh; the help is always friendly and the prices are absolutely fair in regards to the quality.  There is not an abundance of parking in this particular strip mall, so if you're meeting a group on a known busy (weekend) day, I would advise car-pooling.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Pancakes are massive!! But honestly it's quite expensive, and not really anything special. The location, however,  is good. It's close to home, so it's convenient."}
{"text":"The Egg & I is a staple in my girls Saturday breakfasts. I always order the Veggie Benedict on a croissant and it is a delight! They have staff that are fluent in ASL which is something I found amazing. You have to get there before 8:30 in the morning on Saturdays and Sundays or you can expect a wait but I find that it is worth it."}
{"text":"Service was good but the potatoes and biscuits were frozen. Fresh homemade biscuits and some hand cut potatoes would be nice."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  Clean,friendly,great service, obviously we'll managed.  The Parisienne Benedict is fantastic.  Returned in a few days for another.  This will be a must stop whenever in the area."}
{"text":"Don't order their burgers. Their staff is very under trained and will not make it correctly. Burnt or raw those are the options."}
{"text":"So cute. Good food. Super nice waitress. A little on the pricy side for being a breakfast/lunch place, but food is spot on."}
{"text":"We've tried this place a few times now for breakfast. HAILEY is an exceptional waitress!!! Offers great recommendations, and she was attentive without hovering. Very memorable first visit because of her. We told the girl on the register to let the manager know our compliments of Hailey. When you are lucky enough to find an employee with good work ethic these days -they need to be rewarded.   The Hikers Benedict and Farmers Hash was good... they know how to cook crisp bacon! enough to bring us back even though the rest of the wait staff was mediocre at best. One made us feel she hated her job and people -if she had been our first experience this review would be different and I doubt we'd be back.   The kale juice drink was good too - we wouldn't have ordered it if Hailey hadn't suggested it and offered a sample taste."}
{"text":"We were told there would be a 15 minute wait at 12:40 PM on 10/30/16. After 15 minutes we were told it would be another half hour. The manager blamed new employees working in the kitchen. Not the first time I've experienced poor service here."}
{"text":"The owner sent me a message and also called. She gave us a gift certificate and we went back yesterday. The food was great and the restaurant temperature was perfect. I would recommend it highly. ..."}
{"text":"Parfait looked good on menu, asked what the fresh fruit were...strawberry, melon, grapes with vanilla or raspberry yogurt.  No thanks ... Ordered the Belgium waffle...it was flatter than most and soggy in the middle.  Husbands eggs over easy were almost completely cooked.  Chairs are flat and hard, not comfortable.  OJ was good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! The club and turkey,  apple,  raisin croissant were incredible.  The homemade chicken corn chowder made my daughter want seconds!  My son ordered a burger off the kids menu and it was huge!  Overall. .. just moved here and this will be a regular stop for us! !!"}
{"text":"Took my 4 yr old for brunch yesterday, food was good, price was decent service was very good, but the man in the back screaming and yelling profanities actually scared my son to the point where he struggled to eat. If you take your kids ask to not sit by the kitchen. Food and service 4 stars, but had to give a 1 for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, garden frittata  was superb as well!  Juices are fresh squeezed and awesome. We will be coming here regularly for breakfast fr here on."}
{"text":"Our waiter 'Peso' was the best. The food was delicious and I highly recommend this place. Ask for Peso"}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant, and we won't be back. It took 45 minutes to get breakfast. Water glasses were not refilled, and we weren't asked if we wanted another pot of coffee. The potatoes were lukewarm/cold and hard as bricks. The egg dish was OK. My husband said his biscuits were hard. Not worth the time or money to return when better places are nearby."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place in south Gilbert. We've driven by several times and decided to check it out...happy we did. Food was tasty (Colorado jack scramble with real whole wheat toast) and service was great! It was jammin by 9:30 and around 30 people waiting outside. Definitely going back for future breakfast outings with no other decent options in the area."}
{"text":"Great little place to do for Sunday breakfast with the family.  Very nice servers,  ok food (it was barely warm) at a fair price, colored pencils instead of crayons for the kids. :). They also allowed me to charge my phone at the hostess desk.  2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for breakfast. I should have known by the bland interior decorating (and the fact I'd heard this was a chain) not to order the huevos rancheros, but I love them, so I couldn't stop myself.  It was a mistake.  The eggs (poached - my choice) were served on a flour tortilla placed inside a bowl. The dish wouldn't have worked without the bowl: it served to contain the third-of-an-inch lake of runny, jarred, not-made-fresh salsa that drowned the eggs, refried beans, and cheese that are normally the showcase of huevos rancheros.   I sent the dish back, and to save time, instead ordered one egg sunny side up and an english muffin. The english muffin came out sopping in a butter-like bright yellow substance. It was inedible as served.   On top of the disappointing food, the manager on duty was awkward and unprofessional. Instead of just apologizing for the huevos rancheros, he tried to get me to explain in great detail what was wrong with it, how huevos rancheros are supposed to be prepared, and how the waiter could have prepared me to receive their version more favorably. He returned to the table a few times during the meal, and during one of the returns interrupted our conversation just to chat about nothing in particular and to tell us some personal stories.   In good news, though, the egg served sunny side up was fine (though a little greasy for my taste), and my friend's waffle with berries on it looked like an average edible waffle.   If you're looking for fresh ingredients and an interesting menu, this is not the place for you. If you don't mind canned ingredients, a lot more grease than is necessary, and run-of-the-mill offerings, give this place a try."}
{"text":"People are friendly, food is good, atmosphere is relaxed. If they were to pay attention to tiny details, this would've been a 5* review. Either way, it's a favorite for my husband and I. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We tried this place today and got right in at lunch time on a Saturday. I wanted to really like this place, but the food was just OK. Nothing special and my food the eggs benedict didn't really have any flavor and my spouses's food the biscuits and gravy was a little spicy. For it just being OK, it was pricey for breakfast and the servers don't do much (they take your order and bring you water/drinks once because they also bring an extra pitcher of whatever you are drinking so you can refill your drinks yourself) so it's hard to want to tip the usual 20% that I do. The server or hostess wasn't exactly what I would call friendly, so just overall this place is OK and I don't think it's worth going again."}
{"text":"This past Saturday, my wife and I were looking for a new breakfast spot close to our new home when we found The Egg I Am.  We saw the line of people waiting outside and immediately made the connection that the food must be worth waiting for.  Wrong.  Nothing special here that sets this place above and apart from any other breakfast spot.  Our breakfast tasted fair enough but not worth the wait.  Or the price...Breakfast shouldn't cost a small fortune but somehow this place feels they can charge upwards of $10.00 a plate for nothing special!  The orange juice isn't even fresh squeezed!  The potatoes are frozen diced squares, which is unacceptable at this pricepoint.  Good thing the service was friendly or they would be getting only 1 star."}
{"text":"Fairly decent food depending on what you order.  Pancakes and waffles are delicious.  \"Crispy\" bacon never comes out crispy and I end up leaving 1/2 the piece of chewy fat on the plate.  Service is typically excellent.  One major irritation, and is a recent addition, is that you're no longer handed a receipt to write a tip on privately but asked verbally in the crowded waiting area how much you want to tip.  I don't know what their problem is, but seems like they're trying to guilt people into tipping more this way.  I tip well, especially at breakfast where meals are cheaper, but announcing to the world is not ok."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday, and not disappointed. The waitress was great and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Three of us stopped for breakfast. I had raisin bread french toast scrambled eggs and bacon. I love scrambled eggs. I left the majority of them on the plate. Why? They tasted wet and had no flavor. Made me think were scooped out of a warming tray in the kitchen. I did ask and she said the eggs are \"whipped\". She did go on to tell me that I could \"order your scrambled eggs anyway you want them.\" That is a first. Two small pieces of bacon that were burnt. French toast was good with the cinnamon butter. I looked at the ranch potatoes on my father-in-law's plate and they looked like they were scooped right out of a steamer.  Good food should have a nice smell to it when it is delivered. This did not. Over priced, slow service, food that tasted the furthest thing from fresh-made. Save your money and do not even stop. Drive on by as anything will be better than this restaurant."}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the servers are very nice and also helped me to make a great choice with suggestions from the menu. The lemonade is delicious and homemade,  not from the soda machine.  My whole family always enjoy having breakfast or lunch at Egg I am  !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I am a picky eater, and I tried 4 different entrées yesterday. The banana nut French toast was phenomenal even without syrup. The huevos rancheros was great. The fritada was excellent, and my sons waffle was exceptionally good. The price for four people with the quality of food was very nice. The service was excellent as well! I advise everyone within a 20-30 minute drive to try this place out.     On a side note their hazelnut coffee is better than ****bucks. They sell it by 6oz. Bags and I went home with some. I am not typically a big coffee drinker, but I love this stuff. I encourage you to try it, and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Perfect little home town cafe!! Fresh food, fast and friendly service. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We usually meet friends here when visiting up at UW, or surrounding area for bike rides. This time - the experience was horrible.  We were there with some family friends, kids, etc. Were seated, ordered, and... waited..... waited.... Finally - the kids pancakes come out - HARD and BURNED on the bottom,  We talk to the manager, and he got us another stack, while we are still waiting for our waffles, and the rest of the meals.  Then they come out.  One waffle order had a whole banana, and it had dark spots and inside.  Again we talked to the manager about the rotten banana, and he said it was fine, and to stop being so crabby about everything...  ok - DONE - we will never be back here after many years of our go to spot -"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Overall fantastic experience every time we visit. The Hiker's Egg Benedict was probably one of the best breakfast items I have ever had. Friendly service. Insides could use a revamp but maybe that is a matter of personal taste so we won't hold this against them ever."}
{"text":"I had the apple cinnamon pancakes. It might be because my dad makes the best apple pancakes in the world but they were not the fluffy pancakes with huge Apple chunks I was expecting. It had simply thin thin thiiiin slices of Apple and lots of oats. I would compare it to a pop tart almost. The eggs and bacon were super! I would come here again but want a different breakfast entrée."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for breakfast just before 9 a.m. The specials all sounded appetizing and at standard prices. However upon looking at the menu and questioning the waitress, I learned that almost all the potatoes contained in some fashion ranch seasoning. Not being that big a fan of ranch that eliminated most potato dishes. The benedicts we're vari3ed so I chose one off tradition with ham, bacon, tomato, and mushrooms. We both ordered coffee and I enjoyed the fact we received two separate carafes, one with her regular and one with my hazelnut. The food arrived shortly and all together. My benedict looked well put together and the pancake covered with powdered sugar and lemon curd looked very appetizing. However digging into my food I was not all that excited to discover refrigerator cold ham and lukewarm hollandaise sauce. The pancake for the kids was good and they enjoyed the lemon curd and fresh blueberries. We ate, the waitress came around twice more. My wife found the chopped steak on her food to be inedible due to texture. And one last criticism before I end. The bottom of my coffee carafe was burn as the coffee I poured became increasingly acidic. Food for reasonable price but not infallible by any measure."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service to. one of the best breakfast places I ate in the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"I will definitely be returning back to this restaurant. The food was very good my friend and I had breakfast. The server was on her toes and very polite, my coffee cup was never empty."}
{"text":"I went to breakfast this morning (Sunday). Restaurant was about 3/4 full when I got there so was able to get a booth right away. My daughter and I ordered right away and the waitress told us it wouldn't be too long. 20 minutes later we were still waiting for our food. The waitress never stopped to check on us. The food finally arrived and my simple request to skip the green peppers was ignored. 5 more minutes before the waitress checked on us to see how it was going. She didn't seem surprised or that concerned. She offered to replace it or just comp my dish. At that point, I asked for the check. No manager came by to apologize and while we were waiting, the table next to ours was getting replacement food so this must be a common occurrence. The waitress dropped my check off and I went up to the front to pay. The guy at the cashier never looked me in the eye and didn't say a word to me until he counted my change out and didn't say goodbye or anything else. I won't be coming back there again."}
{"text":"The menu is big which normally scares me because of complications in the kitchen, but the food was great! The steaks ares good cuts for breakfast steaks, the food was all hot when it arrived. The also give you a carafe of your drink or coffee so you can eat in peace. The owner visited out table and she was tuned in to our feedback. The only thing you need to remember is get there early! It was open for 2 weeks when we went. I was very happy with the experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent friendly service! Great variety of food and they have grits!!!"}
{"text":"This is a decent spot for breakfast and light lunch. French Toast, pancakes, and Belgian Waffles are all outstanding. Wheat toast is great. But I'm mixed about the eggs. There is an unusual taste to their scrambled eggs, as if they are made with rehydrated powder. The fried eggs are decent, though in my experience frequently overcooked. Biscuits and gravy has always been good, with a slightly stronger zest of spice than anywhere else around here. It's good but unexpected out of habit. Ask for a pitcher of water, otherwise you are left with a small glass of ice long before you're done eating. Paying at the counter on the way out slows the process down. I much prefer to have my server run the bill before I leave."}
{"text":"Pro's: we were seated quickly and the service was prompt despite being packed. The place is clean and cozy. Cons: The food was ok, nothing to write home about and a little expensive for what you get. If I can cook the same food at home the only reason I would visit this establishment is if I was hung over."}
{"text":"The only issue I have with Yelp is they don't have negative star ratings. I'm not typically harsh on these type of diners/cafes as you get what you pay for. It seemed like a cute place to eat, my food came out after about 25 min. and it was luke warm at best. I found what appeared to be a roach or some insect on my plate. The waitress quickly removed my plate and asked if I would like something else. The kitchen must be disgusting. No we will never return. If you have insects on your plate you have an infestation issue."}
{"text":"We eat here many a Sunday morning after church and every time we leave we are satisfied!!!!! The specials are always perfect for the holiday among us and the service is always great! We have this British lady we keep getting and she's great! She calls us all \"Love\" and she is sweet as can be! For my husbands birthday she brought out a muffin with fresh blueberries, whip cream and a candle! It was super sweet, yummy and thoughtful!!"}
{"text":"We are big breakfast people and the Egg I Am did not disappoint! The portions were a good size for the price, that's always a plus with breakfast food! The staff was friendly and our waiter was fantastic. The only negative thing is that they don't serve Dr Pepper! We will definitely be going again (I'll just stop for a polar pop on the way)!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, reasonable prices. Breakfast left nothing to be desired. Green Chile is awesome, must try not too spicy just good flavor.  Have only had breakfast there, wife says that lunch is just as good."}
{"text":"Great service.  Our favorite breakfast spot in the area.  Love the eggs benedict and vanilla coffee!"}
{"text":"worst service ever!! got in took awhile to get water and hot chocolate then she took our order and no one ever checked on us again.  after 25 minutes the sfaff started leaving (close to closing) our waitress left and I went up to ask what happened to our food.  the person then asked \"are you sure your order was put in?\"  I said I am not the waitress but she walked to the kitchen after taking our order...  she went to check and the manager came over and asked what the problem was.  told him and he said \"we will look into it\"  meanwhile they started vacumming next to our table and it was over 30 minutes and no customers where left.  she came back and said sorry they would start working on it and starting walking away.  I stopped her and said \"thats all?\"  she never told us how long it would take, what happened, no one offered to comp anything and no one stopped the girl vacuming and cleaning.  we got up and left.  never again.  DOESNT DESERVE ANY STARS!!  HOW DO YOU LEAVE CUSTOMERS SITTING FOR A TOTAL OF 45 MINUTES WHEN DONE WITHOUT CHECKING ON THEM AND WHERE IS THERE FOOD AND HOW DOES THE WAITRESS LEAVE WITHOUT TELLING SOMEONE ELSE WE ARE WAITING FOR FOOD!!  THE MANAGER DID NOT SEEM TO CARE AND WALKED AWAY WHEN THE OTHER WAITRESS CAME BACK WITH THE INFO.    CRAP!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, not anything special...especially not for the price! However, I would have rated it a 3 star had they been honest and forthcoming with me. I asked if I could substitute a pancake instead of the English muffin that came with the meal and the server said I could. He said nothing about any additional cost. However, when we got the bill there was an extra $4.30 charge!!!!!!!!!!! Is that not someting you think to mention?????? I feel like it was completely dishonest. I will probably never return."}
{"text":"Worst over priced food I have had in a long time. Every ingredient tasted cheap, clearly they buy the most inexpensive generic raw ingredients in a box or a can and then mark it up astronomically. The service was good, our waiter was polite and timely and the restaurant was clean but the food (the whole reason I was there) was just awful. Save your money and eat at home or elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was our first and last visit.  I ordered a club sandwich and asked for extra pickles and the waitress had to ask how much they will charge. Half a buck for one pickle spear... I'm not cheap but that's tacky nickel  and dime, oh I'm sorry half a buck. BS. Did I mention 25 min to get our meal when not that busy?"}
{"text":"We have been about 4 times and have never had an experience like some others on here who rated it a 1!  Almost everything we have ordered has been above average.  My Huvavo ranchera was perfect (maybe as a result of listening to the other commenter on this board).  On all 4 visits the service has been fast and friendly.    Definitely one of our favorite spots for breakfast."}
{"text":"The Egg I am is my favorite place for our usual Sunday morning brunch. The lines are long for a reason. Very clean with fast service. 90% of the wait staff is very knowledgeable of the menu and available options. Appreciate the outdoor coffee and water."}
{"text":"I still like Egg I Am but feel like the quality of food has suffered a bit over the last year. I visit about once a month and I feel like my meals have been more hit or miss lately. They've also removed my favorite breakfast dish, the Wild Mushroom Veggie Hash. Yesterday I ordered an omelette with hollandaise sauce and my wife ordered a dish similar to Eggs Benedict but on a croissant (don't recall the name) and we were both let down by our meals; the sauce just tasted off. The coffee is still fantastic and the service is still great. Hope to see the food get back to the quality that made this place a solid go-to for us."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. I wish the I could give separate reviews for both food and service. The food was exceptional as was the first visit. The service today killed the whole experience.  None of the servers seem to have a clue what was going on. My server in particular was just totally lost. The management was not any better than the regular servers. After waiting for coffee and tea refills we've finally asked a supervisor where is our phantom server to receive refills for our tea & coffee? She said they would be refilled right away. Well, the refills still never arrived & we did not ever see our server. Well after speaking and complaining to the supervisor we still not receiving our drink refills I called over the general manager and complained to her about the extremely poor service that we were receiving.  She informed me that \"she\" would be right back with the refills but she also never returned. Finally after consuming most of our breakfast we did get one of the refills but not the second one and that is only because we asked a different server who was walking by with a coffee pot to refill our coffee. Just as we were getting ready to leave we finally got our refills but now it was way too late. I finally flagged down our server and asked for my check and she gave it to me and I gave her my card immediately to pay so I wouldn't have to wait and I did not see it or her for another 10 minutes. The food is good but I don't think it's worth the bad service that they provided both times."}
{"text":"Great visit this week.  We were a party of 3 and each of us ordered something different including the kale and quinoa special, oatmeal pancake and avocado turkey melt.  All were very good.  Ample servings and two people took home another meal with leftovers. Our server was exceptionally good.  Long red haired young lady who was polite, efficient, fast and friendly.  I hope to have her again to serve us as she was very, very good.  Thanks for another outstanding meal and eating experience. This location is not really convenient to our family yet we are willing to travel for the results."}
{"text":"Sub-par omelets. Inattentive waitress. I would just avoid this place and eat at home if I were you."}
{"text":"Have been there many times and every time the food has been great.  The servers are always nice and you always get the feeling that it's my mom cooking in the kitchen .  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars b/c it is as good as it gets.  We've never been to a breakfast place that puts FRESH blueberries, raspberries and pineapple in their fruit cups.   My husband loves the Berry-ola steele cut oatmeal because of the fresh fruit.   We've been here several times for lunch and breakfast and we've always been happy with our selections.   We've always had cheerful, attentive servers no matter which one we get.  The coffee here is pretty decent too. Very nice clean interior.  http://www.theeggandirestaurants.com/egg_menu.html    I'm getting hungry just thinking about you Egg I Am!"}
{"text":"Simplistic yet delicious breakfast fare. By far the best biscuits and gravy I've had from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Always a good experience.  Great menu options and friendly service.  We've been coming here for about 3 years and it's been consistently great."}
{"text":"We had to wait 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us. When I asked for something quick for my 18 month old I was given some attitude, but everyone else seemed nice. Our food was good. The holiday specials were tasty. It's close and not too pricey. They didn't charge us for our baby's food which was nice."}
{"text":"New in the area.  Clean and good breakfast place.  The egg white omelet was delicious.  I will frequent this establishment.  Nice patio as well..."}
{"text":"Egg and I restaurant had wonderful  service, food was out fast. I had a spinach bacon omelet and liked the fact bacon was crumbled. My sister had frittata and liked it. They had a good kids menu also. Plenty of seating and no wait on Sunday at 930am."}
{"text":"Very good food. Had to wait 45 minutes, which I would never typically do, and it was worth the wait. Coffee was fantastic and the food was better!!"}
{"text":"Every Saturday morning the hubby and I have a breakfast date. We've pretty much tried all the new breakfast joints that have popped up in the area, but we keep returning to Egg & I. The food is fresh and delicious, and the service is great. What more can you want?"}
{"text":"Amazing food but slow service! The waiting staff seems to be moving extremely quick and trying but it did not seem like they were receiving any manager support from what I saw. The manager was jut standing there and not really doing a whole lot to help in the rush. He was just watching the staff and loved to insert a yell but as far as contributing, I saw nothing to support that. Waited about 45 minutes to receive food and ate in about 20 so the wait was bothersome."}
{"text":"The Egg & I had a very familiar breakfast atmosphere to that of say a Perkins.. At least at our location..the hosts weren't very efficient at communicating with each other, we weren't asked our name for the list of seating and there was confusion between the two who was going to be sat first.  For my entree, I chose the French toast with a side of eggs and sausage- which kinda reminded me of McDonald's egg and sausage side of a pancake platter-so it was hard to believe that everything was as fresh as they advertised. The French toast was pretty good though. My bf had the Mexican Skillet, we found it odd but comical that the Mexican Skillet, Santa Fe Huevos, and the Mexican omelette are all essentially the same thing. He was happy with it but not much variation when it comes to a zestier breakfast. I could see myself coming back here but not before some of the higher-rated breakfast/brunch places"}
{"text":"Horrible. We were seated then ignored with 5 people standing around. When a couple came in several minutes after us and immediately had their drink order taken we decided to leave and go eat at Village Inn, where the service and food are dependable and good! On the way out the door At Egg I Am one of the lazy 5 standing around told us to have a good day. Really? Last time I will stop at this location to eat."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at this restaurant at the suggestion of a local resident. I had the classic eggs Benedict. The bernaise sauce was delicious. The food was fresh with a clean taste. I would only have changed the muffin to one that was a little more robust."}
{"text":"Really deserves 3 1/2 stars. The menu has some creative choices.  They also have an extensive drink menu with mixed, non  alcoholic,  beverages , hand squeezed OJ and a good coffee selection.  The down point where I fault them is the service.  I've read in previous reviews and heard from friends that the service is lackluster. Not bad but not good.  Our server was nice but poorly trained.  We will be back but will visit Holstein Cafe in Oregon and Hubbard Ave Diner in Middleton more often."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for brunch last week. In Wichita we used to go to The Good Egg, and I thought these two restaurants must be in the same family of franchises - they're very similar - but they're not.  The Egg and I is in the same family as The Egg I Am..point being, it's a chain, so you can get this delicious food even outside of Madison!  Hooray!!  From the minute we walked in the door, service was attentive - the hostess, our waitress and the manager who came by to clear our plates. The food was egg-scellent (I sincerely apologize for that pun!!) I had a Parisian Benedict - eggs poached atop a croissant with mushrooms and Hollandaise.( I believe it comes with ham but I got mine without.) My husband got the Veggie Benedict and loved it. Both dished come with \"ranch potatoes\" - I don't like this potato side so can't really rate it but my husband declared it \"good.\" I also ordered a bowl of fresh fruit and it was the first time I've ordered this anywhere and had the fruit actually be fresh!! Strawberries, blueberries, cantaloupe, honeydew and pineapple. Delicious.  We were there at 11am on a Tuesday, and were not the only table there, but it certainly wasn't during the rush. I can't speak to their operation during their rush times, but will note that I've seen restaurants fall apart a bit in the down time. Not at the Egg and I - service was great, food was fantastic and the music was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Busy cafe with a friend vibe.  Beautiful outdoor patio.  The breakfast burrito was okay with the right balance of potato, pork, salsa, egg, fried onion and cheese.  It missed the bus of greatness by arriving barely warm to my table.  Iced coffee passed the test though."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for breakfast this morning. It was fairly busy, but we were seated within ten minutes. The service was excellent., as was the coffee. Our food was all done as ordered. The fresh fruit on the steel cut oatmeal was the most flavorful I have eaten in years. The only disappointment was there was no berry jam, only apple butter, grape jelly and orange marmalade. We definitely will return to this spot."}
{"text":"The Egg & I is a little breakfast restaurant that is comparable to \"The Good Egg\". The staff is polite and courteous. The food pretty good, but not outstanding. My wife had the Tuscan Scramble and I had the Parisian Benedict. My wife said that she wasn't as impressed with her meal as she expected. She said that all she could taste was the turkey, and couldn't even taste much of the eggs. I really enjoyed my eggs benedict and also really enjoyed the cubed potatoes that came on the side. The Egg & I has their own brand of hot sauce that I added to my potatoes and it was hot. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by before 7am on a weekday so it was blissfully empty. Service was friendly and prompt. We got coffee right away, and it tasted pretty good. We got actual creamer instead of those plastic cups of half and half so extra points for that.  I was pleasantly surprised by my veggie benedict. There were lots of my favorites veggies like artichokes and asparagus under my poached eggs, and the hollandaise had a good tangy flavor. My husband was satisfied with his biscuits and gravy, but we was wishing for more sausage.  Special thanks to the waitress who mistook my long-haired husband for a woman. I love a good belly laugh that early in the morning."}
{"text":"Just had a terrific breakfast, and our waitress Janae was outstanding. Love this place. Always clean and good is always very good. I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've seen this place from the Beltline but never had the opportunity to stop.  Today I had to get an oil change nearby and took advantage of proximity.    We were warmly greeted and seated immediately.  A comfortable booth, well lit and clean.  My dining companion needed to use the facilities and remarked that the were high end!     Our server came promptly, was smiling and very pleasant.  Our order was taken, beverages arrived shortly and food soon followed.  I had the corned beef hash and poached eggs.  My companion had a avocado/chicken omelette with salsa and fresh fruit.    The only negative is the coffee; typical diner quality, but with all the good roasters in Madison, it would have been nice to have a quality cup.     So, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Been here twice and we will become regulars for sure! Last weekend we tried the seasonal Pumpkin waffle and it was AMAZING! Service is always great and everything we've tried from the menu has been delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few time with a friend and recently started bringing my husband and our infant. The service is consistently good and the food is delicious. I love the chocolate chip pancake and that it comes with an egg and bacon/sausage. I prefer the bacon and theirs is nice and crispy. My husband tried one of their fresh juices last time and enjoyed that as well. We are definitely keeping The Egg & I on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"The service was very good, the food, well,  it wasn't so good. The potatoes were very salty, almost like too much season salt. For as fast as our breakfast came out, it was lukewarm at best, my eggs were good, everything else was salty, due to potatoes I believe. My wife's eggs were really wet for scrambled eggs. I have eaten here a few times before and everything was really good, something happened. Too bad, it's close to home and usually not crowded, time to find somewhere else"}
{"text":"The breakfast took a long time but when it finally did it was good! But a little pricey for eggs and bacon!"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty.  They do a better than averagejob with flavor.  Food and ambiance are plated and set up as you'd expect at a franchise type diner.  Food section led on white plates.  White coffee mugs.  Paper napkins.  Portions are average to below average in size but fill the belly.  Scrambled eggs are fluffy.  Raisin toast was great.  Grits were made to an excellent texture (not runny or clumpy).  Wisconsin scramble with cheese, tomato, and asparagus was very good.   The kids french toast meal was perfect for our 18 month old.  Ambiance is nice.  The Patio is a quiet and pleasing area.    Service was pleasant and timely.  Overall, this is a nice little breakfast place scoring above average due to the taste of the food."}
{"text":"I might have had the best omelet ever! The bacon, mushroom, spinach, Swiss without the hollandaise, was wonderful!  The seasoned potatoes are great too. Glad I didn't listen to the other poor reviews!"}
{"text":"Not anything special. Food wasn't too bad service was good. I would have rather gone to my ultimate favorite place The Gilbert House!"}
{"text":"Wrong order taken.. Ok- mistakes happen. But please don't tell me what I ordered was wrong. Trying to make it right- they put in original order. But took 10-15 minutes to get- while my dining partner finished, visited with friends, and went to eldest room. Really?  You can't put an order in and expedite?  To add to it- waiter insisted he was right. Um. No  Manager very respectful and appropriate- she was great.  Not worth wait- food and service was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Breakfast offerings here are plentiful and delicious.  I had the fresh spinach, bacon, and mushroom omelette that was outstanding.  My friend had raspberry and granola pancake that she raved about.  Potatoes were a touch too salty.  Will definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"I was invited back to the Egg and I today to update my review.  As an account execurive by trade, I appreciated their persistence.... so here we go- Round 2:  As soon as I arrived the manager was waiting to open the door for me.  He brought out a sample the much reviled hollandaise that inspired my last review.  It still isn't quite as good as homemade, but it was MUCH better, lemony and entirely edible.    The service was fast wnd attentive. I would have thought it was for my benefit, but all the tables seemed well attended.  Our coffee came with fresh cream and a whole carafe. I ordered the regular I ordered seemed good enough, but my husband's hazelnut had a mildly off putting burnt flavor to it.  All and all passable coffee to go with a breakfast, but not  quite cravable, but that's not their specialty.    My children order the blueberry lemon curd pancake combo with turkey sausage and scrambled eggs to split between them.  The waitress brought the syrup and extra plate ahead of the food without being asked.  So far so good.    They had fresh blueberries on the pancake and the portion was generous.  I had a steak scramble.  It was good and bad.b Good:  potatoes crisp and not too ranchy.  Eggs perfectly cooked.  Cremini and bell pepper fresh. The toast was crunchy, but not too cruchy and not over buttered. Bad: what was advertised as steak, was more like chopped philly cheese steak.  I asked if they cooked a fresh steak for the dish... they said yes, but i dont believe that to be true.  I took the steak home for the dog.  My husband ordered the hunters benedict.  Again 50/50.  Im kosher so i couldnt taste it.  But my husband reports that the muffin was good, the eggs great again, the bacon good, but the ham was refrigerator cold and salad he said tasted unwashed.  All and all an improvement increase from 2 to 3 stars- if you are looking for good eggs or are a vegetarian then this place is fairly eggscalent and the service left absolutely nothing to be desired, but the meat was odd.  So overall hit and miss..... but i may be back to  try one of their strictly vegetarian dishes.          They have wi-fi."}
{"text":"I would say good but not great. Ordered pancakes but had to flag down a server to get syrup. Worth a trip really. I'll go back. Staff is friendly but seems a bit stressed with the crowded conditions on weekends. Good coffee."}
{"text":"I've been to The Egg and I twice in the past two weeks. Conveniently located near Kayser Ford Lincoln, I've been able to have breakfast there while my car is serviced. Both times, my waitresses have been friendly, the service quick, and the food generally quite tasty (with a couple of minor exceptions.)  On my first visit I had the Spicy Pear juice, an iced-tea, and the Parisian Benedict. The Spicy Pear juice is delicious and I highly recommend it. Pear, tangerine, lemon, ginger, agave and jalapeño. It's really zesty, not hot, and I can't get enough of it. The Parisian Benedict included mushrooms and Swiss cheese. The creamy hollandaise was exactly the perfect consistency. It came with a side of fresh greens with just the right amount of a light balsamic vinaigrette. I was really impressed with this dish. I loved everything about it. The only downside to that meal was the iced-tea. It tasted stale and flat.  On my second visit I again had the Spicy Pear juice. This time I ordered the biscuit, eggs and gravy. The biscuit and gravy were heavenly. Thick, creamy, flavorful sausage gravy over yummy biscuits. Loved this. However, it was served with seasoned ranch potatoes. These were a miss. The potatoes were just warm, needed to be cooked longer, and really didn't have much flavor. I was able to add some zest with the hot-sauce at the table. Next time, I would ask if I could get the greens instead of the potatoes.  The poached eggs were slightly overcooked, not the viscous liquid they should be.   Nevertheless, the dishes which were good were very good. With the friendly service, the speedy delivery, the free wifi, and the convenient location I am sure to be back."}
{"text":"I was in Madison for the weekend, and needed to fill up stomach.  My friend suggested here as it was close to where I was staying.  It's not an obvious place to find as it's part of a commercial building with other offices.    This place must be popular with the locals as it the parking lot was packed.  Inside it looks like one of those family restaurants in a town of 200 people...it felt homey, but upscale.  Since this in Madison, the prices are higher but the food was really good.    I have a hard time turning down crab cakes, and I got the crab cakes benedict with two poached eggs...magnificento! The side of greens was great...whatever dressing they used just hit the spot."}
{"text":"I went in to have breakfast with my son. Right away we were greeted and sat by the friendly host.   As soon as I sat down my server greeted us at the table I ordered the citrus cooler it was very refreshing.  My son and I ordered the Raisin cinnamon french toast. Our server suggested cheese on my scrambled eggs and I went ahead and ordered it with spinach also. The french toast also comes with your choice of meat we got ham. Everything was great. French toast was really moist and it had cinnamon butter! Eggs were too runny for my liking but Ill know to order well done for next time.   Everyone in the restaurant is so friendly!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and the food is very good. Had the Mexican skillet most recently and it was a very good breakfast dish. The food is great and the portions are huge.   The only reason they got 3 stars is the staff was not the most competent. A couple of them were rude. The manager seemed irritated when we asked for a couple of the outdoor heaters to be turned on. Apparently they were \"broken\" according to staff, however they were just out of propane. FILL YOUR TANKS.  When our checks were brought back after the cards were ran, the guy stood there and waited for us to sign them (weird). I asked him if I could have a couple minutes as we were just finishing up, he said sure, took one step backward, and smiled at me, standing 36 inches from where he was before. The grin on his face suggested he hadn't a clue. He sat there until we signed. BACK OFF. Give the customers a chance to sign their bill without hovering. You weren't in need of our table because nobody else was on the patio.   Overall the food is great, but the staff leaves something to be desired. Fill your propane tanks and don't hover."}
{"text":"On a recent Sunday morning around 8:00 AM, I went here for breakfast with my wife and two young children.  They were busy, as expected at this time of day, but not full.  We were seated right away and there were several other empty tables.  The hostess quickly brought a high chair, kids menu and colors. The waitress came quickly and took our drink order.    Everything went fine until it took seemingly forever to get our food.  We watched as two other tables (one also a family) received their food before us even though they were seated and ordered well after us.  Our waitress kept stopping by and telling us that ours should be ready \"any minute\". Finally I pointed out the other two tables and within a minute she brought our food.  However, my omelette was warm at best and my hash browns were cold.  My wife's French Toast was cold as well.  My omelette was also flat, think more like a fried egg texture instead of a thicker almost fluffy omelette as one would normally expect.    So it was a disappointing experience because this seems like a nice place and it is close to us.  Hopefully our experience was an exception so we will try it once more, but this experience was unsatisfactory due to food quality and timeliness of service."}
{"text":"Thank you The Egg I Am for a wonderful lunch. Well will be back!!! I had the Chopped Salad. Very tasty!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the oddest restaurant experiences ever.  It was a sleety/snowy day and the entrance floor was soaked.  Several people slipped, but they didn't mop it up.  On the way out, my young son slipped and fell and the guy standing there said, slow down.  Um, how about getting a flippin mop?!  The food was nothing exciting, especially for the price.  Dude, you are making EGGS.  They cost, what $1.19 a dozen?  It shouldn't cost $7 a plate.    The service was totally inconsistent and plain sucked.  Why were there 4 different people bringing us our food?  We'd get our plate, minus the toast.  Then they would bring the toast, but there would be a random amount-5 slickes instead of 6.    Oh!  The bathroom is a shared one with other businesses in the building.  As soon as you open the door that leads to the bathrooms, it REAKS of smoke.  Seriously.  So much for clean air.  For some reason, I felt like everyone that worked here had an ankle alarm on.  Creepy servers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to get breakfast in Madison! The food is sooo good and I've always had good service. If I had to pick a favorite menu item, I'd probably go with the Mexican skillet- delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great service! Made suggestions about loaded potatoes, which interested my hubby for our next visit.  Like the environment, feels \"homey,\" new and inviting, even though it's a chain restaurant.   It was busy at 9:45, had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  But not bad for a Satursay morning!    It was a bit humid in the restaurant.  If it wasn't cold outside, we would've sat out on the patio.  Although, they do have heaters on the patio. I ordered over-hard eggs, bacon and sausage.  Bacon wasn't crispy and the eggs could've been cooked longer so the yolk could be completely cooked. But to be fair, I didn't ask for crispy bacon.  Husband and niece loved their biscuits and gravy! Mother in law loved the sourdough bread, but thought the bacon was under-cooked.   Our waitress was nice to ask if we wanted cups to take our drinks to go.  Good server.  I liked this place and the food was pretty good.  We'll come back again."}
{"text":"Wonderful service!!!! I give them 5 star for service . We were a party of 11. We got in right away. The service was excellent. Our order was taken immediately, we were served beverages right after that. When our food came out, our server didn't confuse anyone's food with the other. She was so good!!!  I am impressed with their portion. The pancakes were huge and so was the waffles. Even though I have had better pancakes and waffles elsewhere, I feel I got my bang for my buck here.   If u are in a group of 10 or more, there are not many breakfast options in Madison. Every good place has limited sitting. I would recommend this place for large groups. Call ahead. I am told they accept reservations for party of 7 or more as long as you call 2 hours in advance."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars but this place may have the best breakfast I've had in my 69 years. The Staff is friendly and the food is beyond good. This is the 2nd time we've been there and each time we tried something different. It all has been exceptional.. A great place for Breakfast..."}
{"text":"The Egg & I is a decent spot for breakfast, about on par for food offerings with a Denny's or Perkins. Service was good and I liked that they took reservations for our large party (I think they accept reservations for groups of eight ore more).   I appreciated the attempt the provide a daily special, I got the pork belly Benedict. It wasn't bad, but nothing special (I hoped the pork belly would have been a more substantial portion but it was essentially two thick slices of bacon).  Prices were about average for a restaurant in the area, but in retrospect I'd rather go to one of the more local and \"mom and pop\" breakfast spots in town."}
{"text":"Terrible, overpriced and ill mannered waitresses. I ordered skillet potatoes with a side of avocado. The skillet potatoes were OK. The waitress was irritated because I asked for a whole avocado. I can't understand what's so difficult about that. Her response was \"I don't know if we can do that. I'll have to check to see of we can do that.\" Strange. She comes back and tells me that the avocado was going to be $4. $4!! For an avocado. That's about a 400% markup for something that requires almost zero preparation. Our meals were all delivered at separate times. My husband's omelette came back incorrect. We were treated like he was supposed to just be quiet and eat it. No apology. Just a justification that she didn't enter it incorrectly. The chicken in his omelette looked less than appetizing. He described it as canned chicken. It wasn't but might as well have been. He asked for extra chicken on the side. I kid you not it was about a tablespoon of chicken for $3.  His diet coke looked like three day old soda because it was so flat. When it was mentioned to our waitress she quickly and with no concern said she'd have the lines changed. Another flat soda came out less than a minute later. I can assure that soda lines can't be changed that quickly. There was no intent to correct it. Here's your soda and you'll drink it whether you like it our not. My daughters oatmeal was less than desirable.  How do you need up oatmeal?! And the kids meal was almost $6 for a single pancake and a slice of bacon.  Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Nothing fancy - run of the mill breakfast joint. Prefer more character, but would eat there again if pressed for time."}
{"text":"We got here a few minutes after they opened and it appeared that the servers/host were running around still trying to get everything ready for the day.  That being said it took a few minutes to get seated and then a few more minutes to get our drink orders taken. That being said everyone was friendly which is nice especially early in the morning.   My dining companion had the classic breakfast with scrambled eggs,  bacon, and pancake.  He enjoyed everything and thought that it was good. I had the biscuits,  eggs and sausage gravy with scrambled eggs.  The gravy was pretty bland but it was still pretty tasty although I'm not sure that I would order it again.    It was clean and the table wasn't sticky. Which sometimes in a breakfast place can be hard to come by with all the syrup.   All in all, a definite hit as a breakfast place.  I'm sure that we will return when in the area."}
{"text":"Bethany is the best waitress, and I always request her. Sabrina is good as well.  They have been undergoing some changes to their menu, of which is am very unhappy with.  They used to have a coffee flavor of the season, and no longer do. Although their regular coffee is great, it was nice having changes.  On to the menu...they have whole wheat pancakes, of which are amazing. My son loves them and they are definitely a healthier alternative to no whole wheat.  They have fresh ingredients, soups of the day, and other unique menu items.  They are on the higher end of breakfast prices, OMO, so I recommend going online and registering to receive coupons to print."}
{"text":"Delicious! Loved both my chicken salad and chicken sandwich. Price was good too. My husband really enjoyed his eggs Benedict as well and thought the ranch potatoes were awesome"}
{"text":"Today was our first egg and i experience. Our server crystal was phenomenal, the breakfast  was delicious, and the coffee was just the way I like it. (Strong) We can't wait to see what the lunch is like."}
{"text":"I come here quite frequently. The staff greets me right away. We always get great service. The food comes out pretty quick. It has a nice local atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is/was called The Egg I Am........  If you don't like eggs......... lol.  This is a great little restaurant with a more modern twist. My wife loves the Kale Juice, and my boys like the pancakes and waffles.  I had the biscuits and gravy....not great.  Eggs, bacon, and ranch potatoes were good but not the gravy.  (2 stars for gravy)."}
{"text":"I came to this place for breakfast by chance. I actually went somewhere else originally, but they had too long of a wait. So I searched for breakfast near me and this place came up.   The food was delicious! Everything left my mouth feeling very happy and satisfied! I can't wait to go back to try more menu items! Well worth every star in my review!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have seasonal flavors and like any, breakfast attracts all ages.  This place has anything you want, eggs any way you want them waffles, pancakes, stuffed french toast, vegetarian options, coffees, juices - orange, cranberry, grapefruit, apple, carrot, kale...everything  The server was young and bubbly. She was honest and friendly. If she made a mistake, she admitted it and corrected it right away.  Great service, love this place!"}
{"text":"\"Ah, excuse me, ma'am....is there anything on this menu that doesn't have eggs of some kind?\"  \"Why would you come to a place called the 'Egg and I' and expect anything different?\"  That's the conversation I had in my head, anyway.  They seriously know their eggs here, and virtually every dish has some form of egg in the dish or as a side.    The skillets.  Oh my.  I had the Green Chili Chicken Hash Skillet, and I gotta say it was pretty intense.  It's a rarity that my mouth is on fire over the heat of a spicy breakfast, but the green chilis put me there.  I didn't eat until dinnertime...it was that filling.    My wife had the standard biscuits and gravy, which did not disappoint.  She did admit there was a bit too much pepper in them for her taste.    Passable coffee is a necessity at any breakfast establishment, and the Egg and I delivers well above that.  But keep in mind that while I give them credit for offering a couple different flavors of coffee, the hazelnut coffee was disappointing in that it was pretty over-the-top on the hazelnut flavor.  Stick with the standard octane and you'll be a caffeine-happy person for the day.     Overall, it's a great choice for a breakfast destination.  You'll leave stuff, caffeinated, and a believer that eggs truly are a great addition to breakfast."}
{"text":"The food was average at best. It is a little pricier that your bigger breakfast franchise.   Our drinks came out after breakfast was served.  Our order wasnt quite right either. But they did quickly corrected it.   I asked the manager if they would honor another locations coupon and she said no as they are seperate franchise.  I completely understood.  I politely asked if this franchise was planning on a coupon for this location .  She responded in an arrogant \"no\".  I, as a customer politely encouraged her as its great business and customer appreciation!  Her response was rude rather than a polite, \"great idea\" or even..\"oh yeah?\" Even if she had no intention...just be polite!  Instead I got, \"business is doing quite well without it, I have no problem- we have been quite busy and we do take care of our regulars\"....just a tad rude for my liking,especially from the owner.  As if to allude that she did not appreciate our business?   Make your own decision..but I wont frequent or recommend this restaurant. I just didn't care for her and the food was \"meh\"...Service can make or break a place. On a scale if 5 the food was a 3 (average), but the attitude brought it down to a 2:/"}
{"text":"We had great service,good coffee nice atmosphere. The food is the reason for the two stars.The potatoes where tasteless no shredded just frozen chunks. The biscuits where hard, not homemade and the gravy was bland."}
{"text":"I went with the breakfast burrito for my first time. It's great to have a breakfast place so close to home now! The food was a solid 7/10, A bit overpriced, and the decor is a bit dated. But I'll back in the future!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have written a review of any kind. We have been going to the Egg I Am for several years. The food is always very good. What has us coming back is the sevice! Debbie is by far the best server around.  She is attentive and always gets the order right even with special requests.  She just always brighten our day. Not to take away from the other employees but she is amazing! Kristen"}
{"text":"Nothing too exciting about this place... They're usually somewhat busy (which is surprising to me because their food is pretty average), but they never seem to have enough servers to cover the tables. Not only are there too few servers, but the ones they do have, in my experience, haven't been the greatest either. In fact, the last time I visited this establishment our waitress flirted with my date the whole time - it was unprofessional to say the least. I don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We came with an out of town guest because we enjoyed our first visit. While the food was very good (the scrambled eggs are very fluffy and flavorful!), the service was very disappointing. There was a very busy waiting list despite several tables being open and other customers waiting remarked about this to the staff. The hostess was not personable at all and borderline rude, and our waitress this time was insincere and sullen. Basically, we felt like we were inconveniencing their morning. While we did not think twice about introducing our guest based on our first experience, we were embarrassed we brought our visitor and will continue looking for someplace else for breakfast for ourselves and any guests."}
{"text":"Great bteakfast!  The green chili chicken hash was the best. If we were not visitors this place would be on the top of my favorites listm"}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Saturday but the wait wasn't too bad. My husband ordered French toast without powdered sugar. It came out wrong but they made him a new one fairly quickly. I had a waffle and bacon. Both were good, but mine was better ;-) Super yummy and hit the spot! I informed the server that I drink LOTS of water and he brought out a pitcher (and kept refilling it for me!) Our server didn't have much personality but he was efficient so I have no complaints there.   My recommendation to the owners- have the servers take the checks so you pay at the table. The combination of people waiting to pay and people waiting to get in gets quite overwhelming. I think it also discourages business because people walking up see this mass of humanity and think their wait will be too long. Actuality is that at least 1/3 of them are simply waiting to pay."}
{"text":"The chicken salad sandwich was really good!! I've been craving it since I've been last. I will for sure be back to try more items from the menu. The customer service could have been a little better considering the place wasn't very busy at the time we went. But overall good food!"}
{"text":"Egg and I is great! All servers I have had so far have a smile on their face and super friendly. The food is always perfection with a great variety.  I've only ever gotten breakfast and it's been a home run every time. I really enjoy their scrambles.   They also do a seasonal hash/scramble/soup from time to time.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service we received today.  Waitress never even introduced herself when she came to take our order. Not friendly at all. She was training a new employee but never bothered to mention that to us either, just asked for our breakfast order. My kids got a refill on their drink that came with the kids meal, but we were charged for the refill. Would have been nice to have known that the refills were not free! Then she was annoyed when I mentioned to her that she should have let us know when we ordered that there is an additional charge for refills. Not a very good role model when you're training a new employee! Food was mediocre. Mediocre food + poor service = we won't be returning.   Update: we returned to give this establishment one more try. This was a much different and better experience. We were immediately greeted when we walked in the door, and our server was very kind and attentive. She Introduced herself, took our order, checked on us several times, and the food was very good. Much different experience. The owner also introduced himself to us and made sure we had a good experience. Thank you for making this a much better visit than last time!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place in Gilbert near power ranch.  Had an egg skillet and son had eggs n toast.  Overall it was a nice and clean place for a weekend breakfast treat.  Somewhat pricey but to be expected."}
{"text":"I was glad to see a breakfast restaurant open around the corner from me. Since it's opening we've eaten here 3 times (breakfast only). I can't say I'm really impressed. The service is good, very warm & welcoming but the food is just okay. The price doesn't jusify what you get. I'd rather make the drive and get a better tasting breakfast for less money."}
{"text":"Food was okay, unfortunately the service is the worst.  Being the only breakfast place around (for now) took way to long to get a table. Then once we did get seated and order, waited over an hour for food. To bad"}
{"text":"I've been to the Egg and I several times for breakfast. I have to say it's quite amazing. I think it impresses me a bit more each time. From eggs, to large pancakes, waffles, yummy bacon - I've tried a number of dishes and all have been so good. Diverse menu and good service - only complaint I could say is that it is a bit small of a place, might have a wait but it has always been worth it. Definitely more of a quality than quantity place - but portion size is plenty big. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The best fluffy eggs. They always make the eggs exactly the way you want them. Very friendly service. Try the wild mushroom and veggie hash."}
{"text":"We will never darken their doorstep again. My sister recommended this after church today and she said it was amazing.  We are always in the mood to try something new so we gave it a shot. Waited about 10 minutes for a table,  sat down and looked over the menu.  We ordered two breakfast sandwiches and a pancake, does that sound like a hard order? No. Waiting... Waiting...waiting... We are waiting for our food and our waitress says they haven't forgotten our order its the kitchen that's backed up, waiting some more but theres plates of food going out to tables that arrived after us. Our pancake and my sandwich comes out, both stone cold. Where's our other sandwich?  And our potato dish? We send the first food back to get fresh and my moms sandwich comes out and that's cold, but the potatoes are hot. The manager comes over and we tell her our problem and she takes my moms sandwich and says it will be redone and that the meal will be on her. She brings my moms sandwich back out to only know that it was reheated, and wheres the rest of the food? \"We claimed we didn't want it redone.\"  So we just said forget about the food and we got up and left. Have decided to go to a better breakfast spot that's very popular."}
{"text":"Just tried this place today and I'm so happy we did.  I work at a breakfast restaurant so it's hard to surprise me with new things or better flavors,  but my breakfast today sure did! I had the Parisian Eggs Benedict (no mushrooms, no ham/sub avo) with potatoes instead of greens.  OMG so good.  They use a croissant instead of English muffin,  and I loved it that way.  I'm SO picky about hollandaise and this place's holli is bomb! I can't wait to go back.  I'll change to 5 stars when I try more items.  My fiance had the breaks burrito and he damn near licked the plate clean!!!"}
{"text":"Always super, fast, friendly service. Even carry out orders are fast! They focus on breakfast, and it shows... Its delicious! Specialty coffees and teas as well. I love to add their pork chilli to the potatoes. Out of sight!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family for a late breakfast on Saturday. I had the Mexican omelett and my wife had the biscuits and gravy. It was all very tasty. My only complaint is that we had to wait about a half hour when there were clearly empty tables. We were there during a prime time for a breakfast/ lunch place. It seems strange to not be all the way staffed up."}
{"text":"I love brunch here! The food is good eats! I really enjoy the belgian waffles.  Leslie Knope would have a field day!  You get a good bang for your buck here. Sometimes the food can take awhile but you are usually drinking your never-ending coffee cup and don't always notice. :)"}
{"text":"The food is okay to good to pretty good. The issue I have is with the service. The first time we came here they took over 15 minutes trying to split our check while we stood in front of the cash register. The general manager appeared very confused and couldn't communicate with his employees at all. The second time our waitress took about 15 minutes to even greet us but while we were waiting there trying to figure out who our waitress was I do feel we lucked out because one of the other wait staff looked half asleep doing the zombie walk. Later on during our experience this person spilled a drink on a customer and walked into another employee -- it was comical.  Other wait staff employees also looked very poorly trained and didn't seem to care about the success of the company. We only saw one person who looked on top of their game but was clearly frustrated with the other workers.  If you're in the area and need a bite to eat it's not the worst place but be prepared to wait longer and have a higher tolerance for employee errors."}
{"text":"We were so excited about this place. There is NOTHING for a nice, sit-down breakfast that close by. However, after being there twice, I will be making the trip to downtown Gilbert when we can splurge for a nice breakfast again. (There are way better options and cheaper too on Gilbert Rd. in the downtown area.)  The Egg I Am offers a GREAT assortment of egg-based items, and if they were better prepared, this place could be a knock-out. Instead, it is pricey for what it actually offers. The omelets are very generic -- ham and cheese omelet has really small preprepared diced ham (like from Costco) and then they throw a little cheddar cheese and melt it on top. There is no cheese actually IN the omelet. It is not bad-tasting, just really generic --- if you want a big fluffy omelet, DO NOT GO HERE.   Also, compared from the first time and this time, they appear to be cutting way back on the companion potatoes.   I had a frittata the first time. That is even flatter.  As to environment, this place is nice, though I don't know that the wooden slat booths are all that comfortable.   I loved my waiter, but I was delivered my check both times before we were even 1/2 done. That says something about the management."}
{"text":"I went here recently with family for the second time. Not many smaller breakfast options. I had biked there and was sad to see that there was no bike parking. We locked to the bench out front, but needed to use a cable for the second bike because two would not fit using just U locks."}
{"text":"Maybe we came in on a bad day but given their name I expected them to know how to cook their eggs.   They hard boiled my soft boiled eggs,  the over easy eggs came out with a hard yolk twice (after we sent it back).   The other fare is up to par with Denny's, but don't expect anything special"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place on a Sunday morning and after trying other local breakfast places and being underwhelmed I didn't have high hopes.      This place proved me way wrong!      From the greeter at the front desk we felt welcomed!!       Our server was great.   He was very polite, responsive, and came by table often to refill our drinks.      I had the avocado toast that comes on yummy grain bread, soft egg, mushed avocado and pink salt.    It was just perfect!!     Hubs had some egg plate with potatoes and bacon.     He ate it all so it must have been good.       We will definitely be back!!    Often!    Thanks!!"}
{"text":"We came back for breakfast with friends and have to say, we were pretty thrilled with the food.  Two of our group had Crab Cakes Benedict, another had a skillet and I had the Avocado Toast.  All of the meals were quite tasty and everyone was pleased with the food. The service was another matter.  The wait person (Nicki) disappeared for long periods of time.  She never checked on whether we were enjoying our meals and we had to ask for water, more coffee and iced tea.  We were almost done with our meals and long past the time in which we needed more beverages before we saw her again. We will be back but will certainly asked to be moved if seated in her section."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, great food. Come here as often as possible. This is my first choice for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not incredibly special, biggest issue was the luke warm tepratures. It seemed it had been sitting for some time before it was served. The service was really poor and at one point had to go find my waitress to get my check. Just a poorly managed staff. Didn't feel welcome and the hostess seemed bothered by our visit. Won't return here and won't recommend."}
{"text":"Great local business with some good breakfast items. I really love the eggs Benedict. I love sitting on the patio on a nice morning and having a awesome breakfast with my wife!! Support local business when ever you can great little restaurant."}
{"text":"Yelp,  emailed me to ask where I have been.   I haven't done any reviews lately.  I have been working 11 hour days, finally sold my house and now I'm packing to move out.  BUT before I leave let me slam a restaurant that makes too much money and doesn't deserve it! They get a minus any stars...zip...this place has been inconsistent, expensive, I've swatted flies, sent back a salad that looks like a rabbit patch, have been,  ignored by the wait staff, and served blase, below average, debauchery.  Stay away from this pitiful dumping ground of sadness.  After entering their world of shortages, lack of knowledge on how to serve a guest, we got up and left.  Server passed us 5 times, no water, no coffee, no words were exchanged...no apologies...we walked!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent  food, coffee and service! The restaurant is very clean and inviting. Tami was our server, she was so sweet, attentive and prompt!!! We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"The Egg I Am is a neighborhood breakfast joint near Queen Creek. They are located in a new and fancy strip mall on Queen Creek and Higley and are only open for breakfast and lunch.  The menu is focused mainly on brunch items and lunch sandwiches. They probably lack a deep fryer so items are closer to a standard kitchen. I had a good Rueben sandwich although the meat was sliced rather thick. Fresh fruit was a great option especially when traveling.  This location is perfect for meeting friends and catching up which is exactly what I used it for. Staff was very tolerant of some fussy kids which helped the adults enjoy their short time together."}
{"text":"I was totally disappointed with my breakfast order, I had colorado jack scramble way small portion, and a waffle, way over priced at 17 dollars, manager told me they just uped the prices, needless to say I won't be giving them any more business!!!"}
{"text":"Good coffee and juices, decent service, and ok food. Nothing to write home about, but we'll probably try it again since it's right across the street."}
{"text":"Breakfast is consistently yummy and fresh.  Servers are kind. Brendan is one of the nicest and most attentive. Good solid place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love to try new breakfast places and this one has just gone to the top of the list.  Mary Ellen was our server and what a nice lady. I ordered the wild mushroom frittata and it was delicious. Husband enjoyed the Tuscan scramble. I would have given it five stars but our order wasn't quite right.  There's also a meeting room available for large parties."}
{"text":"I tried so hard to like this place. How can you go wrong with a giant pancake? I ordered an apple granola pancake. It contained two ingredients that did not belong - a raisin (not too big of a deal but technically was not supposed to be in the pancake) and a piece of avocado (it was bright green and definitely looked like an avocado - I didn't try eating it). I don't know how those two things ended up in the apple pancakes but I've never had that happen to me at a restaurant. The pancake was decent beyond those two things but way overpriced. I'm sorry but I won't be back. I don't suggest it."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times. Usually just average with poor service always a problem. Today our food was bad. The potatoes were heavy with grease and tough.4plates in our party and we couldn't eat them. I mentioned it to Nico ,our waiter,and he promptly got a management lady who told us these beauties were always twice cooked . She walked away with no resolution. Odd to say the least.  I didn't mention the eggs were undercooked The taste of the hollandaise sauce was off.   We didn't punish our waiter for a kitchen screwup by the way."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple times and it's always been great! There is always a wait but it's well worth it! First time I went I got biscuits and gravy and the second time a salad. Both were delicious and the restaurant has a cozy feel to it. I will defiantly keep coming back! I highly recommend this place if you live near by."}
{"text":"In a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.  It is good food with great service.  The patio on a gorgeous day is a great way to enjoy breakfast.  During peak times (weekend mornings), there will be a wait, but it will be worth it."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come check this place out since it opened as I live right across the street but I am just not really a \"breakfast\" person usually. However I had a friend visiting from out of town and thought it was the perfect opportunity.  Went around 11:30am on a Saturday (ok, more \"brunch\" time than breakfast), and we were sat immediately. Quick and friendly service. The menu is incredible.  It took us forever to decide because everything looked so good.  We finally both decided, I got the Santa Fe Huevos and she got the Green Chili Chicken Hash.  After waiting what seemed like forever (mostly because I was starving, but partially because it did take a while), we got our food... all wrong.  Both of our orders had things missing.  Hers was missing the green chili!?  How is that even possible?  THAT is what she ordered.  It was also missing the guacamole, as was mine (guacamole shortage perhaps?), AND she had to ask for her tortilla.  Oh but the waitress DID bring out a side of hollandaise sauce for her. WTF?  Hollandaise?!  With the green chili chicken hash??  So after flagging down the first person we could and telling them ALL the things that were wrong, they quickly brought everything out that we were missing, and we dug in.  Have to admit, the food was very good.  This, and this alone, will bring me back in the future.  I'm pretty certain our waitress was brand new (she didn't seem to know the menu well, clearly since she brought out HOLLANDAISE for a chili hash), so I will give them another shot in hopes of getting a more experienced server who knows that the green chili chicken hash is supposed to actually have green chili and not hollandaise..."}
{"text":"My husband discovered this little gem on his way to school.  He told me about it and said it's probably something I would enjoy.  So glad he did!  I've always tried something different and I've never been disappointed.  Today it was the Colorado Jack Scramble with a small side of pork green chili.  YUM!  The waiter also brought me some guacamole because they put avocado on my meal, instead of the guacamole.  Different, but surprisingly tasty.  We've never been disappointed in this place.  And the service is always stellar.  We've been fortunate enough to have the same waiter, Payson, each time we've been in.  He always greets us with a smile and comments if we haven't been in for a bit.  I'll be disappointed when he eventually moves on because he's just a delightful young man.  I always make sure he's tipped well. ;)  Overall, we like this place for breakfast.  We've never had lunch so can't comment, but that'll come someday.  The place is clean, service great and we think the price is spot on.  My husband commented this morning that he appreciates that there is not a ton of food on the plate that's going to be wasted.  Many breakfast places throw a bunch of potatoes on the plate for their filler.    We'll continue to patronize The Egg I am!"}
{"text":"Stop by to order to go, fast and friendly. Food was delicious and filling. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Should be 2 1/2 stars. Nothing to write home about. I aways ask for onions in my hash browns why they can't ever get it is besides me. They give it to me on the side raw or forget them just can't ever get them they also cook them early in the morning not fresh so they are dried out and taste old. Not made to order. We have never had anything great there.always pretty clean."}
{"text":"So I have been here a few more times after my initial review and I'm sad to say I will not be returning. While the service is good, the food has been mediocre at best, food quality is not great nothing special here. Stinks it's the only breakfast place right now jn the area."}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast place that I take the family to almost every Sunday. We all love the food here and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"I tried The Egg I Am on Sunday Morning at about 10 am.  Upon arrival, we put our names on the list as there was a wait.  After about a 15-20 minute wait for our table for two, we were seated.  The restaurant has a typical breakfast joint feel; country.   The seats were fairly uncomfortable.  We were promptly greeted by our server and our drink order was taken.  Shortly thereafter, our drinks were served.  Our food took about 15 minutes which was an appropriate amount of time I thought for how busy they were.  I ordered the Viva La France which was 2 slices of french toast, 2 eggs your way and 2 slices of bacon.  They food expediter brought out our food and did not bring me syrup so I had to ask for it.  The food was ok, actually the eggs were good and buttery but the french toast was so-so.  All in all, The Egg I Am is good. While a little pricier than it needs to be but not exorbitant, it is an ok place for breakfast.  Next time, I may try for lunch."}
{"text":"I recommend that you learn how to poach an egg at home. Save some money and a lot of your time and not dine at the egg and I. The owners only concern is to make a dollar. All the food is bland mass produced franchise food. The employees are rude and incompetent. Go to Perkins it's 3 minutes away. You'll be much better off"}
{"text":"We had a coupon and so decided to try this place.  Reviews looked good.  Well, perhaps we have been spoiled by some really great cafes recently because when I compare the meals I had there to the one here, this place just doesn't rate.  Not that it's bad.  But there is no \"wow\" here.  I was somewhat hopeful because when we arrived the place was packed, and there was a 30 minute wait.  Obviously a lot of people like it, right?  They called us and we were seated.  The hostess and server were both very good.  Cheerful, friendly, and helpful.  No complaints there.  Good employees.  I ordered the Texas skillet.  It was fine.  Probably 3-stars.  A lot more mushrooms than \"steak strips\", and the cheese seemed to be in one spot (I got one really big bite of cheese, and the rest of the skillet had almost none), but the flavor was good.  My wife ordered the corned beef, and that was a disappointment.  My wife actually thought it was bad.  I thought it was \"just OK\" (I tried hers).  Not a lot of flavor, and very dry.  She also didn't like the coffee.  Also ordered was a Mexican skillet (\"just OK\") and a soup/sandwich combo (the soup was excellent, the sandwich was fine).  Prices weren't unreasonable.  But given that I can think of three other breakfast places that have better food I can't really see coming back.  So \"I've experienced better\" definitely fits here:  two-stars.  Maybe 2.5 if Yelp allowed me to do that."}
{"text":"It wasn't too shabby, but it's nothing to write home about. I liked it better then the good egg. I got the Texas something and another. It was pretty good but I'm not a fan of ranch potatoes. I asked if they had hash browns and they don't even serve em (bummer). The thing I kind of resented was that they don't have a baby changing station in either bathroom. Went to change my daughter and I had to go to my car and change her. A little inconvenient, but oh well. The waitress was super nice. Moral of the story is we'll be back but it won't be a staple."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the neighborhood and thought we'd give The Egg I Am a try since we love all things breakfast.  We went around 9am on a Sunday, and there was no wait (but it also looked like a full house, so we may have taken the last table at the time).  This review is a week after the visit, so I don't remember exactly what we ordered, but here's what I do remember... adorable Mickey Mouse shaped pancake for my son, a steak scramble for my husband, and a chicken hash scramble for me.  Everything was delicious!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While dining, I asked myself why don't we come here more often?! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is very calm and homey. Today i had the french toast with eggs and turkey sausage. Everything melted in my mouth. I looove their coffee, but today it was burnt , which is why i dropped it one star. However, the server wasted no time in fixing it though. I will definitely be coming back soon. I wish they stayed open later, they close at 2:30pm. I chalk that up to them wanting to leave you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Food is great, service can be a little hit and miss. It's never terrible, just not always great. On weekends there is always a wait so be prepared for that. My husband loves the green chile chicken hash. I usually order from the \"lighter\" menu and get something like the oatmeal or yogurt parfait."}
{"text":"Husband and I ate here for breakfast recently as it was close to an errand we had to run. Decent food. Nothing to be wowed at. Won't go out of my way to eat there when I live so close to other tastier places. But if I find myself in this area while running errands again, I might eat there.   I got the veggie benedict which was pretty good. One egg was perfectly poached, the other one was over-cooked. The hollandaise was tasty and the veggies were nice - mushrooms, artichokes, tomato, spinach. Fried potatoes were just so so.   Husband ordered a gigantic blueberry pancake that looked delicious. I didn't taste it myself as by the time I realized I wanted a bite he'd eaten all of it. The pancake had to have been 14 inches in diameter.  I did like that when I ordered a coke, they brought me my glass filled with coke and a carafe."}
{"text":"I love breakfast. I can eat it any time of day. So you'd think this place would far exceed my breakfast expectations, right? Meh.  The Flapper was a big let-down. Fine, it was a simple plate of one pancake with eggs and bacon. But the pancake wasn't fully cooked. The 2 strips of bacon were rubbery (so we asked for another pair....didn't really make up for it). The eggs? Scrambled. Nothing special. That's a SIMPLE dish. If you can't get that right, get out of the kitchen.   The Parisian eggs benedict (A buttery croissant half layered with shaved ham, sautéed portabella mushrooms and melted Swiss cheese. Topped with two poached eggs, hollandaise sauce and green onions) was VERY good though, I admit. Came with ranch potatoes that were cold, but whatever.   I probably wouldn't return unless someone I was with really wanted to go. And I'd probably stick with that Parisian dish. Guess I expected too much from a breakfast place?   Nah. Prices were too much for the quality of food they were serving."}
{"text":"I dropped in here for breakfast.  I was surprised that the prices were as high as they are.  I was looking for something simple and eventually ordered scrambled eggs and chicken sausage off of the al a carte menu as I didn't want the potatoes and the bread that was offered on all of the breakfast items.  My eggs were overdone and the sausage was okay.  Nice thing was they brought me a small carafe of iced tea with my iced tea.  They also have hard wooden benches in their booths.  Service was slower, also, at 9 a.m. than I expected.  It just wasn't the experience I was expecting."}
{"text":"A Thursday morning., 4 adults and 2 babies, 30 min wait and they try to sit a party of 4 that walked in 20 after us. I understand but it wasn't that busy and there were many open tables.  Then my Order was slow to come and food was cold had to ask twice for my toast. To many other choices to come back."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this place.  Both the food and service was awesome!! The pumpkin pecan waffle rocks!! Definitely many more dishes to try in our future."}
{"text":"I forgot to update my reviews to some of my favorite restaurants.  Last time I went to The Egg I Am was when my Great-Grandmother and Grandma came to visit me.  We wanted to treat them to a great breakfast and my Great-Grandmother had cravings for pancakes.  Our favorite waitress is this amazing British lady and luckily we had her when we sit down.  My Great Grandmother had her pancake and everyone ordered their breakfast.  I hadn't seen our Grandparents for over 8 years due to us always being busy and living in another state but that morning it felt like we've been eating breakfast together every Sunday.  So I wanted to say thank you -The Egg I Am-for making that one morning very special.  Your foods were just delicious and your service was as good as it gets:)"}
{"text":"Went for a drive looking for a nice breakfast place and was delighted to stumble upon The Egg I am. The atmosphere and décor was warm and inviting.  The staff was welcoming with sincere smiles and attentive.  My husband loves his breakfasts and is very picky - he was most happy here and thoroughly enjoyed his meal as did I!  We're looking forward to our next visit in a couple of weeks as the menu of breakfast and lunch meals is plentiful! We may even try a table outside; looks very pleasant in the shade!  We highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I had high hopes but ends up its just another institutional franchise with decent marketing and just average food. Our server Nicki was good but the kitchen slow.   Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I would rather go to IHOP than go here though. I mean there's really nothing too special about this breakfast joint. And their name is so confusing because when you enter they have a different name due to copy rights or whatever. I ordered their Benedicts, it was good but nothing special for $13 dollars."}
{"text":"Had the Denver omelette.  Came with English muffin and ranch potatoes.  Everything was good but I am a hash browns fan.  The potatoes were just ok.  Nothing wrong with omelette. Great selection of jellies and jams for the English muffin."}
{"text":"We have tried this place two times since my review and I have to say we have seen an amazing turn around. One of the owners did reach out to me, and apologized for the experience. True professionalism!! The Santa Fe Huevos Rancheros are amazing. On our last visit a male( one of the owners according to our server) was going around to the tables, filling waters, and taking real ownership in making sure everyone had a great experience. New Pre-Golf hot spot!!!"}
{"text":"Wow,v this place was so good at first. I had it at 5 stars because the food and service was really great. Now, I wouldn't touch this place. Service has gone way down hill. They don't refill and when an order comes out wrong they ask, well do you want something else. Um, no, why don't you try getting my order right. Eggs are not fresh. I wondered why they tasted watery.  I asked and the beat all the scrambled eggs together in a big batch and then ladle out what they need, so in other words it sits there from early morning. Gross. The biscuits and gravy came out cold. Never again."}
{"text":"Love, love, love.  Every time I walk in, I know I will have a great meal!  Here is a warning: only order one meal.  Some people go in and order a meal and extra sides, but at the Egg and I this is completely unnecessary.  They give you more than enough food, sometimes too much food.    I have tried many thing on their menu.  I am a fan of their breakfast croissant sandwich.  Delicious and so warm.  Their omelettes are generously filled.  If you like potatoes AND omelettes, get the skillet.  Best of both worlds.    The service is wonderful.  The coffee is delicious, just their plain bottomless cup of coffee.  Definitely nice to find a place where their everyday coffee is as good as a gourmet shop.    Expect a wait, this place is pretty popular.  It is only open for breakfast and lunch. While you wait, they have complimentary coffee for their patrons.  They also provide for take-out for those of you who do not want to get out of your PJs on sunday mornings.    Negative? It is very popular for families.  And while they have a separate room, they do not separate families with children from everyone else.  I am not asking for discriminatory practices but there is no reason to have crying babies AND children who can not act appropriately with adults who are looking to have a nice breakfast.  Meet the needs of all of your patrons, please."}
{"text":"This place was great... Stopped in after a hike and had a lovely breakfast. I'd come back often if it was closer to home."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since they've opened. I feel like the quality of the food has gone down big time. They've gotten a few orders incorrect. But the last time we went there my sandwich had a moldy tomato on it. I was super excited to have a new place in the neighborhood. But we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Was seated right away on a busy Saturday morning. Outside has misters to cool you down on a hot summer morning.  Started with their coffee and was pleasantly surprised. Rainforest Alliance certified Arabica coffee.  Bold taste. I followed my coffee order with the Sante Fe Huevos.  A warm flour tortilla layered with seasoned black beans, pepper jack cheese and two eggs over easy. Topped with salsa, guacamole, fresh tomatoes, sour cream and fresh green onions. Served with ranch potatoes. Can't go wrong with this!  One of the best bfast dishes I've had eating out."}
{"text":"Menu was different ... In a good way ... Servers are still new and learning. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see there was a breakfast spot near me that served grits. The atmosphere and service was great up until the moment I pulled someone's hair from my tooth. I was instantly mortified and expressed my concern to who appeared as a female manager. After I shared my discontent regarding the hair fiasco she begin to laugh and tell me her cooks wear hair nets. Lets just say I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for brunch recently.  We had a good meal.  Nothing dynamite, but what they do, they do a-ok.  I had what is becoming my brunch staple, corned beef and hash.  Not much to comment on, the food was good, service nice."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  I'm glad they came to Madison because we need some good breakfast places. First time here so I can only speak to one dish.   The M.B.A. Frittata 8.79 Portabella mushrooms, bacon and asparagus, topped with creamy Havarti dill cheese, diced tomatoes and Parmesan cheese.  I picked this to try to get an idea of how they made their egg dishes.   This was very good.   Perfectly cooked.  Portion was of average size.  English muffin was a little bland.  I have had better and I have had worse. My food took a while to arrive and they didn't appear busy at all.  I would say it took about 10-15 minutes, so not terrible.    The service was pleasant and friendly. The menu has a lot of variety and easy to read.  Everything was very clean. I was pleased but wasn't \"wowed\". Returned recently and had a very good omelet and it was of good proportion and hot.   Wife had Eggs Benedict and it was really tasty but it was lukewarm.   Stronger coffee would  be nice. Bathrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming to this place.  I ordered the biscuit, egg, gravy, which was pretty basic.  My wife ordered an eggceptional omelete.  My wife didn't particularly like the taste of the hollandaise sauce on her omelete.  The food came out pretty quick and our waitress was prompt with refills.  However, the service in general was average.  The server checked up on us once and when bringing out the check didn't communicate where to pay.  When we were ready to pay the host didn't say anything to us when we were paying or after paying.  Nothing made me feel like I should come back here, and nothing made me feel like they wanted me to come back."}
{"text":"We brought in lunch once at work from here and it was good so I wanted to come in and check it out. Cute little place. The food was good and the service was pretty decent. No complaints. Will be back to try some more options on the menu. Today I got the breakfast croissant and they let me switch the ham for bacon without any question or an additional charge."}
{"text":"Before I moved to the far east side of Madison, The Egg & I was my go to weekend morning breakfast joint.  I would sure like to know what brand of coffee they are serving, because it is absolutely delicious!  They have ample serving sizes and tons of seating! Huge parking area!  What I enjoy most about this restaurant is the fact that they are only open for breakfast and lunch. The quality of their food shows that they can put more effort into making a great breakfast vs. planning for the dinner menu later in the day. What a great concept!  If I had to suggest ordering one thing, it would be the green chili (as a side for dipping and spreading on eggs and potatoes). It's pretty fantastic!   I also enjoy the fact that they have so many choices for other side orders and bread choices. Sour dough! My favorite!  As for the lunch menu, they have burgers, salads, and sandwiches. nothing too specials. Just great prices quality food.   Honestly, I wish that they would expand and make a new Egg & I on the east side of Madison. You would find me eating there at least once a month."}
{"text":"I use to love this place but as a vegetarian it is very frustrating that they upcharge you for substituting like egg instead of meat in the salads.  Never had this problem at any other restaurant in Madison. However, Great omelettes and all the staff are friendly and efficient"}
{"text":"This place is a big disappointment. The menu looks like it should be amazing: Farm-y looking ingredients, a medley of vegetables, many instances of avocado. Seriously, I was drooling. Instead, it's tasteless food that must've sat on a truck for the majority of its sad little life.  And the eggs. They LOOK like eggs. But the yolks are almost colorless and the flavor is non-existent.  Anyone who likes this place must've lost their taste buds in the war.  The service here isn't bad. But it isn't really good, either. We ordered coffee, but never got a refill after the first cup.   Bathrooms are clean - that's about all I can give them. And they're common to the other businesses in the building so not really giving them much credit for that either.  I won't go back. Seriously, there's just too much good stuff anywhere but here. Bonfyre is right down the way (if they're open): Save yourself."}
{"text":"My husband and I have never been to The Egg and I  and we're excited to try it. The food was NOT at all what we expected, the burrito was flavorless and nothing we added to it helped. Our waitress just said \"I'm sorry\" We should've returned it and ordered something different. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"It's like a glorified George Webb. Frozen potatoes, frozen biscuits, but not bad just nothing special, especially given the price. Friendly staff tho, it's a 24hr diner only open in the morning."}
{"text":"I've been treating myself to brunch here weekly for the past few months, but my service last week was awful. My server came and took my order, but.....never came back. Not even to bring my check. I thought maybe she was just in the weeds, but there she was a few tables over, laughing and socializing with another table."}
{"text":"Our waitress was friendly at first but a little scattered throughout our service.  My friend and I ordered different things to try some dishes and all were very yummy.  The eggs, which for me is the most important part of breakfast, were cooked perfectly.  We didn't feel rushed, considering there was a line to get in.  We will be back."}
{"text":"After driving out to Joe's Farm Grill and encountering the usual Saturday morning MOB, hubby and I decided to make our way to some place a little on the quieter side. We've driven by The Egg I Am many times, but this morning, we finally gave it a try. I'm glad I didn't read the Yelp reviews first, though,  because they certainly don't do the breakfast we had this morning justice.   Hubby had a blueberry pancake. It looked amazing. It smelled amazing. It tasted amazing. (How could I not have a bite?)  I ordered a very basic breakfast with a side of sausage gravy - which was absolutely delicious. The potatoes were some of the best I've ever had. We had a nice quiet table just off the patio so the ambiance was exactly what we were looking for. Zach, our waiter, was top-notch. Seriously, we couldn't have asked for a better breakfast!   The downside....  I would have given The Egg I Am five stars but for one thing, the prices are a tad high and probably the ONLY reason this restaurant didn't have a Saturday morning mob the way Joe's Farm Grill always does."}
{"text":"Great food and service! My kids beg me to go to breakfasts there on weekends.  We enjoy going for brunch.  Everything we have ordered is yummy."}
{"text":"Quaint place. Yummy French toast. And I pretty much only order French toast, haha. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather along with our food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot, I liked the idea of the free meeting room. I had the Green Chile Chicken Hash and I thought it was great. The coffee (Pecan) was good too but wasn't that hot. Good service and everyone was friendly. I did go back with the whole family Debbie was a great server, breakfast was awesome for everyone. My only knock was when I ordered a side of corned beef hash I ended up with a side of hashed potatoes but since I'm a meat n potatoes kind of guy, I ate it anyway and was still ok with it.   The picture of my son says a lot, propped up in the corner of the booth with 2 bites of his adult size pancake left on his plate with his hood over his head like he went to battle with his food and lost."}
{"text":"Thank you for dropping off our bill as we were finishing our meal and letting us choose when we want to leave instead of holding us \"hostage\" by holding back the bill. Doesn't matter as much on the weekend and hopefully you do this on weekday lunches when it matters more.   Food was great as always. Always look forward to the seasonal specials and usually end up ordering them which puts us in the dilemma of not getting around to the standard menu. And frankly, that's a good problem to have!  Still not crazy about the lunch menu, but that is just my personal preference.  I'm sure it appeals to others.  I always leave The Egg & I with a smile on my face. Can't wait until we come back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! But the service from Kellie was outstanding! This girl was attentive and so friendly. I will be back! Customer for life !!"}
{"text":"The service was great, Your server always has a smile and great attitude. I'm been there a few times but waiting to write this review. It is a busy place on the weekends, so plan a 30 to 45 min wait during the peak hours. The nice thing is that while you wait, they do have coffee and water outside. Not a big place so it fills up fast. The menu is simple,but good food item to select. Priced in the $6.00 to $9.00 range, not bad price for the food served. The food is good with a twist on the basic egg and bacon & hash browns. They kick it up a bit with some interesting menu selections.  I'm a fan living in Gilbert, worth the drive."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Denny's and/or Perkins, The Egg & I is right up your alley.  I've been here a few times and each time it's just ok.  Nothing great.  Nothing bad.  Your typical breakfast options.  Service is fast and welcoming.  In a pinch and if I was in the vicinity, I would consider coming back.  But there is way too many other breakfast options in Madison that I would choose first."}
{"text":"This place is brand new and still working out the kinks. We waited quite awhile but the food was absolutely amazing and well worth the wait! All the staff is very friendly. Great little brunch spot. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was expecting a great experience. Only the greeter smiled. Our server wasn't really helpful, and seemed like he was just punching the clock. My daughters Mac n cheese was cold (just out of the fridge???) and was Kraft. Yuck. Left $40 lighter for about a $30 meal. The gentleman at the register had an opportunity to make things right (I told him the food was just ok) but was concerned about other things and seemed indifferent about the dining experience. Will never be going back."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great food and coffee. Only wish they were open later hours since we are late risers. Always a great meal and service."}
{"text":"Good food,  great service.  I don't think I've seen a better managed restaurant.  There is attention to every detail...  Nice to have a selection of coffees too.  The food is slightly generic and heavy on potatoes but worth coming out for."}
{"text":"Great for brunch! Standard breakfast fare, but done really well.  I've been here a ton of times and try to get something new each time.  Some of my favorites: VERA CRUZ CHICKEN & AVOCADO OMELETTE- it's in the \"smarter choices\" section but it is super flavorful and comes with lots of avocado PARISIAN BENEDICT DENVER OMELETTE BISCUIT, EGGS & GRAVY Seasonal favorite: Banana bread french toast- this is to die for!  My favorite waiter is Nico, but generally the staff is friendly. The place can be very busy if you go between 10-11am on Saturday and Sunday, but I've never had a wait longer than 20 mins.  Parking can be a little tricky, there is plenty of it, but the spa and gym next door have reserved parking, so you may have to find a space in the parking structure in the back.  I know it's a chain, but one of my favorite breakfast places in Madison."}
{"text":"It's a good breakfast.  I would say its a little pricey for eggs. Service is a little overwhelmed at times."}
{"text":"I don't know how long this place has been here, but thank you Yelp for helping me find it. My mom and I met here for breakfast, and we were both pleasantly surprised. We both ordered different varieties of Eggs Benedict, and they were pretty good. I liked the variety of the menu- lots of their menu items had unique flavor combinations, not just your typical \"dineresque\" selections. Their seasonal coffee was good, and their brand of hot sauce at the table was tasty too. One downside for me was the way you pay. I don't like paying at the front where everyone is waiting for a table. It makes the entryway super crowded in an already busy restaurant. Definitely makes it seem a little hectic and disorganized."}
{"text":"My son loves eggs everything about them how to prepare how to whip them hard boiled. I took him here before we have a day together of talking and walking to the comic book store, train store and he said Dad those eggs were good. They were sunny side up not burned not slimly and they made the smile face with the bacon and toast were ears. I like little touches like that seem like a gimmick but to a little boy without a high chair it's a big smile and it takes such little effort for the cook (I used to be a cook) or the server to make a plate look good."}
{"text":"Good is ok, I spent $10 on a canned beans, jarred salsa and a tortilla and eggs. I wont be back anytime soon for the food. But also, this place must not care at all about familes. So much so that they dont have anywhere to change a baby, I mean what restaurant dpesnt have a kaola care station?? My 3 month old had a major blowout, I ran to the bathroom and to my dismay I had to take my baby outside in the cold, and change her in the front seat."}
{"text":"I would love to tell you about the wonderful eggs, fresh ingredients, and intimate, loving care this place provides.  Oh well.  Easily 5 minutes until we saw our server.  Eggs here are from a box unless you specify you want them from a hard-shell. As I got the manager to admit \"Well sure, we have plenty of 'hard-shelled' eggs here, on request.\"  The orange juice was supposedly fresh squeezed but it didn't taste like any fresh-squeezed OJ I've ever had, and I am a connoisseur.  I am not sure how they managed to mess up fried potatoes, but they did. They were burnt yet still mushy. I have no clue how they managed that.  The english muffins were not toasted well enough, and buttered, so it was just a mushy wasteland of nooks and crannys of an undesirable sort.  I had to explain in detail to the (creepy) manager what was wrong with the meal, and had to argue to get him to lower the already high price for a completely undesirable meal.  This is the same manager that left a lady waiting while he talked on the phone, and wasn't sure where to seat people. Just bad.  Save your money. Go somewhere nice. It is just not worth it.  The coffee was okay though, but this place is not called \"The Coffee and I\""}
{"text":"Good food but waited nearly an hour to be seated even after calling for reservations.  They're not adequately equipped to host large parties (6+)."}
{"text":"Arrived 10:00 am on Monday. About ten minutes to be seated and server was on us fast. All orders were accurate and very good. Service was very good, nice place, small but nice. We sat on the large patio, tables could have used table cloths but was nice. Bathrooms clean as was the clientele. Food was well presented and both tasty and pretty. Bill for 4 was only 50.00 buck, will definitely return. The menu offered a large selection that satisfied all."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant.  The man and I have been coming here almost every weekend for a while now and we both agree that it's I've of the better breakfast places in the city.     They have a very expansive menu.  It is also easy to opt for healthy and gluten free choices which I love.  All the pancakes are whole wheat and delicious and not in that delicious for whole wheat way but more in that delicious cause they're delicious way. I've tried many things on the many and am yet to be disappointed.  I also like the location.  It's not in some old building swarming with people who look like they've been coming here for 75 years.  Instead it's contemporary and comfortable, another attractive thing about this place versus all the other places in Madison."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited to try this place out. I ordered a Tuscan scramble and my husband got the biscuits and gravy. My eggs were way over cooked and it overall had no flavor. My husband said his meal tasted like it was made from a box at home. The only things we enjoyed were the fresh squeezed orange juice and English muffin. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was below the standard I expect for a mom & pop breakfast joint. I had steak and eggs. Although the steak was tender, it was poorly seasoned - even A1 didn't make it tasty. The eggs were bland as hell and don't get me started on the \"ranch\" potatoes. If I go to a mom & pop for breakfast I want real potatoes not frozen packaged potato squares. They were simply dismal. The waitress was nice though."}
{"text":"The Egg & I is a Johnny-Come-Lately, New-Kid-in-Town version of Denny's or Perkins. I get their MO: Serve up the same kind of stuff and dress it up with a cute name to draw the upscale brunch crowd. Voila, it works masterfully -- you get a crowded place with a long wait for service and if you're really unlucky, like us, an even more Egg-&-I-zingly long wait for your food.   My family and I sat for 1 hour, 47 minutes waiting for our order. Kid you not. I know this because I received a text message just before placing our order and the time stamp never lies. The waiter and manager compensated us not with a free entree or a comped check, but with one free cinnamon roll to split among the four of us and free refills of nasty diner coffee while we waited. Gracious.  Since it pains me to write reviews like this, I will say the food was OK when we finally got it. Then again, after waiting almost 2 hours, we devoured it like the pack of hangry wolves we were. The eggs could have been rotten and we'd have been none the wiser but honestly, and to be fair, everything tasted A-OK."}
{"text":"I still really enjoy the food here. The issue seems to be management. Arriving almost anytime during their weekend hours will mean standing packed like sardines into a tiny 'atrium' area where departing diners are trying to pay their tabs. Meanwhile, a majority of the tables will be empty.  The last time I was able to speak to the owner about this, he mentioned that he had new kitchen staff that wouldn't be able to handle the influx of orders. He's mentioned this several times before. It stands to reason that diners sitting at tables drinking coffee/water while they wait is better than having them packed into the front door - staring at empty tables and considering their other breakfast options.  It does sadden me, because the food at the price point is really spot on. It's just tough to wait 30+min to sit when there are so many exceptional brunch options in Madison. Given the simplicity of their menu, I've found that if I'm in the mood for the Egg & I, I end up cooking breakfast for us at home."}
{"text":"Service goes a long way as well as attitude and when you lack both you lack customers. Unfortunately with the attitude and lack of service from the hostess you will now be losing four customers today. Now..... will that send you into bankruptcy, no..... but I vote with my dollar and my dollar will now go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I heard of this place but never realized how close to my home it actually was!  Who knew!?!   Anyway, this place is touted to be similar to the good egg. That's far from the truth. It's a little smaller but the food and service are not the same.  I enjoyed my Denver omlete but it seemed smaller than ones I have enjoyed at similar places. My wife did not like the huevos rancheros, especially the beans. I'd rather find the nearest First Watch and go there."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, friendly staff, ordered orange juice (fresh squeezed) odwalla. For a $1.00 more you get a carafe for a second glass...nice. I ordered bisquits, gravy and eggs, gravy was a little spicy for me. The eggs were perfect. They don't have an option for hash browns only breakfast potatoes and an option for crispier potatoes."}
{"text":"The first few times we've been here, great experience. Went today. Sat right away but waited 30 minutes for our food to be delivered. Omelet was pretty flat. Bacon was under cooked. Scrambled eggs had large yolk pieces. Only highlight were the waffles. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast food ever! The coffee is strong and the potatoes are wonderfully spiced."}
{"text":"The waitress was awesome and the food was awesome. I had the breakfast burrito with green Chile and salsa and it definitely did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"I think we definitely came in on an off day. Went there with family over the UW Homecoming weekend at around 10 am. People were waiting outside when we arrived so my aunt asked the hostess about how long for a table for 8. She was told the tables are turning over fast and it shouldn't be long. About 45 minutes later we were seated. I'm guessing they were short of waitstaff that day because there were plenty of empty tables in the side room where we were seated. When our food was delivered we thought they would be right back to bring syrup and any other condiments needed. Nope, my husband had to go find someone to bring us those items. The food itself was good, but the staff was clearly struggling and management was no where to be found. Considering the other options, I doubt I would return."}
{"text":"Our waitress Cecilio was very cheerful and accommodating. We had our coffee right away. I liked that I could get egg whites, and substitute fruit for the potatoes. The meeting room was adjustable for our needs."}
{"text":"Took my sister here for brunch. She had dietary limitations and explained to the server what she wanted. Her meal was beyond her expectations and was delicious. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was super delish. I like how you are served a carafe of your beverages and I especially liked that the cashier reminded me of a discount I wasn't aware of.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great experience this morning with the family.  Wasn't sure that this place would be friendly for toddlers, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The wait staff was spot-on.  The boy was brought his meal before ours by about five minutes which couldn't have worked out better.  I'm not sure if this is common practice for kiddos, but it should be as it prevented an early-morning \"melt down.\"  I opted for the French Toast special.  I'm not as big of a French Toast snob as my brother, but I was nearly blown away.  If his assessment meets my expectations, I would be willing to up my rating to a 5.  The portion of eggs included with the meal (I opted for scrambled with cheese) was far greater than any side order that I have recieved anywhere else and the bacon was prepared to perfection.  Very satisfied with our experience.  I am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Food was delicious and the server was friendly.  Personally, I don't like coming here over the weekend, very long waiting time.  Spinach, Bacon, Mushroom Omelette topped with creamy hollandaise sauce is my favorite food."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast Benedict place. Good service, nice booths, good coffee. They even have the rarest jam, blackberry!"}
{"text":"To quote my wife \"The best waffle she ever had in her life & it doesn't need syrup!\"  Place is pretty busy but they seat you fast and the service is always friendly.    The eggs are really good and you can add cheese and even get stuffed French toast with eggs.   Kids love the waffles and prices are really good for what you get.    The waffle \"Sugar & Spice\" (Pumpkin Pecan) is the one my wife said was the greatest ever and it might be seasonal so for that reason alone we will be back next weekend."}
{"text":"Kellie was the best server ever!!!  The food was good, but Kellie was great!  I hope they treasure her.  The kids had chocolate chip pancakes which they all enjoyed.  The sausage patties got rave reviews from my son and I enjoyed my omelet with turkey sausage and cheese (I think the onions were forgotten but not the end of the world).  All in all a good experience came at about 10:30 on a Saturday and only had like a 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"Great place to check out on a Sunday morning. Our server was quick and pleasant.  The food is pretty consistant and we rarely need to wait too long for our table or our food.   One of our go to spots for a Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff. I had the Greek frittata it was amazing. The Apple cinnamon granola pancake is absolutely incredible. Ordered it for dessert. Only thing I might change, next time I'll order the pancake for an appetizer so I can enjoy it before I get too full."}
{"text":"The food was ABSOLUTELY UNREAL! Service was wonderful, but the wait was a little bit long. That's not something the restaurant can control of course, so ultimately, I'm extremely happy with my experience here! Very delicious."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good and there is rarely a long wait.  The prices are less than other Madison breakfast options and they pride themselves on the quality of what they serve.  There is plenty of parking and seating for large groups.  Only downfall is they don't serve Blood Mary's, but their crispy bacon makes up for it!"}
{"text":"GREAT customer service. I watched the owner/manager walk an elderly lady out to her car and carry her food for her. He went by every table to ask how everything was. I haven't seen customer service like that at a restaurant in a long time!"}
{"text":"We have been there several times. Love the unique menu and the nice staff. Our food has always been top notch. A tad pricy but seems to be worth it."}
{"text":"I told the server I could not have any dairy or soy because I am nursing a 6 month old with a severe allergy to both. She seemed to understand and said she would check with the kitchen. My food came out about 10 min after the rest of the table, which was just annoying. After eating a piece of salad, I noticed it was sweet, Most likely a dressing. Knowing almost every salad dressing has soy in it, I asked the waiter and she confirmed it did have soy in it. The owner came out but not to apologize. Just to tell me that they take food allergies seriously. Obviously not the case. They did not offer to bring me out something else or fix my meal and charged me for the meal even though I could not eat half of it. The worse part is that even though I only ate a small piece of salad, my baby is now screaming in pain with terrible diapers. This is so irresponsible of a restaurant. I should have stayed home. Won't be going back.  Update: the restaurant replied saying they take food allergies seriously but did not apologize for what happened to me and my baby. They did not offer to rectify my experience and later deleted their reply when asked by another reviewer what they were going to do to change my opinion of them. Pathetic all around."}
{"text":"The menu and atmosphere are similar to that of First Watch, however that place has gone downhill over the past 2 years in service and cleanliness. I greatly enjoyed my experience at the Egg & I for an early breakfast on a Saturday afternoon.  Came in as a single diner, there is not a counter for singles or quick dining, but was seated right away as it was before 8am. Ordered a Corned Beef Hash skillet and it was mighty fantastic. Service was wonderful, with my server obviously being a long time employee of the establishment and food came out piping hot.  It is a smaller restaurant so large parties may have to wait longer. As I was leaving close to 9am, there was a wait list so come early with a big appetite because you don't want to leave any of the homemade goodness behind. Portions are just right, not too big and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The Egg I Am was satisfactory.  I didn't try anything too hard to make (blueberry pancake, scrambled eggs with cheese and bacon).  It was all good, but nothing to write home about.  I would certainly return for another breakfast, except for one thing--the price.  With coffee, tax and tip it was over $17 for one person.  Now, I will say, you're getting one ENORMOUS pancake and maybe next time I'll split with someone, which would make the cost more reasonable in my estimation.  Great service, pleasant atmosphere.  Don't shy away, just be prepared for the prices."}
{"text":"Showed up for breakfast at 615 left at 625 with no service. Great place to eat, but no one came up to greet us or seat us. We won't be coming back. At least have a bell to let yall know someone has popped in to eat."}
{"text":"Incredible food, incredible service, amazing prices, fed a family of 5 breakfast for under $70."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Very home style kind of dishes, but they can be elegant too. The staff is always friendly. If you get in on a day it's not busy, you can be seated and fed in 15 minutes. It's super busy on weekends and holidays, but that's because this is a good restaurant. The only thing I didn't like was the OJ, I've had better for a lower price, but I'm satisfied overall!"}
{"text":"Besides the fact that our waitress was incredibly rude and customer service means a lot when you're paying for semi over priced breakfast. I would say the food was simple. My bread was burnt and I asked the waitress for another one and she looked at me as if I was the worst person in the world for not wanting black burnt bread. We couldn't even enjoy or breakfast because of her. The food was unsatisfactory, the customer service was a negative star. The best part when we got up to pay in the front I was informed that she was the manager by my friend who has been there before and the manager herself was upset with us. She didn't get a tip from me because I was planning on giving it in cash and I paid for my meal with my card. So then she whispered to her waitress and said give her 2$ since she didn't get a tip. And I looked at her like can you give me a second to take out my cash. Is this really how your treat all your customers? If so, you don't really deserve your position. Definitely won't return and I plan on telling my friends not to either!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty meh. I don't think they make anything from scratch. Nothing tasted terrible, just nothing special. I had the vive le France french toast combo and it was edible but not great. The prices are pretty reasonable and they can easily accommodate large groups but there are so many good brunch places in Madison and this just doesn't really compare."}
{"text":"One day I saw The egg and I manager on channel 3's \"the restaurant show' which is a weekly review of different local restaurants in Madison. Seeing that made me curious due to the presentation of the dish they had on the show and the fact that they specialize in just breakfast dishes. So today my girlfriend and I went to eat there and tried a couple of dishes which were both benedicts (can't remember the names) Overall they were ok. One egg was poached good and the other was over cooked. The dish was pretty cold too and the side potatoes were rather bland. The part that left a bad taste in my mouth was when I went to pay the bill. There were two girls at the register which one of em was saying a lot of stuff you wouldn't say working in a restaurant business. \"My manager wants me stick around and talk to customers, I Just need my money \" It was rather unprofessional being that the food was meh and she seemed rather rude to the table sitting next to us. I'd save your money and go to a place with a decent breakfast. As you can see all the mediocre reviews it definitely has a lot of work as far as food quality and service professionalism."}
{"text":"I had breakfast there with my wife this past week.  I tried just basic ol' biscuits and gravy and their sausage gravy was definitely one of the better I've had. The ranch potatoes are seasoned enough for you to get the ranch flavor but not so strong as to slap you across the face with it. They also know how to cook crisp bacon properly without burning it. That's a decidedly rare thing.   The only thing that I think could've improved my experience is some seasoning on the eggs and that's just a hope rather than a need. They were good as is.  My wife had peaches and cream french toast. It was very good, subtle hints of cinnamon and vanilla, but also very sweet. She had scrambled eggs, as well, and they were slightly undercooked but still decent.  The actual waitress was great. Responsive but not hovering.   There was some awkwardness with the hostess, however. She stared at us vacantly, no greeting. When we talked to her she appeared out of it and was very confused by some basic details of her job. It was strange enough to be noteworthy.   Of the breakfasts out I've had in Madison they'd be in the top 10 I've experienced thus far."}
{"text":"I got the heuvos rancheros and was disappointed because it wasn't authentic. It was refried beans on a tortilla with an egg on top, so it was really a taco. The chorizo wasn't very spicy and the green chilies and pork topping had very little pork and chiles. My friend got the eggs, bacon, with hollandaise sauce and loved it, gave it five stars so it must be I ordered poorly."}
{"text":"I love this spot for brunch meetups with my friends. The portions are large, the service is friendly, the food is yummy. They always take good care of us and I love their healthy options."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious and wholesome menus options. Breakfast potatoes are the best in town."}
{"text":"Used to be great. Now there's crappy service, the manager sucks and they are always messing up our order. This is the last time we are going there"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is incredible. I can barely bring myself to get anything but the Cambridge Skillet but whenever I do it is incredible. Love that they have calorie counts on their website. They have plenty of healthy options as well.   My one gripe is that on more than one occasion I've noticed staff being rude to their coworkers. Mainly in the form of talking down whether it be a manager or waiter - I've seen both. That is not ok. You would think that working at the same restaurant would inspire a team atmosphere rather than condescension and power trips.   Food is great though!"}
{"text":"Nothing special IMO. Long wait to get seated and for food. Server wasn't paying attention to things we requested. Wasn't outrageously bad, but we won't be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for breakfast around 8:30. The restaurant is clean and casual/comfortable. It wasn't too crowded and there were plenty of tables open, but the place got super crowded within about 15 minutes of our arrival, so I'm gad we got there when we did.  I had the chicken apple sausage scramble, which had plenty of vegetables and came with fruit and an english muffin. I wish it had a little more flavor- like maybe more seasoning or a stronger cheese. It was good, but a little on the bland side.  My husband had corned beef hash and said it was decent.    The only way I can describe the service is....strange.  Everyone we encountered there was awkward and just a little...off. It's hard to explain other than that it was off-putting.  The host seemed totally overwhelmed by the decision of where to seat us, our waitress walked back by our table as we were finishing our meal and appeared surprised- like she'd forgotten all about us. The kid at the counter when we left did not smile and in fact barely acknowledged our presence. So the whole vibe was just a little uncomfortable, and while the food was decent, I wouldn't say that it was so awesome that we'd make a special trip to go there again."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointed in our visit. Waitress seemed cranky and not interested, food took forever, and it came out wrong. Waited forever for our waitress to check on us, sent our food back and it came out wrong again. I just ate my omelette since at this point the whole table was done eating. No apologies, not even an acknowledgment from management. Bad service and mediocre food at best. Save your money!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried The Egg I Am 3 different times and have enjoyed our breakfast food every single time.  We've tried the Athena scramble, the MBA frittata and (just today) the raspberry granola pancake.  All of the items were great, but the raspberry granola pancake was probably one of THE BEST pancakes we have ever tasted.  Crunch, nutty, slightly sweet and delicious.  It, kind of, tastes like raspberry pie.  We're going back to try the pineapple/coconut pancake and also the cinnamon apple pancake.  Try it, you'll love it.  We haven't had any problems with the service and got our food quickly.  They tend to get busy, so if you don't like waiting use their call-ahead seating."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast.  Was a short wait even at 10:30am on a Monday.  Serving sizes were very large.  We will for sure return especially when we have guests in town."}
{"text":"A very popular breakfast spot in Queen Creek. Lots to choose from for breakfast & lunch. Good it's good &, the service too. This is my 2nd time here."}
{"text":"What an absolute joke this place is!  We were told the wait would be 20 min. 45 minutes later we were told 15 minutes & the entire time there were many empty tables, 10 at last count. When I asked why we are all waiting so long the answer was, my manager asked me to stop seating tables for a while. I understand the kitchen needing to catch up, but it was ridiculous & completely unprofessional.  Won't be back until we see the manager name on the door change, because this lady has no clue what she's doing!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  Lots of egg dishes on the menu but what breakfast place doesn't have egg options?  The prices are a wee too high.  The food is fine but it feels crowded, and not in the convivial \"oh hey it's family style dining\" kind of way.  I wouldn't be opposed to going again but I go to many brunch places, but this place....only been there once, haven't really had the urge to go back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service. It was clear my \"over easy\" eggs came out with a hard yolk but the server didn't seem to care. I ordered the huevos rancheros which came out drowning in salsa that looked and tasted like it came out of a jar. As other reviews stated, food quality was on par with Denny's but much more pricey."}
{"text":"It's rare to say breakfast is amazing, usually good or fare is my standard response. But this is amazing. All the ingredients are good. The choices are great.  Service has been above average, very attentive. Our new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Serves traditional breakfast items.  Food is good...gave me the impression of a typical fly-by breakfast joint...nothing really stood out.  Service and food were good and YES i would come here again."}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from my house so it is extremely convenient. We have been here a few times and the food was always good. We went in the other day and was disappointed that the menu has been completely re-done which eliminated my favorite meal (green chili chicken hash) and the prices seemed to have gone up. Still enjoyed the meal, but wish the menu hadn't changed."}
{"text":"NOTE: 4 STARS IS FOR THE FOOD. Service is a whole different story. Careful for the 16 year olds hosting because they'll likely drop the ball when you're there. I'm assuming that their inexperience and being overwhelmed by the high weekend volume is the cause for them to skip names. It's not the servers fault that they get double sat and lack in service because of it. I blame the hostesses. Also, they have no baby changing station. Isn't that illegal?   However, in their defense I like this breakfast restaurant more than their competitors (the good egg etc.). Their corned beef hash and biscuits and gravy are amazing!!!!  Great coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice, too!"}
{"text":"Biscuits and Gravy are always my go to, and they do not disappoint. The ranch potatoes weren't my favorite. Maybe it was the batch, but I think they were too salty maybe. Definitely will be back and hope to try some new things on the menu."}
{"text":"evrything was great but somehow didnt like the seeting , noisy old style dinner in nowdays breakfast service, dont know"}
{"text":"I love this place and can't go without getting the apple pancake. They are super accommodating. I'm pretty sure my dad never ordered off of the menu, but instead told the server what he was in the mood for and they would make it. It is basic breakfast food done well."}
{"text":"This place was really good. I took my parents who are the pickest when it comes to eating out. It even impressed them"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. Each time the service has been really slow and the wait staff unfriendly. This time, though, really takes the cake.  We put our name in at 10:45am for a 15-20 minute wait ... And we were seated at 11:40am. It happens. We instantly order since we had plenty of time to look at the menu and what do you know, by 12:30 our food still hadn't come. We had a 1pm appointment so we were hoping to get out in time. When we I quired about our food we were told it was ready to come out next. FOUR other tables then got their food and ours was STILL missing. One of us finally had to get up to see why our food was now over an hour late. Again we were told it was next in line. We were then also told by the waitress that \"this place sucks and is a piece of %+#:\" something we didn't expect to hear. Finally at 12:50pm our food came out...all except mine. And the server ACTUALLY looked at me and said \"oh, did you already eat?\" ARE YOU SERIOUS?! I said no and asked where my food was. I was reassured it was coming. 1pm, no food. I get up and tell them I have to leave for an appointment which I'm now late for and they tell me my food was just starting, meaning they lied and had totally forgotten my food. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good (could've been a little hotter) service was great ( they forgot my side of potatoes (which I really didn't need) and our server took $2 off the bill ! ) we'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing special. I work nearby, so it's convenient. Corned beef hash is awful. Most food comes out barely warm. Eggs almost always over cooked. If it wasn't nearby when I'm starving, I'd pass."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast chow, in a nice setting coupled w/ friendly service.  Broad menu and our party were all pleased w/ their food.  Biscuits and gravy were just okay, but the pork sausage patties were very tasty.  Sole potato option is of the diced variety, and it would be nice if hash browns were added to the menu.  Service was friendly and efficient.   We arrived on a Sunday before 8, and were immediately seated. By 0815, the place was nearly full.  Outdoor seating is plentiful, which was good for the sweaty bicyclists that arrived en masse after their road workout.  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"Love trying new places and we have been to this restaurant in a few other cities when traveling.  It's an open type feel which isn't too warming.  Our food has been pretty good.  Omelets and frittatas.  The veggies were fresh.  Sometimes the service is a little mixed up.  Order the flavored coffee.  We would recommend it, but timing on weekends is essential.  Our wait would have been 20 minutes had we stayed last weekend.  We chose to go to the Original Pancake House instead!"}
{"text":"The host was super nice. Our waitress was very friendly as well. The food looked amazing when it arrived, and once we bit in we were not disappointed. I had the special cranberry & almond flapper with yogurt, bacon & an egg. My husband had the corned beef hash. Both were spectacular."}
{"text":"First visit today. Nice clean place and no wait on this Tuesday morning @8:30. Our waitress was very friendly and efficient. I chose the Eggs Benedict which came with thier ranch seasoned home fries. My eggs were cooked perfectly, thank you. My friend had the French toast which came on a platter sized plate, they were quite large. It was noted the french toast wasn't spectacular...more like grilled bread was her description, they could have used more batter and maybe some vanilla. The coffee was very good. All-in-all it was a success and I will definitely return. I do have to say it was a bit spendy for breakfast. Our bill for two was $22 & change before tax & tip."}
{"text":"This is a nice little breakfast spot. The coffee they serve is fresh and they even have special blends (the caramel crunch was terrific!). My wife ordered the huevos rancheros and I ordered the apple cinnamon pancake with bacon. Overall the food was okay. The most disappointing part were the potatoes.... I didn't even touch them after the first bite. It was nice to try something different but I don't think I'd drive past the good egg, I hop, or snooze to go come here again."}
{"text":"This really is a great restaurant with good menu choices.  The host was very disorganized and quiet.  If you need to wait for a table make sure you park yourself right next to the hostess and keep checking for your place in line.  Did not go out of her way at all to be helpful or heard.  Good is excellent."}
{"text":"I had made a phone order knowing it was mothers day and how packed everywhere was going to. I made a phone order to The Egg & I, the lady took my order, repeated it back to me and then told me it would be 20 minutes before it was ready. I get there a few minutes before the 20 minutes up and checked in with the cashier to check on my order for pick up. She started looking and had me tell her my name then a few minutes later she asked me what I ordered, I tell what I ordered and she just says hmmm it doesn't look like its in yet, then I tell her, I called 20 minutes ago, waitress took my order, didn't give me a name, but tells me 20 minutes. She said okay let me just go to the back and check on it. Anyways 15 minutes after I call and placed my order and then 20 minutes of waiting there just to find out my order was never put in at all. They take my order, the cashier just tells me sorry and offers $5 off my bill. When i get home for my husband and I to eat, our food was sooo disappointing and a waste of what we did pay. My husbands waffle was soggy, bacon was soggy, my veggie Benedict was also very disappointing, the veggies were half cooked, and then just thrown into the container, and I found a little plastic thing in my potatoes. And note we only live 6 minutes away from this place. So food shouldn't have been soggy at all, it was over all a very disappointing experience and i don't think we will be getting food from here again."}
{"text":"Everything about this place AMAZING! Really good food and great and friendly servers! Never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Good service, great prices, and excellent food!  I was very impressed with this place and certainly look forward to going back.  The quality of food was superb while also still allowing for home style cooking taste.  Definitely a place for brunch after a night of partying.  Can't wait to go back for some biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"There is great joy in your first cup of coffee when they serve you the roast you prefer, in your own insulated carafe, with a small pitcher of fresh cream! The breakfasts are really good too, but honestly you had me at \"Hazelnut or Dark Roast\"...."}
{"text":"Over priced with average food and quantity isn't there. Nice place with decent service but two greasy spoons close by are way better."}
{"text":"My parents actually turned us onto this place (usually we're the ones to introduce them to new places). We went on a Sunday around 11, they were pretty packed but we were seated quickly enough. The place has a quaint, country charm vibe.  Our waiter was very attentive and after realizing how fast we go through iced tea and water he brought us adorable little pitchers! My Mom and I ordered the eggs benedict. I liked everything but the ham (I'm not big on ham to begin with though). I'm very picky about my poached eggs being cooked properly and can go all Gordon Ramsey if they're messed up. They were perfect! I really loved the hollandaise too.I forget what my Dad and hubby ordered but they loved theirs as well.   We'll definitely be going back here regularly!"}
{"text":"Yep, this place has your standard breakfast fare. I had the huevos rancheros (so-so) and a bit of the veggie omelette (pretty \"standard issue\"-- not bad). I wouldn't say there's anything to write home about here."}
{"text":"The food and service at The Egg I Am are so inconsistent as to make frequenting here irritating. My husband ordered the Colorado Jack Scramble and enjoyed every bite. My 14-year old son tried the Cheddar Burger, which he noted, while tasty, was very greasy (not juicy, greasy). I tried the special Peaches & Cream French Toast, which tasted just okay. It was not prepared as described, the temperature was tepid, and the peaches were canned and sparse.  As for the service, we were hopeful that we would be seated in Debbie's section but, alas, no such luck. Instead, our service was compulsory and falsely cordial. We received our order long after two other tables (in Debbie's section) who were seated well after us, and were largely neglected save for the requisite \"How is everything\" asked on the run. The check was dropped 1/3 of the way through our meal - a clear sign that our server was done with us, whether we needed anything else or not.  So, while I'm certain we'll return, if only because of the restaurant's proximity to many of our other activities and the potential of a reasonable meal, we'll be sure to specify our choice of server or manage our expectations accordingly."}
{"text":"Went to the Egg I am for the first time.  We wanted to try something different and came across this place through yelp.  There were a lot of great reviews so we decided to give it a go!  Loved it!  Food was delicious, reasonably priced and everyone was super friendly.  Our order was placed and arrived at our table with in 5 minutes..It was so fast!    The restaurant itself is a typical looking breakfast atmosphere...not huge, which I like.  We ate outside on the patio which I love to do when the weather here in AZ. permits  If you are looking for a new breakfast place, give this one a go.  Looks like they have a great lunch menu as well."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly delicious!! Not much for atmosphere, but the food was incredible, healthy, tasty, and fast. Would absolutely recommend for brunch!"}
{"text":"A fun breakfast place and our waiter was very nice. The food was pretty good but not the best I have had. Also I didn't like how you had to go to the cash register and pay which was right next to where you also would check in for a table. These were also both located right by the front door. So this caused some congestion. Anyways I would probably go there again not too bad."}
{"text":"Came back again as promised yesterday.  Ordered the huevos rancheros with the chorizo and both salsas.  In a word, they knocked it out of the park and Mary Ellen was as usual awesome.  Added a desert of the new lemon blueberry pancakes.  The lemon pudding/filling used as a spread is a little disappointing.  I'd suggest lemon zest mixed in to the batter.  The array of berries on top was solid.    Definitely better than my first trip here on 3/24."}
