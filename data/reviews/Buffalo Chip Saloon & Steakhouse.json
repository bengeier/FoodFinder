{"text":"Food was OK, tried the BBQ chicken and the brisket.  Both were dry, and the BBQ sauce was average at best.   Only got one biscuit, inspite of  asking for two.    Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Had never heard of this place until last week.  A friend of mine was bull riding on Friday night, so I decided to check this place out.  It only took me 30 minutes to get there...  but, this place felt like world's away!!!    Country-type of atmosphere.  Cowboy hats and boots were abundant!  And the place is really big.  You can do a $10 food buffet outside or go into the back, sit down, eat, drink, and listen to some tunes.  And if you're brave, you can even get up and dance!  Also, every Friday night is bull riding.  This was, by far, my favorite part of the evening.  There were 3 rounds.  My friend rode on the 1st bull in the 1st round.  They randomly select which person will ride which bull.  Some people can't stay on, but others stayed on for the full 8 seconds.  It was really neat to watch!    I would highly recommend this place.  Especially if you need to get away from the hustle, bustle, and craziness of the city."}
{"text":"I agree device is terrible food worse. This is all show but the show is not worth it. A tourist trap. Worst meal we had in a week at Care Free. Too many goog places for barbecue avoid this one."}
{"text":"My friends took me to Buffalo Chip for the first time last night and what an amazing night it was! The bartenders are great, I love that they have dancing and live music, and it was fun to watch the bull riding. It would be rough during the summer that they do so much outside but since they just finished restoring the inside, I don't know if everything being outside is normal or they just haven't moved it back in yet. During the fall though, it's perfect.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was fantastic. I'm not a huge BBQ fan but I will order that again and again. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they have the Smirnoff Coolers.   I didn't give it 5 stars because our waitress was a bit slow. I know that it was busy but she couldn't remember our drink orders very well. We preferred to go the drinks from the bar ourselves. The drinks were a bit on the pricey side but other than that, I very much enjoyed my time there.   Someone who I think is the manager stopped by a few times to see how we were doing, but he never introduced himself so I don't know for sure."}
{"text":"Took a colleague who is from China to experience something a bit different. The atmosphere was unique. The waitress was very prompt and helpful. However, the barbecue (brisket, pulled pork) was subpar - very dry, over cooked. Far from the best barbecue..."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go out in Cave Creek, hands down. Not only is this a staple for those of us who live here, but a great place for those visiting to get a taste of Arizona Cowboy nightlife. This is a BBQ joint through and through, with my personal favorite being the Beef Brisket Sandwich. The meat itself is always cooked perfectly and the portions are generous. For a fun dessert, try the smores you get to cook right at your table! Whether you're going for Bull riding on Friday nights or to listen to Pat James, you're guaranteed to have a fun night."}
{"text":"Neat when first walk in.  Then tables are terribly uncomfortable, menu is puny.  Food is average at best.  Too many other really good places!"}
{"text":"Are you a cowboy? A cowgirl? A honky-tonker? A wanna be? Or just a person who loves one-off places? Then this is the place for you. This place is legit and right out of a tombstone movie. At any minute you feel like a duel could start or a bucking bronco could come through the door. Besides that, the food and drink are great and the clientele is amazing (read:real cow pokes). Do it, you know you want to."}
{"text":"We visited the Buffalo Chip this past Friday night with our two teenage children and it was a very fun experience.  The bull riding was exciting to watch, the food was good and served quickly and the band was amazing. It is open air which my family really enjoys but you may have to deal with a few bugs as a result. As it is a saloon, the atmosphere is loud and crowded, so if you are looking for a quiet sit down meal, this isn't the place, but if you want a real taste of the southwest, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Live bull riding, fire pits and outdoors bars?! What a great venue! Dress for the weather and head out to see the live bull riding. From the patriotic opening ceremony to live action riding and no cover. Yep, go check it out!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork & brisket are awesome! Great, tentative staff, delicious food & the bull riding on Friday is fun to watch! We will go back!"}
{"text":"buffalo chip is awesome.  the bull riding is the real deal and you can expect to see some very tough, young cowboys beaten up a bit by the bulls.  there's a country band and dancing inside, a few bars, bonfires, fish fry and barbecue-everything a person needs for an authentic cowboy experience.  it's very family friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for a group of friends to watch the Friday night bull riding....but please note that you have to be 21+ to enter unless you have a parent (even if you're 20 years old)! It doesn't matter whether you plan on drinking or not, but they are STRICT about letter underagers in. Not to mention I was ID'd at the entrance, when I ordered a drink, and again just walking around with a drink in my hand.  Good fun for those that are 21+, just don't invite your underage friends...they'll have to go home!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute dump, with the worst type of people operate this pile of shit. The owner told me to fuck off, after my kid fell from a a faulty high chair they provided. If you are white trash this is your place!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times but sad to say will NEVER eat here again. The food has gone from good to average to awful.  Fried chicken was very over cooked and greasy-the Fried chicken used to be amazing here. The brisket sandwich was the size of a slider all food was served at room temp. Both the mens and ladies restrooms were had toilets overflowing no soap or towels. Where do the employees wash their hands? They used to have JJohns out back to help with the large number of people on Friday night to watch the bull riding. They are now gone and far too many people for the restrooms to handle in a sanitary manner.  Will eat at Harold's first from now on!"}
{"text":"Typical cowboy joint...loud music, sawdust floors, hanging boots from ceiling. Parking was tight. Waitress was quick in refilling drinks, but long time for the meal. Two of our party was served 40 mins after order taken, the rest of us did not get our meals for another 20 mins. Food was average, French fries were cold. Well not be returning soon."}
{"text":"Wanted to go back and do lunch to see the place after reopening after their fire last November. Yes it was lunch time and they were busy but we had three waitresses look at us as as the table had not Been cleared and quickly walked away. Never saying they would be right with us or anything. Other tables with people also not being acknowledged. We waited about 15 minutes and decided to leave and went across the parking lot to Harolds. No excuse for bad service. Reopening not brand new and with tongue in cheek I say this wasn't their first rodeo. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Baby back ribs were tough and chewy. Yech!!! Beans had no flavor.  My wife had pulled pork that was horrible. Had to spend $35 to find out this place is a dump. Had to buy another lunch down the road at Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"I recently visited Arizona for the first time and I visited the Buffalo Chip almost every day I was there. It's certainly the place to go for a good time. They have a good beer selection, my favorite being the Sculpin. The waitresses were very accommodating, the bartenders were friendly, and the managers really go the extra mile to put a smile on a customer's face. Can't wait to go back to Cave Creek and see all my new friends at the Chip!"}
{"text":"This is a WI-FI Review        When at a restaurant, coffee shop or other business,  I, like many other people these days want internet access  using my IPod or IPhone through a free WI-FI connection.        The Buffalo Chip Saloon does have WI-FI but it is marginal at best. If you are sitting at the bar inside \"The Shack In the Back\" which is part of the outside patio, the connection is pretty good. Twenty feet away, at the outside bar, the connection comes and goes - mostly goes, and forget about sitting at any of the tables.        I'm not even sure if the WI-FI here is intended for public use, it's locked and requires a password to connect. I asked an employee and they did give me the password. Overall the bottom line here is the system could use some work - maybe an additional access point to cover the outside area. Additionally it would be nice not to have to enter a password. Too bad about the WI-FI because this is one of my favorite places in Cave Creek. 2 stars for The Buffalo Chip Saloon on their WI-FI.                                          Food and Drink        They have 22 oz. cold Amber Boch beer and buckets of free salted in the shell peanuts, a definite plus!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Chip on many occasions and always have a great time. The atmosphere is so much fun! They always have pretty great service. One particular time the service was absolutely amazing. I made sure to catch our servers name.. Elizabeth. It was a fairly busy evening and she was on top of her game, never forgot about us. She was extremely reliable.. Anytime we needed anything, there she was! She was also very sweet and seemed like she genuinely cared about giving great service. I would be happy to have her as my server anytime!"}
{"text":"Friday night is a nightmare. The arrangement at the new building is long tables in rows too close to each other. When someone gets out to the dance floor or to the bar or wherever, all have to get up and squeeze to let them pass through. Very annoying. We used to go to Buffalo Chip a lot before it burnt down. No more. Not worth it. Luckily there is more competition now."}
{"text":"can not wait for the grand reopening. miss the place!!!!! the fire was horrible!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fun on Friday nights for watching the bull riding but the restaurant is just terrible.  It was so packed people couldn't move inside.  There were 2 lanes of people trying to get in and out.  The line for the women's bathroom wrapped all the way around the inside of the restaurant and the toilets weren't working properly.  The food is ok and not expensive but the service is some of the worst I've experienced.  The waitresses wander around aimlessly with seemingly no assigned tables.  You have to flag them down to get any kind of service and they'll sometimes look directly at you and keep walking.    What should have been a quick meal turned into an hour long exercise in frustration that included mediocre food and excessively loud music.  Bottom line, don't bother.  Go across the parking lot to Harold's.  There's still live music, the service is much better, food is comparable, it's less crowded and easier to move around.  I won't be going back to Buffalo Chip.  As its name implies, it's shit."}
{"text":"Went looking for Mexican food in Cave Creek and stumbled upon Buffalo Chip.  Great country feeling bar, peanuts on the floor.  Being Christmas night service was a little slow, but free two step lessons and nice country cover band.  I had the Brisket, had EXCELLENT cowboy beans and the best biscuit with honey poured over the top.  For dessert try the Smoors at your table.  Friday night they have Bull Riding and an old fashion covered wagon cookout."}
{"text":"This must have changed owners from the last time that we visited.  You now have to pay for refills for sodas and there was a hair in my food.  The waitress said that the manager was kind of mean so he wasn't going to discount our meal even though I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Took the family here for the bullriding! It was very fun! It had a very cool cowboy set up! I've lived in this area for awhile and never been here. Food was alright bartender was on the snotty side. I will come back for the entertainment"}
{"text":"Fun place, friendly people as well. Great service, we weren't sure we would make it by the time they stopped serving dinner so we called, the guy on the phone let us put in an order so we wouldn't miss out. I like that kind of friendly service"}
{"text":"Bull riding Friday nights!  Heck yeah!    Definitely a good time.  Bon fires and beers and men in tight jeans.  Cant beat it.  There's usually a band playing inside too, it's so cute watching older couples two-step together.  Aww...  Bathrooms are a bit rough though.  Try and hold it..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had a reservation for 40 people and they didn't have a space for us and stuck us in the back corner. Once they sat us 30 mins later the service was okay and the food which is buffet style took 45 mins for burgers and fries. The BBQ was good. Very busy and they weren't ready for the crowds. Would of had a better burger at In n Out."}
{"text":"It still has the feel of the old buffalo chip which I love! Good food! cold beer! Great place go watch a packers game! Great stafff"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun - especially for out of town guests. Friday night bull riding was a riot. Definitely DO NOT eat here.  For $15 it is all you can eat FAT rinds. My slice of beef had literally no beef. One guy trying to carve chicken, sausage, beef and doll out pulled pork by himself as the line wrapped around the coral. Want refills?  Stand in line again!  One waiter told me I didn't need to stand in line but to go up and butt in front of people who were in line waiting. No set rules on this feed and I couldn't see fighting my way t get another piece of gristle. One out of town guest was so turned off after first bite he couldn't continue to eat.  Nice enough people - just go for the drinks and bull riding but don't bother with the food. YUK!!"}
{"text":"Beers & Bull riding = Great!  Service & Management = Poor!  After waiting 2 hours for our food- the order was completely wrong AND our bimbo server Sherri forgot a meal!  By this time, the band started at 8pm.  We were the ONLY table left in the middle of the dance floor with cowboys two-stepping around us!  Sherri asked our table of 10 (including our pregnant sister) to move to another table.  This table didn't exist! We stood around, being pushed and shoved, while asking to see the Manager Mark - who conveniently avoided our group. They finally threw a picnic table cloth over a pool table and posted us up there.  Mark \"made up\" for the chaos by buying us a round of drinks??!!  Cheers  to you Mark.  You just lost our business!   Bottom line: Ask for ANY other server than Sherri, make sure you don't get seated on the dance floor anywhere after 6pm AND for large group dinners-- this is NOT the place to go.  I'd like to throw Mark & Sherri in the Bull Rink and make them both Rodeo Clowns for the night!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim to get out of the house and picked it based on reviews.  Don't come for lunch and expect anything but 10 items to choose from on the menu.  Bbq plate was ok, fatty brisket and a strong vinegar based sauce.  Beans were bleh and breaded mushrooms were frozen. Waitress was very nice though.  We will go to Harolds next time"}
{"text":"This was mine and my wife's first time here we loved the atmosphere and the live music was great. But when it came to the food I was extremely unimpressed my wife had the beer but chicken that she wouldn't even eat it was so dry and rubbery and I had the 3/4 pound ribeye for $20 it came out extremely thin not saying it was not the right size but it was on the slim side I ordered it at med rare it was a good med we'll. and on the services to start I asked her for my stake to be cooked Pittsburg style she looked at me and said this isn't a stake house. At the end she brought our bill we were with two others she had all the items on the wrong checks and even on both we tolled her what was wrong so she could fix it no big deal we'll she did not fix it and ran the card anyways so that took us another 35 min to get it all fixed. I gave two stars for the environment and a food time. I may go back but not for food!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to the guy that was doing the BBQ, but the new cook doesn't know what BBQ is. It is horrible now, we won't be back for the buffet if this new cook is there. No flavor and tough. Very disappointed, too bad we were planning on having a party there but not now."}
{"text":"I would like to break up my review into two parts. First, the food- it is not good.  With the exception of the Onion Rings- everything else was less than mediocre.  Within our group we tried the pork sandwich, rib eye, a salad and the fish fry.  I definitely do not recommend this place for the food.  (although we did eat outside and on this particular evening there was an outside buffet which may have been better).  Second- the bull riding on Friday nights- great fun and very entertaining!  These bull riders were the real deal and the crowd and ambience was great.  Big bonfires, drinks, bleachers, etc.  Next time I will definitely eat dinner somewhere else and then head over to BC for the bull riding and drinks only."}
{"text":"This was just a bad night. Food was good. Waiter was friendly. Service was astonishingly horrible. Food came out haphazardly if at all. Some of us  didn't get our food at all. Granted it just reopened. They may have employment issues but truly the worse service imaginable."}
{"text":"It would be really hard to find a more authentic western saloon (it is so western that it would be silly to call it a \"bar\"). Not only is it a great place to hang out, drink, eat, and dance to live (country) music but on Wednesdays and Fridays they have actual bull riding competitions (and I am not talking about mechanical bulls but real, live, mean bulls). And to top it all off, the drinks are pretty cheap."}
{"text":"If you're into country music and and dancing this place is ideal. Drinks aren't very cheap but it's very homey and hard to feel out of place. On Friday nights there is live bull riding, bonfires and BBQ. Not much more you can ask for in my opinion. Being from Tempe it's a little out of my way but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Tried the smoked brisket. better than what it use to be (#excellent). Atmosphere was family friendly and the bull riding was very entertaining."}
{"text":"The place is awesome!....the atmosphere, service, entertainment and food. You can go inside to dance and get cooled off or enjoy the live bull riding and entertainment outdoors."}
{"text":"Staff is indifferent. We were left standing at door wondering if we should seat ourselves, which we did given that we were completely ignored and they were not even busy. Nachos for 4? NOT! NOTHING like they were before fire..... Staff doesn't have answers for anything. they basically shrug and walk away- no personality, at all. Service slow slow slow. Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Country music, decor and dance floor, although it all could use a good dusting. Waitress was so cute and helpful. My highlight... I am from WI, 16 years in Green Bay, so pulling up to Packer flags waving a huge \"Packer Fans Welcome\" banner and fried cheese curds and brat bites on the menu! Heaven! I've had better barbeque, but it really didn't matter!  I'd love to be there this Sunday for the playoff game! Go Pack and go to Buffalo Chip Saloon!!"}
{"text":"The bull riding is great on Wed and Friday nights! Bartenders are great and work so hard especially on game days. Food is ok. Nothing to brag about. Cheese curds are good and very much like Wisco taste and texture. Brats are not like Wisco at all and was not a fan but maybe it's different out here in the wild west. All you can eat bbq could use some work. Wasn't all that great. Meat was fatty and lots of bones. I have a great time here and the atmosphere is fun. Now here is the issue...  Organization for the events needs to be better. I made reservations 3 weekends in a row. All the reservations were messed up. I called several times each week starting early in the week to confirm my seats and never got a call back. The first time I got there and was put in the vip room which was fine. I got there at 1130, got seated and then went down to the bar with my family. Came back up to vip room about 2 right before the game and people were in our seats. Which is fine but we nicely asked them to move and they claimed they were given those seats. So we moved down Cuz they were starting to cause a scene and I didn't want to fight and ruin the day. Had somebody just told us hey we moved to u guys down a few seats then it would have been avoided and no awkwardness at the table. Anyway we got over that..made reservations for the next two weekends and again no call back to confirm. We showed up and we had asked for Bar seats in front of a TV and they didn't have our reservation. Alright. Frustrating.  They did squeeze us in at the bar but we had to stand for 30 minutes before they made 2 people move from the spots even tho we made reservations.  Several other people had problems with their reservations as well. I hate to complain too much Cuz in the end it was fun, the Bartenders and atmosphere are great. The even organization needs a lot of work though. The tent set up this last weekend was also a disaster. One TV, not enough wait staff. People kept coming in from the tent to order at the bar and hovering over myself and others, spilling their drinks all over us. Hopefully next packer season and future events will be planned Better. Jackie is a nice girl but maybe needs more help with reservations and a better system for keeping track of reservations and phone numbers."}
{"text":"Man oh man, this place is great. Not just for the delicious BBQ and other food, but for the actual establishment (sawdust on floor, line dancing, pool tables, ARM WRESTLING machine and BULL riding!) and the people. April was super nice and Bob the pit master is the greatest. See, we're into BBQ and he spent a lot of time with us - totally by chance, just came up to us and started talking. Showed us around his pits and even gave us tips for our home smoking! We genuinely had a great time and will definitely come back next time we get out west. Worth the trip you'll be glad you went."}
{"text":"Great local fare. Reasonable prices. I had the fish tacos, a surprising tasty meal for a cowboy saloon. The slaw recipe on top of the fish was wonderful. I would choose this again."}
{"text":"Food is the worst in Cave Creek. Should have eaten at the gas station counter. It was the first and last time we will go.  Actually signed up for Yelp just to review this trash heap of restaurant .  Took some friends from out of town,they had steak. Both steaks were raw, even though one was ordered medium well. sent both back, waited another 30min then they came out cold. I ordered the ribs that the waitress said were great, slow cooked and fall off the bone. These tasted like overcooked pork chops whose bones my two dogs would not even be able to clean.  Tonight I purchased ribs at the local grocery store they were MUCH better and reminded me to post this review.  Never go to this place...  The drinks were not even good. Want beer and country music? Turn on the radio, go to the gas station buy a COLD 12 Pack (yeah the beer in plastic cups was warm)"}
{"text":"The service is incredibly slow.  We have been sitting here for over 45 minutes and still no food.  At this point, I really don't care how good the food is, I'm so irritated that I don't want to eat it.  There is zero chance that I will ever come here."}
{"text":"I understand that this place is bar food but this place is amazingly bad. The food is the definition of bad. We were there on a Friday. There were eight of us and had a variety of food. 100% of it was consistently bad. Not just bad but really, really bad. If you go there, skip the food!  Just have a beer and definitely don't waste your money on the stuff they call food."}
{"text":"Wednesday night and you're looking for some fun?  Check out the live bull riding and cowboy buffet with live music later on indoors & s'mores.    Be quick about deciding exactly *which* meats you want though or they will pile up your plate with ALL OF THEM!!!  (I had meals for a couple of days...)    You sit on wooden bleachers to watch the bull riding from a few feet away from the ring.  Wow!  Haven't ever been that close to bull riding before!  Kind of makes me want to do the running of the bulls in Cave Creek in mid-October.  Had so much fun here, I really did!  I wasn't sure what to think before I went but had such fun I will definitely go back!  Tip:  Don't wear white pants and you'd probably better leave your stilettos at home.  It is pretty darned casual here."}
{"text":"Used to go to this place back when the smoking laws weren't in effect. It was very dark and you always left smelling like smoke. Now it is so much better! Good food and good times!"}
{"text":"If you go to Cave Creek you must go to the Buffalo Chip, Harold's , hideaway etc.  just great local restaurants in a great town north of Phoenix/Scottsdale.   I like the Chip more for drinking dancing and rodeo than the food. But it is okay for a little grub   But it is fun.  So try it"}
{"text":"I will never go back. We called and made reservations and were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We picked outside...and they neglected to tell us you cannot order a steak dinner...which they are supposedly known for, if you sit outside. That would have been nice too know."}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday to watch a good friend ride a bull on amateur bull riding night. The atmosphere was really cool with campfires and the old times bar. Waitstaff was really friendly and even had drink service in the grand stands. I did not eat so I cannot comment on the food. Overall if you want a cool place to grab a drink with free entertainment this is a great place!!!"}
{"text":"I've been enjoying the Buffalo Chip since 1995.  I took out of town friends there on Saturday April 1, 2017 and ordered 5 glasses of cabernet at $7 per glass,  tipping the waiter $5 cash.  My receipt said $7 each glass, but the Buffalo Chip charged my card $60 - for 5 glasses of cabernet ($12 for each $7 glass of cabernet - the charge on the receipt was $35).  I saw another reviewer on a Google site, who referenced \"greedy Larry\" (the alleged owner).  Well Larry, this is fraud - collecting an extra $25 for your bank account is illegal.  I intend on reporting the Buffalo Chip for their deceptive business practices. Larry shame on you for defrauding our winter visitors, along with the good citizens who live in the area. We don't need greedy, dishonest people running businesses in Cave Creek.  I won't be back and I will so advise everyone I know.  Word of mouth is powerful, as is Karma."}
{"text":"Had a blast on Friday night bull riding with my 13 year old son.  Spring for the VIP seats (call in advance to make a reservation).  Best $10 per person spent in a long time.  The food is acceptable - I wouldn't come just for the food - but still gets a 5 star from me because such great value and atmosphere."}
{"text":"First I think the more positive reviews are based on a bar and bull riding place and not so much the food and service. The good - the chuck burger was good. The bad - the Friday night fish fry is a definite pass. Dry fish and quite tasteless.  The choice sirloin was raw to rare when she ordered medium. Not seasoned at all. The Cowboys beans that came with it were good. The ugly - 30 minutes from being seated to waitress at the table. 40 minutes for water. The food was up 20 minutes after ordering. So an basically a hour to get food. Wife asked about the different kinds of fish and the server said, \"I don't know I don't eat fish!\"  Obviously no service training. A waiter should always know their menu regardless. If you are in a party mood then come for the fun and beer. Skip the food."}
{"text":"Went in there with my wife today. Got 4 cans of  beer for $10. Not a bad deal. I ordered 3 shots of fireball. Came out in three thimbles, figured about an ounce and a half total for all 3. $21, you kidding me. That should be criminal. Could have bought a bottle of fireball for that."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast service and worst breakfast food we've ever had.  We will probably never be back, fun place to dance and drink on a Friday night but horrible for a Sunday when you are starving and waiting an hour for food. Nothing was cooked to order... Yuck!"}
{"text":"Our friends in the South Valley didn't believe us when we told them there was a place close to our house to see live Bull riding on a Friday night. This is an experience that is worth taking a little drive. Cave Creek is cute as and the Buffalo Chip fits into the whole down home vibe of the place. We have been here during bike week and it is biker heaven. The crowd is happy and friendly - great for people watchers. The day we went they had a decent live band and people where dancing on the outdoor dance floor with the \"ghost town\" facade in the background. Friday nights (and Wednesdays) they have live Bull riding and all you can eat BBQ for $10. The food was good and the service was great. The owner personally took care of us and could not have been nicer. They lit a huge fire outside and it was truly magical to sit outside with a cold one, some BBQ and live cowboy entertainment. Perfect for kids...better for them than sitting at home playing video games!"}
{"text":"There were 14 of us ranging from 60+ to 5. We loved the atmosphere. We all loved the food as well. We all ordered something different including appetizers and it was all delicious. I am from Georgia as are 8 of the other guests. We are here visiting family and they suggested we all go. We will definitely come back our next trip out West."}
{"text":"Love this place. Recently enjoyed some bull riding action (watching of course) but the entire time it was SO dusty, it was a huge disappointment. And I'm not talking about just the bull riding- I mean, just the people walking around - it was super super dusty. Not cool. Otherwise looking forward to some fun nights with the great weather and their reopening!"}
{"text":"We had a great time on new year's eve. We enjoyed the band inside AND the bond fires and music outside. The staff was warm and friendly. The crowd was fun. It was a perfect night. Can't rate the food as we ate before arriving to party. Go there to get your cowboy and cowgirl fun on!"}
{"text":"Beyond fabulous atmosphere and character at this great Creeker bar. The food is pretty good, especially the wings and the pulled pork. The star are all super-friendly and the bullring  is a real crowd-pleaser on Wednesdays and Fridays. I love their bloody mary breakfast at the weekend. Fire pits, smores and cowboys, what's not to love!"}
{"text":"One of the big draws for us to hit up Buffalo Chip was that they offered free Western dance lessons! After we stuffed ourselves with Southern Fried chicken and half a rack of ribs, we sipped on some Apple Pie moonshine cocktails while the place slowly started to fill up.  I was honestly surprised at the number of regulars that showed up (dressed to the nines in their Western gear!), ready to dance the night away! We were taught the Western waltz, and it was so much fun since we had to switch up partners throughout the night and socialize.  The live band was a great and it was really fun to try something out of our norm."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Buffalo Chip on a Monday Night.  The restaurant was hosting a Christmas party for their employees.  Our group ordered 5 meals.  The two Brisket sandwiches ordered were dry, and not very flavorful.  The two Pulled pork sandwiches were almost as bad.  For the $100 spent on dinner and soft drinks we could have eaten better food for far less somewhere else.  Don't bother going here for the food, the only reason to go here is for the bull riding and bottled beer"}
{"text":"MAKE RESERVATIONS! The atmosphere was great - sawdust on the ground added to the ambiance! Green Bay Packer & WI Badger games televised live here! We had the \"buffet\" - 1lb of food for $10.97. Included in your pound are your sides (biscuit, beans, corn) & meat (chicken, rib tips, brisket, pulled pork) My pound included almost 1/4lb of fat and bones - brought this to the attention of our waitress (April) and her fix was to tell them next time that I don't want so much fat and bones. SUGGESTION: make reservations for 5ish & then watch bull riding on either Wednesday or Friday.  We wanted to do this but didn't eat til almost 7 - by the time we got out it was winding down - there are 2 sessions though. Fun for entire family - something different to do! Live country bands and dancing."}
{"text":"Very authentic cowboy bar, with outdoor fire pit, music and bulls riding show on Wednesday and Fridays."}
{"text":"This place is so fun!  Food is great. Especially the beef brisket, which can be ordered by the pound!  If you're in to clean floors and matching chairs, then avoid this place. If you're into fun places with great service and amazing food with an old ranch feel, this place is second to none.  Also, this is a very Packer friendly bar. All Green Bay games are shown here. Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Look, it is what it is.  BCSS or Beer Can Chicken as we call it in our house is a Western Throwback where you can go for line dancing, bull riding watching, reasonably priced drinks, and decent food.  Overall this is a place you'll go once a year with friends from out of town to show them what Cave Creek is all about.  The nachos are huge and meant for sharing.  The ribs are \"ok\" but no where near as good as Bryan's down the road.  I would recommend the burgers as a safe bet."}
{"text":"After receiving horrible (lack of) service from a competitor across the street and a little to the east, we made our way to the Buffalo Chip where we were greeted well and received excellent service.  The Buffalo Chip was friendly and had an enjoyable atmosphere, cold beers and good food.  Our server checked in with us routinely and was a huge part of our magnificent time there!  Heading back soon!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and terrible service,  obviously the place orders cheap food and tries to  serve it as good bbq.   TOURIST TRAP.!!!  Go for drinks,  dance and bullriding,  stay away from the food."}
{"text":"I will give four stars mostly for the entertainment the rodeo shows are fun to watch!  The food on the other hand, not so great.  My husband had the ribs which were very very fatty I did not care for them at all I took one bite and could not continue.    My daughter had the chicken wings plain which had a very strange chickeny flavor to it again I could not take another bite and stopped.  My daughter ordered the sirloin steak and she also said it was not very good.  I had the iceberg salad with blue cheese dressing which was OK and jalapeño poppers which how can you go wrong with that.  So basically four stars for the entertainment but one star for the food."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner Friday (3/16) with reservations for a party of 8. Needless to say we had the worst experience with the manager and getting sat. The nice hostess (young/blonde) was seating us when another host sat our table at the same time. Things happen. I get it. But this turned into an hour long mess trying to get a table. Tara our server was very accommodating and is the only reason I'm not giving a worse star. You guys are lucky to have her and she is the reason one day I hope to return and give Buffalo Chip another try."}
{"text":"As soon I walked in the door, I was in honky-tonk heaven.  This is a real country bar with great live country music, well sized dance floor for 2-stepping, indoor & outdoor bars, great crowd that is a mix of bikers, cowboys, and locals both young and old just looking to have a good time, and of course the live bull-riding. Yes, anyone with $40 bucks and a death wish can sign a waiver and ride a live bull (Wednesday evenings) For those of us less-adventureous folks, we can watch from the bleachers. Top that off with food sold for $10.00 a pound, and you got yourself one heck of a good time Y'all!   Tip -It's a bit of a drive to get here, as the saloon is located in the city of Cave Creek, so make sure you assign a designated driver."}
{"text":"This is a really unique fun place to go! Bullriding, outdoor bar, Country music and the best fried chicken I have had in.. well.. I can't remember when I have had better. Oh and affordable even with the Uber taxi home!"}
{"text":"This is a great venue, beer is cold, but the food is basically garbage!  I've personally spoken to the owner about with such a great venue, why doesn't he improve the food.  His attitude was why should I, look at all the business I've got with what I'm serving.  I no longer waste my money on any menu items here; just drink the cold beer!"}
{"text":"Cave Creek and the Buffalo Chip Saloon are a bit of Wild West in Arizona. On the Wednesday night in March that we arrived the place was surrounded with pickup trucks, jeeps, and real and wanna-be cowboys. There was a long, very slowly moving line waiting at the outside buffet. You choose your meat (they give you a pound of it!) and some sides. And of course there is cold beer. We chose to go inside and grab something. It was busy, but far quicker than the patio buffet, although it was confusing to even find our way to the restaurant. The place is kind of a maze.   Once inside, we ordered beers - very cold!  That was nice. Fast service. Sat at the bar. Ordered the homemade fried chicken and a burger. Both were good, but the chicken was better. Definitely homemade.  However, if you're looking for a neat, organized, well appointed atmosphere you won't find it at the chips. It more resembles a cowboy mess hall and its a bit messy, loud, and crazy. But it was packed - and that says something.   After dinner we headed back outside for the Wednesday night entertainment of amateur bull riding...and we're not talking mechanical bulls...these are the real bucking, snorting, and kicking big boys. The bleacher seating around the arena was packed, there were bonfires roaring, and the crowd was wound up and having a great time. This is a highlight of the Chip.  Would we go back?  Maybe not.  But we're glad we went once. It was a fun experience.  If your near Cave Creek, you should do the same."}
{"text":"Saturdays is really slow, but the staff are always fun and friendly. But over all it's a nice change."}
{"text":"This place is so fun!! I'm glad you guys decided to re-build. When we walked in the manager, Scott, greeted us and that made it feel all the more personal. Bull riding was great! Definitely a place you want to check out. After that we moved to the outside bar area where Dustin helped us. He was so professional and helpful we assumed he was a manager!! This guy is a keeper for sure! Good job on hiring him! The only thing I'm bummed about is that I didn't win the PBR tickets! Overall great experience and we will definitely be back!! :)"}
{"text":"I just love this place! The genuine western ambience is outstanding. We always take visitors from Europe here and they all LOVE it! The bull riding just tops off the evening!!"}
{"text":"Tried to give my business to the small town. Lights were equivalent to a tanning booth. LED Lights do come in many different wattages. Tvs were way too high up.  Thought I was in old country buffet."}
{"text":"I'm 90% sure the owner of this burned it down rather than doing the right thing and selling it or closing it and now he isn't giving his employees money that was raised for them to get them through the holidays. This guy is a total sleeze ball!"}
{"text":"The food is decent and I usually just go for the fish fry on Friday nights because it's all you can eat. The service is a whole other story, servers tend to be rude, forgetful and they will literally come up behind you and scream to communicate. I understand it's usually a packed house and really loud but Jesus, warn someone or make your presence known before howling out orders. I have a huge issue with the forgetfulness of the wait staff as you sometimes have to ask two or three times to get what you want, no matter how busy they are, this shouldn't be an issue. I absolutely love the atmosphere and bull riding, it's a great place to go grab a drink and either sit inside and listen to the live band or outside around the bull riding and campfire. And if you get a chance to sit and watch people dance over a beer or five, do that too!"}
{"text":"Most of the food is pretty good but we had to stop going to BC a couple years ago because of some of the ridiculous things they do. They stopped sell salad to the patrons on the back porch area when you order food...The bar bill was never consistent on back porch area and some of our friends also felt like they were getting gouged.... Oh you need a drink of water...$2 a bottle. We were invited to thanks giving buffet (as many places do that). We had out of town gusts and asked if we could bring them, but they were refused anyway. How embarrassing! That was really lame and I never go there anymore because of it.   There are many other places we can go in Scottsdale where they appreciate humanoids. I take my money where customer's are treated well."}
{"text":"The Chip is my absolute favorite hometown bar. I will always be a loyal fan. Great food, atmosphere, music, drinks, service and entertainment!"}
{"text":"Good food you get way more than you would expect. And bull riding! Always a fun time!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! A taste of Texas without the drive. Cold beer. Good BBQ. And a rodeo. Hell yea! Barmaids are cute and friendly. This is the real deal. If you don't like it ruff and tumble stay home."}
{"text":"Awesome saloon! Went to this place for a after work get together! I may have used coupons to get my food and beer although it did not take away my bull riding experience! Watched YouTube videos for a few days on how to ride a bull but nothing can prepare you for this Beastly Bohemeth! I paid $40 and signed my life away and got to ride the Bull! I figured how many opportunities am I going to get riding a bull!?!? Awesome staff and supportive staff and bull fighters!"}
{"text":"Great place to spend a Friday evening.  We had gone for lunch before a trail ride at Spurs Cross (awesome place!) and the ads for bull riding and dancing intrigued so we went back.  Was well worth it..  Very crowded but kid friendly and inviting.  Band was playing, people dancing and mingling in and out, bull riding as well.  Wish we had places like this in San Diego.."}
{"text":"I have been in AZ for almost 1 year. I have been out a few weekends each month searching for fun different places to hang out. Up until going to Buffalo Chip, everywhere I had been was just decent. I absolutely LOVE Buffalo Chip. I was a little skeptical at first about going because I am not a huge country music fan.... but this place was a blast. The food is decent, the drinks are pretty good (and affordable), the patrons are super nice, and the buffalo riding event is FUN. They have fire pits outside near the buffalo riding area to keep you warm... they have bars outside and inside. Inside they have a live band playing music and people are actually up and dancing. After being there I really do want to learn how to country line dance and 2 step. haha. I went with 2 other girls.... and all 3 of us cant wait to go back. Buffalo Chip will most likely be my new \"hot spot\". Next time I go I will be better prepared... and I will wear a jacket and warmer shoes. I didint realize that we were going to be outside for most of the night. I figured we would watch the bull riding and then go in.... but it was to much fun outside near the firepits to be inside. If you are considering checking out Buffalo Chip... I say do it. I am an East Coast girl (NJ).... and this place was outstanding."}
{"text":"The food was average at best.  We were told they had a new chef that was famous because she had been on Food Network and we were going to love our burgers, funny.  I was grossed out by how very dusty & dirty everything was.  We went there based on Yelp reviews, we wished we would have tried somewhere else.  Maybe it is just a good bar/hang out place???"}
{"text":"Very good .I love this place.great food great atmosphere.fun place for family.they also have alot of fun things they do for kids ."}
{"text":"So I live near Cave Creek but have never been to the Buffalo Chip, but have been to many other Cave Creek restaurants. We have friends visit from Chandler, and they wanted to go to the Buffalo Chip, so we agreed.   First the place looks great. I was never there before the fire, but I imagine it looks better now. But the tables are just folding tables and the chairs folding chairs. Not the most comfortable. They need to invest in more permanent digs.   Now on to the food. Between all in the group we ordered many dishes. I ordered the Iceburg Wedge with Blue Cheese and a Fish Taco. The Wedge was $6 and the Fish Taco was $4. Honestly neither was all that good. The taco was quite small and just had a few pieces of fried fish cut into small pieces.  The salad had some blue cheese,  but it seemed like ranch dressing, and store bought certainly. Definitely not worth $6 in my opinion.   My wife had the pulled pork sandwich for $9. Was a normal sized store-bought hamburger bun (unheated) with pulled pork, along with a SMALL amount of baked beans. The baked beans were cold, and the container the beans came in was one of these small containers they usually use for sauce. Tiny.   One other had the catfish, which looked good, but the others weren't happy with their choices. Small portions and average at best. Prices were OK but portions small. We saw several people at other tables that had to order more food because the portions just didn't fill them.  All in all I wouldn't go back  because there are many much better paces in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW.  Buffalo Chip hosted the National Concierge Association in the area for its 2013 conference for a night of BBQ and bull riding.  The BBQ buffet was an amazing line up of cowboy fare such as the tastiest biscuits I've ever had, delicious cole slaw and more styles of BBQ than I've seen in one place.    And then there was the entertainment portion of the evening which included a wide range of events such as bull riding for adults and calf and sheep riding for the younger generation.  Despite the heat,  the place was packed with all ages enjoying and supporting the folks risking their lives while trying to conquer the beast.  It was a great night.  Lastly I'd like to recognize Sandy who did a great job serving us and making sure all of our needs were taken care of.  Thanks Buffalo Chip."}
{"text":"Update - We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here - 90% of guests were from \"back east\"........  To say it was a huge success is an understatement.   Larry the owner / manager is fantastic.   The Buffalo Chip is the real deal and I love it!"}
{"text":"Super entertaining bar! My husband and I enjoyed both of our meals and were able to sit for dinner right away. There was also an option to eat BBQ buffet. Enjoyed the bull riding (40 minutes of entertaining bull riders from age 5 to adult). Don't worry, the kids rode calfs.  After the show there was live music, corn hole, Jenga, fire pits for warmth and smores for purchase.  You could also get a pic on a bull. Families brought the entire family. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had a blast!  Live music,  live bull riding, great food, great service and great drinks. I love this place & totally worth the drive!"}
{"text":"They have a Bbq buffet on Saturdays that's about $11 per person and oh so worth it! The brisket is tender and delicious and the beers are nice and cold!! Check it out if you're ever in Cave Creek. They were named top western bar in Phoenix Times a few times."}
{"text":"Is there ever a time when this place isn't packed?  Answer: I don't think so.  Wow, I have been during the day and during the evening.  This is the most popular place in all of Cave Creek it seems.  Motorcycle clubs, rednecks, pretty women, great food, awesome bands.  Good luck finding a parking space, BTW.  Dirt lot, too.  Big but your car or bike is going to be dust covered.  Try the street tacos - excellent!  The cole slaw is fresh and some of the best I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Went to their Thursday night dance lessons.    Good music and fun instructor.   Unfortunately this does not carry through to the rest of the place.   Yes, service was decent but beers are a tad pricey.   Food, well you have to remember where you are at, Cave Creek.  It is nothing but lower end bar food for tourist prices.   One would think for what is being paid they would have something tastier to offer.  Seating was uncomfortable and way too close together.  If you were to leave the long table you're sitting at, everyone else will have to stand for you to get out.  If you are looking for some dancing it's fine.  If you are looking for dinner and drinks, there are far better choices in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"I had a great time at the Chip! Hope ya'll do too! Lots of fun, and the food was great. A solid 3.5 stars from me. Gets crowded so go early. Music was terrific."}
{"text":"Went here to meet a friend who happens to be a Green Bay Packer fan. This bar is Lambeau Field West, Cheese Head city. It was a Sunday and the Packers were playing. Every seat in the house was reserved, even the bar stools. Since our friend comes here we got in. We did browse and the place is huge. The outdoor patio is extra large with TV's for viewing, they also have a ring for bull riding. Interesting all around.   The story here is drinks are heavy and good. The patrons are dressed to the T in Green Bay fashion. Plenty of Cheese Heads, Jersey's homemade hats anything and everything. They are ready to party. And party they did when the Packers scored a TD. What The....They jump up and start parading around the bar cheering, singing, DJ playing. Just having the time of their lives. It was fun to watch and this day the Pack scored 53 so it was a hot mess of cheese here.    If you are in cave creek this is a must stop just for the shear amusement. Other bars in the area are dedicated to the Bears, Pittsburgh and the Vikqueens. Have to give it to the fans here, they know how to party. Good times..."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  I was hungry, so I'm probably being generous.  The place is cool, if you are into Cowboy bars.  This is a fun place to take out of town guests for a drink."}
{"text":"Great place to come dance and have a good time! Great vibe and people! Last nights live band was AMAZING!!! Can't wait to come back and country western dance!"}
{"text":"It's definitely not the old buffalo chip, especially without the shack in the back. I'm a packers fan (while others in my family are Steelers) but this place is awesome during Packer games! The owner Larry Is always there to talk to customers & handle any problems - which is note worthy. Most memorable bartenders to my family & I were Billy, Keleigh, Maggie, & Maddie (not sure if they are still there) but they always seemed to be having fun& cared about their customer experiences! Thank you to the Buffalo Chip!"}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere. Live bands, rocking rodeo, great eats and the perfect place to spend a Friday night out!"}
{"text":"The food is good and they have great entertainment. Fun place to meet friends. The staff is always friendly and fun. It has the cowboy charm throughout."}
{"text":"Love the chip, did the VIP above the bull riding had a blast thank for the great time"}
{"text":"Strange experience here as we attempted to eat lunch here on Saturday. The place was pretty empty with about 3 tables of people dining. The bartender came over and took our drink orders pretty quick, which was two diet cokes. After that, nobody showed up for about 10 minutes, which gave me a chance to read some reviews about the ribs I was about to order and they weren't good. Finally, a waitress showed up and she started telling us about the two fights that took place last night and all the events that go on at the Chip. She also mentioned that the brisket wasn't good which was my backup choice and also some weird explanation of why nobody showed up to take our order (miscommunication with 3 tables full?). Anyway, after all that, we said screw it and decided to bail across the lot to Harold's. Extra star for that bald bartender who gave us our cokes for free and a to-go cup. Otherwise, they were $3 a pop. Might be nice place at night if you like to watch live drunken fights (now, I just watch them on youtube)."}
{"text":"Want the Wild West Saloon experience? You got it here! Feel the small town charm of Cave Creek-cowboy food and outdoor chill."}
{"text":"They did a good job of recapturing the old feel of the original Buffalo Chip with the new building, and I commend the owners and staff. Ambiance is great for an old west saloon. We've noticed over the years that if the mesquite grill is going, you will get a great steak, burger, or ribs. Unfortunately, if they are not using the mesqite grill, the food is just okay. This has not changed. You guys have the opportunity to make your food really shine in Cave Creek. You should take advantage of that."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here: from the bull riding to the food and dancing. So. Much. Fun!   Seriously my favorite thing to do when we are in AZ is Friday nights at the Chip!"}
{"text":"We are Packers fans and my husband called on Monday to reserve seats for Sunday's game.  -Jackie said she will call back to confirm. No call back and we had to call 3 different times to ensure we had a reservation. Finally we were confirmed after all of our attempts.  -We get there and get seated at the bar (we love sitting at a bar) but we were outside with no heaters and no TV. Um, we are there to watch the game.  -My husband asks Jackie if we can move and she said any two open seats at the bar except for 4 on the left side and two by the restrooms.  -We find seats in the middle of the bar and order drinks. Then the bartender, Billy, tells us that people who have been coming for 20 years want our seats. Then another bartender talks to Jackie about where to move us, and Jackie LIES and says she didn't tell us we could move. WTF? We aren't making it up.  -We are then told we have to move and our option is to go back outside, or we can sit across from each other in the middle of someone else's table. Seriously?  -We decided to leave. Even the bartenders thought it was messed up and gave us our beers for free. That was cool. One star to them.   This place has no organization whatsoever and I still can't believe how poorly we were treated. Too bad, it looks like a cool set up and I heard the food was good."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times over the years but for some reason, I've never Yelped it.  Well, since I'm doing the better late than never thing this weekend, I'll do it now.  Popped in here for the annual Red & White Birthday Bash for Sonny B. (still running strong at 73).  Great atmosphere, with a kick ass back patio area.  Grabbed my usual spot and ordered up their oh so refreshing Hefeweizen, in a tall frosty mug.  I also chowed on their burger with fries which also hit the spot.  Caught up with old friends, made some new friends, took a few pics and then Mel and I hit the road for some impromptu green light fun down Scottsdale Road.    Reminded me of the good old days."}
{"text":"The hubs & I recently relocated to Cave Creek (yee haw!) and are lovin' life. This place is the perfect example of why.  A couple of weeks ago my British husband said to me, \"I'm gonna have to check the bull riding schedule.\"  Pardon?  \"Put on your cowboy boots.\"  Well you don't have to tell me twice.  Off we went on a Wednesday night to watch live bull riding and enjoy some cold drinks on the bleachers outside. They have pro and semi-pro riders, but anyone with some balls and the willingness to sign a (very thick) waiver is welcome to give it a whirl. I passed, and advised the hubs that he doesn't have enough life insurance to even begin to consider such an activity. But we sure enjoyed watching everybody else - especially the girl that stayed on longer than her boyfriend - and will absolutely, positively be back for more!  We didn't eat, but the drinks were cold, reasonably priced and delivered quickly by a cordial bartender. Love that it's just a couple of minutes away!"}
{"text":"Just have to say damn. That was a lot of fun. The food we got was all about meat. But okay. And got a table, drinks and food  right away even though it was packed.  But the bull riding area out back came as a big surprise.  Will for sure be coming back next time my plans get me to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The service is awful. I was surprised at how rude the people who worked there were. at one point, me and my friends were sitting on the barstools near the bar, and a server who had been cleaning walked past us and said \"not the best place to be sitting guys.\" Well, maybe you shouldn't have barstools there? Similar incidents happened throughout the night. It wasn't that busy, but everyone seemed put out for having to be working. I'm sad we made the drive up there to celebrate my husband's birthday."}
{"text":"One of the awesomest places I've been to yet in Arizona. This is a must for people visiting or newcomers, or it even would be a great place to do a company outing. The food is just okay, but everything else is awesome. Big mugs of beer are only $4 and there is bull riding and cowboy music. The place is totally themed out but I didn't think it was cheesy (or I really liked the cheese).   I wouldn't recommend coming here just for food. For vegetarians there is an all you can eat salad buffet. For meat eaters, there is an endless supply of food you can eat. The biscuits were way too heavy and hard and the cowboy beans are probably an after thought. Their chips and salsa are surprisingly good, and though we didn't order it because we were deep into beer there is a tableside s'mores where you get to roast your own s'mores over an small open flame.  Wear whatever cowboy gear you may have and just come for a good time!"}
{"text":"Here for preopening day.  Food was mediocre at best.  No free refills on soda and no beer butt chicken.  Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"It is always scary to plan an event, let alone planning from Seattle and not knowing what you will get.  But... Whitney was AMAZING to work with, made everything I wanted happen and went above and beyond anything I could have imagined.  Our event was for 270 people and EVERYONE loved it.  From Redneck Games to the Rodeo to the most incredible food.  Honey Butter Biscuits, OMG!!  We want to ship those home to us.  Larry is the kindest host and I would recommend Buffalo Chip Saloon to everyone.  After our event, we took it inside and danced until the bar closed.  Thank you for everything and I should ever get back to Arizona, bring on the biscuits."}
{"text":"Come here every Friday and Sunday!  Great place to watch bull riding and roast s'mores. Great for families. Service is a bit slow...otherwise would be 5 stars"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Wonderful customer service. Took my family to eat dinner. Their coleslaw was delicious!"}
{"text":"Not sure what had changed but the BBQ here is Amazing now. I have never had brisket so delicious! Such a great place! BBQ is definitely a reason to go back and fight the crowd!"}
{"text":"This review is focused ONLY on the dining part of the experience.  It looked like plenty of people were having a great time dancing to the live country band, but we were just there for dinner with friends.  Although the servers were friendly, the food was less than desirable.  We ordered the Nacho's (OK), Onion Rings (pretty good), brisket sandwich (not good) and ribs (not good).  The brisket sandwich was laid out on a small bun that looked like the ones you buy at the store for .99 cents.  The worse part was the cheese.  It had the texture of Velveta and just didn't go well with the sandwich.  Our friend, who had ordered the cheeseburger only ate one bite (same issue).  She planned on taking it home and trying to remove the cheese and replacing it with some other kind.  The sauce the ribs were in seemed to be ketchup based.  The ribs themselves underneath the sauce seemed large and meaty but the sauce just destroyed them.  Both my friend and I had ordered the full-rack.  Both of us decided to eat only about 1/4 of them and then take them home, wipe all the sauce off and try our own bbq sauce at home.  The side order of beans were bland and the cole slaw was ok.  We also ordered a wedge salad that was ok.  Overall, if you like country dancing, playing pool, etc. then this place could be fun.  I personally would never eat dinner here again."}
{"text":"I'll update my review since it's been over 5 years.  I love coming here on Friday evenings for the bull riding, great live band, and all around fun atmosphere. Drink prices are spot on (aka cheap). +4 for the atmosphere and fun. Until the new building is ready, be prepared to be outside. But it's really nice outside. Campfires, s'mores, games for the kidos.  Service is pretty good and the employees seem to be enjoying themselves. Because everyone is outside for now, support your wait staff. Sure, you can go stand in line, but the servers really do appreciate you getting your food and drinks through them.  But let's talk about the food: it's just so-so. The BBQ is not bad, but you may end up with a lot of fat. The chicken and pulled pork are your best bets. Bring your own BBQ sauce (we do). It's that bad (just ketchup and something added to it). Slaw is pretty good. Biscuits are good (but they come out of a box). The only good part is the price.  Owners, please read: you are SO CLOSE to being so much better. Improve your food and you won't believe how much better business will be! If you food was better, you would be turning away people Fridays and Saturdays. Just because you have been doing something the same way for years, doesn't mean you can't do better. You can!  The new digs are looking so cool. Can't wait until it opens."}
{"text":"Great experience @The Buffalo Chip.  Great atmosphere and great staff!  Food is good.   Burger could of been more done as well as the chicken sandwich and fries.  What a great place to come to escape from the City hussel and bussel.. : )"}
{"text":"We went there at lunch time on a Saturday (yesterday) and it wasn't too busy but  every table had a 'reserved' note on it.  We almost left until another customer came up and explained that 'as long as we were out of there before the time it was reserved it was OK to take a reserved table'.    Service was wicked slow; I think they had two waitresses for the whole place.  Our waitress was nice but was running her butt off to keep up with it all.  It took about an hour for our food to arrive.  We had the nacho mama appetizer which was pretty good but they skimped on the pulled pork.  The steaks were cooked right but were dry as could be and they didn't have steak sauce.  It came with cowboy beans which weren't bad, a bag salad with nasty dressing (not homemade for sure) in a cup the size of a coffee cup, and a biscuit smothered in honey which was pretty good.  The steaks were smoky but otherwise weren't that flavorful (no seasoning, marinade,rub,etc).  I'm sorry but if you're a 'steakhouse' you should at least have your own brand of steak sauce if you're not going to stock A1 or your steak better be so good it doesn't need it! It was OK there but I don't think we'd go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service -our server was very knowledgeable.and sassy just the right amount of wit and knowledge. We Decided to forgo the BBQ buffet cause we didn't think we could.do it justice - but the pulled pork sandwich O M G. So good . A welcome stop for a couple of out of towners , great staff, and a definite stop"}
{"text":"Really cool place to watch live bull riding! You can even ride the bull if you like. They even have sheep for the kids to ride.   It's also a bar. After 7pm or so they do check ID so make sure you got one. They even give you a bracelet that says they checked your ID. So I went outside(backyard of the bar) to meet my friends they were sitting at a picnic table and they already ordered appetizers from the menu. When we were ready to order the waiter said we can't order from the menu we can have the buffet or we need to move closer to the bar to order from the menu. Totally weird. So we moved & the food was okay. The steak was expensive & they don't give you a lot of food. Definitely recommend eating somewhere else and just come here to watch the bulls.   Come early to get a seat if not you will be standing & wont see much. It was awesome! They even prayed & sang the national anthem like a real rodeo.  They do live bull tidings every Wednesday & Friday nights starting at 8pm."}
{"text":"I alway have fun here! I love the live music, pool tables, bull riding and the overall feel of the place. The food is descent but I prefer to come for the drinks and entertainment."}
{"text":"Husband & I stumbled onto this place on our way back from being a tourist in Sedona. Can't speak for the food but he overall experience of this little cowboy rodeo & dancehall was so much fun. We were there on Wednesday night and the band was AWESOME. We are from Texas so we know a thing or two about live music. We had a blast. We were just bummed we did t have our boots with us."}
{"text":"A fun place to go especially on bull riding nights. Food is fine, not great. My burger the other night was a little charred and overcooked and sweet potatoes could have been hotter. Have had other times where the burger was great so could have been an off night. Server was pleasant but inconsistent."}
{"text":"I can't say that I've tried anything from the menu except Coronas....but, I must say they opened those REALLY WELL! I plan on going back for lunch before I leave town at the end of my winter stay....I'll update my yelpin' at that time! We've gone two Friday nights in a row now for the bull-riding - it's just something I would NEVER otherwise think to go see, but now I'm kinda hooked :) Plus, seeing all those Stetsons, Wranglers, and Tony Lamas put me back in the Country mood that I'd been missing and didn't know it :) There were guests of all ages for the 8:00 bull-riding fun....I'm thinking the crowd changes with the later shows? There was a great band playing some covers inside while we were there, also...great job on the Chesney songs! Whoot! Whoot! for Buffalo Chip!"}
{"text":"We went in for a few beers and a bite.  Billy the bartender was absolutely awesome and attentive.  Called us by our first names the entire time we were there.  Made us feel like we were at our local spot back home.  The entire staff was friendly and the food was good.  Highly recommend this place.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We have been here several times since moving and my like if this place in waning. The first time we came (a weekday for lunch) it was so tasty! Meat was well flavored, tender and had a nice smokiness to it. I was just certain I would gain a few pounds off of this place. The second and third times have not left me with such warm feelings. The meats have been dry, tasteless and chewy. The service is pretty decent and seating has been plentiful (we go at off peak times). We come here, mainly, because our kiddos can be a little louder and the music drowns them out :) It is a bit pricey and they have a limited menu so you typically have to order something a la carte if you want to try everything (ex: only certain meals come with a biscuit). I think we will be back and try it again, but it will be a while before that happens."}
{"text":"I love this place except for a total bitch of a bartender outside in the food line area. She seemed completely bothered by having to make drinks for my friends and I and also insulted me. She is a blonde who looks pregnant. I was there on Saturday and will not return if she is there. Total bitch!"}
{"text":"I had a completely wonderful evening here. had a good amount of drinks at the outdoor bar, watched the amateur bull riding which happens on WED nights, we happened to be there on WED. there were a few hundred people there. Very friendly, family atmosphere. Great place to go with a group of friends or a date. the BBQ plates are stacked high, I shared it with my date because it was a lot of food. I hear bull riding on Friday nights is way better, but I had a great time. We did some dancing inside the dining room area. Very western country vibe, with inhouse country band doing covers of famous country songs, and they do it well.   I would go here again. I loved it. I had a wonderful night."}
{"text":"great fun but poor food and service. Drinks are high in price from other bars in town."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential. My family and I really enjoyed the live bull riding, but starting 45 minutes late is unacceptable. It was cold, we had little kids and the place was so packed we had trouble squeezing into the bench seating. Had the show started on time I could probably tell you about the food we had time to order.  Have to admit, I will probably be back. Have the kids better prepared to sit in the bleachers for 45 minutes or maybe eat first. Either way this place seems worthy of a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"The Buffalo Chip is the real deal.  Nothing says the \"WEST\" like the town of Cave Creek and this place.  Friday and Saturday they have live bull riding competitions.  Fridays are better as they have the pros.  Wednesdays are for the amateurs and anyone else silly enough to sign the waiver and pay the entrance fee.  Outside on the new patio they have a pound of meat (your choice of brisket, ribs, chicken, pork), a roll, corn, potatoes, cold slaw.  It's good.  Bathrooms are well not great.  A 7x10' space they've carved into as many stalls as they possibly can.  Live country western bands play on weekends and the place gets packed.  Fires in the winter keep the outside cozy."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex food comes to the Buffalo Chip saloon!  I stopped by today with the wife for a quick lunch and a nice time out after we attempted to get in to the El Enchanto Mexican restaurant but we forgot that it was Sunday and how much we hated the brunch they serve so we moved on.  On the way up through Cave Creek we passed the Buffalo Chip and I saw a new sign outside announcing Tex-Mex so we pulled a quick right turn into the parking lot and went inside.  The list of food for traditional bar meals was all there...burgers, fries, onion rings, bla, bla, bla... but on the back side was the Tex-Mex menu and it read pretty simple, enchiladas, tacos, chimis, taco salad. You know, the usual.  So I went for the cheese enchiladas with red sauce with a side of rice and the wife ordered a taco salad with shell and all. We also ordered chips and salsa for the wait and I had a very tall cold mug of flat tire amber on draught. Chips were very fresh.  I gotta tell ya' I did not expect to get what I ordered. I was thinking greasy food and lots of tums. What showed up was a very hot plate with two nicely filled cheese enchie's, a side of very fresh rice soft and fluffy and the wife's taco salad with shredded chicken was huge! She liked the fresh chicken and the added in guac and sour cream. They also provide a spicy salsa ranch dressing. The large flour shell was fresh and crispy.  Honestly, We were completely caught off guard.  This was a place I would go back and eat repeatedly. The next time I'll try the shredded beef tacos or a Chicken Chimi!  The only draw back for me is I like hot, spicy hot. The sauce for my taste was a little too flat so out came the hot sauce and my palate was satisfied.  Great experience!  Stew  Best part... It was cheap and you could order all alacart!  Don't be afraid to stop by and check it out!  Stew"}
{"text":"Was at the Chip for dinner on 4/8. I ordered steak, my wife ordered a burger. We both made it clear to the server no red in the meat. I cut into my steak and blood comes out of steak. The blood turns the bottom of the biscuit red. My wife's burger was as red on the inside as well. As i cut into my steak a gentleman who seemed to care asked me how are food was. I let him know how it was not cooked the way we asked it to be cooked. He had the food redone   and cooked the way I wanted it. My wife was super hungry and just ate the burger the way she didn't order it. I appreciate the man who came over and checked on us and eventually gave me a steak the way I first ordered it. We will go back to the Chip cause I feel they do care about the customer experience. I really want to give a place 5 stars but most restaurants are not worthy. I think it is best to just stay home and cook my own food."}
{"text":"Pretty much guaranteed a fun nite unless its dead... bullriding, country western dancing, corral to park your horse..... ;)"}
{"text":"The Chip is my favorite place to be on a Friday night.  Be prepared for an old style country bar! Dancing, bull riding, fire pits and BBQ!"}
{"text":"First and last time there.  Food was not great.  Not impressed.  My husband said his steak was good but 2 of us had the brisket sandwich and it wasn't good.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a $30 lunch for two. Great outdoor atmosphere. Burger, bbq sandwich and two beers. Not bad at all. Good portion sizes at a $10 price point. Not busy and friendly service. Parking lot is gravel so don't wash ur car ahead of time"}
{"text":"Food was good, atmosphere is fun.  If you like country music you'll love this place."}
{"text":"This place is a whole bunch of fun!  We got there around 9 on a Friday and there were still some families inside, but bull-riding and the band had started already.  Everyone was in cowboy boots and cowboy hats were a-plenty as well.  I didn't have any of the food but my friends assured me that the BBQ is top notch.  The biscuits looked heavenly, with butter and honey dripping out of them.    There are three rounds of bull-fighting from 8 to 11ish.  I've never been to a rodeo or anything like that, so I was really into it.  Each round had maybe 6 riders, and in between you can pay $5 to get your picture taken with one of the bulls.  The bleachers tended to fill up well before the round started, so get there a few minutes early to ensure that you have a seat.  It's cool being so close (a few feet away!) to the action.  Afterward we headed inside where the families had cleared out.  There's plenty of seating and the bartenders are fast.  The people on the dance floor ranged from older couples barely moving to younger ones who really knew what they were doing.  As in, girls were flipping and being lifted overhead and who knows what else.  The band is excellent!  All in all, it's a fabulous and fun place to spend a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Went to watch and participate in line dancing! It was my first time but it wasn't intimidating. Everyone is just there to have fun. We didn't order food but the bar service was great. It wasn't too crowded on the night that I went but I heard it was light night. There seems to be plenty of both indoor and outdoor space though. The live band was pretty good and made the whole experience more authentic."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fantastic at this location however the food was lacking. We had a BBQ pork sandwich and felt the sauce was slightly bland and needed something else to add more flavor. We also tried some of the buffet and the beans were less than desired due to lack of flavor. The drive to get there was beautiful and the views make up for the food lacking in flavor. A great spot to relax and enjoy the surroundings but if you are craving real homestyle BBQ I would not make this a first recommendation. The service however was amazing. There were few people sitting outside when we ate and they took good care of us."}
{"text":"We came for lunch and were extremely disappointed! The onion rings and fries weren't fresh but frozen. The hamburger had no flavor  even with green chili on.  How do you mess up a hamburger? My husband's bque platter was just as bad. The sausage was burnt to a little crisp, and the rest was the worst bque he has ever had.  Choose someplace else."}
{"text":"the most authentic south west place you'll find in the phoenix area! i fell in love with the place the first time i came here, and I don't even like country music! The bull riding (Wed and Friday nights), the bon fire pits, the live music (man, those guys can sing!), the dancing, the food (biscuits, s'mores, pulled pork sandwiches)--everything makes this the perfect place! you feel like you're in an old country western movie. They also have the best fourth of July celebration around! I always make sure to bring all of my out of town friends here!"}
{"text":"The food was very average. Nothing special. Chicken breast was very dry and the smoked pork sandwich had a lot of fat chunks in it. Live music and fun dancing to watch."}
{"text":"You will find some of the best BBQ in this place. A very fun atmosphere. If you're hungry you don't have to wait long. Don't wear your good shoes there is always a lot of dirt. It's a place to wear the clothes you get dirty in. Boots and cowboy hats are the norm. There is always great entertainment"}
{"text":"This is a review of the restaurant, not the bar area. Went with group of 8 people. Seated in the back area where the decor is not very nice. Two round tables stuck together wasn't at all comfortable.the service was extremely slow and the food was mediocre at best. Getting sodas refilled was nearly impossible. Definitely felt like prices were too high for what we got. I don't see another visit anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"We went on xmas day, the food wasn't very good at all. Cheeseburger weren't cooked they way we asked. The chicken sandwich we had was the worst chicken sandwich i ever seen, it was more like a chicken nugget sandwich. Pretty poor excuse for a sandwich.   They weren't really busy at all.  But it took almost an hour to get our food. Are server was SO BAD, (jen) she never came around unless our drinks were empty. Never came to check if we needed anything after see gave us our food.  She needs to get some better server skills. WAS NOT HAPPY WITH HER AT ALL.  We really like the place but no sure if we will return.  Im sure it wont hurt their business if we don't.  Oh and bartender you don't put a lemon in a bloddy mary.  And it sucked anyways."}
{"text":"Not my usual scene, but I had a work event here. The beer is cold, the brisket delicious, and they have live bullriding. Serious. Live bullriding.   The brisket is phenomenal and they have the best fried cheese curds south of Wisconsin.  The patrons are a bit intimidating, but after 2 beers, you won't even care."}
{"text":"We just had lunch there. I ordered a cheeseburger cooked medium. When I took a bite it was almost raw in the middle. Hamburger is not safe to eat less than medium. I asked our server to have it cooked some more.  She brought a new burger out. It was way over cooked, past well done. Also, the replacement burger had one very small tomato and one small slice of onion. I spoke to the manager about my burger. He thanked me for my input. He did NOT comp my meal which I took one bite of. I have been to the Buffalo Chip before. The food was always edible, but not great. I guess I will limit my visits to having a beer in the future. If you want good food there are other places within walking distance. BTW, I grew up in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Love Buffalo Chip!  I've never eaten here but I dig the atmosphere! Fun crowd, pool table, live band, awesome western decor, live bull riding.... all in all a fun way to spend the night if you are looking for something fun and different from the typical Phoenix bar!"}
{"text":"Dance floor is great now, thank you!  but Pleeeeze cut the glare of those bright bright lights on the dance floor by 7PM, thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband and his friendgirl wanted to have my birthday dinner here.  Cute place. Andi, our waitress,  was superb, the service was most excellent from everyone who woeked there. However, The food is terrible - I ate very little, and almost everyone in our party got sick.  The menu says baby back ribs but they are NOT baby back ribs.  The drinks are wicked expensive, and I don't think there was any tequila in my margaritas - I had 5 Patron margaritas and felt no buzz at all - stick to beer or shots."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the Packers game. Arrived less than 5 minutes late and they had already pulled our table. There were 6 of us so fortunately they had one more table.  The next issue we had was the pain we experienced from the speakers. It was deafening when they played Go Pack Go so I recommend that you wear ear plugs if you plan on watching a game there.  It took quite a while before someone took our order. We ordered easy appetizers and drinks. Pop, lemonade and 2 beers - 1 Bud Light and 1 Miller Light but they got it wrong and gave us 2 Millers. My husband said he'd drink the Miller but to bring a Bud Light next time. They ordered another beer a bit later and AGAIN she brought 2 Millers and AGAIN my husband drank the Miller with no complaints but let her know.  We also got our food and they delivered the items at both ends of the table...chips and salsa, onion rings and wings. We were watching the game and about 20/30 minutes later the waitress came back and said they mistakenly gave us an extra order of chips and salsa and either she'll take them back or have to charge us for them. We thought this was odd and perhaps rude since it was their mistake, we didn't even notice AND she had already brought the wrong beer twice but my husband didn't complain and just asked that she bring a Bud Light the next time. We didn't complain and said we would pay for the chips and salsa.  One more thing I want to mention is that this place is crammed full of random things on the walls and hanging from the ceiling. Too many things and many items have water damage and a thick and solid layer of dust. It is rather bad.  I love my Packers but I'd rather watch them in the Bears place across the street before I would go back there again."}
{"text":"Let's just say if you want to get away and have a good time have some good food and watch the bull riding  and enjoy the live music and dancing this is thee place. Beautiful scenery and friendly atmosphere. Though it is a 45 minute drive from my house it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere drinks well made, games and band were fun. Issue getting cab ride home but we made it"}
{"text":"Love the vibe here.  It's fun to watch the bull riding.  I enjoy the campfires in the winter and the live bands. Food is \"meh\" but good enough.  Can't wait for winter to start going on Friday nights again."}
{"text":"This place is a riot. Definitely country flare. Super fun for dancing & country music. As well as a favorite place to hang & watch football. Been going here for 15 years."}
{"text":"Went here recently because Harrolds was closed...it's right next door. Nice sized place; had a band playing later with line dancing (not my thing, but I always like to see places that have bands). Got some food at the bar; hubby got a burger that he liked and I had some chicken strips. Decent food, nothing too special but we were both satisfied. Had about 15 people with us and the one bartender did the best job she could keeping our cups full. I'd go again."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a very busy night during some kind of city event.  We still got reasonably fast service, and it was friendly, though the place was packed.  The food ranged from very good to phenomenal.  Way more than we were expecting from a simple-looking place with a basic BBQ/American menu.  My wife decided to try the fish tacos, which she normally doesn't because she doesn't like spicy food at all and some places over-spice them.  They were made from huge chunks of fish, very crispy on the outside, tender inside, with a really great light sauce.  One of the best fish tacos anywhere.  The BBQ platter was excellent.  The pork not only shredded easily with a fork, it was almost the consistency of butter to chew on.  The brisket was some of the most tender I've had.  The BBQ sauce was really good.  Links weren't extraordinary, but still very good.  Prices are in the average range for this type of food, but the quality of this food was above anything else in the same price.  We wish we lived closer to this place; we'd be there every week."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a young man who announces bull riding on Wednesday and Fridays nights. Jacob is his name. He's so great  makes it worth coming out. Hes,very personable and entertaining you can tell he loves,what he does always a good time . I come out just to see jacob"}
{"text":"I've cold beer and free rodeos on Friday!!"}
{"text":"DISCRIMINATION DISCRIMINATION DISCRIMINATION. I am 20 years old and I had read the other negative review on here that mentioned their policy about not allowing people between the ages of 18-21 without a legal guardian, so before driving 30 minutes to go to this place I called to confirm that this was true. The lady that answered the phone, Delaney, informed me that as long as I was over 18 and that I told the security guard that I was under 21 that he could put X's on my hands so that I would not be served alcohol. Upon arriving to the restaurant I was stopped by the security guard, told him I was 20 years old, and told him what Delaney had told me and he rudely and carelessly responded, \"She must have been misinformed. It's her second day.\" Kind of ironic how they allow small children to be in that environment with their parents, but they don't allow legal adults. Not sure what world that makes sense in!"}
{"text":"Best Bar in Cave Creek... Hands down. Friday and Saturday nights live bull riding and no bar north of 101 can come close to drawing the crowds this place draws on the weekend... Why? Good BBQ. Best looking bartenders and wait staff and all of the pretty girls come from all over Arizona to dance and find a cowboy."}
{"text":"I never got the chance to go here before the fire, so this new building is my only experience with the place.   We went during a February afternoon. Just because it's Arizona, doesn't mean February is warm....we opted to sit inside, but since the entire back of the restaurant is open air, it was pretty much like sitting deep inside a park gazebo, with the wind blowing in every so often creating a slight chill. I'm not complaining (well, I am just a little bit), but be forewarned that you may need some sort of sweater or cover-up even if you choose to sit inside.  I ordered the \"Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Green Chiles, Tomatoes, Cheese and Fries\" and a coke. There were actually onions and lettuce involved, but I didn't eat those or the tomato. I thought the sandwich was pretty tasty; the chicken was cooked perfectly and the green chiles really added that special something to the sandwich. The fries were thick, not thin, and were tasty as well. Refills on soda were free.  For dessert, we ordered the  \"Campfire S'mores\". There were enough ingredients to make 6 s'mores; more than enough for our party of four. Arriving in a cast iron muffin pan, it came with a small can of portable gel that was pre-lit, thus creating the roasting fire. There were wooden skewers for the marshmallows, and plenty of chocolate and graham crackers to go round. It was a fun and delicious concept.  This place is also known as the Packer Bar, and there is a small area near the front of the restaurant dedicated to the green and gold. While all sports fans are welcome here, I feel like they are just a little bit nicer to those who are devoted to Green Bay. If you feel they don't treat you well here, you can always go next door to the Steelers Bar........good luck with that.  Out back are a few corrals which hold cattle during bull riding events, but that wasn't happening during my visit. The back area is also pretty big and I think they hold church services back there for bikers on Sundays.  If you're a Cheesehead who finds themselves on the outskirts of Phoenix, head over to the Buffalo Chip. You'll feel like you never left home......almost!  5/2017"}
{"text":"Where can you find Fat Albert and tons of hot cowboys wearing spurs on a Wednesday night? Why, Buffalo Chip, that is!  My friends and I came here on a Wednesday evening to watch some good ole fashioned bull riding. Wednesday nights are for practicing and amateurs, yes, dear reader, as long as you sign a waiver and pay a fee of $40, you can ride a live bull and pray you don't break something as you get bucked off! Friday nights are for the professionals with shows starting at 7pm both days.   We got here around 6pm because my friend said they have great BBQ so we decided to try it out. Its $10.88 plus tax for ONE POUND total weight of any of the following: beef brisket, pulled pork, grilled chicken, baby back ribs, smoked sausage, cowboy beans, grilled veggies, quickdraw coleslaw, and honey butter biscuits.   We tried the beef brisket, pulled pork, beans, veggies (which was really corn), and the biscuits. Oh my yumminess, everything was so tasty, but next time we agreed we would just get the beef brisket due to its superiority over the pork. Buffalo Chip also has $3 domestic drafts (PBR, Bud, Miller, Blue Moon) and $4 import drafts, awesome. My friend got a mixed drink using Absolute and a bottle of water and it cost her $9 for both. Great drink prices!  We didn't spend much time at the inside restaurant/bar because all the excitement was outside, but we did notice a pretty decent size dance floor where we can only imagine the amount of line dancing going on. Also, I notice the menu inside and it looks like they serve TexMex food along with BBQ.  Big Props to all the cowboys and cowgirl (yep, there was one girl toughing it out) giving us a great show and great first experience at Buffalo Chip. I also need to give a shot out to the bulls Fat Albert, Brutus, Black Hole, Domino, and Goliath, I don't know how you are able to buck around with balls that huge...ouch!  Oh, and four random side notes: (1) because you are so far north and away for the bulk of city lights, you can really see the beautiful stars (2) I listened to country on my way back home (3) don't forget to wear your cowboy boots and (4) I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST place to be on Friday nights- singles, couples, and families.  Food is good and reasonably priced. Kelly, Stephanie, Pierce, Matt, and Courtney (really, too many to name) provide fast, friendly service.  The live entertainment whether it be the live music or bull riding adds some extra fun to the evening.  The outdoor seating provides a comfortable space for kids to play - they have games like giant Jenga, tic-tac-toe, and corn hole to pass the time."}
{"text":"It's something different to do always have to take out of town guest here. They have a free rodeo a few nights a week. Great family fun or head in side for some adult fun drinking and dancing never fear you can drink outside at the bull riding to. Foods not bad."}
{"text":"Cowboy- up; We love the atmosphere and always make this a stop for lunch.. No crowds, no wranglers, no bull...The meat is smoked, the fries are crisp and the pour is mighty fine.. My cowboy and I leave with the mustang, top down( the car.. Not us). The Buffalo Chip satisfies your inner cowboy!"}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself deep in the bowels of lacka-nookie hell, have I got some good news.  The Buffalo Chip.  It's a widely known fact how most chicks dig cowboys....manly bastards they are.  One small problem.  You're not a cowboy, which is why you're knee-deep in the midst of a sex-draught.  Well let's change all that, shall we?  Get down to Saba's western wear in Scottsdale and pick yourself out a cowboy getup, making sure to get a pair of tight fitting Wranglers that'll telegraph your business.  Another problem. You're running a small business and not a major corporation. That's ok.  That's what the good lord made gym socks for. Roll one up, and stuff it inside your boxers.  Hmmm.  That's not going to get anyone's attention. Better roll the other one up too.   Ok, now you're ready.  Climb into that Range Rover and head down to the Buffalo Chip. Start with one of their $3.75, 16 oz drafts.  Follow it up with 12 more jes like it.  Now it's time to eat.  Order the bbq meal. A full pound of tasty meat with all the fixins for 11 bucks.  Showtime. Sit at one of the tables next to the fire pit where everyone can see you.  Next, begin wolfing your food as though you've been on a cattle drive for the last month and haven't eaten anything but jerky and corn nuts.  Don't come up for air.  Be angry. Get mad at that bbq...wolf it down man.  Quick, sop up those beans with your bread, making sure to slop it all over your mug.  Now wash it down with some hot coffee you threw an ice cube in when no-one was looking.  Drink the entire cup in one gulp. This will impress any onlookers. Now, lick your lips, wipe your face with your sleeve, and make some loud noise like ahhhhhh.   Then, start looking around to see if any of the beautiful women in this place are watching your shit-show, hoping at least one of them is about to slide off her seat.   Time to rope a filly, bud.   Uh-oh.  Burrrrpp.   I forgot.  You don't drink twelve beers at a time do you?  Quick, run for the bathroom to throw up before anyone sees you.  Shit. You forgot the socks. Hoist up the socks man. Too late. One just slid down your pant leg and into the well-lit dance floor for all to see.  Now the other too. Don't look back man, git to the crapper...fast.   God you're pathetic. But I will give you props for at least trying.  Now wipe that puke and beans off your mug, and head back to the Rover...it's high time you skidaddled outa this place. You don't belong here.  You never did.  The cowboy life jes ain't for you.   Jes mosey along now.  Go on...GIT!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.....great food.....friendly staff. I hit this place whenever I'm in the valley. Wouldn't change a thing!"}
{"text":"I hate that I have to write this review, but I had an extremely frustrating experience.  Short Story: If you are between the age of 18-21, YOU ARE NOT WELCOME IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT  My cousin was visiting PHX from across the country for an interview, and she was trying to decide if she could see herself living in phoenix. I have taken several family members and friends to Buffalo Chip in the past, and have thoroughly enjoyed my time there (although as noted in many other reviews, the food is sub par). I asked a few friends of mine to join my cousin and I for a Friday night rodeo. My cousin is currently 20, but as I had been to Buffalo Chip many times, I knew it was a very eclectic group of people ranging from toddlers to grandparents, including some high schoolers. My friend had mentioned that when he had last tried to go to Buffalo Chip with his little brother, they had turned them away because his brother was not 21 yet. I thought that this didn't sound right, so I decided to call the night before to check to make sure that my cousin would be able to get in if we decided to make the 45 minute trek to Cave Creek. The lady who answered the phone (I wish I had a name) told me that anyone under 21 should be accompanied by a legal guardian, but other than that everyone was welcome. I told her my situation, that my cousin was 20 and that she was visiting from out of town, and technically didn't have a legal guardian as she is an adult, and she said \"Oh yeah, anyone from 18-21 is fine, you shouldn't have a problem.\"   Fast forward to Friday night, we drive the 45 minutes to get to Cave Creek, and we park and walk to the front gate (after stepping in some literal horseshit). We give our IDs to the guys at the front gate, and start to walk in. When it comes to my cousins turn, he asks if her legal guardian is here. I explain to him that I called on Thursday and the lady that I talked to assured me that I wouldn't have a problem getting in, that adults from the age of 18-20 are fine. He points to the new sign posted right on the door and repeats that she must have her legal guardian. I explained to him, that as a 20 year old woman, she doesn't have a legal guardian, and again that I had taken the time to call the day beforehand to make sure that we'd all be able to get in. We discuss other options, saying that in the past my friend was able to sign for his younger friend saying that he would be responsible for him, and then also just tell him that he can put the biggest X on her hand or a completely separate color wristband for all we care. We offer to have him introduce her personally to each of the bartenders with a big \"I'm not 21\" sign on her chest. He tells us that he's sorry but there's nothing that he can do.   At this point, I ask if he's the manager on duty, or if I can talk to whoever is. He goes to get the head of security who patiently listens to my story, and at some points seems to genuinely empathize with our situation. He doesn't budge, however, and turns us away.   I understand and respect them for sticking to their rules, and I get why the rules are in place. I was pretty disappointed, however in the fact that no one apologized for the miscommunication on their end, or offered any kind of solution to try to win back our business. He just kinda pointed the finger at whoever was manning the phone that day. No responsibility was taken, nor were any peace offerings made. I really enjoyed Buffalo Chip, but with this kind of disregard for their customers who drive an hour to and from, and who make arrangements to make sure they are following the rules beforehand by calling more than 24 hours in advance, I don't think that I will be supporting them in the future. If you have a friend or family member who you want to share Buffalo Chip with who is between the ages of 18-21, be aware of this ridiculously exclusive rule, and be prepared for them to make absolutely no concessions."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some action on a wed or Friday night, you need to head up here and try out real, live bull riding. It's quite the thrill. One of the most adrenaline rushing things I've ever done."}
{"text":"Buffalo chip is my home. I'm happy to drive 40 miles from gilbert to come up here. The bbq buffet on the patio is phenomenal, Jen behind the bar always has a cold beer waiting for me wednesday night.  So here's the deal at Buffalo chip: live bands every night so if you're a dancer you've always got a good night to come. Cowboy church sundays, live bull riding wednesday and Friday nights. They sell smores now too so you can bring the kids and have something fun for them to do too. They also have pool tables inside. It's a little cramped by the tables but we always make it work. In and out of season it's a great place for regulars and first timers alike."}
{"text":"And this time we caught a downer.  The brisket was almost pure fat.  Tasty, but fat.  To be fair, they took it off our bill.  But they should never have sent it out of the kitchen.  Maybe their up and down quality explains why they were almost empty at 1pm on a Saturday"}
{"text":"The food was TERRIBLE.  We ordered 4 different items and the only thing that was 1/4 way decent were the French fries.  Go for the ambience... maybe... if you like bull riding or line dancing... but eat elsewhere before you go."}
{"text":"Super cool place, missed the bull riding but saw the dancing. The bar has a great atmosphere and if I'm ever within 50 miles I'll be back. In fact sat next to a guy who drives 50 miles 3 times a week to be here - respect"}
{"text":"Very fun place to go, especially on bull riding nights. Food is good, service fair for the type of place. Bull riding events very fun. Drinks are great. Only gripe I have was the hostess didn't not tell us if you eat outside you can only get buffet and nothing off the regular menu, so from now on before the bull riding I will eat inside, the buffet was not great, the menu dishes are much better. Find the place very friendly and fun. Definitely see it becoming a regular comfort place for us. Also it's a Green Bay Packer hangout! GoPackGo"}
{"text":"Have to say...as an out of towner on vacation...this is a MUST VISIT spot!! Folks...1lb of BBQ for $10.95!! Grab that deal and a cold beer and enjoy being outside and taking in the old Western feel. Wednesday nights is amateur bullriding and 730 and 830. One tip, sit in the wood stands as we sat i nthe metal stadium seating and people packed it in and our 3rd row seat was blocked by all the bystanders. Kids, they will let you sit up front and they throw out beads...everyone enjoyed. YES...we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday night. I heard about the rodeo show they have. Yet, this is one of those things \"been there, done that\",  I don't need to return back.  Friendly patrons and the rodeo was fun when they got started, yet it was getting awkward and when they continuously stopped the show to make long, lengthy announcements that no one in the audience cared about...which included politics and stating Sheriff Arpaio was arriving. I'm not from here. AZ and l could care less about the political drawn out statements, over and over again.  Others felt the same, who are long time residents. I left as soon as he arrived and walked to my car and he was still talking.  The rodeo would have gotten at least 4 stars if not without all of the interruption, better parking system and water misters to help cool the public down. It is way too hot to enjoy it.   Strictly dirt parking. Kinda frustrating.  Get there early and if needed park on the upper mound level to avoid waiting on others to leave. Kudos to the bull riders, the sheep and the calf, kiddie riders. They were adorable!"}
{"text":"Live bull riding night, bbq galore, indoor and outdoor bar. View of rodeo action can be crowded. At the front door an open barrel of salted peanuts in the shell. You can even toss the peanut shells on the floor."}
{"text":"We wanted a fun night out with the kids and attended the Wednesday night Bull riding and it was a blast.  The BBQ is ok, sides could stand to be upgraded a bit, but the entertainment was outstanding.  I would take friends and family from out of town back.  It was fun and kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Great Friday night activity.  I've only been to this place once, but I will definitely go back.  On Fridays, they have an outside BBQ buffet for $10 and you get to watch free bullriding from 8pm to 11pm.  Inside the establishment they had a live country band with line dancing."}
{"text":"We used to love the Chip, it was our go to place when we had company from out of town. The new Chip is missing the special something. The hostesses are rude, the restaurant is just set up in a strange way. We will be back, but we will be sitting outside and will eat somewhere else first. Super disappointing."}
{"text":"Had an awesome time at this place and met some totally random strangers who we partied with all night long. Drinks were cheap and we only had appetizers but they were all good. Our friend rode a bull for the first time ever so that was exciting. Hanging around the fire pits is always good time. Can't wait to try some of the bbq next time."}
{"text":"Holy bull riding batman! Here are some updates since my last review.   Be sure to visit Buffalo Chip Saloon on Friday nights. The professional live bull riding makes it worth the drive, trust me.   Since my last visit, they've built an entirely new edition to the Saloon where they serve the famous BBQ buffet. It's very nice and makes for a good place to sit and eat!   I just love it here. This place is definitely what you would think AZ looks like if you lived elsewhere and had never been to Arizona, but sometimes even the locals need a little tourist social night in their life!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone. They double parked behind my car blocking me in so I could not leave. The door man was rude to say the least and when they finally got the car moved (an employees car) the door man was mad because I went over his head to the emanager to get the car moved so he called the sheriffs department and tried to get me arrested for DUI. The police blocked us in our parking spot and wanted to talk to me but when they saw my wife was driving they let us go. I am just saying I would not go back there and would not recommend this to anyone ever. Watch when you leave and be careful or end up in jail. Not really the way to treat your patrons that pay your bills. They manager told me they call on people because if you leave and hurt someone and are drunk it is their responsibility. Not true but all I am saying is be careful with this place if you decide to chance it."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in on Saturday afternoon since it had been awhile since the last time we were in. It was a bit chilly when we came in but they had plenty of heaters on outside and the fire pits going so finding warmth was not ever an issue. We sat at the bar that services the inside and outside and we decided to order some dinner to share. We talked to the bartender Dustin and he explained that we could order from him or we could order from the BBQ bar/stand area and they will bring our food to us. We knew we wanted to just share some brisket and maybe a side. I walked to the BBQ bar/stand and there was a female bartender talking to two other employees and there was no one else around. I walked over and asked if I order from them for some BBQ....they looked at me for a second without saying anything and looked quite confused. After a minute or so I said I just wanted to order a pound of brisket and a side, the bartender proceeded to grab a sheet of paper and say let me check if we even have brisket today...she said no we don't have that but we only have a brisket sandwich....ahhhh what?!? Let me get this straight...you have a brisket sandwich but you don't have brisket? WTF?!? I said I just wanted brisket no sandwich and she again said she didn't have that! The two other employees were just standing there doing absolutely nothing. I walked away and just shook my head and told my boyfriend what had just happened and he was just as confused as I was. I then went back to the bar and ordered from one of the other bartenders working the main bar as I told her I tried ordering from them but they were not helpful at all. They brought out our food and it was quite good. I made a point to get Dustin's name and tell him he was a great bartender as he was! Very attentive, great attitude and service and he deserved to hear he was doing  great job. We will be back again soon but will look for Dustin for the friendly attitude and the great service."}
{"text":"This place is a must stop on Friday nights  when ever we have guests visiting from out of town. Where else can you see live bull riding, lots of fire pits, live country music, numerous bars outside that eliminates the wait for a drink. Have not tried the food. Wear your boots and cowboy hat!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS BBQ, and if you're a fan of country and cowboy-themed restaurants with a large outdoor and patio area, you'll like this place. I've never been in the Cave Creek area, and while this place was pretty far from my place, it was totally worth it.   Now granted, we visited this place on a Sunday afternoon. It was dead at this time, but I've heard rumors it gets really packed Friday and Saturdays.  I got the BBQ platter, which was about $15 total (with tip) and the plate was a nice mix of pulled pork, sausage and some sort of beef strips (forget the name) it was big enough for me to save a good majority of it for leftovers the next day.  Also: They have some sort of offer where you can get a pound of food for ~$10 or something ridiculous like starting at 10 a.m, so I'll try that offer next time I'll be back...and I'll definitely be back. I'd give it five stars but it's really far away from me."}
{"text":"Great fun place to be!   The atmosphere here is awesome! very cool divey country western feel. I came here with some friends for drinks and country dancing. It's quite a drive when your coming from the west side of town. This place is located in the town of crave creek, which seems like it's in the middle of no where. ha ha   The place seem really big on the inside. The dance for was kind of small and I wish they had more restrooms.   We came here on a Saturday night, It was really busy, and lot of people were on the dance floor getting their two step on. They had a live band that sounds really good. Not much for drink speicals though. If you plan on drinking a lot you might want to plan on spending some extra mula.   Very fun place here, great from groups and events."}
{"text":"I have been to this bar a handful of times and I just have to say in comparison to the surrounding bars. The people at three chip are just awful. The girls there are snotty and seem unwilling to meet new people. It seemed as though there was a lot of drama and the bartenders are not very social or friendly. I love bullriding and mutton bustin for the kids but wow, I would rather go to Outlaws down the way, formerly \"Outlaw Annie's\"."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Arizona for the month of February on our year long trip around the US. While in Phoenix, we were looking for some free, wild wild west fun, and found Buffalo Chips! We had so much fun watching the bull riding, talking to locals, and enjoying a bourbon on the rocks. We did not have any of the food here, but it smelled delish!   We came on a Friday night and it was PACKED! We caught the 8pm bull riding show. The seating is free, and they have experienced riders, first timers, kids, and LITTLE kids who ride sheep! It was a hoot! Great energy, an evident love of the USA, and so much fun.   We were there in February, so it got cool at night, but there are tons of heaters and fire pits around, so you won't get too cold! Before we left, we watched some people dancing inside. One of these days we will take lessons! :)   I actually just wrote about our experience here in my blog post about the Food and Fun in Arizona: https://tandaintheusofa.com/2017/03/16/food-and-fun-in-arizona/"}
{"text":"\"Terrific Atmosphere / Good Food\"  Came in on a Wednesday night and ordered a steak .  The beer was cold and the atmosphere authentic.  What I did not bother to do until I had finished my meal was walk around to the back.   This place is crazy on the weekends and crazy on Wednesdays...  The reason? Bull riding!!!!   Wednesday evening they let the amateurs jump on for a try, so anyone ANYONE could ride on a Wednesday evening under the stars.  The 4* star rather than 5* was just for the food, could be a little better but the BBq Sauce is great , as are the tacos.  Come to this place for a bite and a drink but stay and ride the bull that escaped the grill!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about the Chip.  I like the place,  I like the atmosphere,  I like 99% of the clients,  I like the food. SO WHATS THE PROBLEM  I like Captain Morgan and coke. OK fine I like a little Coke with the Cptn Morgan. The drinks inside just never taste right to me. Perhaps it is a \"cola\" not a Coke perhaps it is a weak pour or bad ice or carbonation issues ... Whatever... I just taste something off.   This does not stop me to partake...just a bother.   OH I don't like getting my feet dirty BUT that is my problem since I choose to not wear shoes or boots there. HAHA"}
{"text":"Bull Riding Friday Night is AWESOME!  No cover fee or charge to get in.  Atmosphere and attire are casual laid back country.  Boots to sneakers and fedoras to cowboy hats.  It all works.  Prices are fair and the food is pretty good for typical trash bar food.  Early evening this is a family establishment and it gets rowdier as the night progresses.  Parking is a P.I.T.A. so come early and get a good spot NEAR THE STREET so you don't get pinned in.  ENJOY THE BULL RIDING UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL!"}
{"text":"It's a cool concept, and really a great place to take the family, kids and all.  It is kind of a haul to get to, but it's worth it...from time to time. It's spacious and has an authentic old west vibe, complete with cowboys, cowgirls, and rednecks with money. It's nice that they give you the option to eat buffet-style or just order a big juicy burger for $5. The bullriding, though not my thing, was a nice touch. The WTF moment of the night happened though when the bullride MC asked everyone to bow their heads and pray to Jesus. Uhhhh hello? I didn't sign up to go to church, and I don't think it's cool to push YOUR religious beliefs onto a crowd of people who just showed up to eat and watch some live entertainment. That was weird. The rest of my experience was enjoyable though."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with folks who say this place is touristy. Granted, this is THE place to take your out-of-town visitors. Last time I was here we had a friend from Australia and she was over-the-moon at her first real American experience. So yes, a lot of out-of-towners. But you CAN'T tell me that the folks tearing up the dance floor on any given Friday are your Uncle Murray and Aunt Sybil visiting from Boca.  This is a fun place with a nice old west feel. They have great live music, the afore mentioned dancing, reasonably priced drinks, pool tables, a HUGE patio....and as others have mentioned, LIVE bull riding. I really need to come here more often because it is one of the funnest places in The Valley and you really feel like you're away from it all. Yes it gets uber-crowded, the line to the men's room is a long as the line to the ladies room and you're really kinda screwed if you really came here to play pool, but if there is ANY place you should take it all in stride, it's here.  And seriously folks, quit bitching about the food. It's a $20 steak for God's sake. You get what you pay for and frankly it's pretty damned good-better than Outback or Applebee's. If that's not good enough then go to Mastro's and bring your own bull.  Good times and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  This place was recommended to me by the gentlemen at sabas.  It was Saturday night and my girlfriend and I got all dressed up and headed down to the buffalo chip for a fun evening.  I had previously viewed the menu online and was craving something special.  Well when I pulled up in my truck,  some good music was playing.  We approached the back entrance and two bouncers asked for ID.  We are both 20 and got denied access.  I asked \"so we can't even eat here?\" and he said no.  Ruined our experience and couldn't have been more disappointed. We are on a tight budget and don't get to go out often and sadly this is what we faced."}
{"text":"I went to the Buffalo Chip Saloon on Friday a couple of weeks back and had a great time. Being a native of Arizona I'm no stranger to country western restaurants and bars. The Buffalo Chip is probably one of the best. Friday nights is all you can eat fish fry with delicious cod that would make even a non fish lovers mouth water.   The only thing better than the food was the service. Despite it's popularity in Cave Creek and the valley for that matter, service was fantastic. Our server was on point with drink refills and getting our food out quick.  The Buffalo Chip offers a full bar and great atmosphere for adults and children. I really have nothing bad to say about this place. I would highly recommend it to anyone willing to make the trip to Cave Creek.  OH...I almost forgot. Bull riding on Friday nights also. Free entertainment with an outdoor bar. Great for the kids too."}
{"text":"Well, we went to the Buffalo Chip today during the bike run.  We were told by the cashier to \"go ahead and have a seat anywhere\", so we chose a table, tried to sit down but I banged my knee on the table stand because the chair wouldn't move due to the tables being too close together, so we moved to a more acceptable spot.  I have to say, the seating was NOT comfortable and the tables just didn't seem wide enough to fit multiple items... now, I wouldn't know this for sure because after 15 mins of sitting, pretty much next to the kitchen entry, being passed by MULTIPLE employees and watching 2 tables get help AFTER us, we were NEVER helped and we left.  Now, before you say \"oh, it was their grand opening, they were probably busy\"...no.  We were there around 4:15pm and there were more employees/waitresses, than there were customers at this time.  NO EXCUSE acceptable, for what happened and very disheartening, considering the amazing review I left for them a year ago.  The lady  manager/ possibly the owner said \"thanks for coming\" and I had to let her know that we waited with no help.  No attempt to fix the matter and let us leave with no apology.  I just recommended them 2 days ago... that referral will be intercepted and we will NOT return.  Plus, not very warm and inviting with seats that made you want to stay and buy more, with this new remodel... It's a shame.  I'm sure they'll do fine and I do wish then luck, but no longer my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I went to the pre-opening dance party. I was impressed with their high quality wood dance floor but I was disappointed that it wasn't larger. For country dancing it will be a tight squeeze on busy nights.  They had a good live band and a free dance lesson. There were too many people to give a viable lesson but they tried. Sound acoustics seemed to be good throughout the dining room area and bars.   Overall the Chip rebuild is impressive. It will be a popular party place and hangout in the winter months.  The food was mediocre bar fare. My partner and I did give the fried sweet potatoes a thumbs up.  I was told by the waitress that they are using a temporary kitchen and she reassured me the food will improve.   Parking in the dirt wasn't fun. I hope I didn't get Valley Fever. Cough! Cough!  There isn't much reason for me to drive the 45 miles to get there because I have better options that are much closer, so I won't be inhabiting this venue very often.   For many of the regular patrons, the Buffalo Chip has a mystical aura of Brobdingnagian significance. I call these cultists the \"Chippers\". While practically living at the Chip they learned to dance, and many of them had torrid romances -- and perhaps a few got hitched.. I'm sure many of the children that resulted from that cowboy social scene can be seen at the Chip to this day. For the disciples of the Chip, no rating less than 5 will ever do. (Sorry Folks!) I have no doubt that if I come back when the Chip is completed I will upgrade my rating to a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"Hey Y'all!  No freakin way does a place like this exist. Completely surreal!  I like my country but this is something you have to be in a Honky Tonk mood for!!   You walk in and there is a big bon fire going on with picnic benches and people eating off of paper plates as there is 10.00 all you can eat BBQ going on. seriously. They have an outdoor bull riding ring that starts around 7. And these are real bulls with semi professionals and rodeo clowns and everything. none of that mechanical wimpy stuff.  there are three rounds and they always start of with a little kid riding a lamb. so cute. The bull riding is legit and so fun, definitely a fun crowd!  in between the bull rides you can go inside to listen to a live band! They totally rock my socks! There wasn't any line dancing going on to my dismay but it was fun dancing and singing. Well a funny moment came when they were to sing \"Save a house, ride a cowboy\" and he was reading the lyrics off of his blackberry. At first I thought he was texting, but no he was reading. I mean who whips out their blackberry when they are on stage?  The food, is, well, country food. fried fries, fried chicken, brisket, fried fish-you get the idea. The BEST is the smores! they give you a little fire, skewers and enough fixins for 6 smores! :) yeee haw!"}
{"text":"This place is fun.  Just how you would expect a Cave Creek bar to be.  Nice country music and dancing or you can go outside for bbq, fire pit, and bull riding.  The food is pretty good, prices are reasonable, and the beer is cold.  The parking is the worst ever.  I've seen people get pinned in and cars bumped.  I ended up with a large dent in my car once.  Take your beat up road warrior car and enjoy."}
{"text":"The bartender \"Texas\" is a sad excuse for one. Her shift was about to end and we had just closed out with her. She had another bartender come over and ask (while we were talking to people we'd just met) what we would tip her since she was leaving. Millennial problems and COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL. During all my years bartending if your shift ended and you closed someone out, the next shift would put your tip in an envelope or hold it in some fashion but what she did was pretty unprofessional. Bartenders before her slung drinks for a lot less per hour and were a lot more professional. The gentleman working with her was nice and engaging but she was a sour"}
{"text":"Buffalo Chip is full of real-life cowboys. I felt like I walked into a country western film when we got here. The main restaurant was a normal looking sports bar, but when we got out back it was another story with the pen for bull riding.  For $20 a person, we went up to the VIP section which was made the weekend for two eager little boys. We had great seats, and a server for food and drinks. It was really busy in the VIP section, and we only had one server so everything was a bit slower than expected. Our server was doing her best, but it would be nice if they had another server to help her out.   We stayed for appetizers, drinks, dinner for the munchkins and 10 or so bull riders. The food was so so, but the drinks were strong, and the entertainment was top notch. I'd certainly recommend planning a night out to Buffalo Chip.   The only downside is that it's a Packer's bar, and I'm a Steeler's fan. Apparently, there's a Steeler's bar next door though!"}
{"text":"I tried going here once but left after 20 minutes of waiting for someone... anyone... to give us a menu or take our drink order. The place was empty except for 2 people at the bar, which is where we probably should have sat if we wanted service.   Maybe the food is good? I would have liked to find out."}
{"text":"Oh Lord somehow I have wound up in Cave Creek down at the Buffalo Chip Salon,  I guess this place during the day is restaurant and I'm sure even at 11 they were cooking some beef cuz I sure was smelling the bbq and thinking damn that smells good, yea wasn't thinking about food till I smelt the bbq! But didn't get any but did have me another whiskey and coke, guess that was my drink for the night  So if you're into cowboys, hunny this is your place! It must be the mecca for the cowboys, they were everywhere, Also there was a live band playing loud and proud, dance floor was small, inside seemed to be a tab bit small to me too and crowded, I don't like when its elbow to elbow of people, I like to people watch, look around till a spot a fly guy and then go talk to him, but here to move around was a big production.     Sometimes it's not about the place you are at, but with the company you keep, I did have a good time at the buffalo chip, but it was due to hanging out with my girlfriends on a Friday night! My dd and I bounced after 40 mins, again if you're into loud country music and tons of cowboys, this is your place!   DD & I hit the road to go check out a dive bar in the valley"}
{"text":"Such a gnarly experience!!! Parking was rough so get there early. Beer was cheap, live band was great, bull riding was so fun to watch! Buffalo Chip, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Killer catfish going on at this place! Friendly bartender and server. Nice rodeo style bar. Came early to eat but looks like a nice dance floor for later in the evenings."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Service is tremendous Couldn't ask for a more enjoyable bartender. Bill is the best. The beef brisket street taco can't be any better.  Recommend it to everybody."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate writing this review.  I've been going to the Buffalo Chip since I was a kid, and frequented the restaurant during the day and the festivities in the night for decades. Pre-fire it was the best burger around.  However the fire claimed the souls of the buffalo chip.  The new building is stark and not dissimilar to other establishments within blocks. The \"old\" buffalo chip was warm and cozy, albeit haphazard and short restrooms. The new buffalo chip is like a Texas Roadhouse. A missed opportunity. Secondly, the food isn't at all the same. The burgers have dirt cheap buns which disintegrate upon handling and the meat has lost all its pre-fire character. Nothing special anymore.   It hurts the heart to see what happened.  Larry missed it on the rebuild though, and it just isn't the old Buffalo Chip anymore. With some more focus on recreating the feel we all loved (yes with some more bathrooms) and an exact replica of the system used to produce such wonderful burgers would have been all that was needed to turn this back into a 5 star destination."}
{"text":"We went during the all you can eat BBQ which was really good. I couldn't get enough of the ribs and shredded pork. I'm assuming their BBQ sauce is house made and boy was it good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Buffalo Chip Saloon for a birthday party.  It was fairly easy to find as I don't go to Cave Creek all that often.  So here's the run down:  Pros -Good food.  You may want to avoid if you are a vegetarian but I mean...really...it says steakhouse in the name.  -Great atmosphere.  We were out in the back area and they had bull riding and good country music blasting.    -Great staff. They were prompt and really nice for as crazy as their system is (More on that in the Cons). I had a fly in my beverage when it came out and she apologized profusely and quickly went and got me a fly free beverage.  We were outside, it's not like we were inside and there was a fly in my food.    Cons  -Payment system. In the day and age of identity theft, I am not a fan of letting my credit/debit card out of sight.  This place takes your card, until you leave.  Seriously.  I'm sorry but that is beyond crazy.  So far, I've not see any \"extra\" charges on my card so I guess they are trustworthy.   -Ordering food was not clear.  It may have been just because we were part of a large group but it was just kind of \"we do what now?\" Never saw a menu, we just did an outdoor buffet.   Summary Go check them out if you like good food and country music and don't mind total strangers holding on to your credit cards for indeterminate amounts of time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the place is really nice and the wait staff were great as well. If I scored the place solely on those two things I'd give them a 4 out of 5. My score is for the food only, which is literally terrible. The prices are great but the food is so bad it still doesn't justify the cost. The buffet area had no serving spoons for the condiments- literally none. The storage tub to cool the condiments was warm and the water underneath was warm and all the ice was gone (yes, I moved the metal food bins to see if it was cold before eating the coleslaw so I didn't get food poisoning). Without a functioning cold bin the coleslaw and ranch was stored at outdoor temps which is just food poisoning sitting there, yours for the taking. That is, if you could find something to scoop your food poising up with. In the kitchen there were two people handling and getting food ready for plates with no gloves on, just their bare hands all over your biscuits and fries. Two others did have gloves, one of which was an older man working the grill while eating his dinner- what looked like a taco(?!?!?) with his gloves on. I cannot make this up, he's grilling and eating his dinner at the same time. Food prep 101- you can't eat your dinner while making other people's food and the fact that you just ate a what appeared to be a taco of sorts renders your sanitary gloves absolutely useless. The BBQ is completely void of taste and the biscuits taste exactly like KFC. the ribs, chicken, etc. taste like they're frozen and then reheated and they leave it to you add BBQ sauce which I had to scoop from an open tub with a plastic condiment container (like the to-go salsa containers from Rubios) because there wasn't a serving spoon in that either. After seeing all the sanitary signs you may wonder why I even ate the food at all (I am wondering the same thing myself) but we had been at the lake earlier and we were really hungry and didn't want to wait another 40 minutes to get home. This was a bad decision as I felt more sick with every mile closer to home and ended up throwing up as soon as I got there. I am convinced any of the reviews that say the food is good, they have either never eaten BBQ in their life or were completely trashed and couldn't taste the food they were eating. For the price, you could go to Famous Dave's and at least have half decent chain BBQ instead of these frozen concoctions. I should say that the burgers aren't any better they taste like frozen patties as well and are cooked to a hockey puck consistency by the old man eating his tacos at the grill. The cheese on the burgers tastes like great value \"cheese\" that doesn't actually taste like cheese- you know that thick waxy government cheese they used to dole out in the 80s. If you want food because your hungry go anywhere else, literally anywhere- there is a circle k a 1/2 mile down the road, stop there. If you're going here just for the bar, eat up and ask for seconds. After a few drinks you won't taste anything you're eating and after a few more you won't remember what it tasted like coming up either."}
{"text":"Just Celebrated my Sisters Birthday here, and we all had a Fabulous time !  they had a Great Band!  the food we had was greasy and good !  the Smores were the best, not too many Restaurants offer Smores, also it was a thursday night that we went, and they had a free Dance Lesson, which was so much fun, would difinitely recommend this place for a FUN time !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We take our out of town guests here for a unique experience and fantastic brisket. Young and old alike love to people watch and try the bbq."}
{"text":"We waited 10 minuets at the outside area to be served. The bartender and server looked right at us but never came to our table. The atmosphere was awesome but the service sucked! The sad thing is it was Sunday and not busy!"}
{"text":"If it were possible, I would have given this a negative 10; the absolute worst experience of our lives. I went in there at approximately 2:00 today (Sunday) with my husband and son. it was relatively empty ( maybe three other tables of customers , but several dirty tables that were sitting unbussed). There was no one at the hostess stand, but to the right were two girls behind the bar; presumably bartenders. They saw us standing there for over five minutes and said nothing. I walked the two feet over to them and asked them whether we should seat ourselves, even though the sign said the hostess would do so. They ignored me. I asked again and one snapped \"yeah\" My husband said we should leave and go to the Horny Toad, but I wanted to give this place a try. My son said the bartenders were disgustingly rude and he too would prefer to go elsewhere.  My choice was to give them a try. We sat at a table and waited for a waitress. We waited and waited and waited.Two gals were walking around, one of which was messing with the TV right above our table.  They would not make eye contact, but knew we were there. We sat there almost 15 minutes with these two gals walking right by us and neither was doing anything! The people next to us were waiting for drink refills and were livid. We got up and yes, one of them saw us and we left. UNBELIEVABLE!! I called thirty minutes later to speak to the manager and the girl who answered the phone said she was too busy to talk to me and what was the problem. I told her I needed to speak with the manager and she refused to see if she would take the call. I told her what happened and here is what she said: The two bartenders were ignoring me because they were supposed to be \" off the clock\" and didn't feel they needed to acknowledge a customer. She didn't seem to have an issue with their rudeness. The reason we weren't waited on or approached was because they were having computer issues. When I tell you that this pathetic excuse for an employee couldn't care less...I cannot stress this enough. I told her a simple waive from one of the girls, as in we will be right with you, would have been fine. The place was filthy with more dirty tables than clean ones, we have NEVER seen a staff as rude, disgusting  and unprofessional as this in our lives. I cannot imagine allowing customers to be treated so poorly. We will never go back and we will make certain that every single person we know never steps foot in that place. There are several fantastic eateries within steps of that place; do yourself a favor and go there!NEGATIVE 10 folks!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have ever had. I have eaten here before during daytime family hours with no issues. Today, my nephews were visiting and love cowboys. Everything went downhill from there. I called and asked if the restuarant was air conditioned because I know it is an indoor/outdoor place. I was told yes. It was as hot inside as it was outside and it is a dangerous temperature for kids to be in for really any amount of time. In addition, flies were everywhere, landing on us, and food, when it arrivee. Then the food ordered off the kids menu was served extremely hot and of course it won't cool down when it is 110 in the resturaunt. Then the blairing music and then the manager topped it off. As he walking around, he starts rubbing my nephew's head, my nephew has his back to him, and my nephew is completely freaked out. DON'T TOUCH OTHER PEOPLES KIDS! He started talking to us and it was obvious we were not interested because my wife and were desperate to keep the kids from overheating - manager did not get it. It was awful as an adult and even worse for the kids. This was about 5pm on a Sunday last I checked still family hours. Won't be going back. Would never recommend."}
{"text":"Ok, honestly this is not going to be everyone's bag. But I LOVE going to Buffalo Chip. Throw on my cowboy boots, have a chance to wear denim on denim (oh hell yes I did!) & just let my wild hair down.   PBR out of a mason jar. Professional bull riding on Fridays & amateurs on Wednesdays (my guy friends' favorite new activity). Two-stepping to live bands. Fire pits out back. Cheap, delicious BBQ that looks as unhealthy as it is for you...but that makes it so much more yummy.  There is no pretension here. Everyone is just hanging out, having a good time. Talk to strangers. Everyone just seems genuinely nice. The walls are covered with cool shit & it definitely feels like I think AZ felt like back in the day.  Take a trip...Cave Creek is so much fun, & the Buffalo Chip is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Best cheese Curds I've ever had! Atmosphere is great! The rodeos and bonfires are pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Chip is like another world!  We love living in downtown Phoenix, but this place is a great getaway for the night.  If feels like another world.  The dance floor is always packed and drinks flow freely.  The food is ok, but nothing great.    The live bull riding on Friday nights pack this place out, but its also worth it...   Super fun. Great place to go with a group of friends.  Just make sure you whip out your wranglers and boots before hitting it up."}
{"text":"Our first visit and not our last. The food, drinks, service and Band were all better than average. Not only did we enjoy the saloon, but the other patrons in the saloon were fun to be around. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"One of the few true Cowboy bars left in Arizona, and this place is a run down and rusty house of fun.  The food is good, especially the Friday night fish fry, and the beer and food is inexpensive and well made.  A Green Bay Packer bar, the place hops on Sundays.  Go there, dress casually and have a nice time."}
{"text":"This place is full of flies..... because of the rodeo. You cannot eat without having to swat away flies off your food.  There are ways to deal with flies but these places do not even put the effort.  Maybe they think it adds to the ambiance. The women behind the bar tend to keep the change if it is within $4 or $5 dollars assuming it is their tip when you pay in cash and that is on a $5 purchase!!! That is something I have never experienced before. I guess they think they are pretty special. One time we were there the Barmaid carried her 2 year old around behind the bar then sat him down on the bar. I guess that is OK too.  They are over priced now from what it was before they burned down the place. Their drinks are now watered down and they and twice the price. Not a place I can recommend. there are better places in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"This is our second visit and a tradition we'll continue to keep.  The place was packed with locals and tourists.  It's loud and bawdy with a down home atmosphere.  Reservations are accepted and strongly recommended, however our hostess was accommodating and found us a spot.  We chose to eat inside the saloon.  If coming with kids, eat outdoors around the pits.  Our server, while very nice, wore a very small top which was inappropriate and embarrassing.  It was appeared to be standard attire for most of the servers.  The food is good barbecue.  The portions are a good size.  Split the salads as they are large.  There was live music, plenty of dancing and a gal swinging from the ceiling.  The rodeo starts with prayer and the national anthem.  Even inside, everyone stood in silence and then erupted in applause following the final notes.  The mutton busting can't be beat.  The stands were packed.  If in Cave Creek you don't want to miss this gem.  You'll be glad you did.  Make sure to grab a T-shirt or hoodie to commemorate the evening.  It comes in handy too, as it can be chilly in the stands.  Yes Haw!"}
{"text":"Very eclectic and inviting interior.  Get to see a bit of Old West history both inside and out.  The staff were very happy, helpful, and attentive.  Started with cheese curds--which were delicious.  The buffalo stew was very, very tasty.  Ribs--HUGE portion, but did not have very much flavor.  I will agree with the other reviews which state that the sauce is very bland--and they liberally slather it on.  Both ends of the ribs were so tough that they were inedible, and the spine section was liberally coated in fat which I had to cut away.  $40 for two--no drinks.  Did not leave hungry!  I would have given 4 stars for the ambiance and excellent service; knocked it down to 3 for the ribs."}
{"text":"LIVE BULL RIDING FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Wednesday nights are armature nights (though you could have fooled me)   The hubs and I headed up as our friends son is apprenticing to be a rodeo clown (Who knew that was possible)   We had a total blast! Those bulls are feisty!   We didn't make it inside, but could hear the live band jamming out. We did hit up the BBQ buffet, pretty dang tasty. For $10 you get a POUND of meat, 2 sides and a biscuit. The hubs and I split a plate and they let you get several different kinds of meat, whatever adds up to a pound.   We will be going back up here again real soon."}
{"text":"An amazing country western good time at the Buffalo Chip.  An ABSOLUTELY MUST TRY when in Cave Creek, AZ.  Came to visit friends building a home in the area.  They suggested the Buffalo Chip as an after dinner drinking hole. We were pleasantly surprised by the ultra friendly staff and patrons, the entertainment, the bull riding, the food and drink.    What a memorable experience.  We'll be back for another round."}
{"text":"I usually only write reviews for bad experiences. This place was so fun i had to write a review. I had an exceptional time watching friday night bull riding and line dancing, both new experiences for me. Everyone was really nice (huge age range), awesome vibe, and the band was good. I'm not a cowboy by any means but I love country music, which is definitely required here. I live in Scottsdale and had to drive about 40 minutes. It was well worth the drive. I will come back for sure. More fun than penthouse suite parties at the Bellagio and rooftop nightclubs in LA, both of which I got to experience recently, and both cost more. Can't say enough about how much fun I had."}
{"text":"Stopped in during bike week, bars across the street were to crowded to find a place to sit to eat. Service was good, food okay, place is only 6 months old. Just ok not special. At the bars across the street music was pounding, wait staff in fishnets and thongs and people having a good time."}
{"text":"Must say I loved this place before but the other night we got up to the bar and ordered drinks and the next thing we know we are being escorted out under a false accusations.  Really not happy, and it left us in a very scary situation to follow.  Long story, but just wanted to say thanks Buffalo Chip!  Might want to review your security staff, I felt strongly that there is something shady going on with them."}
{"text":"I was planning on eating/watching bull ridding here the other night. Went with my 26 year old sister and was told by the security guard that I wasn't aloud to enter since I'm only 19. Seriously this rule is RIDICULOUS if all you wanted to do is eat. My family was actually shocked when I went home and told them. We will from now on eat at Harold's since all ages are welcome."}
{"text":"Half beer butt chicken breast was dry  Half rack ribs meat was tender and smothered in the tasty Bbq sauce (which hubby didn't like; he likes sweeter sauces and this one was smoky) Sweet potato fries- sauce it came w was soooo yummy  Busy Wednesday so service was good at first but when the place packed up we didn't see our waitress, which was pretty much the whole time we ate our dinner.  This place has bull riding and a live band on Wednesdays so it was good to be in one place for food and entertainment. And cheap drinks which is always a nice surprise when you're from LA."}
{"text":"The Chip is a staple for us! Since rebuilding last year, the back patio area is much nicer. The service is what you'd expect for a western bar (a little attitude but fun people), but the drinks and vibe are perfect. Definitely break out your boots and prepare for some dust. My favorite is Friday nights to watch bull riding! The food is pretty solid for bar food. Bring a big group and enjoy an adult night out!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Chip Saloon and Steakhouse... I adore you  Why, most of you ask? I am a true wisconsinite! And buffalo chip is where we belong! Cheese curds, Broasted chicken, beer chasers with our bloody mary's... heck to the yes!   Us cheese heads have to stick together and I am glad I found my spot!   Baffalo Chip Saloon and Steakhouse... As a wisconsinite and cheese curd and broasted chicken loving girl... my heart and soul is yours as long as you support the packers!   plus the food and service is amazing, even if you aren't all about all things Wisconsin (which, I frankly will never understand!)"}
{"text":"Super nice and attentive staff. Thank you Taryn! My burger was a generous size and perfectly cooked. Craft beer drinkers in my party were impressed with beer selection. Solid choice in the area."}
{"text":"Nice place! Good food and drinks, fun entertainment with bull riding and live music. Definitely doesn't feel like you're in the city anymore. When you have visitors in PHX, take them here!"}
{"text":"I wish we found this place sooner in our trip! We found it only an hour before leaving for our flight! We loved the atmosphere, felt like an old saloon, with boots and photos on the ceiling - where the locals hung out (not sure if they did but our bartender the night before was heading there after work!) Between the 5 of us we had the beef brisket and pulled pork which everyone loved. We had the sweet potato fries (yum) and s'mores (fantastic!). We only got to see the first 15 minutes of country dancing, but I will be back to see more and definitely dance next time we fly in! We had a great time while we were there, a dinner full of laughs. If you want a place with a great atmosphere, this is your place"}
{"text":"This place is unique and a fixture of Cave Creek. The bull riding is awesome. The food could be better, but you won't find an atmosphere like this anywhere else. Buffalo Chip screams \"Arizona!\""}
{"text":"Due to Lent, we enjoyed the fish selection in the buffet on Friday night.  The buffet included a great selection of bbq items & sides also.  The cost was $15.95 for a 1.5 lb plate full of food.  The place was packed with people, the outdoor bull riding ambiance was fun & family friendly people was all around.  We will return & recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after buying a house close to this landmark.  We were not disappointed.  It was mid-day and there was live music and great staff and great food.  The waitress whipped up her own version of a steakhouse sauce for my husband and it was amazing!!!!!!  So excited to be moving closer and we will be there often!"}
{"text":"I finally got to experience this place late night snce we got a hotel.  Oh my word. Horses out front, cowboys all over the place and the dancing.. wow the dancing.  You know that wedding reception scene in Steel Magnolias?  That's what you see.  Amazing.  Tons of line dancing as well.     Live music inside, but outside....  bullriding!   So much fun to sit in the stands and watch people ride bulls. They kinda sucked, but who am I to judge?  It was still fantastic.    The bar is PACKED at night and the drinks are cheap.  Good food and fun times."}
{"text":"Eat before you get there but stay for drinks and the atmosphere.  We spent $75 on food that wasn't very good and ended up get soggy because we got caught in a quick rain storm. Since all the seating is outside we had limited places to seek cover. I never complain when AZ gets rain but our dinners got wet and we ended up throwing it all out. We had out of town guests with us which made it that much more disappointing.  We enjoyed watching the bull riding and live band. The kids had fun dancing to the music and making s'mores."}
{"text":"The food here is very good solid western food. But you MUST go to see the live professional bull riders on Wednesday or Friday!!! Lots of fun!!! I have been going there for over 10 years whenever I am in Scottsdale or Cave Creek. Well worth a trip up to Cave Creek from anywhere in the valley of the sun."}
{"text":"Wow, what a tourist trap.   Which is how we found ourselves there, in Cave Creek, an hour from our home. We were there because out of town guests wanted to go there. We wouldn't have chosen to go here on our own.  From the second we walked in, you can see it's very Country Western themed. Boots hanging from ceiling, pictures and art, wooden tables. But it's nothing you can't get at other restaurants around town.   We had reservations but arrived early, so had to wait about 10 minutes. It was packed. Our table was not cleaned off before we were sat there & there were holes in my chair. Service was adequate, but nothing too friendly or fast. You could tell our server was overwhelmed- \"in the weeds.\" Our table was in the worst location- back corner by the bar & server station so I had people standing over me to get to the bar, knocking my chair (one lady's purse hit me in the head as she squeezed past), and servers dropping plates or talking to each other about their customers. Trust me, I get it- I waited tables for years & we talked about customers too. But never where other customers could hear us! Speaking of hearing, the restaurant was LOUD! Mostly because it was packed but music was on too. I was in a party of 4- 2 people had the fish fry, 1 had steak & I had the chicken sandwich. The food was awful! All meals came out cold with the exception of the steak. The fries are the kind of Ore Ida you can get at the store (not crinkle cut though) and everything was bland. My chicken sandwich had green chilis on it & they had no flavor at all. I doused it with salt & pepper & tried to choke down cold fries with ranch that didn't taste good either (you know when something doesn't taste right but you can't explain it? That was the ranch). The only person who finished their meal was the 1 who had the steak & we all agreed we should've had that. At least it wasn't a rip off- all meals were in $10 range except for steak which I think was $17. But as terrible as the food was, you couldn't pay me to eat it again.  We finished our meal & went outside to check out the bull riding. Here's why I give BC 2 stars instead of 1-- it's a cool set up outside. Several bars & beer tubs, an arena for bull riding, picnic tables & bonfires. The people watching is First Class- tourists, cougars, teens, cowboys. Crowd seemed to be about 85% over the age of 45 & more tourists than locals. It was crowded & at times seemed like a meat market. Bull riding takes place at 8, 9, & 10 and you should get there early to sit in arena.   Inside, half of the restaurant had been cleared of tables, a live country cover band was playing & people were dancing. Sorry- just seemed hokey to us. Again, it was crowded. The guys who had the pool tables couldn't even play because of people crowded around them.   I wasn't impressed & doubt I'll be back unless dragged all the way up there again. And one things for sure, I will not eat there ever again- BLECH! Sit in the back, drink beers & enjoy people watching."}
{"text":"A lot of fun!  Friday nights live Bull Riding out back!  Outdoor bonfire!  Really something different!"}
{"text":"A unique place. Was open on Christmas day a few years ago and we ate there outside and took our dog with us. (we had just hiked in the Spur Cross) . Have gone back a few times and its a favorite of our family. Our kids always ask to go back. Just a fun place to eat and hang out."}
{"text":"Went there with my girls. I like the remodeling and I even got my girl to sit on a bull with her pretty dress. The people are super cool and the dancing is fun. We're up here all the time. Makes me feel like home."}
{"text":"BRIITANY, daytime bartender  Great food suggestions & drinks!! Didn't know what I wanted. Made 2 AWESOME Britfany bar specials. We ate Pork sandwhich, no bread  tasted incredibly delious as well as brisket sandwich. I made it open face, rarely ever finish a meal. I ate 75% of my entire lunch.  BEST lunch & service in a long time. Thx Brittany"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for bbq. The pulled pork is amazing and the drinks are even better. Just a cute family place with a western feel. The s'mores for dessert are my favorite part and the service is great! I will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is huge! No need to get to dressed up it's like being out at the barn. Such a good time watching the bull riding. The MC is hilarious!"}
{"text":"What an experience! Really fun family activity that shows off the true southwest history in Arizona. I split the hamburger with a friend, which was extremely yummy (but I was still hungry and they charge $3 for splitting so I wouldn't recommend splitting). Fries were also very good! Reasonable prices for food and drinks. The bull riding was extremely entertaining! Which if I recall correctly is Wednesdays and Fridays only. I would recommend making a reservation, we weren't able to find a table for four and sat at the bar. Children riding sheep is a little crazy and kind of sad to watch, but I guess it's part of the experience! Round up the whole fam and get out there!"}
{"text":"Food was good but needed more choices for the bbq sauce. Only had one. Pulled pork sandwich was tasty. Bbq platter was a lot of food but was just ok in taste. Blue cheese wedge was pricey but delicious. S'mores seemed old but liked that you could cook your marshmallow over the fire. Got to see Bull riding and a band."}
{"text":"The Buffalo Chip, Cave Creek, AZ! We ended our road trip on Sunday there for dinner. Your new structure is awesome. As we drove through town we knew we had to eat there! I switched up my wine for a cool refreshing Gin and Tonic. Gary got iced tea, lots of ice! We had to ask for a glass of ice, NO Charge! The tonic was \"flat\". I thought it was Gin and water. So, we tell the waitress. Who was very nice and offered a new one. Now, I would think the bartender would, at this point, check the tonic water. But No... I get a second...FLAT! Order dinner. I order Catfish and Gary a Brisket sandwich, no cheese, can he get a couple onions. The waitress says she cannot promise the onion. Sometimes when she puts in the order it is not transferred correct. OK... Dinner comes out. Oh no, thanks for the onion, but I can't eat cheese. So back it goes. Now, the very best thing about bar food??? The hot crispy French Fries! The buffalo Chips serves their French Fries pale and limp! Two small pieces of fish. And when the brisket sandwich finally did come back out, it had half the meat the first one had and half of that was fat.  Scott the manager comes around and we tell him about the drink. He did offer another or take it off the tab. I choose to have it taken off. We were finished eating. Now the bill comes. The brisket sandwich was clearly $9 on the menu, yet bill said $10. I point this out to Scott. He tells me it was because Gary asked for onion. Yet it did not show $1 for onion and no credit for NO Cheese. It clearly had the sandwich was $10.  You know what Scott; you owe that waitress and bartender a tip. They clearly work for you. I am of the belief your employees cut corners where they are told by management. I will never go back and that is sad, The Buffalo Chip is such an Icon in Cave Creek. If you go... stick to the beer or wine and make sure you get your onions to go."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT! AWESOME FUN FAMILY NIGHT! What a great place to have a great night! Awesome food spectacular entertainment...live bands and line dancin and a live band and to top it all off watching the bull riding with great music played with a hilarious DJ! I highly recommend this place! Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Just visited Buffalo Chip on February 7th and they have an AWESOME barbecue buffet going on right now for just $12.00 with tax.  Saturdays and Sundays in the afternoon until (I believe) 6:00 pm.    They had the following meats and sides ALL YOU CAN EAT:    Beef Brisket (Unsauced - they have two delish sauces) Pulled Pork (Unsauced) Texas Sausage (YUM!) BBQ Chicken Legs & Thighs Rib Tips (pork) Burnt Ends (beef) - YUM!  Included sides are Honey Butter Biscuits, Cowboy Beans (pinto), Mixed Vegetables & Coleslaw  It's the best BBQ I've had in awhile, great value and SUPER TASTY!  I left in a wonderful meat coma.  Will be back again February 21st!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the price was right but we musta overlooked the fact that on Friday nights they let anyone with big enough balls who is drunk enough, ride a bull to the amusement of hundreds of people. Talk about some great Friday night entertainment!"}
{"text":"Just went for a few beers and ended up at Da Shack in Da Back. Good service and nice to have the misters on such a hot Saturday afternoon! My only complaint was all the flies!!! If they hooked up a fan or two, I'm sure that would solve the problem. Considering going back to try the food cause the smoke smell was very inticing!"}
{"text":"I was there with my family for the grand opening. The Chip was always one of my favorite places for the atmosphere & the Pat James Band (I miss the traditional country music) We got there early (still daylight) to see everything before it got too busy.  For the most part I liked it... the food was mediocre at best.  2 of us had the BBQ \"buffet\". It was greater than 50% fat & mostly not edible, 2 had the burger & were pleased.  The dance floor was smaller than I hoped.  But where was the Buffalo??  We finally asked... they have it poorly displayed above the stage where it's blocked by the lights & not positioned properly for the correct view. I hope they rethink where that beautiful beast calls home.  It seems the Buffalo Chip bison should have a more centrally located home where everyone can see him from any place in the bar.   Still a great place & I'm sure will only get better with time."}
{"text":"We assisted with a Rehearsal Dinner at BC.  The Staff at Buffalo Chip were exceptional!  From helping with decorating to inviting guests to sample s'mores around a fire pit, the staff was so attentive!  The food was outstanding!  Thanks to all at Buffalo Chip that made the party so awesome! Highly recommend BC for your next large group function!"}
{"text":"It's been so long! Fire destroyed this place almost a year ago, two weeks from reopening 100%. The new restaurant looks incredible. But these guys never put their head in the sand, have been open ever since. Always a great place to come for barbecue. Coming out with a new menu when they reopen. Totally worth checking out. Great great food and at a fair price"}
{"text":"D from Iowa and this the best bar/saloon in Arizona that I have visited! Dustin, Matt, Nicole and manager Keleigh have been FANTASTIC! So attentive and FUN!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"HILARIOUS experience watching live bull riding (horrible riders who fall off in seconds but cool nonetheless), country dancing indoors, and dont want to forget the living, breathing horse roaming dead center of the outdoor bar. A night I won't forget just because I've never experienced anything like it.   I think my rating would be higher if I was into country to this extreme. It was really interesting watching people dance- twirling and dipping as they do haha"}
{"text":"My family had a disastrous experience at Harold's across the parking lot earlier in the day at lunch. Coming back from Bartlett Lake, we were all pretty famished and wanted some good barbecue. I would say the Buffalo Chip delivered admirably. Service was fast and efficient, and they also had a rock crawling contest through the local Jeep club happening out back. This provided some fun entertainment while we waited for our food.  I would categorize their baby back ribs as good but not great. Some pieces were very tender, others were a little tough. The beans were unremarkable. I washed it all down with a very large mug of PBR at a very attractive price of $3.  The band was just setting up as we were leaving. I would've loved to stay and listen to the haggard old fella that was tuning his pedal steel guitar, but we had to get home and put the little dudes to bed. I'll make sure to come back sometime on a Saturday night to make a total ass of myself on the dance floor.  The biggest negative: This place counts itself as a Packers bar. Gross."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst ribeye steak I have ever had. No seasoning and really over cooked when we requested medium well. The service wasn't the best either...it wasn't busy, but it took a long time to get our food...and our server forgot to put in our order for the kids so they ended up just eating our French fries. We decided we'd just forego the additional wait and go somewhere else to eat. At least the set up was neat and the kids had a great time playing outside!"}
{"text":"I went in this place mid afternoon and it was quiet but it sure was very clean and everyone was very friendly. I try to look for very unique places to check out. This place is for sure family friendly and all around shows how Arizonans are really all about. Family, friends, good food and some great southwestern entertainment. I will for sure be back :)"}
{"text":"I have only been here Fridays.  Many Fridays.  The fish Fry is great, but get there early if you want a seat during tourist season.  Real deal Bull riding, real deal Cowboys and girls. It gets crazy so service can be slow at times but heck its  a real deal cowboy place.  So throw those peanut shells on the floor all you want."}
{"text":"This was quite an experience really good food totally awesome set up and does feel like you're back in the old west and the wait staff is nice"}
{"text":"Happy to give a strong recommendation to this place - fun atmosphere, great service, excellent food... and really loved the made-at-the-table s'mores!  I recommend this for anyone who has out of town guests for a little bit of the 'old west' and good fun.  All you can eat BBQ on Saturday and Sunday during the day."}
{"text":"Fun saloon with a ton of character! Do miss out on the bbq buffet. I wasn't expecting it to taste so amazing. A great find!"}
{"text":"Sunday Football with the Cheese heads. Not a packers fan but I went with a buddy and was truly impressed with their all you can eat BBQ. Ribs, brisket, chicken, sausage, beans, slaw, and much more. Usually go there Friday nights for some beers and fun with friends that's about it. Might have to make this a Sunday fun day and get nice n full with the mouth watering BBQ. My mouth is watering right now writing this!! Lol. Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"Great fun outdoor bar. Bull rides on Wednesday nights that anyone can sign up for. Check it out."}
{"text":"Quite the cultural experience for city folk like me. My friend who lives in the area brought me here straight from the airport and thank god they serve food because I was starving. It's about $12 for a biscuit, greens, beans and a pound of meat. A POUND. Could probably have shared with a few people. I would recommend not sitting too close to the arena, the bulls kick up dirt. Cheap, strong drinks."}
{"text":"Friday night atmosphere is 2nd to none , food and drink sucks,  not the staffs fault .   the bar is incredible looking , get your act together"}
{"text":"We take all our visitors to Buffalo Chip for Muttin Bustin and Bull Riding."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place - I think. I was somewhat inebriated by the time we got here. I will try to remember the details... We mostly hung out on the back patio, which has it's own bar and restroom (outhouse). I mostly remember the arm wrestling machine and the drinks being really cheap... I could be wrong and just mixed this up with another bar... reading this review could be a waste of your time."}
{"text":"Fun Fun Fun if you like Rodeo!! I do!! I did not know I did but AH DOO :) Hee hee, very exciting..4 starts to the Cowboys and Bulls and 3 Stars for the food, 2 stars for the drinks. BBQ Real good, thang is they weigh the portions of meat, I am down with that, cept, I had a bit of fat on my plate so I wasnt too happy about paying for a a few chunks of fat , they werent small neither..and the drinks look like they came out of its a small world..better of with a standard beer, in a bottle, those portions dont change. I laughed and asked \"are these child size '?  tee hee hawwww"}
{"text":"Beer butt chicken was incredible, moist, well seasoned and overall knocked it out of the park. BUT... the pork bbq was horrible! Tasted like racoon (or what I would think racoon would taste like)."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Went here while in town visiting family and it was SO much fun. Make sure you go on a bull riding night and having burgers and beer! Great food, prices, and so much fun"}
{"text":"This saloon is complete fun. On a recent, hot summer weekend trip my dad actually suggested we head over here to watch the bull riding.   It is out on a main road in a nicely setup tourist/ restaurant row in Cave Creek.   We arrived around 7 pm and the parking was at capacity. We headed straight to the back outdoor area as we could hear we arrived right at show time. There's tons of seating, but it was standing room only. The scene completely exceeded my expectation. Lots of cowboy hats, boots, and smiling people.   The MC was funny, charming, and had a nice clear voice. He got the crowd excited.   The actual bull riders didn't stay on too long, but the whole show was a blast. It was just long enough to stand the heat and the dust, before the intermission came.  Time for a cold beer to refresh and to go inside to watch some phenomenal dancers, listen to a lively band, and bask in some a/c.  The decor inside enhanced the personality of this establishment. All the servers were super friendly. I felt like a regular. When I'm back in the area, I'll be kickin' some chips at the Buffalo Chip Saloon."}
{"text":"Really fun scene. Yea, the whole cowboy thing, but they all have so much fun you wanna go get yourself some hat & boots too!  Great live music, fun crowd. Lots of areas to hang out.  Even us city kids had a great night here!"}
{"text":"If your looking for an Old Country type bar, look no further.......   Packed on a Friday night, 8 of us went and had their All You Can Eat Fish Special....... Nicely done without a LOT of breading, and seconds and thirds came out quickly!!!  Then top it off with Smores you make yourself at your table.....   All the fixings with a can of flaming sterno delivered to you table!!   Then you can go dance, always a live C&W band, or go watch  Just be prepared to get a bit dusty."}
{"text":"Go on Wedesdays or Fridays!  Its quite a hike up to Cave Creek but its worth it :)  Real bull riding and its PACKED full of people. Everyone in Cave Creek and their grandma is at Buffalo Chips.  The place itself is huge with a dance floor, restaurant area, multiple bars, arm wrestling station (hilarious), outdoor eating areas, outdoor bars, rodeo area.... and its right around a bunch of other bars within walking distance (some are very 'biker' bar'ish' so beware but try Harold's Corral next door)    The rodeo is AWESOME and they apparently have amateur night which is somewhat shocking to me... but maybe they put you on a little pony or in a full suite of armor ;)      Great western crowd... more cowboy hat and boot wearing folk than I've ever seen in one place!    In my book you are a winner if you even attempt the arm wrestling machine.... that thing is freakishly strong and makes you feel like a wimp.   Live country music is fantastic and everyone is out there dancing and swinging around! SO MUCH FUN! Dancing really is the best part of 'nightlife' in my book and I totally loved the country western dancing at Buffalo Chips.    WARNING:  DO NOT PARK ON THE STREET EVEN IF EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING IT.  Those Cave Creek patrollers are nasty and I got a whopping $200+ parking ticket as did the other 12+ cars on the street.  You've been warned yelpers!   *This is why I have to give four stars... the cruel and unusual parking ticket left a sour taste in my mouth*"}
{"text":"So much fun. Actually going there this Friday for the bull ridiing (not to do it but to watch). Plenty of room outside and inside. It does get busy but worth the wait and plenty of other options withing this establishment to get food at another area.   Wednesday and Friday nights are the best for the bull riding. A must in my book."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was good but don't order a side of beans...not very good and weren't worth the money.  Wait staff was great and food came out quickly. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The barn is still being renovated, so everything's outside. But it was still a great time.  My friend and I arrived at 7:45pm on a Friday night, and parking was a mess. The actual parking lot is a dirt pit of sorts that was entirely filled, so it's best to just go down the road and park on the street.  They check your ID right at the entrance and give you a wristband for drinks.   It was my first rodeo show, so I was quite excited. I wore the wrong things however. Everyone had on their flannel shirts and jeans and belts with shiny buckles and cowboy boots and hats. Literally, everyone.   It's best to sit in the front seats of the ring to get the best pictures of the riders and bulls. And even if you don't purchase food or drinks, you can totally just watch the show for free. There were three rounds, but we only stayed for the first two. The first one was great bc after the cowboys ride the bulls, about 17 kids come out and ride sheep. It's so adorable.   My only complaint is that when you order and put your name in, you name is called on the speaker once your food is ready and it can be distracting during the show.   I also don't recommend getting the s'mores bc the graham crackers were soggy/stale and for $6 it's a rip-off.   The live band in between bull riding rounds is awesome. You can dance in front. There are a couple booths selling cowboy hats and boots and such.   I would totally go again and bring friends and children and whoever."}
{"text":"When asked if you wanna ride a bull... You say \"HELL YEAH !\" . My life changed after I mounted up on that beast of an animal . Granted I was only on there for 1 sec . I coulda died BRUH .. I missed out one the hot chili due to the adrenaline that was pumping through my body. Yee-haw"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and tons of night time fun with bull riding, BBQ and even Friday nite fish fry!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Prices are reasonable. They have really good chicken strips. Service is friendly. They teach line dancing on Sunday nights. This place is a like a home town bar with a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Great appetizer tacos for $2  Great fish tacos for $4 Ambiance is okay, but prefer Harolds next door. The seating area here is really tight and hard to access because the table behind is so close - and they are really long, so not easy to get in and out.  Lame rule (that the \"just doing my job\" type enforce) about not allowing cups to leave... even if it's water... even if you're a 3 year old kid! Ridiculous. It was 7:30 pm, and clearly none of us (who were leaving together at that time) had been drinking alcohol.  I prefer Harolds... by a long shot! The only reason we didn't go there, was because of a wedding going on, so they were closed for regular business. We are never disappointed over there. (And, we've left with to go cups of water AND tea over there before! )"}
{"text":"I'm bumping this up even another notch. Came here tonight (wednesday) and they had LIVE bull riding. Not a mechanical bull, a REAL, LIVE BULL. Crazy. For $40, anyone can do it.  Definitely a place to take out of towners. Did I mention they have a 1 lb of food for $10 deal too? Includes your choice of a pound including biscuits, corn, beans, chicken, pork, brisket, etc"}
{"text":"We came on a busy night, with all the cowboys and cowgirls dancing inside, and yet we were seated very quickly outside, with misters to keep us cool on the hot night.    The waitress was very attentive and never forgot about us.  She recommended the BBQ sampler and fried chicken.  Both were outrageously tasty.  We had a great time and will be back."}
{"text":"Cowboy haven tucked away in old town Cave Creek. Fits right into the theme of that entire stretch on Cave Creek Road. Definitely a good place to take out of towners, or to visit for a worthy filling meal.   Bbq is right on par with what you might expect from a joint in Texas.  Great ambiance both inside and out.  Woodshavings on the floor and cowboy boots suspended from the ceiling are a great  backdrop for a group photo."}
{"text":"Fun place!! Never fails. But beware of the police! We left an hour before closing and there were 4 cops parked right outside waiting for people. The bar was packed too, so I imagine that many will get arrested. Beware!"}
{"text":"It's a Packer bar so how could it be bad. Well, cheese whiz on the nachos, cheese curds that even the worst place in WI wouldn't sell. And honestly could even fathom attempting another appetizer.   Atmosphere is ok. Just eat across the street first."}
{"text":"Decent food, good service, getting a bit old and run down. Could use a bit of a makeover."}
{"text":"Great place to take out-of-towners for the bull riding! I seriously miss the old Buffalo Chip building with it's dark wooden walls and back bar. The new building is beautiful and they are paying for it with increased food and drink prices! But if you are looking for a cool place to take the kids or your mother in law, this is it. On Wednesday's they have the qualifying for the rodeo. Friday night is the big show. The purse (winnings) must be some serious money because bull riders come from all over and up from Mexico. They have built more grandstand seating so you can sit all the way around the ring.  Satellite bars are conveniently placed so you can get another beverage without having to go inside every time.  It's one of the coolest places to people watch as well. You have your Creekers - the artists, Cowboys, and Indians (and their dogs), you have the folks from Scottsdale, Desert Mountain and those who make the trek up from Phoenix, all smooshed together and having a great time.  Food is ok. Smoked meat, grilled sausages, burgers. All a lot more expensive than it used to be. But a friendly staff."}
{"text":"My aunt and uncle love this place because the beers are huge and their dog's invited. What more could you want? One time they were there and two folks had ridden their horses right into the bar. This is their kind of place!  We sat outside on a perfect afternoon and heard stories of other Buffalo Chip visits. Nothing too crazy and never any bullriding witnessed. They said they'd never seen a fight either but this is the kind of place that just screams Roadhouse fight.   Their dog made a best friend there once but he's long gone. I could make best friends here with a tall beer and a pail of peanuts."}
{"text":"A very fun place for adults or family! The reason I had it 3 stars was for the food. The food is just ok but the ambiance is down right fun which makes up for the food! What place can you goto and watch real bull riding every Wed and Fri night free!!!  Live music most nights and line facing Thursday night. Go for the fun, FYI I had the ribs, wings and they were only average!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time although the place is a great venue the meat was kinda dry and over cooked. That being said, I would totally come back to give it a second go"}
{"text":"We had a absolute awesome time here. We came to enjoy Cave Creek Bike week and ended up back here each day multiple times. One of our many bartenders Brittany was fantastic. We are looking forward to our next visit thanks again Buffalo Chip!"}
{"text":"The Buffalo Chip is a great place to drink, watch bull riding & live music, & just have fun. Food is pretty average so dont expect a whole lot when it comes to the food.   So get your drink on and saddle up partner cause only the brave will give bull riding a shot...yeehaw!!"}
{"text":"Could not ask for a better old western bbq/saloon environment :-) Tons of old west memorabilia, great food, courteous staff and great views! Be sure to watch the bull riding out back and most importantly be sure to watch a Green Bay Packer football game here!! Old history of the bar was once owned by ex Green Bay Packer great Max McGee! All around A+"}
{"text":"This barn/country saloon looks fantastic and the help loves to help... my only complaint is the price of the drinks... my 22 oz import draft was 7 bucks, and my gf's drink was 11 dollars.. and it was 10% off Monday's...  otherwise the experience was great and they play good country music..."}
{"text":"The original Cave Creek cowboy bar.  How can anyone argue with live bull riding?  Do yourself a favor though, eat before you go.  The food isn't bad, but I just kind of think its for the tourists.  The Pat James Band plays most nights and is incredibly good to have remained a house band all these years.  Go after 9pm, order something on the rocks and have fun."}
{"text":"We will return.  Here on a Wednesday night awaiting the bull rides. Numerous beers on tap.  We walked up to the bar to get our own drinks and we went out to the seats to watch the amateur bull riders.  There were little fires throughout the area to warm you on a cool night.  You can make reservations to sit in their \"skybox\" for a $10 fee per person to watch the bull riding.  Or just sit in the stands for free."}
