{"text":"Great bar with attentive service. Cozy atmosphere, great drinks, just a cool place to hangout."}
{"text":"I have been there with a friend recently and I was positively surprised with this place. The area is really a mix of everything so I was not expecting much. I pass in front of it almost every day because I work in the old Montréal but I never really noticed it.  The staff who welcomed me was nice and friendly and the decoration is also very nice. There was a decent selection of beer and wine special for the happy hour and also 3 different drinks for 6$, so we tried all of them: negroni, Tom Collins and mojito. Surprisingly drinks were not cheap, it was strong. We also had a nachos to share which was good and a bit different with the sausages and BBQ sauce. I usually don't expect much from this kind of food, usually industrial sauce and average toppings but again a nice discovery. The staff was super friendly the whole evening.  So I left with 30$ bill, tip included, tipsy, full belly and happy ! It's a really good option to avoid average and expensive drinks from the old Montréal bars."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time to get a drink before a dinner reservation. The place was packed at 6pm on a Friday but we managed to get a seat. The staff was very helpful and attentive and quickly gave us the happy hour rundown: $6 for all pints, wine, and a selection of cocktails. Tried the French75 and the caipirinha and they were both delicious and quite strong. This may become a go-to before going to shows in the neighbourhood. The only reason I can't award 5 stars is that it was a bit loud: we had to shout more than I would want to to keep a conversation going over the table, but the ambiance made up for it."}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for a quick drink or entire night of getting crazy. The decor is very modern, steel pipes on the celling, photos about the history my of Montreal on the wall, mirrors that make the place look even more spacious. Lots of table to sit down and even some couches spread out in the bar. The location is right in between a new development project of the St-Laurent street and the old shady vibes. But not to worry, the bouncer will watch over you when you're having a smoke and chase unwanted attention from you.  Full bar, the choices aren't limited, if you know what you want, the bartender will make it happen. We we're celebrating a birthday and the bartender on duty was very generous with the amount of alcohol in the drinks. The ambiance is great, they we're rocking Grooveshark and took demands all night. The best surprise was the pool table in the back, available for only 50cent a game.  Overall, one of the best new bar I have been in a while. Will definitely be back for more fun and drinks!"}
{"text":"This USED TO BE my favorite bar because of the friendly service, great music, good bar menu, drink portions and reasonable prices. Unfortunately the bar no longer stands out among the rest. It is now just another pricey cocktail bar with an average selection and meagre portions. What's more, when I aired the specifics of my disappointment to the manager, he snapped at me saying that he had personally made those changes, which he's proud of, and that I didn't have anything constructive to say(??). Needless to say, he kept arguing and defending himself, to which I replied, if he's not interested in listening to constructive feedback from his clients then I have nothing more to say, then I walked off."}
{"text":"This bar became my go to place during my Montreal adventuring. Located on the corner of the old \"RED-LIGHT\"  district it looks a little hidden from the venues around it. Despite the large wooden patio area in from of it. It may have been the best cocktail bar i went to in the city. The decor was def industrial with half cut barrels for lights and bartenders Wearing blacksmith aprons. There is a slightly large pool table (free to use) in the back and plenty of room to bring a larger party. They need to upgrade the pool balls and cue but you get what you pay for. Definitely check out this bar when you are in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite bar un town, beautiful decor, great host and, Sharp classic cocktail list."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite bar in the city last summer. I went back last month and I was SO sad to see what it turned out. It is now populated by a bunch of 20 year old who listen to Drake all night. If you're looking for a low key cocktail bar with a cool atmosphere, look elsewhere :("}
{"text":"First time to Montreal and we found a great spot in Midway! Great setup inside, and great service. Spent two nights hanging out in this place. Food was delicious. Our group had the wings, nachos and Mac and cheese, all were great portions and very good. Also, we got a sampling of the the chefs beef jerky, hopefully an added menu item soon. Great bar selection and great place to relax. Thanks for the hospitality and love the black M hats! Thanks , we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice bar, good ambiance. Bartenders were friendly despite my poor French. Old Fashioned was mixed pretty well; Manhattan could use a little work (use less vermouth next time). All in all, a good place to spend a couple hours."}
{"text":"Ended up at Midway because the original place I intended to go to was too busy. We got a table right away around 10pm and had good service. The drinks were well priced and their burger was tasty as well.  Be aware that around 11pm the volume of the music in this place goes way up and the back area of the bar becomes somewhat of a club, so if you're there with friends to chat and hangout it gets bit difficult to hear yourself speak. All in all, we stayed until 1:45am when it just became to loud for us but we were happy to have come across this place. I would go again for sure."}
{"text":"Not bad for a drink but 15$ for a hot dog with a side of coleslaw is a joke. No fries, just a hot dog wrap in bacon in a bun. Sad. But the cocktails were great."}
{"text":"I saw so many good reviews about Midway that I was very excited to give it a try but I am sad to say it fell very short of expections:( I am hoping that maybe I happened to go on a bad night because my experience was nothing like all the good reviews I saw. For starters we were seated for a very long time before even being acknowledged by any staff or server to come bring us menus or greet us. We had to find someone and flag them down for menus at the bar. Again it took a very long time for anyone to come take our drink and food orders. Our server seemed very uninterested and not attentive and never even cracked a smile. The menu items are not fancy but very suitable options as a quick bite to have with a a few drinks and they seemed to have some interesting options like duck confit poutine , pulled pork sliders , hamburger etc unfortunately at 8pm on a Friday night they had already run out of most of the food items. So we were left to choose between nachos and Mac and cheese. Some of us ordered the sausage nachos and were underwhelmed. while the chips were good and tasted home made there was almost no toppings ... barely any cheese , no more olives and small portion of salsa compared to the heap of sour creme. Also the sausage had a weird taste. I and a few others had the Mac and cheese which was the better option but still not great. There was cheese on top but there was barely any cheese inside and the noodles were very dry and lacked a lot of flavour. The portions were pretty big but the food itself was underwhelming. We also ordered some beer and cider - decent selection of beer at reasonable price and did have some cocktail options on the menu as well. The decor inside was very nice and clean and the staff behind the bar were more friendly and helpful than our server.  This place can accommodate groups and nice dim lighting for a date as well. I really wanted to like this place and I feel it has a lot of potential but my first experience was very disappointing:("}
{"text":"Amazing beer and cocktail selection. I highly recommend trying as many as you can handle. Nachos as an appy will definitely help tide you over so you can have a few more drinks. The atmosphere and ambiance of this place is off the charts. The bar staff are extremely friendly and very attentive. You next trip to Montreal should definitely include a stop at the Midway."}
{"text":"Great service, strong well done drinks and a fun atmosphere. This is a perfect spot to meet up with a big group of friends. There is a terrace outside and a pool table inside, excellent choice for Friday night's drinks."}
{"text":"Dive Alert!  We did not have the experience that John Q had (thank goodness) but we did enjoy a quick stop for 2 pints.  Mugs are cheap, $3 each for Molson Export."}
{"text":"I like the place, tiny entracy but full space inside, lumieres tamisées, table de billard au fond, beer if necessary ;)"}
{"text":"I wandered here while visiting Montreal for Jazz Fest 2017 by using Yelp to look for Dive Bars.   The first Dive Bar I visited sucked.   This was the second dive bar listed and boy am I glad I came here.   I stopped by next door for some poutine at the Montreal Pool room.  (In my opinion it was the best Poutine in all of Montreal after staying a week and going to every poutine place I could find.)   I wandered here for a beer.  The server was kind enough to let me sit outside on their fairly large patio as long as I ordered a beer for myself and my friend.   Since I didn't know what the local beers were I asked the server for a recommendation and they came back with something amazing!   And it wasn't that expensive either!   I love this bar and you'll find they have some wonderful beers for not too expensive a price.   I'll be back!"}
