{"text":"Definitely one of Kensington's hidden gems, Maison Close is a quasi-pub in an old Victorian home with a Quebecois inspired menu. They regularly advertise a pancake brunch that I haven't taken part in but look forward to when the weather warms. My experience so far has been a pint and a quick bite after work a few times over the past month. The beer list is short but well curated. Same for cocktails. Food changes daily and is brought in from the neighbourhood. French Onion soup is solid, as was the charcuterie plate. I had a bagel/lox sandwich and it was awesome. Overall a great chill place to spend an afternoon or evening. Bartenders are casual and friendly. Also looks like they have two stellar patios come Summer time."}
{"text":"Go in for a respite from the bitter cold, take off your denim jacket, sidle up to the small bar in the back of this Victorian house and order up a local dry cider or a Bicyclette. A couple toonies will be all you'll need. If you're gut-foundered, the ecletic mix of North American food staples served with French panache should suit nicely. The pork belly was lit.   The couple behind Maison Close put thoughtful love (and their very lives) into the hyper-locally sourced food. All of the fermented beverages on tap and even a few of their distillations come from the city. They haven't been in Kensington Market long but are already heavy hitters on the scene.  There's an amply-sized outdoor patio to shoot your darts should you require. Just don't come on hockey night, though, as there isn't much in the way of boob tubes. The musical ambience is superb, with American heroes such as Townes Van Zandt and Bob Dylan on frequent rotation. Didn't hear many local Canadian artists, though, such as Avril Lavigne and Nickelback.   All in all, I can't think of a place I'd rather be in Hogtown on a Saturday night. Not bad, eh buddy?"}
{"text":"Kind of stumbled upon this place on accident just trying to duck out of the rain. Located in an old house near the Kensington Market area, this place has some great eclectic charm to it. We sat at the bar only thinking we would have a few drinks while reading over their menu (it changes daily). Well we ended up spending hours making friends with the staff and Owner as we proceeded to drink and eat the afternoon. The food was great and all over the place. For instance we started with some French Onion soup... then later Pot stickers. Yet, sitting near the kitchen we saw all sorts of food being cooked up that wasn't even on the menu that night. We were there for so long enjoying ourselves that the owner had to run out twice to pick up more booze for the bar.  If you like old worn in places, great food and drinks, and fun artistic/sarcastic/talented/smart ass/funny type people, this is your spot. I would pop in to visit my new friends at least once a week if I lived in town."}
{"text":"All I have to say is this place is great.  5 stars.  Fantastic service.  I admit I've only eaten the nachos but MAN they were made with love and GENEROUS heaps of high quality toppings.  Beef tasted like it was brisket.... I mean it all tasted quality.  Only thing missing was a little bite, as mine didn't come with jalapenos.  Still it was so good it get's a 4.75, even without jalapenos and enough bite.    The space and the setting bumps that up another 0.25 to 5 even.  We dined in a little trailer that they have parked in the back patio area.  I don't know if we can curse in these reviews, but I'll abstain.  I'll just say it was super, super cool.    Fantastic setting, fantastic  service, fantastic nachos.... I only had one beer so can't speak too knowledgeably on their alcohol offerings but as funky as the place is, I'm sure they know how to get a group pleasurably tipsy.  Go, but leave room for me, ok?"}
{"text":"I have to say I was really impressed with their service! They use texting so I was able to make a reservation promptly. I was concerned because I had a vegan in my party with the intention of having a dinner meal there.   We were seated promptly in a cosy booth since we had texted ahead of time for a Saturday night. The lighting was a bit dim and romantic, plenty of couples here and one larger birthday celebration.   I was greeted by name and promptly asked who the vegan was :) since they change their menu often (daily?) it is hard to predict what options there would be for a vegan but I was assured there would be vegan options.  They had veggie dumplings, mushroom tacos with soy cheese, guacamole, and avocado salad as vegan options. The guy tried really hard to accommodate us so I was above and beyond impressed with the service.   I myself had a chicken schnitzel and polenta fries which was heaven served with some chipotle mayo. We all had glasses of house wine which I actually liked the dry red but the dry white was too much.   I would come here again with maybe just bae and without the vegan but I'm really glad how they were so open to changes on their menu :)"}
{"text":"Great food (couple of veggie dishes), short beer list and no dessert menu but decor/atmosphere, music and food make this a solid date spot or low key night out"}
{"text":"Fun little place in Kensington across from the Last Temptation. Wandered in here for a pre dinner drinks in a snowstorm yesterday.   Very eclectic decor, reminded me of some of the joints I've been to in Brooklyn but didn't try too hard s in the case with many Toronto/ Hip of hip places.   The special was apple cider with bourbon and it hit the spot. My partner's cider was also decent and prices were reasonable.   The menu looks interesting. Quebec inspired bar fare. Would like to come back for a Nosh."}
{"text":"Beautiful place!  Very relaxing and calm atmosphere. We ordered the non-alcoholic Apple cider & shared the buffalo cauliflower bites. The server was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and didn't mind when we asked to change seats. The place is impeccably clean and the owner definitely understands that the little details matter!  Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Food- fantastic! Drinks- ridiculously good! Salad-  It's just the cutest place with so much character. Every corner had some flicker of life. Very, very lovely. Just the kind of place for drinks and conversation."}
{"text":"Hidden in a house of history in Kensington Market, this bar is interesting and cozy. It's really just like visiting a friends house.   We came in on a warm fall night and the patio in the back yard was open. There was even a camper with candles and seating in the back yard!   We chose to sit down in the living room area and the owner told me the rocking chair I sat in was his grandmothers. It's pretty comfortable. We ordered a Moscow Mule and 2 tapas - salmon crostini and pork croquette. I found a the drink with a bit of too sweet and spicy (because of the ginger beer) to my taste, but the food was pretty good. The pork croquette was especially quite unique and delicious. The salad on both dishes were a bit under seasoned - we were not able to finish it.   Overall, I think this bar's atmosphere and music is great, drink and food Okay, service a bit a slow on a not so busy night, but it is great to just grab a casual drink and snack if you are not in a rush. I can see myself come back if I'm after dinner and in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Here, i had the best nachos i've ever had in my life.   Pull pork nachos piled high with goodness in every chips layer and not just on top. This gigantic plate of nachos was a solid meal for my husband and I.  Drinks were tasty. Super cute location- in an old apartment.  The only downside is the whole place smells like fryer oil. we walked out of there with our clothes and hair smelling like oil :("}
{"text":"I like this place, but I'm not sure about the person behind it (I'll explain this at the end of the review). It is a very cozy restaurant with lots of details! The menu changes every week apparently, and everything is locally sourced - which is really thoughtful. Their straws are also paper.   It was just one guy running the show last night, who I suspect is the owner. It wasn't particularly slow, but you can see that it's just him serving and bartending. He is a bit sassy, but for good reason most times (ie, my friend thought it was okay to shake their glass to signal another drink).   He did make a comment to my two guy friends that was a bit insensitive right when they ordered: \"what's your boyfriend having?\" - not sure if it was sarcasm or he actually thought they were together? They didn't take offence but were questioning why that was an option.    On the other hand, they are definitely a more moderate noised place - so big parties beware! We had a large group of 9, and were told to keep it down when our conversations got too loud.   They have a front living room that can sit about 30 people and a bar area for about 10! The washrooms are clean, and the vanity makes you feel special.   Maybe they were already running low, but by 10pm though, they were running out of Jamison and Vodka.   However, one thing to note is that the owner of this place does not have a good reputation in the media - I'm not sure if he's made his amends or anything, but it is something to keep in mind. I found this out as I was going through their geolocation on Instagram. Someone had purposely made an account to post pictures of dog poop and tag the restaurant. I did some digging and found that he was previously the co-owner of Handlebar, and his business partner got the backlash of his personal debt in Jan 2017.   \"RBC obtained a court order that she repay over $70,000 that stemmed from the personal debts of her former business partner and not the bar they operated.\"  Moreover, the venue is great, I like that it's locally sourced as much as possible, and I had a good time, but I do feel a guilty about supporting a business that has some history. But then again, who doesn't have history?"}
{"text":"Tucked away little gem at the Dundas end of Kensington Market - can be hard to find as it's basically a house. Just remember to look for the more flashy \"last temptation\" bar sign directly across the street.  The space inside is not huge, so caution when trying to bring large groups here. Probably better suited for dates or happy hour. The entire restaurant feels like you've entered someone's house and for the most part isn't too loud with background music and fluctuations in customer flow. Tip: Wednesdays they have their $5 drinks + food menu!!! Do check it out because normally, while the menu is reasonably priced, drinks for example are $10. The food portions are quite small, very tapas style, so don't come too hungry or be prepared to order at least 2-3 dishes per person.   They have a number of vegetarian options here and one of the owners will make veggie tacos off-menu if you ask. I had the crab cakes, veggie tacos with red wine last night. The crab cakes came on a bed of white plants (I don't know what it was... Perhaps fennel?) and that had such a crunchy yet chewy texture.  Friendly, personable service here - family-owned and run. The wife cooks up the dishes while the husband bartends and does a splendid job at it. Food does take some time to make it to the table given the small # of staff here, so don't be in a rush when you come.  There is patio seating in the warm months, can see myself come back for a cold one this summer :)"}
{"text":"On our Kensington Market journey, Maison Close 1888 was first on our agenda.  Upon figuring out where to eat, we decided to check it out.  Though the outside may look residential, as you enter, this place is busy.  Reminiscing the old fixtures of what used to be a Victorian house  converted restaurant Maison is a cute find.  Cozy like sitting in grandma's house it's no wonder people are attracted to this chilled out ambiance.  Aside from the Grandma comment above, its also a perfect spot for a romantic date with all the lit up candles at every table.   Their service was spectacular and extremely accommodating and willing to change up the menu since we had a vegan in our group.  He truly went above and beyond which made a positive impacting experience....I think he came back twice to ensure the vegan was taken care of lol. Kudos to management. Seated in a cozy booth, their menu is limited but changes quite often, however smaller menu usually equates to focus on quality with a twist. As for food, we shared their Chicken schnitzel with polenta fries and honey chipotle mustard. Presentation was lovely and the Schnitzel was prepared perfectly to pair with the stack of polenta fries beside it.   Other half of our entourage had their vegan dumplings which looked appetizing as well.  I'd come back here in a heartbeat, but with a smaller group."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have cocktails and coffee. The menu is a bit pricey for Kensington. However, what I ordered was delicious. The portion was small so it's for nibbling. The place has an old feel to it. Nice for taking people from out of town. Service is a bit slow because they only have one person bartending and cooking. Best part is it's in the middle of the vintage clothing area where there's so much culture and life."}
{"text":"The backyard patio is completely adorable. It's like you are hanging out in your friend's backyard, complete with tiny camper van to hang out in. The kitchen cranks out little nibbles and the bar supplies wicked cocktails or a cold brew depending on your poison.   As we walked by the kitchen, all we could smell was the umami of cooked mushrooms so we had to get the mushroom poutine. It comes in a french onion soup bowl with tater tots as the base, plenty of mushrooms and melted curds on top. It was delicious and went perfectly with our beer/ciders.  I loved the relaxed atmosphere and summer mood of the space. I would recommend securing seating when you walk in since the space is first come first serve. Once you get a seat, just slide up to the bar to order. They will bring everything to you!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Bruce was very friendly and makes a mean drink. We stumbled upon this place looking for a Pre-dinner cocktail and really enjoyed ourselves. We sat near the bar and were drooling at all the food coming out. We didn't eat there but the food looked delicious. The place has cool vibes and awesome people working there."}
{"text":"We stopped in midday for a bite and a rest.  The cocktails and decor made me want to spend the afternoon.  The staff was friendly.  The repurposed mansion was really well done-- high art with Andy Warhol influences.  The kids had gourmet grilled cheese.  I had a warm homemade cider with a bourbon shot.  They have lots of plans for summer.  Check them when they have the grill and the patio going. #foodtourism #chifoodie"}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly owners. Hidden gem. Highly recommend. The menu literally changes daily! I had the almond & spinach pâté, French onion soup, salmon salad, & the pumpkin tofu red curry (my fav)  Came back for a second visit, OMG the buffalo cauliflower is a MUST. It was the BEST I've EVER had!!! Salmon cakes were also delicious.  Baked Brie was boring."}
{"text":"I've always loved the idea of the public house. This place is exactly that - totally committed to making you feel welcome and comfortable. They quickly learn your name and order. they go out of their way to be friendly. The decor is totally relaxed.  And they love what they do and they do it well - host and make merry! Last I was there they made me an incredible dessert totally off menu just because I was craving a sweet and just had such a great time dreaming up something they thought I would love. French toast with cream cheese filling and homage chocolate sauce. I died!  Always come back here. Such a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute place in Kensington Market! The back patio is super adorable, and you may have some extra friends--raccoons!   The food and drinks are tasty. The atmosphere is kinda romantic. There's a weird trailer in the back with a table in it if you wanted to be hidden away.   Staff here are friendly. This is such a cute spot I'm definitely coming back in the summer, though their interior looks cozy for cold weather too."}
{"text":"Fav spot in the city, amazing food, drinks, cozy, great staff and owners!"}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant inside an old victorian house in the kensington market neighbourhood! The decor is very eclectic and has a candlelight ambiance which reminds me places I visited in Berlin....You really feel like you're eating at someone's place!  The menu is quite simple and offers different types of meals (pirogues, soups, pastas).We had homemade pogos, the sour cream pirogues and the ribs & mash patatos. We were really surprised by the quality of the ingredients and how everything was very flavorful especialy at this price....all the plates are under 16$  Great service, great food and good ambiance! I defenitely recommand!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came to check out the backyard patio and we were very impressed. I can only comment on their sangria and it was dangerously good. We saw some of the food people ordered and I will definitely come back to try their food. We were told the menu changes pretty frequently. The space is pretty small inside (seats about 20) and patio can seat maybe 20 more. It wasn't too busy around 7pm on a Friday but most of the seats were reserved."}
{"text":"Romantic cozy bistro in the heart of Kesington market. Very charming Victorian home that has been turned into a restaurant. Every table is lit by candle light, the menu is hand written. Keep in mind, the menu changes often and it is not a huge selection of items but they are very well made. We ordered the chicken schnitzel with polenta fries and coleslaw. The dish was fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. Our meal was only $15 for a main."}
