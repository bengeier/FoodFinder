{"text":"I just moved really close to Ming's and had been meaning to try. Decided to grab some to-go this evening and was delighted with what we ate! I had the best moo shu pork I have ever had! She said her curry rice was delicious as well.  We even have leftovers.  Will make it a point to eat in next time."}
{"text":"We finally found a monday where we could get here and take advantage of they're 50% off rolls. As usual, good service, good atmosphere and good rolls. We ordered the Crazy Tuna, Sakura, Green Devil, Golden Bridge, Phoenix, Pink Lady and 2 Spicy Girl rolls. We brought a friend to share the enjoyment. We all left happy and satisfied. Still a solid 4.5 from us."}
{"text":"It had been several years since I had been here, but I was passing through Davidson and decided to give this place another try hoping since they are still open that they had improved. NO!!!! Bad idea!!   Ordered off the lunch menu for take out. Most items were about $8.- but after all it is Davidson. When I got home I couldn't believe the small portions and the food...as close to inedible as I've ever had.  How do you screw up wontons in wonton soup?? Worst I've ever had! They were all a doughy, gummy blob of nastiness as was the rest of my food."}
{"text":"Two rolls, one crab Rangoon, chicken teriyaki = $50!  Quality= $10!   We will not be returning.  :("}
{"text":"awesome place, great food, great prices, love the staff. 1.50 miller lights, some of the ebst sushi i have ever had! it is great!!"}
{"text":"Every visit to Ming's is great. Chinese and their sushi always top notch. The do a booming take out business. But it's nice to sit inside too.  The Phoenix Roll is the best thing in the menu. And try the Chef's special fried rice."}
{"text":"I came in and placed and order for pickup. The receptionist helped me and a gentleman named Mark came out and greeted me offered me to sit down and answered any questions about the menu I had.  Once I placed my order he invited me over to sit at the bar and I got to watch him hand roll sushi while I waited.  The food was good and the service was beyond that, I was in town for work and I will definitely recommend other people come here and hopefully I can enjoy it again soon."}
{"text":"First time at Ming's and last. Food was good, that's the only reason 2 stars was given. Server had terrible attitude from the start. Food was brought out in the span of 1 1/2 hours. Water was never refilled, received 4 of our 6 egg rolls and soup within 15 mins.  Thought things were going to be ok.  Then received 2 entrees, 30 mins later rec'd 2 more egg rolls and 2 more entrees.  Ten mins later 2 more entrees and no rice.  About ten mins later other 2 entrees and rice from earlier.  All surrounding tables were experiencing same thing.  As we were attempting to have our credit card ran, my husband went to the cashier to  speed things up.  (After waiting over ten mins.) Our waiter was challenging  a table of 3 college students, telling them they had to tip him 15%.  This table was beside us and trust me, they did not receive 15% service, nor did we."}
{"text":"We went to lunch at Ming's on 7/24/12.....4 total in our group.  We have been here as a group on a few occasions.  Today's service was at best BAD.  One in our group wanted a salad and to put Shrimp on top...told \"No, you order from box menu\".  That happened and our food was brought out.  The server kept his attitude (this is the same server we have had on several different occasions.).  He slammed food on the table, he did refill drinks though!  At the end, all the meals were placed on one bill...simple (Thanks boss!).  His service was at best BAD.  He was only tipped 10% for his service.  This guy had the guts to come back to the table, tell her that she only tipped 10% and to put more on the tip!  Wow.....words were exchanged and he walked off.  Never in my life have I seen that done.......STAY AWAY from this joint!"}
{"text":"Ordered the General Tsao chicken and it was cooked nice and crispy. Generous serving size and quick service.  Half off select sushi items on Mondays which is nice. Reasonable prices and friendly atmosphere.  Menu items are reasonable priced."}
{"text":"An enjoyable up scale Asian with quite reasonable prices and very nice food"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in over 2 years. Went in today for a quick lunch. 2:20 pm. Walked in alone. Immediately greeted and was asked \" can I help you\"?  I said sure, can I eat lunch?   Response was \" oh, just one\"?    Seated and drink ordered taken. I ordered the hot/sour soup. It came quickly, was decent. Not the best but maybe 3/5.  I then asked several questions about vegetable dishes only- if I could chose my vegs ( didn't want certain things) and sauce.  Was told the vegs were already together. After some more questions, I just decided to go with 2 spring rolls and be done.   They were very greasy and hardly any filling.  Then was told I CAN order specific vegs. . I honestly think there was a little language barrier when I was asking questions about the menu.  THEN, my purse slid from the booth onto floor under my table. I leaned over- under table to pick it up and there were ants all around on floor, around purse and my shoes.   So I got them cleared off, paid and departed.   Two stars- seated quickly, drink order taken quickly, soup was just ok. Everything else was a fail."}
{"text":"About every 3 months I get a hankering for Asian cuisine.  Ming's is by far the best in the area that I have had.  I have tried a few of their dishes but my staples are Crab Rangoon (they have the best sweet and sour sauce I have ever had) and Pad Thai Mei Fun.  It is consistently good every time I eat there."}
{"text":"If your looking for quality sushi this is your spot in Davidson.. My favorites are Crab Rangoon's, Orange Chicken and the egg rolls... Enjoy.."}
{"text":"good food but too pricey for chinese ... nice atmosphere, seats are too far away from tables in the booths, you know what I mean? service is great though but not to fast on the refills."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food and freshest sashimi in Lake Norman, I recommend the lo mein, orange chicken and any sushi."}
{"text":"Today some coworkers and I went to lunch at Ming's in Davidson.  The Asian themed restaurant was small and cozy.  Not too crowded, the server was attentive and took our orders pretty quickly.   There were only three of us at lunch, and our entress came out staggered - one at a time.  I was the last to get my food, which was a little awkward for the two guys at the table who felt they needed to wait on me to get my food before they could start eating.  About 7 minutes after the first person got their food, and 4 minutes after the second, my food came out and was nice and hot.  I ordered the Scallion Chicken which was mediocre but a generous serving and cost $7.75.  I probably won't come back to Ming's, unless we have a team lunch and coworkers strongly prefer this place."}
{"text":"If I had only eaten the Fantasy Shrimp, I would have given Ming's 5 stars. The Fantasy Shrimp is nothing short of amazing! The shrimp are breaded perfectly, not too much breading but enough for a crunch. The sauce is creamy and flavorful. And, as with most Chinese restaurants, the portion is huge.  Unfortunately, I went in wanting Sushi. My fianc√©e had had the Fantasy Shrimp before, so she did not even crack open the menu. I opened mine and went looking for the sushi menu. I suppose I have been spoiled by other sushi menus which include an endless list of Special and Popular Rolls. In comparison, Ming's did not have as many options.   I should mention that I never consider anything with spicy crab or tuna because the chef can use a lesser tasting cut of fish. Why? Because the average person would never notice a difference in taste because it is masked by the spice. Now, a small menu can often mean great quality because the chef does not need to master as many recipes. So, I was not deterred and decided on the roll named for the town: the Davidson Roll. It is fried, so it can't be that bad, right? Wrong. Was it inedible? No. But it was lacking in overall flavor and the chef used too much cream cheese. I will know next time to order the Fantasy Shrimp and save my sushi craving for other local restaurants.  Overall, Ming's is A-Ok. I would highly recommend the Fantasy Shrimp (I hear the Fantasy Chicken is also delicious) and would check out other Lake Norman places when you need a Sushi fix."}
{"text":"Better than average Chinese food, but lunch is a couple bucks more per meal than average Chinese places.  I'm a sucker for cheap Chinese, but this place isn't really that cheap.  I probably would have given this place a 4th star, but in an otherwise completely empty restaurant I was sat at a booth sharing a back with 3 or 4 12 year old girls that just would not stop talking.  The hostess had to know that a grown male would not be thrilled with this idea.  $7.95 for seafood lunch combo with a spring roll.  Not horrible, but not great.  A-OK!  I'll be back if in the area and looking specifically for Chinese food, but I don't know that I'd work into the sushi."}
{"text":"The good: \"Eddie\" good server. Lettuce tolls good. Everything else sucked. Thin slices of fish. Cold sushi rice. The mgr Mona told me that I should not have eaten the Angel roll and then complained . She wAs the worst. I. Just moved here to Davidson Landing and I will never go to this place again. Ha, Cornelius and Mooresville are only an exit away. Do go here and don't fall for the half price roll deal. I came with no coupon or groupon and spent $100 as a single. Can't beeline how rude they were - especially the anorexic hostess"}
{"text":"We live locally and usually take advantage of the 1/2 off sushi rolls on Mondays. Their sushi rolls are the best value in town. At 1/2 off it does not pay to cook at home. Went there recently on Sunday eve and was disappointed with a regular menu item (sesame chicken). It tasted like leftovers just smothered in sauce, chicken was dried out. Portion size was nothing to write home about. They filled the plate with orange slices and a carrot the size of my fist to make it pretty. If your food is good, you don't need to fill the plate with decorations to distract me. So, if you go, stick with special sushi rolls. They are fresh and a very generous portion."}
{"text":"Have come here for great Chinese dishes like beef and broccoli but here today for sushi, which was beautifully presented, fresh and tasty.  Would definitely have options next time!"}
{"text":"Very good. Had the Dragon and Phoenix combo. Great atmosphere, even better service. I don't eat sushi but my friend was raving about the M16 Roll. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I think this place is the perfect chinese take-out place.  But their dining room is nice as well which is a plus.  You forget that you're in a strip center.  I usually get the chicken w/ garlic sauce.  The vegetables don't smell weird like some of the other fast Chinese joints.  Haven't tried the sushi so can't comment, but they do serve it if you're interested."}
{"text":"Bad experience.  Was \"fussed at\" by waiter for ordering a \"cup\" of soup instead of his preferred \"small\" soup. Then only got the soup and not the lettuce wraps we ordered.  After waiting for the lettuce wraps to appear and seeing everyone else get their food, the waiter brought us our check, and he hadn't even written down the lettuce wraps in the first place.  If he hadn't been so upset and correcting me for how I ordered the soup, although he understood what I meant, then maybe we would have gotten our food. This used to be our go-to place for lunch but since it has changed hands, we have gotten horrible service. We left hungry but not for anything they had after this experience."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food, and live a walk away, but stopped coming here. I feel like there are better options a short drive away"}
{"text":"The food is great, honestly I have zero complaints about the grub!  The service..ok, it's been questionable since we first started eating there late last year. This is actually kinda funny, check it out, we just moved to the area after I got out of the Army and my girlfriend was looking for a job. She's never worked in the food industry before but was desperate at the time (she's worked at law firms) so I basically dared her to apply and BOOM! She got the job! She worked there like 3 weeks and when we went out of town for a holiday the owner was like \"ok, I'll call you when you return and let you know when to come in\" except he never called haha.. Mind you he was happy with her work and all. So she got a great job in Charlotte at a law firm so all is well, it's just weird and in bad taste to do that. Then we went a few weeks later and they tried to hire her back. The owners seem rude and the wait staff are to rushy.. And the hostess.. Complete B.. Like chill out, high school isn't that bad haha  But the food..  delish!"}
{"text":"I had steak last time I was here and it was better than most other American restaurants.  They aim to please too. All I had to do was mention it and they made it again for me!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"They lost a star because I went in to grab some lunch the following day around 2:45pm, and the server told me I can only order off the dinner menu. I asked her why the lunch menu could not be honored, since it was from 11am-3pm or something and she said \"yeah, but our clocks are fast\" ... really? Needless to say that annoyed me a wee bit."}
{"text":"Today was our 2nd visit. We went back because we were impressed with the food and service. We were again pleased with both. We had sushi and moo su. It is a small place, I am guessing family run. It is clean and the decor, while a little too dark for my taste, is okay.  We don't understand some of the past negative reviews. The staff was very pleasant and the food excellent."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese/sushi bar. Any and every sushi roll is delicious. They are quick and have fair pricing. It's always my first choice when I am going out to eat. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. Pretty good food, great service. Some new staff the last time I went. Our server (Jersey?) was really good. Personable and funny. My shrimp egg foo yung was yummy. Tea was good too.   I'll eat here again when I'm in the area and in the mood for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Two stars if I'm being honest, three if I'm being generous. I ordered the Hunan chicken; I like that you can choose your sauce and then protein. It was good but greasy. I also had a won ton soup - generic soup you can get at any Chinese place. I would go as far as to say it's got to be premixed with frozen premade wontons because there's no way it tastes exactly the same at every Chinese place. Boyfriend got the general tso's - said it was good at first then got really sweet. Skip the spring roll - it was doughy with barely any filling. I'd eat here again because my friend loves it and says she and her husband eat here all the time. Maybe sushi? Either way, I'll give them another chance. $27 plus tip."}
{"text":"So much better! Mark is amazing with sushi!  Love the atmosphere and delicious offerings!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. Food is reasonably good but I am very very disappointed in the management. The service was good but one of the first times I've seen makings of a good restaurant (food, service, location) go down because of poor management. Horrible isn't strong enough of a word--unipygic is. I have a teenage son with Down Syndrome. Asian food isn't his favorite but we look for ways to work around it.   Mings has Corn Dogs on the Children's menu. So we order it or more accurately, try to. Mings won't allow it since my son is too old. We inquire whether we can just pay a surcharge for them--not allowed we're told. We ask to speak with manager and are told we can bring our own food in for him but they can't deviate from the menu (a Chinese restaurant not deviating from the menu?)   We were a bit taken back and the waiter really felt for us but not accommodating a customer (and one willing to pay for the accomodation) is a show-stopper. Never coming back and given the other Asian restaurants are rated 4 stars in Davidson, I recommend you skip Ming's too."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's authentic. But we don't always want something exactly the way it is. So what I'm saying is this. I've been to Hong Kong about 5 times. So I know what Chinese food the way Chinese people make tastes like. And this is pretty much the same. More flavor, spice, oil, flour, and the meat is less cooked inside somehow. All in all, my wife had a few bites of the Seafood Lomein and especially the General Tso Chicken. The Spring Roll was a hit though. I don't recommend the pork fried dumplings. If you don't like to taste a lot of flour, it's not for you because it's pretty thick.  Service? Good. And it's real Chinese people working there. Not like some places where they recruit whoever they can with dark hair or college kids who will work for food. So it feels pretty authentic but if you expect people to wait on you constantly or check on you every other minute, it's not the place for you either. So know what you want. Now, I don't want to ruin their business. And to be honest, more people might disagree with me because there were plenty of people there on a Sunday evening. But just saying. Know it's not PF Chang's before heading over."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat! Good sushi and egg rolls. My daughter and I love to go here for a quick afternoon snack. Fast service !!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have had in the Lake Norman area - And, I go here on a regular basis with someone who is from China and HE thinks it is the best Chinese food in the Lake Norman area!  Truthfully, I have never had a bad meal from Ming's.  Some dishes are more successful than others (of course) but everything I've had has been good.  I am particularly fond of the Sa-Cha scallops.  Part of what makes the food at Ming's really tasty is that they use fresh vegetables and meat that seems to be of decent quality.  In entrees that are loaded with vegetables, this makes a huge difference.    The service at Ming's is also quite good.  Everyone in the restaurant tries really hard to make sure that you have a good dining experience, and all of the employees are very friendly.    All in all, this is a great option if you are looking for inexpensive Chinese food.  (And, they do have take out.)"}
{"text":"The specialty rolls are very good. If they didn't have the Monday specials (50% off specialty rolls), we probably wouldn't come here very often. I would agree with previous comments: Chinese/cooked food is ok/average, specialty rolls are excellent, the sushi chef is great, and most of the staff is pleasant.   There is one member of the staff who I cringe when we get him... he smells of smoke and does NOT understand personal space. He's touchy, gets too close, is obnoxious and is genuinely the reason my husband and I no longer go here weekly. He's friendly, but has absolutely zero ability to understand personal space and is frankly not professional.   He's always worked there as long as I can remember, so perhaps he's related to the owner? Though, he does not seem to be a manager of any sorts. For those wondering what I mean, he'll touch your shoulders, get really-really close to your face, reach between you and over you and in front of your face, top off your already full water (I think he's bored), interject for no reason amid discussion - just overall bizarre and frankly, annoying. To be fair, I'll update this review if the overall experience changes...  \"Mona\" is great and can make great sushi too - same for \"John.\" Overall, great place for lunch or on Mondays for 1/2 price specialty rolls. Just beware of the staff member who can make your dining experience go from typical to uncomfortable. And if you eat at the sushi bar, (or even if not), remember to leave a tip in the sushi chef's jar at the bar area.   They are not on OpenTable.com so I don't believe they take reservations - but they may if you call. (I only make reservations on OpenTable as a rule - much easier). They're quite small - so for some during busy hours this may be a turn off. And the bar area could seat about 8 people, but they use the bar area for other things like water pitchers, etc., so I've only seen 4-5 seats utilized at a time, thus limiting seating. Don't misinterpret that to mean the bar's messy or gross because it's not. In fact, it's where I prefer to sit... just could add a little extra capacity.   The atmosphere itself is fine: seems clean, simply decorated and easy to get around. Bathrooms are always clean as well, which I appreciate. I don't recall their food/health inspection score, but I'll update next time I see it.   As for our FAVORITE rolls, we love the following from their specialty rolls: Pink Lady Roll (has a yummy and different pink-colored soy? paper instead of seaweed, the California Dream (may have a slightly different name) roll (better than your average CA roll), and the M16 is great as well. I honestly don't think my husband or I have ever had a \"specialty roll\" (separate laminated menu) we didn't love here. Give them ALL a try! Note: you cannot call and get the specialty rolls for 1/2 price to go, it's for dine-in only.   In summary, GREAT rolls, convenient location (next to Harris Teeter), reasonably priced when you go on Monday's, but experience makes 80% of the difference and when compared to their neighbor across the street (Sabi) who has similar (and sometimes better pricing with outdoor dining), the experience is far more casual. I would not take someone here for a business lunch - especially with the incredibly uncomfortable waiter I mentioned - I'd take them to Sabi. Now, for just myself and my husband, we do enjoy going here and would come more often if we didn't have the overly friendly and awkward waiter. Overall, it's good, but could be very good with improved service.    Still, I DO recommend it for Monday-sushi. As a believer in equal-value applied to atmosphere, service and food - this place could be great. I don't need anything fancy for a restaurant to be great, but great requires consistently great service. They have some work to do here."}
{"text":"Sushi at the Lake has been our go-to sushi joint for awhile now. But when I saw a Groupon for a sushi place in Davidson I snagged it up to give it a whirl. After our experience at Ming's it will be hard to decide whether we return to Sushi at the Lake or Mings next time we get a craving for some sushi and sake.  Ming's is located right off exit 30 in a little stripmall area. There were some parking spaces available right in front on the street but we opted to park in the lot behind the building and walk around to the front. The ambiance is what you would expect from a modern-day sushi place, in that it was somewhat dark and slightly fancy. We were greeted and sat right away and the server soon joined us to take our drink orders. We ended up splitting a bottle of Ginjo sake ($12) that was plenty for just the two of us. It was a slightly sweeter sake so it wasn't so harsh going down and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  We ordered some edamame ($3.95) as an appetizer and it was your standard stuff. Perfectly cooked and plump and the beans were nice and firm. I would have preferred a bit more salt on the pod, but as always it made for a nice beginner before the sushi.  We ended up splitting three rolls, and as usual it was more than enough for the two of us (each of these rolls came with eight pieces.) The Amazing Roll ($10.95) was the first one we started with and consisted mainly of BBQ eel and was topped with spicy tuna. This roll definitely lived up to its name as the spiciness complimented the roll perfectly where it wasn't too hot to ruin it yet hot enough to stir up the senses a bit.   The M16 Roll ($11.95)  had smoked salmon mixed with fried shrimp and cream cheese, and this was our favorite roll of the night. I know some people don't agree or consider it blasphemy , but I love the combination of salmon and cream cheese in sushi. This was kind of like a mighty Phili roll where the flavor profile blew the usual Phili roll away.  The last roll we had was the California Dream Roll ($11.95) and it was our least favorite of the meal. It was stuffed with crab meat and cream cheese and topped with BBQ sauce and avocado. Oh, and it was also stuffed with tempura flakes. Lots and lots and LOTS of tempura flakes. This had to be one of the toughest rolls I ever ate in that there was just so much to chew. The flavor wasn't really there either...it was a rather bland roll that really didn't pop or do much of anything, other than make me chew for an excessive amount of time.  I'm not going to judge the place on the one roll we happened to not like, as everything else about the meal was great. The server was funny and personable, the place had a nice \"feel\" to it, and the other sushi rolls were simply tastetacular. It's one of those places where I'd actually be interested in trying the Chinese dishes and foregoing the sushi, because I'm sure they do a heck of a good job with the hot food. In the end, Ming's Bistro is a place we will definitely be returning to."}
