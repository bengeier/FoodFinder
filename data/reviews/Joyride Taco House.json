{"text":"Great nachos!  They're big.  Great grilled Mahi tacos and the house made vanilla pudding is the bomb! Atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon was relaxed and the service is at the top.  We'll definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!!  Had the guacamole \"Joyride\" style.   Soooooooo yummy.  Tried the carne asada tacos and the crispy fish tacos.  Absolutely delicious.  Great service, friendly staff.  Only had to wait about ten minutes for a table for lunch.  I plan on going back to try the other taco options on the menu........"}
{"text":"The horchata and Frangelico with the Mexican street corn, chips and salsa were amazing. We tried three tacos - crispy fish, beef and ahi tuna; and a shredded beef burrito - all were tasty! Jessica and Andrew provided out of this world service! Ended the evening with Mo's special and while a little \"liquified\", special it was! Thank you Joyride for the treat of an evening out!"}
{"text":"I hate paying for food that isn't good. Nice vibe but that's what you're paying for! Food is just ok."}
{"text":"Really good service and food is decent.  Not your typical Mexican tacos but they are really good."}
{"text":"I had the Ensalada Fila.  It was a delicious salad, and I know my salads!  The others in my party loved their food as well.  Delicious!  I live far away but will come again when I next visit.  It is a fun place with great food and friendly service.  It has a loud atmosphere so not the place for a quiet dinner, but fun and even kid friendly."}
{"text":"Best all around restaurant in town and it's in the walking radius of where I live? Sounds good, I'll be there twice a month at a minimum. The food here comes fast and hot and is always tasty and fresh. The standard is my standard. You should try it soon."}
{"text":"Went to Joyride again tonight. Had the chicken burrito. ***AMAZING** That is one fine burrito. My wife and I each ordered a margarita. OOPS!!! Delicious, YES, but small and $9.00 each. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!!! I will not order that again. WOW!~!! This is a 4.75 - 5.00 drink and it is really good but MASSIVE OVERPRICE. The service was excellent again. Definitely go to this place but, watch those drink prices. WHEW!!!!"}
{"text":"One word: NACHOS 
This place by far has been a favorite since relocating to Phoenix... I've always been impressed by the quality of this chains food (Postinos, Windsor, Federal Pizza & Churn) but this place was an absolute treat! When they brought out the salsa, I was highly impressed by the speedy service.. I ordered the nachos with carne asada and whew! I was blown away.. The abundance of avocado (I'm an avocado whore) and the tender/flavorful carne asada was out of this world. If you like spicy I highly recommend the habanero salsa (for an additional 1.99).. Yum! In honor of this review, I'm going to get some nachos now;)"}
{"text":"Service is great, no denying that but the food is so mediocre I cringed while eating my tacos, which is their supposed specialty. I will say though, their tortillas are fresh and taste great with a good texture as they don't get soggy and blow out the bottom. Anyway, I had the fish taco, pork adobaba, and carnitas. The fish to batter ratio was a little weak and the batter seemed to take up more space in the shell than the fish itself and the taste didn't meet my expectation of freshness. The adobaba and carnitas could've been the same taco as far as I was concerned. They were probably the same meat, which had the texture of pulled pork, but the adobaba had a sauce that resembled in look and taste as a failed attempt at tex mex BBQ sauce (although tex-mex is a failed attempt at cuisine, imho). I wasn't a fan as you might imagine. My friend ordered vegetable enchiladas and they were much better than I was expecting, decent red and green enchilada sauce, oaxacan cheese and a nice array of vegetables. Margaritas are good, $5 pitchers of beer before 5:00 everyday, free chips and salsa great service just lacking in the authenticity or even just a little flare in the food department. Probably won't go back. In fact, So cal tacos across the street is twice as good I'd say."}
{"text":"What a treat to eat here!  The food was good but the customer service was even better. Manager Eric and our Server Alex training Jessica, went way above and beyond to make sure our experience was spot on! Thank you for going above and beyond to get our needs met! You Rock! Guys, come here if you want a fun filled experience."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of Mexican food over the years, some good and some not so good. The Joyride ranks up there with some of the best. Having had the 3 taco combo I choose the \"Standard, Baja Fish & Pork.\" While the Standard and Baja were out of this world the pork was just ok, not my fav at this time. Will need to try it again. The deserts, while only 3 choices available, we choose 2 of the 3 and they were an \"oral orgasm.\" The service exceptional, the ambiance trey KOOL and the food the BEST! I'll be BACK!! ;~)}"}
{"text":"My wife had finally convinced me to come back here against my better judgement because service has always been sketchy at best. Today they excelled, we went 25 minutes without being approached by a server even though we had empty glasses on our table and had planned to order more drinks. Eventually I managed to attract the attention of a server and asked to see the manager but having watched the discussion she chose not to come over and simply sent another server
 over to let me know they were taking care of the check. It will be a long time before I visit again the attitude towards service presumably starts at the top and results in general indifference from all staff members"}
{"text":"I am giving this place a three because it is beautiful inside. However, I did not have the best experience as far as service goes. It took 20 minutes to get water. Plus, valet only.. really? The food was ok. The main thing that I didn't like is you couldn't tell which hipster was your server . Confusing because they dont have any kind of uniform.  They did give us a $10.00 coupon because we had bad service. So... eh."}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious! Margs are perfect! The Chips/Salsa are fresh, and YOU MUST TRY THE QUESO! 

Besides the food, the decor and atmosphere was fun and reminded me of being at a cool house party in the late 60's and the staff is fun and upbeat.

You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The street tacos are WAY overpriced and mediocre at best. Their cucumber mint Aqua Fresca is delicious but I felt like every single item on the menu was overpriced for the flavor and portion size of what you receive. Their cocktails are very good but again, their tacos are lacking. Their crispy fish taco tasted very bland and almost like fried cardboard. We might come back for a cocktail but definitely not for food."}
{"text":"Really great service here. Everyone is very attentive and super nice. We tried the 2 tacos and side salad happy hour deal. We tried the carne Asada, shrimp and one of the pork options. The shrimp was definitely the favorite. The chips and salsa aren't our favorite, but I think we will definitely give it another chance and try something else."}
{"text":"Food was really greasy and service was non existent. Maybe it was an off night, but overall not an enjoyable experience. There is a lot better Mexican food in this area. No need to go back here except for drinks."}
{"text":"Yummy food ! The enchiladas are the best that I have had . Margaritas are good but a little pricey. 
The patio is awesome, spacious and cool, funky decor.
Service is good, nothing to write home about.
Go for the enchilada and margaritas for sure!
Good chips and guacamole also
One of downtown Gilbert's best choices!"}
{"text":"Awesome chips and salsa, and a great experience at the bar! The bar itself is really unique and they get drinks quickly and are very personable! Great selection as well!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and customer service. If you haven't tried this place, then you must. I love the vintage atmosphere. They have beautiful seating outside too."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place today and was not disappointed! Sunday afternoon, nice weather and they were packed! Ordered a shrimp and a fish taco and they were very good, fresh ingredients and they were just the right size. Salsa is very good, but if you want more spice ask for the habanero version. My only complaint is that they don't have full sized pitchers of beer...small ones at about 2.5 pints each. However, that being said it was happy hour (we were there about 1pm) and they were only $5 so all is forgiven. I like that you can sit outside and the back outside patio has a large grass area so if you bring your kids they can lounge around and not bother anyone as it is not right next to any tables. Will for sure go again!!"}
{"text":"update: regional manager contact me and apologies for the incident, this make me believe they really care for their customers and their standards are high, I definitely will give another shoot to this place.
the quality of the food is fresh and taste is good."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything I've tried has been really good and decently priced. I love the atmosphere as well. Although I prefer the outdoor dining area more because the music is really loud indoors and difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I have now been here twice.  Both times with groups 6-10 in size.  I love the restaurant group for their fantastic decor and mood, but the service is TERRIBLE!  Both times now it has taken 20+ minutes to get a drink.  Our waitress tonight never asked if we wanted appetizers (which we did because they are fantastic).  Drinks were never refilled.  I had to flag her down to order a second drink.  I wish I ever got her name so she could know how horrible she was.  

The tacos are very good.  I had a sandwhich tonight and regretted it.  I would go back to tacos next time.  They are overpriced for what you get, but they have great flavor.  

The appetizers are all fantastic.  I don't know if I would even order of the real menu anymore.  I want this place to be so much better, but it just isn't."}
{"text":"So much funnnn delicious food and drinks! Go for taco Tuesday $2 tacos are amazing!!! Service is awesome food and drinks are awesome! Hope we can come back!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful trendy place!  Food is sooooo fresh and so good tasting!  Highly recommend for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and tasty options. Good service and full bar. Nice addition to gilbert."}
{"text":"As far tacos go I haven't had anything better and I lived in scottsdale for a few years and tried everything.  Only taking a star away because we've had a few occasions where they got our order mixed up"}
{"text":"I came in last Taco Tuesday for the first time in awhile. We were seated in a very timely fashion by the hostess considering it was very busy. I asked for her name and she said \"I go by Fergie here at work.\" She took us outside and made sure everything was right! We let her know our table was wobbly and asked if there was anything she could do about it. She immediately fixed it for us and recommended the Sloe Ride margarita when we asked her which one was the best! We had a fantastic evening and it all started out with the extraordinary service we received when we first walked through the doors. Great job Joyride!! We will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"very good food and atmo , service is on the Mark, upward projects does a great job , ask for Gabrielle ;*)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Food is excellent quality and great prices.  I had a taco plate and meat was tender and flavorful.  Margaritas were perfectly balanced and refreshing.  Will be back."}
{"text":"HAPPY TACO TUESDAY TO ME!!! 
I've been in search for a good taco Tuesday for quite some time. I had tried a lot of taco places all over the valley-- and I always end up with one of those Mexican chain like filibertos/robertos for the authentic flavoring. Coming from Southern California where every corner there's Mexican food-- definitely there's no shortage for authentic  flavoring. Since I moved here, I had realized and learn that the most authentic comes from those Mexican chain restaurant. If it didn't come from there- I've learn to accept my faith if I eat elsewhere- it will be Tex mex flair.
Anyhow, I woke up this morning with a strong craving for tacos and a good margarita. Should I go pick up my tacos at my old faithful authentic place? or go to my usual wannabe flair like salty señorita or  blanco taco y tequila?... Hmmm, then I turn to Yelp, on a mission to find a new place and I stumble across this place (joyride). The reviews sounded great and its happen to have a great taco Tuesday menu. Without hesitation, I waited in agony till 2pm for the taco Tuesday deals to start. I arrive to the restaurant and was please by the atmosphere. I seated outside and today weather was a tad breezy but it was great. I already had in mind what I wanted to try on their menu and I have to say ... this is my new taco Tuesday place. I find the margarita are great in flavoring. They did not skimp on the tequila and it is $5. I ordered 3 different kind of tacos but there are like 7 different kind to choose from. Their taco was definitely decent size for $2.. it's not small like street taco size. I love all my tacos but I like the crispy fish taco the most. There are other taco choices in the main menu but not on taco Tuesday menu that sounded awesome. I can't wait to be back to give it a shot next time. It's definitely cheaper than blanco taco y tequila happy hour.. and better than salty señorita-- which their food hasn't been up to par lately. I attached pic but I don't think it did any justice. Go check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"joyride is by far the best place to get fresh Mexican food. My favorite tacos I have ever had"}
{"text":"guys... gotta post an accurate menu. first time ever calling this place, was expecting to order from the menu.. the person who answered the phone had never even heard of ANY the items on the menu. 


wtf. failure.


update: ordered for the first time, to go. got all of the way home 20 mins away and no dressing for the salad, no salsas as ordered. mngr was nice about making the food over and gave a $25 gift card. 

update 2: just called this afternoon to make a reservation for tonite at 8. here on Yelp it says, 
\"Takes Reservations:  Yes\" come to find out that i would have needed to make them yesterday. 
spoke with a mngr to no avail. 

I call restaurants in advance now, especially on the weekends, to make a reservation or see if they are on a wait. I have called 3-4 different times and they were on a wait anywhere from 30-60 mins each time so we opted out. 

Lame Lame Lame. I'm so glad that you're a trendy up and comer place to eat but if you have this sort of service and already seem to be doing just fine without us then so be it. 

Wish I could trade the $25 Gift Certificate in for Cash as it seems to be an empty gesture. 

We'll continue to support restaurants and places that deserve our business."}
{"text":"Crispy fish tacos and a pitcher of beer on a nice afternoon while sitting on Joyride's patio is complete luxury. Also unbelievably priced during happy hour; best $10 I could spend."}
{"text":"Great food! I ordered a variety of tacos - grilled fish, carne asada, and carnitas. All of them were very flavorful, but the carne asada was AMAZING. Their pico de gallo was mild in heat, but delicious."}
{"text":"Really cool place! Very hip and young vibe and environment. The decor was eccentric but modern. The menu was creative Mexican food with a modern twist. The nachos were really good, they used a really good white cheese. The tacos are also pretty good, the shrimp especially are tasty. Friendly helpful staff. The have creative alcoholic drinks and you can add alcohol to their agua frescas.We will for sure  go back."}
{"text":"Love my Joyride!! I am a regular Taco Tuesday patron. Love the atmosphere awesome food and a great skinny margarita! Would have given 5 stars but on occasion the service is not consistent -sometimes a little off/slow but hey they are always busy so I understand!"}
{"text":"Cold tacos, watered down drinks.  Not a single Mexican person in this place.  Service was decent."}
{"text":"Charging for salsa refills is ridicules. They give you a very small amount with chips and don't tell you to use it sparingly because no more salsa for you a unless you pay extra. It's Mexican food for crying out loud and you need salsa. Rip off and I will not go back."}
{"text":"this is not your average restaurant!!!! great playlist and atmosphere. the service was super fast we went on a Saturday night and got seated right away even though it was packed. the chips and salsa came out quickly as well and the waitress refilled our drinks without us asking. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"AMAZING! I have been here twice and in my humble opinion, this place is pretty close to having the best tacos in Phoenix. Their flavors are really defined in each of the taco selections. The size of the piece of Ahi Tuna in my taco was impressive, I'd say at least an inch in diameter. The specialty cocktails are innovative and refreshing. The decor is fun and hip and the place just has a good vibe. This is definitely a wonderful place for date night or lunch with the office crew. I will probably visit here monthly!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Joyride on Saturday for date night. It exceeded my expectations! From tasty unique cocktails to authentic and delicious street tacos and street corn, we we very pleased. Many restaurants in the Heritage District are busy on Saturday night at 7pm, but we found seats quickly at the bar and didn't mind. I am guessing a little earlier would have garnered us a table. I can't wait to take family there when they visit town next month."}
{"text":"The best taco house! We are regulars, visiting every Saturday for lunch for $5 pitchers of beer and $5 pineapple mojitos. Our waitresses/editors always have out drink order memorized. We love the carne tacos, chicken tinga tacos, Mexican street corn and the cheesy mas to start. Our daughter loves the Virgin prickly pear lemonade."}
{"text":"I was actually trying to go to postinos- my AZ friends won't stop talking about it. I accidentally walked into joyride instead, So glad i did!!! Everything I had was insanely good. I love the funk decor, great music, very friendly (and good looking) staff. Service was quick! There's outdoor and indoor seating- it's comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. The food was yum. Yum YUM!! I had 3 tacos- braised beef, Tinga, and pork. First off all it's awesome that they even have Tinga on their menu. But the fact that it was good?! I'm grateful for being so tired after work to make this restaurant mistake. Oh!!! They serve aguas frescas too- they're take on them anyway. I had a cucumber one and I wish I had that recipe. I only wish I lived locally so I can return over abc over again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Joyride. Both times I've been there, the service has been good, staff has been laid back yet attentive, and the food? Exactly what the doctor ordered! Excellent margs, a nice deviation from your basic margarita, but nothing too bizarre or fancy. Great tacos (check out $2 taco tuesday!), and truly inspired flavor and ingredient combinations. Definitely worth a return visit, and another, and another."}
{"text":"Great concept, fantastic food and warm, open, laid back feel.  If I lived close, this could very well become my regular watering hole...

Their spin on Mexican fare is pretty damned good.  Everything my friends and I had was awesome. I highly recommend the crispy fish tacos and the blood orange margarita!

The parking is a tad weird, but it should not be enough to deter you."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere! My new favorite Mexican place in town. Carne asada taco and crispy fish tacos are amazing. Upward projects, you once have done it again. Thank you"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burritos I have ever had! The place has a nice vibe and amazing service that keeps me coming back. Beautiful outside patio creating a cozy environment for everyone dining in. If you haven't visited this place yet, I would definitely recommend you trying it out!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place since it is so close to me. There always seems to be a pretty good crowd there. Went for dinner on 12/7/13. Service was good and the waitress was informative when we had questions because there are a few funky items on the menu. We asked if we could get the vegetable enchiladas without mushroom and the waitress said no because they are all pre made? Food was ok, everything is a la carte so it gets pretty pricey. Not sure I'll be back unless it's just for drinks, just not for me."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Joyride taco!  We went on a Friday for lunch after hearing about it on the radio.  The location is central and the restaurant decor is fun and casual - a great fit with all the hip new restaurants in the area.  Our food was delicious!  The elote corn appetizer was great and the churros dessert was amazing.  But the service was truly what sets this restaurant apart.  Our server was friendly and attentive, and at least 2 of the managers stopped by to check on how our meal was.  In fact, I guess our main course took longer than usual to come out (although I didn't really even notice) and the manager picked up our entire bill!  That's great customer service.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the chips and salsa but wish you didn't have to pay for refills of it. Service can be slow waiting to get drinks but food always comes out fast once you place your order. Great atmosphere to enjoy drinks and/or friends. Take out is always good on busy nights too."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Too many screaming kids,  guacamole was not made on premises, Baja fish taco made me deathly ill. Bad fish is supposed  to be thrown away, not hidden in a taco. Waiter thought he could memorize the order,  he was mistaken, should've  written it out. 
Needless to say, I won't  be back."}
{"text":"so yummy! we got tacos and chips with several different salsas to try and it was really good. it got very loud as the night went on but our server was nice and always checked on us."}
{"text":"Love the music, food, service, and food...the food is amazing.  I would also suggest only four frescas...5 was too many ;)."}
{"text":"The owners of Postino, Windsor, and Federal Pizza have done it again!  The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the ambiance and decor were adorable, colorful, whimsical, comfortable, and stylish with a hint of sophistication. 

Favorites menu items include the Street Corn, the Short Rib Taco, the Baja Fish Taco, Minerva's Mix Tape salad (so refreshing and bright), and the Banana Pudding (the crust in the bottom is SO TASTY).  I also had the Bandit, which was kind of like a tamale plate.  Didn't think this was particularly unusual, but I loved their marinated pork - so good. 

This Mexican/Latin based food restaurant even has delicious agua frescas (with or without alcohol) and its own version of a Moscow Mule called the Mazatlan Mule, made with tequila and passion fruit puree. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Great experience at this restaurant! I brought clients here for a work dinner on a busy Wednesday night. We were a party of 7 and had a short 10 minute wait, eventually getting a table on the patio facing Central Ave right in front of the fireplace! They cranked up the heaters, not knowing half the party was in town from Chicago and quickly turned them down at our request. The blood orange margarita was excellent, not too sweet but smooth. We had the cheese y màs (a chunky queso dip) which was awesome, along with ceviche (very good, light and not too acidic) and the guacamole (alright, but not in my top 5). The chicken enchiladas were very good with red and green sauce, spicier than I expected. The staff was attentive but not overbearing kept waters full and cocktails coming. I'd definitely pay this place another visit."}
{"text":"Normally, I LOVE Joyride, but I was so disappointed to see they've literally shrunk their kid meals. The bean and cheese burrito meal was made using taco tortillas. My 3 year old and 5 year old finished their meals before mine even came out (yes, all ordered at the same time) and were still hungry, so I asked to order two more burritos. They said they only sell the meal, so, $20 later ($5/meal x 2 kids x 2 meals), my kids were finally full. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"OK if there was a 3 1/2 stars that is what I would have given it.  Love the decor and rocking 80's music.  Service was very good.  Great deal on pitchers of beer.  Chips and house salsa are very good as well.  Now the OK stuff.  Tacos were pretty good.  I had the chicken tinga.  It was suppose to have \"magic white sauce\" but mine apparently didn't have it.  On a side note, maybe that is a good thing since Joyride Taco House seems like a name for a porno shop.  Chicken tinga was a little bland, likely better with the magic sauce.  Carne asada taco was good.  I personally thought it was a bit pricey for what you got.  Bottom line is that I  would return to drink beer and have chips and salsa especially since we found out the one patio is dog friendly.  I would say give it a try.  Never know you may get the magic white sauce.  ;)"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. My boyfriend and I ate here during a quick day trip to Phoenix and we will definitely be back. The staff was friendly and the tacos are so worth the trip. The establishment was very lively and welcoming. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Something is happening with service, took almost 30 minutes to be seated, was actually not busy and there where empty tables, got water but took 20 minutes to get drinks and took another 30 minutes to place order and 1hr15 minutes to get food and they weren't busy.  Actually tried this place because had lousy service from Postino's, just found out there owned by the same people.  Going to Texas Roadhouse, never a bad time, in 20 years.  And with 8 kids and 9 grand kids, this place will be gone soon and replaced with new owner and management and name.  Seen it happen."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's always busy, great drinks, food is well above average. I always enjoy myself. Service can be a little slow but everyone is pretty friendly. As it stands today I will be back but there's a lot of other options now downtown Gilbert so my visits are less frequent. That may change. Still getting a feel as to how much I like the newer restaurants. We'll see."}
{"text":"Fun place to lunch with girlfriends!  We came on the third day open and enjoyed studying the new menu, finding something delicious for everyone.  I love the ensalada fila -- although I struggle to remember the name of that salad -- it is first on the list.  It's a great kale salad.  Add a crispy fish taco and it is the perfect lunch!
They serve the tacos family style (I.e. all orders on one plate) and this threw us off a bit.  The ingredients of the tacos are fresh and delicious but we noticed the awesome  home-made tortillas.  Lots of attention to detail here,
Desserts are fabulous!  Save room for the brownie."}
{"text":"I've now eaten here twice and tried all of their tacos. Joyride has amazing food, amazing staff and the cutest decor! 

I like to sit outside on the patio- which often puts you at risk for being forgotten- but not here! The staff is bubbly, helpful and checks in often! 

Everything I have tried here has been gorgeous, the presentation and flavor of each dish makes it hard to choose- but my favorites right now are the standard chicken and baja fish tacos!

I also would like decorate my house like that place haha! 
I think I will try the agua fresca next time :)"}
{"text":"Great first impression. Sat at the bar with a friend. We came in just for margaritas (which were very well prepared) but then we decided to have a couple tacos. My friend had the fish taco and I went with the chicken taco.  Honestly, they were the best tacos I've ever eaten, by far.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I want to give a big shoutout to Grace!  She was all kinds of sweet and provided awesome service.  We're from out of town and it's nice to feel at home when you're not.  Kudos to you Grace and to Joyride for hiring wonderful people.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The check-in/seating system here is ridiculous. We stood by 3 vacant four top tables while they made two old ladies in front of us stand and wait for 15+ mins, then they finally gave up and sat them at the table that had been vacant the entire time. My mom has a hurt leg and she had to stand and wait even longer because it was too hot outside. Then she all of a sudden they realized they didn't put my name in the iPad, so another two tables was sat in front of us. If it weren't for the good wait staff and food we would have left a lot earlier. They just kept pushing to send people outside and to the bar and saving the tables for special clients apparently. I should mention this was on a Saturday at 1:30pm. The food and drinks were excellent and for that I give it another star."}
{"text":"Went to Joyride for dinner last night to give it a shot for the first time. They have a simple menu but pricey for Mexican food; they will nickel and dime you to death on sides that you would ordinarily get with your meal at other Mexican food restaurants, so make sure you ask before you get your bill. My $12 burrito was nothing to write home about and the \"refills\" for their aguas frescas (no alcohol) are not free (it would be nice to know ahead of time). What you are really paying for is the ambiance, the décor, loud music, their indoor outdoor concept and their cool hip staff which provide good service. I felt fleeced when we received our bill for almost $50 for 3 tacos a burrito, churros and our $10 agua fresca.  In my humble opinion, if you still care about the food and want great value for your hard earned money Nando's Café is still a hidden gem in Gilbert."}
{"text":"We waited about 15 minutes for a table for 4 outside, not too terrible. Ambiance of the place is excellent.

I LOVED the coconut margarita. I also tried the blood orange marg after seeing it mentioned in several reviews, but I thought it tasted a little soap-y. Thankfully, they were great about swapping it for another coconut one when I told them I wasn't a fan. My friends ordered the house margaritas + they were happy with theirs as well.

Tacos were hearty - no skipping on fillings - and we were happy with everything we ordered as far as flavor.

My one major complaint was the speed of service. We waited a LONG time in between any attention from our server. The manager (I think?) was much more attentive and ended up taking our order, among other things, when our server was missing."}
{"text":"Well, I'd read some great reviews so I was excited to try it.  The decor was great and the service was awesome too, but the prices and the food leave alot to be desired.  We boyfriend and I got there at 530pm.  The chips and salsa are complimentary, but the salsa was thick and tasted like they used alot of chili powder.  My boyfriends loves salsa and he couldn't even eat it.  I compare all my salsa to my favorite at Mi Patio, and I haven't found anything that compares to it, so I wasn't expecting anything better, but this salsa was really bad.
We both ordered a margarita.  The drinks came in a standard size bar glass. I also ordered just one taco...a shrimp taco.
The big surprise was the bill...$9/ea for the margaritas...and $4.25 for the taco.  I felt like I just threw $30 out the window.
Oh, and there's NO happy hour.  I was told the happy hour was from 11a to 5pm.  What??
Yes, it's hip, yes, it's cool...and I don't mind paying for great food/drinks, but it was definitely not worth the high prices.  The margaritas would've been priced around $4.25 at any other mexican joint and that tiny taco should've been about $1.25!  The tortilla was the size of a small pancake and had just 2...yes 2...shrimp inside..we each got a bite.
I'm still kicking myself for paying that kind of money for nothing special!"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos around. Service was outstanding. Great outdoor seating area. Staff was great and the Blood Orange margaritas were delicious. Definitely a place to go to."}
{"text":"Good food , music and drinks. Recommend the Baja fish Taco and cucumber Serrano margarita."}
{"text":"so after my last review which mind u I said I would be returning back and enjoyed myself there... Management still contacted me offered me gift card to return bc I wasn't fully satisfied w tacos I got.. wow first of all such amazing hospitality. So of course I accepted and went again and this time we had even more fun I love this place bartenders are so cool and knowledgeable and laid back. I ve never been a \"regular\" anywhere bc I like to try different things too much and no place has I guess has drawn my attention enough but I think joyride did it... Im just in a good mood when I'm there everyone's happy staff and guests. I Ordered cucumber margarita that was really good..I love anejo tequilas and Mackenzie suggested a new one I hadn't had b4 that i really liked. I think my first visit it was just some flook or it was my taste buds bc I tried carnitas again on my nachos and were amazing i kinda consider myself a nachos and carnitas expert bc I'm obsessed w both and I order both a lot! In addition got st corn my fiancé is Mexican loves corn and a chef and he loved it!! I don't care for corn too much but damn I woke up thinking abt it today is all I need to say I guess and I don't even like corn!! So good on the cob and chz maybe lime on it idk but super good so I definitely definitely recommend this place it's chill fun and good food and service can't ask for anything more :)"}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday for the first time. Service was horrible. Very over priced and average at best food. The restaurant was not very busy but the service was painfully slow."}
{"text":"Got the \"beast\" burrito and it was full of gristle in the meat and had a BONE in it. NEVER will go back..like eating at a Filibertos for 5 times the price. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Funky decor; friendly, fast service. Like the casual atmosphere & open, airy dining room which is great on a nice day. Great salsa. If you're looking for untraditional flavors this is the place to go. We ordered carne tacos, quesadilla and chicken salad. Carne was sweet, which was interesting. Chicken wasn't all that great - I would almost score this place a 4 but chicken ruined it."}
{"text":"Joyride tacos were amazing and being Hispanic I can honestly say they are very authentic the salsa is amazing and their black beans are really really good! I was there to days in a row! The carne Asada tacos were my favorite I did not care for the breaded fish but I got a taco replaced without charge which was really really nice the service was excellent and the atmosphere was Great! I would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Great food! Not the best customer service. I've been three times and each time the waiter has forgotten something I've ordered. Will go again just for the food."}
{"text":"WOW, wish I had taken pictures! I was sure hungry and this place hit the spot!!  Delicious roasted salsa & tomitillo salsa, I had the nachos with Carne asada meat, huge serving the left overs will be calling my name tomorrow. Yum yum yum, 
My Friends ordered tacos, shrimp ceviche, mexican street corn.  I will definitely visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Recently celebrated the end of summer with a large group of kids and adults at Joyride.  The beer was icy cold, the Blood Orange margs were to die for and the food was amazing.  Our server was super attentive and offered great suggestions.  The manager checked in occasionally as our group was so large....appreciated.  Would have taken some pics of the food but it was gone too fast.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Trendy. Expensive. Loud. Tuesdays is your best bet because beef tacos are a couple of dollars versus typical prices any other day. Everything else in the menu is pricy but good. Not family oriented, unless you like to be screaming at your kids."}
{"text":"Can't beat $2 happy hour tacos and $5 margs.. plus happy \"hour\" is pretty much all afternoon! It was kind of busy for a Wednesday around 5 PM, but our server was so nice and brought us a dessert on the house for being patient with the service! honestly didn't seem like the service was slow to us, but it was a nice gesture and earned my 5 stars :) some places with taco Tuesday $1-2 taco deals have tiny poor quality tacos, but that is not the case here! Decent size and quality for the price."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, great location.  The tacos are good, I had one of each, very unique!  The Beast burrito is my favorite! The ceviche was tasty, but almost too chunky so it was hard to scoop on a chip. No televisions, so that can be good or bad depending on if you want to watch a game while eating."}
{"text":"We visit here almost every Tuesday for taco Tuesday and we have 2 to 3 people with us last night we had 7 we bragged about this place it was horrible 1st we were told an hour then it was actually 15 min we almost left then after waiting 20 min for our waiter chase? He got all of our orders wrong the carne asada was burnt another waitress who is really good admitted they were burning the meat he had to come back 4 or 5 times to correct items never did apologize or anything we were going almost every week but after this and now looking like idiots in front of of friends and new clients I think now you have lost everyone it's too bad it was good for awhile"}
{"text":"Try the crispy fish tacos they are delicious! They are perfectly battered and crispy and garnished beautifully.The carne asada quesadilla was very good as well. I love that you can also get all the chips and salsa you'd like without it costing a few extra bucks. Skip the burritos though. They taste like the enchiladas that Pollo Loco just added to their menu. Definitely not worth the $8 price tag. And last but not least, the drinks! My mouth just waters at the pure thought of them. I'm personally not a fan of margaritas but man oh man! The drinks were stirred and executed perfectly!"}
{"text":"4 & 1/2 stars on the food, 3 on atmosphere (music way too loud), 4 on service.  5 of us had 5 dishes, all good to excellent.  Salsa is very tasty, chips hot from the oven.  Just wish the music was down a notch - hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Not great but good. Might be better if you're a drinker. Id recommend the chicken burrito."}
{"text":"Recently had the famous Joyride Taco's. I had a shrimp, carnita and two crispy fish tacos. The first two were good, the crispy fish were fantastic, I highly recommend! We finished off the meal with the chocolate churros which were god as well and perfect for sharing. Overall good experience and solid food."}
{"text":"This place was making up for the fact we couldnt go Dos Los Molinos as they were closed on Sunday. I was blown away by the rockstar service provided to us by our waitress Breezy. She was amazing!! The food, however, was a complete surprise. It was fresh and flavorful and out of this world! Especially the blood orange Margarita, the charred habenero salsa, mexican corn ( heavens to betsy was it amazing) orange cucumber salad and the crispy fish taco which we couldn't get enough of so we ordered several more to go! This was a happy accident and I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Joyride was excellent for happy hour.  The tacos were amazing with flavor and the house margaritas and beer specials were very good.  Friendly staff as well.  Make sure to get there early or you could be waiting in a big line which means others feel the same way."}
{"text":"This is a unique place that has some great food and a good atmosphere. The best thing on the menu might be the \"Bomb Black Beans\" which have a great little kick to them. I was slightly disappointed with the grilled fish taco but all of the other tacos I have tried have been great. They also have good margaritas and a great deal for taco tuesday!"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place! Great atmosphere, delicious food and ridiculously friendly staff! Everyone that works here seems to love their job and their smiles are contagious- I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tory our waitress was amazing. made amazing suggestions and we loved everything. the ceviche is a must. My son ordered 2 orders of the kids quesadilla because he loved it. Fish tacos were my favorite, the husband loved the carne asada tacos. we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from multiple family and friends who have raved about it so I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about.  Well let's just say I was not real impressed with the food but the service was really good!  The street tacos weren't terrible but nothing great.  I think Sandbar has better tacos, especially the carnitas.  Good prices, good service, good chips and salsa with a cool atmosphere gives it 4 stars"}
{"text":"This place was sooo awesome the staff is soo attentive the ambiance was amazing. The food was delicious. The cucumber serrano margarita was a bit too strong it definitely has a bite to it and the end, but the tacos and the salads where delicious. We had the chicken tinga,braised beef, and battered fish tacos.The guacamole,chips and salsa were delicious. It was a great place for a date night."}
{"text":"I was not impressed but my husband liked it more.  We went for Cinco de Mayo so it was busy. I noticed their happy hour ends at five.  Am I the only one who thinks that is weird? The tacos were ok but over all not really worth the price.  Drinks were decent.  The decor and atmosphere were great but there were a large amount of flies.  I think there would have been less trouble with flies if we ate outside.  I might give it another try but maybe just a drink and app but there are better places nearby."}
{"text":"I just want to shed light to the fact that this upward projects restaraunt concept is a complete ripoff of Gallo Blanco. I heard about this place through a friend who works at the gilbert location, they described it as one of AZ's \"best Mexican fine dining places.\" Having previously worked for Gallo, I was curious about this new place I had never heard of before, but was apparently such a huge deal. So I did a little investigating. Much to my dismay, upon discovery of their menu I realized that many of the names of food dishes, even exact recipies had been stolen from Gallo Blanco. I can say this with 100% confidence because if you know anything about Gallo Blanco's owner, you would know that he is from Mecixo, he is a prominent chef, and his menu items are either entirely self-created, or as a collaboration with somebody who works for/with him. His food is authentic to Mexico City as you will get this side of the border. So you see how it might have come as a shock when I noticed items on Joyride's menu like steamed jasmine rice with tomatillo salsa as a garnish: this item was on the menu at Gallo Blanco for 4 years because the owner's mother (who is of partial Japanese descent) would serve rice to him in that way when he was growing up in Mexico. Tsktsk Joyride, I see what you're doing.
 It's not about competing restaraunts,I'm sure that Joyride Central will come to it's own success as Gallo continues to grow, I'm just upset to have stumbled upon such an ugly expose of how people choose to make money. I've been a patron at Windsor, Postino, and Federal Pizza on numerous occasions; Upward must be doing something right, and making a lot of money doing it. But this Joyride thing is low, and upward people should be ashmed that rather than develop a creative food idea for themselves, they'd rather hire a good interior decorator, steal food concepts, and try to out-compete the original creator of the ideas they are attempting to capitalize on."}
{"text":"Love this place... Food is always great, and the atmosphere is fun and casual. Come in between 2-5 if you can. They have $2 tacos and $5 pitchers. Great way to end the week!

Service is always friendly, and remains consistently good, even through the apparently high turnover of the staff."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday afternoon because we were in the neighborhood. Our waitress was really sweet, but the girl helping her was a nightmare. So rude. 
They wound up forgetting one of my tacos.
Chips & salsa were good, tacos were meh, service was horrendous. We had to ask 3 different people for a high chair for my daughter and it didn't come until halfway through our meal.
Will not be going back.

2 stars for the blood orange margarita and the cute atmosphere. I had high hopes for this place but sadly was let down."}
{"text":"Shared several different tacos with the wife and they were all great.  I had a Margaritas and it was also very well prepared! I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a bad experience.   We ate here back in July and loved it.   This time it was totally different.   Flies filled the restaurant, the taco meat was fatty and the salads were wilted.   Luckily the manager, Daniel, dropped the bill, but they need to make some changes."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say if you haven't been to downtown Gilbert in a while you need to. It has become a hip little restaurant row.  A few years ago I moved away from Arizona to foodie heaven a.k.a. Portland, OR. Being from Arizona originally I would have to say that the one thing Portland cannot seem to replicate correctly is Mexican food. So coming back to visit tacos are an essential must eat. 
A friend suggested we head over to Joyride Tacos and I'm sure glad she did. Every sip and bite was delicious! They had both a front and back patio with plenty of seating. Being a beautiful sunny, 70 degree day we choose to sit out front. While I was waiting for my guest, the waiter promptly brought out chips and salsa, then took my drink order. They have about 6 aqua frescas to choose from which you can get with or without alcohol. I choose the almond horchata, oh man was it good! They serve it with a little bit of ground cinnamon sugar and nuts on top and that gives it an amazing texture. The chips were crisp and tasted like they had been fried fresh that morning. The salsa was spicy yet fresh. So don't be afraid to dig in just because you can't handle heat. When my friend arrived we ordered a couple tacos each. I got both a chicken and shredded beef taco, both came with and assortment of cheese and veggies on top, including avocado. I ate my chicken taco first which was very tasty, but the beef taco was by far superb. You could literally taste the smokey goodness in every bite of the taco and the creamy avocado was a perfect accent to the meat. Oh and because the two of us ordered more then 3 tacos we received a free side dish! We choose the black beans and they were better then any black beans I have ever had before. Overall I will be heading back to Joyride Tacos at least once every trip back to AZ!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The staff was friendly and accommodating. We kept chasing the shade and they accommodated. The tacos were off the chain- Delish! Carne Asada, fish, carnitas, it's all great! 
I plan to go back."}
{"text":"We shared a crispy fish taco and the torta with pork. It was delicious! We also got a pitcher of beer for $5 (happy hour) the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the fish taco was pretty small for over $4. The chips and salsa were really good too:)"}
{"text":"My first time, sadly last time. Nothing special here and we came on staff doesn't care day"}
{"text":"'hip' taco joint, really? gilbert is not nor will ever be in the least bit hip. Told it was a 20 minute wait on a wednesday nite and waited for an hour. strike one. Waiter asked if we wanted to see the menus, seriously? don't they teach you this on the first day of training? strike two. chips were way too salty and only one kind of salsa was chincy strike 2 1/2. i have had better tacos off of taco trucks in Yuma for 1/3 the cost. if you really feel that you can open a restaurant catering to 20-30 somethings and forget about everyone else I can envision the 'for rent' sign on your window much sooner rather than later. and finally, booths that seat 6 with 2 people sitting in them.  who ever designed this place should immediately be fired. poor layout, fair food, clueless servers. make that one star. want real food with knowledgeable service at fair prices? try si senor on alma school in chandler"}
{"text":"Wonderful tacos, I couldn't decide so I had to taste one of each. This place had a fun atmosphere and I really enjoyed the staff, the location and the food!"}
{"text":"Chill atmosphere, cold beer, tasty tacos. \"The Standard\" is my personal favorite. And the rice..... be sure to get the rice!"}
{"text":"I LOVE joyride taco house. My friend and I sat outside on the patio with his puppy (so nice). Everyone was really sweet and it was a perfect place to bring your dog.

The atmosphere is fantastic, really laid back but also awesome design. I got the Mexican corn and two tacos and they were incredible. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat dinner! Everyone was so nice and the food was delicious! We had the street tacos and nachos. Everything had a lot of flavor and was super fresh! The wait staff and manager were the nicest of any restaurant I've been too. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We put Joyride to the ultimate test - Taco Tuesday on Cinco de Mayo! It was EXCELLENT! Of course there was a wait, which was to be expected. We weren't the only geniuses going for Mexican on Cinco de Mayo! The service outside while we were waiting was spot on! Drinks kept coming, along with the chips and salsa. When we were seated our server was happy, excited and in a genuinely great mood. Then you could really see how the entire place was all in! The hostess was running food, servers were delivering drinks and managers were clearing tables! And the food, top notch as always. No sacrifice in quality and no eternity wait times. Awesome place and fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"I love Joyride. It is one of my favorite downtown Gilbert restaurants. The atmosphere and food/drinks are always amazing. My favorite is the chicken burrito..... And the mango mandarin margarita...  The the spicy around the rim!!!  Joyride will always be a go to place for me!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour tacos to fuel a day of bike riding. $2 tacos and endless chips served by friendly staff, and with quality ingredients. Easily made vegan friendly for those seeking dairy and meat free options."}
{"text":"Good here is pretty tasty but not as good as some. Meat was a little over cooked and tacos were plain. Plus specials weren't great! Still will eat there just giving an honest review"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! It's our first night here and we weren't greeted for about 10 minutes at our table, the manager comes up to us and comps are our meal the best customer service I've seen EVEr!!!! Plus to tacos are off the hook!!! Nothing Taco Bell about this place yummy!!! Deeply satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Tacos were fantastic! My wife and i had the mixed plate with the three tacos, tortillas are super fresh so are all the fillings.

Ceviche was ok very fresh but i feel under seasoned.

Had a couple margaritas that are priced fairly and were made great with a mild sweet and sour."}
{"text":"Location right in downtown Gilbert is great.  Layout with indoor/outdoor patio is great.  Stick with the taco's.  Nachos are SOGGY (i've had them twice...because i was hoping the first time was a mistake.)  I would encourage Joyride to review the \"recipe\" on the nachos and come up with a way to keep the chips crisp.  Hours are great as it is one of the only spots open late in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I went here on a weekday for lunch with my daughter. She goes her all the time and she thought I would like it. It was amazing. got three Baja fish tacos and a cucumber Mandren orange salad. Also very good. The place was crazy busy and very fun. The place is very edgy in a good way. Definitely will be going back here."}
{"text":"Ended up here when we saw our intended restaurant was packed. Nice open seating and bar. Smaller menu but all sounded good. Both my hubby and I ordered the the beast burrito. Carne asada, avocado, beans, salsa. We asked for no rice in our burritos. Diet coke, iced tea. Burritos tasted good with fresh tasting ingredients. Service was quick. Unfortunately, lots of grisely pieces of unchewable meat. I get it, sometimes a bad piece gets through but I had like 4. For 11.50$ a burrito I expect better quality meat. Good chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Good restaurant concept. Great vibe. Would have given 4 stars but valet parking only. Fresh ingredients. Went here for Easter lunch and had no problems getting in and there was plenty of parking that I couldn't park my own car into.  You can get plenty of food for under $10 but most likely will go over 10 per person especially if you're getting alcohol.  House margarita was tasty. No need to go top-shelf, but that have that too. Overall a bit on the pricey side for Mexican, but you're paying for location and the swank ambiance. The free salsa is good. I tried the un-free habanero salsa (they let me try it for free thankfully) and didn't like it.  So before you buy the un-free salsas ask for a taste."}
{"text":"Loved this place! My husband got a steak quesadilla which was fresh and the meat was juicy, tender and flavored perfectly. I wasn't very hungry but wanted to try a taco so I went with the crispy fish, so glad I did. It was really good. The restaurant was pretty packed and the workers were all busy but the service was fantastic. Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"I go to Happy Hour with my coworkers here and it's okay.  The drinks are GREAT. Try the pineapple mojito - they'll ruin you for anything else.  The problem for me comes with the food.

I'm GLUTEN-FREE due to a diagnosed wheat allergy, and there are VERY few things I can eat here.  The service (and perhaps the kitchen) staff does not understand issues of cross-contamination with food allergens.  My server there the first time went to ask the chef what I could eat (and I said \"severe wheat allergy\" several times) and came back telling me I could eat the chips among a few other things.  I ate ONE chip and my mouth started itching.  I called him back over and asked if they used a shared fryer for wheat/gluten-bearing and wheat/gluten-free products and he came back saying that they did fry the chips in the same oil as the wheat-filled churros  That's allergen cross-contamination 101 and anyone in food service should think/know about it and communicate that to customers.  Had I not known by hard experience to take a tiny bite and go slow no matter what my server said, I would have had to Epi-Pen myself.  On the plus side, I bring my own chips now sometimes and once I explain, they're happy to bring me a bowl of salsa so I can snack with the rest of the group.  

If Joyride would simply use a dedicated fryer for its chips, I'd be able to eat a lot more -- including the yummy-looking chips and salsa and their amazing-looking nachos. As is, there are two or three tacos I can supposedly eat.  I stick with the Standard taco because it's never made me sick.  The food is never bad, but it's not really even either - one time I had a fantastic one, full of fresh, sweet corn kernels.  Other times the taco has been okay, with hardly any corn.  Proportions of ingredients change, affecting the taste -- perhaps because of the availability of fresh ingredients?

All in all, I go because I like hanging out with my friends from work and the drinks are truly great.  But I wouldn't choose to go back on my own. Joyride is owned by the same group that owns Postino's, which has some great gluten-free options.  Wish they'd catch up a little."}
{"text":"Came here with a small group of coworkers today and we all had a great time. The staff was very friendly and fun. Our particular waiter looked like he was training someone, but that did not stop him from providing great service to us. Our chip, salsa and drink refills were great. Everyone seemed to like being at work and help out with all tables. It is a little confusing when you aren't quite sure if the man or woman walking by is a waiter or guest, name tags or something would be helpful lol. The menu is nice and simple and the presentation is very clean. Our beans and rice needed a little salt, but that's probably that healthy effort kicking in. I had the carne asada, carnitas and standard tacos, they were sooo good. I WILL be back to try more of their items, I would like to see this place in the evenings. Seems like a cool place to sit and have some drinks. No complaints from anyone in our party, definitely happy with this establishment."}
{"text":"These tacos are AWESOME! I have been a few times and have never been disappointed with the food. Super yummy. Only bummed about the wait time. They don't take reservations so if you go on the weekend or during a busy time- be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Went for the first time Sunday. Had a great meal, wonderful food and top notch service. Never did a drink go empty. Very attentive without being intrusive. Will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Crispy fish taco is great, ahi fish taco was very flavor able service was fast with lots of thoughtful follow-up.  It's a nice spot, give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my highest Yelp recommendation. By far the BEST tacos I've EVER had.  I will absolutely be back.  And, the staff are just fun and friendly - especially Chris.  Highly recommend this place to everyone looking for flavorful dishes."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I love all the other spots from the group who did Joyride. The fresh chips and salsa were good! But the salsa verde we ordered wasn't. I ordered the almond horchata aqua fresca, but they were out. Okay, fine. So I order citrus. Nope. Pineapple? Sorry. The waiter was great and comped the mango one I finally ended up with. The service really was good here, albeit the bar was incredibly slow. As in, took 10-15 minutes each time we ordered drinks. 

So, onto the food. I got three tacos: carne asada, crispy fish (server's recommendation), and the chicken tikka. The best was the asada. It had a really good flavor and had that same smoked salsa they'd served with the chips. Too many raw white onions. Sadly, it was cold, as were all of my tacos. The chicken tikka really could have been great, but it was cold. The flavors were there, though. The crispy fish: yuck. Fish was cold and flavorless, the sauces had no taste. Wholly disappointing. I had the black beans for my side. They desperately needed salt and some seasoning. My boyfriend got the Mexican slaw. It too lacked flavor. All in all, I was disappointed. I adore Federal and Windsor, so I had high hopes. I definitely see room for improvement. I hope they get better, but I won't be trying again."}
{"text":"We loved our service! Definitely a team oriented place. Daniel H. the manager was brilliant. He filled in when our handsome server Cory was preoccupied by other tables. The food and especially the cocktails were delicious! My mom went the night before and got the ensalada fila and it was spectacular! Thank you for a wonderful first experience, I will be returning soon xoxo"}
{"text":"Kind of a crazy place during rush times ... but they did well in handling it all.  We were seated within 20 mins ... and points for keeping track ... and making sure people were seated in the order of their arrival.  Food was really good.  Maybe the best Mexican we've had since moving to Gilbert, AZ."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out with my friends because we heard it was really good. The food tasted great but 3 of us have food poisoning. Also the service was really slow being that it wasn't that crowded."}
{"text":"I really like Joyride.  I like the enchiladas with half green half red sauce, I like the hip colorful casual vibe, and I most definitely like the margaritas - oh the margaritas.  I just don't know if I actually like the tacos...I've never tried them.

Therein lies my only complaint with Joyride (and gourmet taco places in general).  The tacos just never seem like they are worth the price (unless you are here on a Taco Tuesday night or I suppose have self control and don't need 5-6 tacos like me...)

The free chips and salsa are a nice touch and the service is usually outstanding.  Like I said, the food is delicious! I promise I'll try the tacos eventually..."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Server, Bailey, was one of the worst servers I have had while eating out. Never felt welcome from the start, it was our first time at this restaurant. Difficult for our server to even crack a smile, she actually seemed irritated when I asked for a refill on the salsa; barely any in the dish the first time around. Chips that were brought to the table were completely broken. After the first 10 chips, we nibbled on quarter sized corn chips until the meals arrived. Do we want another round of drinks? Hell, no! The check please. So, she takes the basket full of broken chips that we were still nibbling on, while waiting to pay. A sad experience. Friendlier and more courteous service at In N Out Burger, but they don't serve drinks and tacos. 

Followup: The general manager did reach out through Yelp to make it right and take corrective action. I declined contact, my key points are covered above."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for an early dinner.  Service was great, waitress was friendly, we were seated right away.  We also moved tables because our location was too loud for me and they had no problem with that. Living in Phoenix, I feel like we have lots of great food options here and I would say that their food was a bit pricey and tasted good.  Not great, not awesome, just good and that is fine.  The chips and salsa were great (probably best part).  We also ordered the fish taco (husband said that was good) and the carne asada burrito (that was ok).  Also got the vanilla custard pudding for dessert (very interesting, not my fave).  So, I guess I was expecting awesome since lots of people have eaten there and suggested it to us, but I thought it was average.  I do love the ambiance, though and the outdoor seating area is great."}
{"text":"First of all I hate comments from people who have no clue about the restaurant business. Don't go out to eat if you are in a hurry.

Sitting and the ambiance is great. Large place with a ton of seating. I am not eating here but I'm drinking here. The cucumber Serrano is great. My wife is drinking agua fresca with vodka and its great. I will update the post when I eat here."}
{"text":"I had a salad for lunch. It was $11. It was quite small and not really large enough to be a meal. I felt it was too expensive for what I got."}
{"text":"Just came back from the restaurant now. It was the middle of the day, so the place was slow. We were a party of 2 and waited over 40 minutes for our food. And when our food did finally come out, it was cold. Completely appalled at the service we received today."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were tasty, loved the salsa! We ordered the nachos and they were even better! The chips were amazing. 

I ordered the braised beef and red chili tamales and L.O.V.E.D. them!!! They were so awesome! As were the pinto beans, and I am NOT a pinto bean fan! They had incredible flavor. My husband ordered three different fish tacos, he said the shrimp one was OK, but the other two he loved! He's a picky eater, too! My daughter is the pickiest of eaters, but she loved the chicken out of her taco. I ate the beans and tortilla and thought, even for being super simple, had a ton of delicious flavor.

The service was slow towards the end, miserably slow, but the servers and the hostess were all super friendly and funny. Loved the ambiance, too. We sat outside and it was great! Kiddos loved running on the grass (as no other patrons were out there at the time). 

All in all, it was a nice evening with very tasty food! Loved it, thanks Joyride!"}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed. The Tacos(if it's in your name they better be great)  were ok but I've had way better. The kids meal burrito was about as big as my finger. The margaritas were really good. Prices were way to high for the quality and portions of food, but I get it, they have to pay for that prime downtown Gilbert location. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Joyride is hit or miss for me. The fish taco's were great, but I don't think I would go out of my way to go here. There is nothing wrong with it, and most of the food was good, but the portions are kind of weak."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here on a work trip and I am glad I did.  I had tacos and beer only.  Tacos were so good I had 6!  To make it better it was taco Tuesday so 2 beers and 6 GOOD tacos only $20.  Ill come back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent service during our weekday lunch! Tacos and soup were tasty and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos but pricey... $5 tacos! :(
Nice restaurant and good service!"}
{"text":"Had the cucumber-Serrano marg, fantastic and the nachos were great! The staff were friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was happy to see a new restaurant finally move into the space next to Postino, so when it opened, my wife and I had to try it. I have to say the service and drinks were great, but the food was quite a disappointment. The chicken burrito my wife ordered was filled with over grilled vegetables, very little chicken and wrapped in a tough flour tortilla. The only flavor detected was that of roasted corn. I was equally disappointed in the tacos I ordered. I tried both the shrimp and the chef special scallop. The corn tortillas were grilled until stiff and dry. The shrimp and scallop were plentiful, but again lacked any kind of flavor. If you want to try any salsa other than the bland house kind, it will cost you two dollars extra. Not worth the cost, when you consider you would have to eat it with the generic tortilla chips they serve. The one bright spot was the Mexican street corn. It was very good. Overall, I would say skip this trendy spot and go across the street for much better food at half the price."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere, fun patio.  Watermelon margarita was refreshing and not syrup sweet.  Justin the bartender provided excellent service, he was attentive and helpful to us as first timers.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Generally, I really like this place. The two big drawbacks for me are the lines and the price. However, in downtown Gilbert you kind of can't get away from long lines no matter where you go so I can't hold that against joy ride. So, the only real drawback that remains is the price. It is definitely way more expesive than a lot of other great taco places. You don't even get chip refills on top of already step food prices.  

But having said that! That food is really good. They have one dish here that I really love and haven't found something comparable to. It is the veggie enchiladas with goat cheese. They are so good! I am not a vegetarian but I would still pick these over pretty much anything else. YUM! Their burritos are also good from what I have tried but man those enchiladas."}
{"text":"Love this place but why oh why did you get rid of the El Capitan sandwich?? It was amazing! Bring it back please!"}
{"text":"Good food. But when you get my bill wrong and take 10 minutes to give it back and then have to give it to another server to take care of it and then you don't give me back my full change then that is a problem... There are other places that will give me back FULL change and not try to take advantage of me"}
{"text":"Worst service ever, had to find someone to get chips, drink refills and pay the bill even after asking the server. Appetizer corn was cold, Beast burrito so so. Never going back..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but they need to get the flies under control. We were dining inside and still had to constantly swat them away from our food. Felt a little rushed out the door at the end of the meal. Other than that it was good."}
{"text":"The service is bad and it always takes a while for them to acknowledge you  even when it's not busy. On my last visit I ordered the chicken burrito and it didn't taste fresh and I could barely eat it because it was soaked in enchilada sauce, my fiancé agreed that it tastes like the stuff you buy from a can. I've given this place way too many chances and I only write this review because I got sick right after eating there and the next day I am still sick.."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place.  Every time I've noticed the place, it has a good sized crowd on the patios and it looks like a good time. Kind of fell short.  The Mexican food is like a tex-mex fare which really isn't what I look for in Mexican food.  In fairness, that's my preference and there's probably quite a few people who look for this speciality of the Mexican food class so just expect that kind of menu. The ceviche was pretty good though.

Update- I have been going back to this place monthly...the ceviche brought me back and I think I can be called a regular now...my wife has the Veggi tacos which she likes about as much as my love of the ceviche.  The place turned me around, great bar to eat at....apologies to the owners for the initial lackluster review...I think were all good now."}
{"text":"Very casual and laid back place downtown Gilbert with great margaritas and tacos."}
{"text":"First the important thing... The drinks are amazing. Of course they have three of my favorite bartender's in town Megan, Chris, and Diane. The decor is nice and has a good size bar.

Now for the food... We tried a few different kinds of tacos the chicken had a nice spice, the beef was a little salty, and the pork was way to sweet. The chips and salsa rocked. Oh did I mention the margaritas... Lol.

All and all a cool place to hang out have some cocktails/food. We will be back I wish you were just a little bit closer to home."}
{"text":"Baja Tacos. Crispy Fish Tacos. Chicken Burrito - Chimi Style. Everything was on point. Salsa is killer, chips are fresh. Go here!"}
{"text":"Love them.  But now charging  $1.00 salsa and $2.00 for chips refills on a $50.00 tab for 3 people for food and drink! Seriously?"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious food! Homemade corn tortillas which have a consistency of a flour tortilla. Love love love"}
{"text":"Love Joyride taco house! Whoa! Love it!! Addicted. Fun place for the whole family!"}
{"text":"2 strikes and you are out as far as I'm concerned.
My first visit was over a month ago and I met some friends for a Sunday brunch. My boyfriend and I got there early so we sat at the bar and ordered beers. I have to say, the bar staff was awesome! Quick service and very helpful. That was the good part.
Got to our table and not only was our server apparently having a really bad day, she was extremely slow and not very polite. We had to wait for drinks, wait for food etc.. The table next to us complained about the same server and amazingly enough, the service got faster and much better. The food was okay, but nothing to write home about, but the bartenders were so nice I figured I would give this place another try.

This past weekend, we went again to celebrate my friends birthday. It was a Saturday night and they were busy, but that is to be expected on a Saturday. We sat outside in the grassy area and they told us we could get drinks there while we waited. Well, we waited and waited and waited and finally the server came over for our drink order. It was the same server I had on my first experience at Joyride. This should have been my first clue that things would not go well, but I figured the first visit was a fluke. So we get our round of drinks and waited......................................waited for an hour and a half and the server never came back for another drink order. She came back to other folks and we tried to flag her down, but nothing. I ended up having to get a manager because by this time none of us were happy. Manager promptly came over and got us a round of drinks on the house, but not before she commented on how many empty glasses were at our table, basically accusing us of having more drinks than what I told her. If she had counted she could have seen that there were 9 glasses and 8 people. The extra glass was from water that I had to go get myself.
At any rate, service is horrible, food is okay, but since this is the second time I have been there and the service was horrible both times, I won't be back. My friends said they would not be back either because this is not the first bad experience they have had."}
{"text":"Tacos are good.  I recommend going on a Tuesday, so you can get more bang for your buck as many of the tacos are half off.  Unique and flavortul margaritas.  I ordered one of the chile ones and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"What's the big deal about this place?  Food was good but the atmosphere was moderate the service horrible and the prices were a little steep."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere, music, and décor! I enjoyed the Cucumber Serrano margarita. It was refreshing and had a little kick to it, but was not overpowering. I had the \"Mix Tape\" salad with papaya and prickly pear dressing, it was amazing! The service wasn't the best, but overall everyone was nice. I would eat at Joyride again!"}
{"text":"Meh. Chips and salsa are good, as far as street tacos and the majority of the food, it's alright. The atmosphere is what sells this place."}
{"text":"I branched out of my normal stopping grounds to join a friend at his birthday dinner in Downtown Gilbert.  We dined at Joyride just a day after it opened, and there was quite the buzz which resulted in about a 20 minute wait, which was no big deal.  The interior is modern and bright, and very typical of what I have come to expect from the Upwards Project group.

The best dish of the night was the Joyride Guacamole, it was topped with little pieces of crispy manchengo cheese, which makes plain guacamole look super boring.  The chips were thick, some of my dining partners didn't care for them, but for thick chips I thought they were pretty good.  The salsa that they bring out was a smoky, thick red salsa, it reminded me of the salsa from Chevy's. They have some other salsas that you can order a la carte, but we stuck with the free stuff.

For our main dishes we got a variety of tacos and the nachos with carnitas.  I am a huge nacho fan, and I found these to be a bit underwhelming.  They were beautiful in appearance, but the cheese sauce that they put on them was pretty bland and they overloaded them with mushy, black beans.  The carnitas were decent, but I have had better.  The tacos were pretty hit and miss, the chicken tinga was the standout, the grilled fish was decent, but the carne asada was chewy and very lacking in flavor.  I am not sure if it was the cut of beef or the cooking, but either way, America's Taco Shop or even Filiberto's does carne asada better.

I know another Joyride is in the works on Central Ave., so I will probably give it another try when they open, but it is not something I loved so much that I will take a field trip just to eat."}
{"text":"I flippin' love this place. I've been here a few times. Service and food has always been top notch. Last time I was in I had a little gal named Gabby. She was super witty and had great knowledge about the drinks and food. I love the Naked and Famous, but my girlfriend hated it. Super smoky and great for sipping! The sweet pork taco and braised beef were also really good. Can't wait to come back for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Well after a few recommendations and some yelp reviews we decided to try it. Over all a disappointment for all the hype. 50 minute wait. 30 minute wait from the time we ordered appetizer until food arrived...uhm before the appetizer. I had 3 way overpriced \"street tacos\" crispy fish, shrimp, and shredded beef. Both the fish and shrimp were cold, the beef barely warm...wife's were adequately warm. Over all tacos all kind of tasted the same was my wife's comment. I agreed. Appetizer finally came...ahi tostada (on the house at this point) it was good...but nothing to write home about...was not seasoned at all. It's amazing what a little salt and pepper can do for a dish folks. A double rum and coke set me back 14 dollars wtf? The moes definitely desert? Uhmmm runny and grainy boxed pudding, a clump of sliced banana, Carmel and salted pecans...pecans and Carmel were the best part etc...thrown together...but tasted pretty good...not worth 6 bucks. Our server was pleasant enough but forgetful apparently. Short term memory problems? Lol

All said and done ? 64 dollars for one app, two entrees, one desert and two drinks. 

I don't know what the uber positive reviews are all about I'm thinking you waited a long time and had a few too many by the time your table was ready hence...\"everything was so good\"...really over priced, under seasoned, poorly executed simple food. Trying to ride on the hipster local and decor  and forgetting that the food and service is the thing. 

 We decided we will go try it one more time just make sure it wasn't an accident. Will update after."}
{"text":"Went to Joyride today and really had a wonderful time.  Their salsa is fantastic and I wasn't even to the bottom of the chips when they brought me a refill of chips and salsa. The food is fresh and just the right portions and lots of vegetarian options available.  I recommend the Mexican corn from the starter menu and the pineapple Fresca!  Joyride's Happy Hour specials are the best just like all the Upward restaurants.  I hung out there with a few friends for an hour or two without pressure to leave or order more. I will definitely frequent Joyride."}
{"text":"bomb.com and a great happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Came here for Taco Tuesday tonight with my parents. The ambiance and music were great! I ordered 2 crispy fish tacos and 1 standard taco. The crispy fish was my favorite. I also ordered my favorite margarita, the blood orange, I get that every time I come in. The service was great, I never had an empty water glass and the 2 hostesses that greeted us at the door were super funny, putting smiles on our faces before we even sat down!"}
{"text":"Awesome salsa, strong drinks, tasty tacos, and a fun atmosphere. We tried 5 different types of tacos and I have nothing bad to say about any of them. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, will definitely return. Got seated immediately, I got my water refilled like 3 times, the waiters kept checking in. I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great but I can't say the same about the tacos or the margaritas. The carne asada was extremely fatty and the chicken with white magic lacked any magic. The margaritas needed more tequila. Not sure if this is just how they get rid of the low quality products for taco Tuesday or if this is the standard but it did not live up to expectations."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, and another cool restaurant from upward projects.  Family style tacos but also perfect individual lunch portions."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good, spilled salsa and it was cleaned right away. Ordered a non alcoholic beverage (underage) and waitress brought a mojito Fresca drink. Chips were good, guacamole okay. Fish tacos had no flavor. Even tasted gross and overly fishy. I either think everyone giving 5 stars has really bad taste and doesnt know what a good fish taco tastes like, or my fish taco was bad."}
{"text":"It's quick, it's open late, it's convenient. But ultimately, the place is soulless. No original dishes, no authenticity to the flavors. It's a food factory and if that and a tart drink are what you crave you'll be satisfied. But satisfied to me is the baseline for keeping a restaurant open and a far cry from making it a thing of quality. Also, they're batting a thousand on putting avocados on my girlfriends tacos even though she's allergic and 86's it every time."}
{"text":"Went back again to give it another shot, couldn't get those tacos out of my head. Service was definitely an improvement. Food was still amazing. 

I guess my advice is try to go during a time when its not as busy and it will be an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and from what I've seen, the experience at Joyride is consistent. So the positives are the atmosphere, service, and drinks. Whoever designed this place did a really great job at creating a hipster environment that is also really comfortable. There is a great outdoor seating area and all of the design choices are happy and pleasant. Service has also always been friendly and efficient. The other major upside is the drinks, which are well made, creative, and delicious. They have a nice nonalcoholic selection as well. 

The major downfall at Joyride is unfortunately the food. It isn't awful, but it's just not very good. I have had a variety of tacos, the torta, and some forgettable huevos rancheros type thing and none of it has been any good. I mean, it's edible, but it just falls so flat in flavor. Pretty much everything needs more salt and spice. Even the salsas are really quite bland. 

If they improved the food situation, this place would be five stars, no question. As it is though, I'd stick with drinks and eat at any one of the other more delicious choices within walking distance of Joyride."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service. A little bit on the noisey but everything else more than makes up for it. Very polite staff with a laid back attitude. You can't go wrong with any of the street tacos or a burrito. I definitely recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"We just left Joy Ride after waiting an hour and received our food COLD, a variety of tacos with the street corn.  The corn was refrigerator cold, sent it back and it returned the same way it came the first time.  If you value your time and taste buds, do not go to this restaurant!!  This unbelievable coming from this restaurant group."}
{"text":"I ordered their chicken Tinga tacos the first time I went because I had yet to find a good version of pollo Tinga in az.  They were a little bland despite warnings that they were spicy.  However, once I added some of their salsa to them they were good chicken tacos.  I like their decor.  I have eaten their once alone at the bar and the service was quick and super friendly and once with friends during the busy Christmas season... Service was a little slower but food was great and waiter was fun."}
{"text":"This place was really great.  I loved all the tacos I tried and the atmosphere is really open and colorful.  They have huuuuuge booths that are a great place to bring friends.

I was there on a day when I had a party of 10-15 at any given time.  The server was great at accommodating our group - we were able to pay with several credit cards + cash as long as we divided up the items ourselves.

The only reason I wouldn't give this place 5 stars is because when I called to make the reservation for 10, the manager gave me grief that my party would be arriving & leaving at varied times, and pushed back because 'the restaurant is busy at 4:30'.  At 4:30 when I arrived, half the restaurant was empty and there wasn't a wait until shortly before 6:30, when we wrapped up and left.  I was disappointed at the attitude that a party of 10+ wouldn't be welcomed with open arms.  

On a positive note, the drinks are fantastic and the open doors made this a perfect place for a spring get together."}
{"text":"Joyride was a joyride. Finally made it in after being on my radar for a few weeks. Quite possibly the best tacos I've ever had (carne asada, baja fish, and short rib). Not sure if the 2 star reviewers are on crack, but these tacos were muy delicioso and service was definitely top notch. I can't wait to be able to sit outside in their lawn area with some tacos and brewskies without melting away."}
{"text":"Where shall I begin? The decor and setup was cool. The free first round of chips and salsa was amazing. However we probably should have stopped there. The rest of the food was just blah and mediocre. I'm used to some really good authentic mexican tacos, and the taco's here just didn't cut it. They came out rather cold and just eh. It did not satisfy my mexican food craving at all. The rice was kind of cold and crunchy as well. And the elote corn was nothing compared to Barrio Queen. Normally when I leave a restaurant, I'm so full that I tell myself I'll never eat again lol well unfortunately I left here the other night and went straight home to eat something. I was looking forward to eating here because I'm a fan of all their other restaurants that they own in the area; I suppose I will stick to those instead."}
{"text":"Love this place, food, service and employees all Rock! One of the managers (Chandler) always goes above and beyond... as do his employees. I highly recommend the tacos or just hanging out there for Sunday bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great recommendations, yummy tacos, and happy hour at noon.  They just need a queso dip and I'd give them 6 stars!"}
{"text":"we visited joyride in old town gilbert this weekend, and the food was outstanding,  and the service was great! very accommodating!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and service was great! Couldn't get any better!"}
{"text":"I want to like this restaurant. But the last 3 times I've been here there is something a little off about the food. Also, the service is bad. All three times I went I've sat waiting around for someone to take my order , refill my water and bring my check. each time I've had to leave my seat and ask an employee to service my table. All of the other restaurants owned by upward projects are amazing but something is missing at Joyride."}
{"text":"This place is really beautiful. I love the decor and ambiance. It feels nice and easy. The carne asada is sweet and delicious, the salsa and chips fantastic, the fish tacos rocked but the street corn was odd and mediocre at best. And I love street corn. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well, it's not bad...but it's not great either. Walking in I was pumped to hear Deltron through the speakers and see the place was not as pretentious as I had heard from the grape vine. Since I'm not one for negativity I'll start out with some positives. A wide selection of aguas frescas with the option of adding booze to it was quite a delight, and the salsa they bring out with your complimentary chips was actually tasty as a mofo. Service was pretty good and,,, well...that's about it. If you are going to be charging around 4 bucks each for mf'n street tacos they better be amazing, the truth is they were not. You could score a hell of a better fish taco at rubios, the cochinito pibil tasted like a corona with a few cigarette butts floating inside, and the short rib was alright...just kick up the seasoning. A few adjustments and this place could be a gem."}
{"text":"The grand opening week was the first time we visited - tacos with a minuscule amount of meat - but things have much improved.  I'll chalk it up to the loads of trendy skinny -jean wearers trying to be as cool as we are. Now that it's filled with normal citizens, the food is much improved and they do have a nice draft beer assortment along with some wine for my wife.  It's nice to dance between postino next door and here so you can mix it up depending on what you are craving.  Very cool decor inside and a nice big bar."}
{"text":"Loved it. Just...loved it. Very hip vibe, very fun decor (can't go wrong with Lego Storm Trooper posters and hexagon tile walls), and the food...mmmm! The hubs didn't care for it too much, but he would prefer a big-ass burrito wrapped in foil to something with complex flavors and interesting ingredients. :) I love him, but he's not a foodie. I really enjoyed it--the tacos were fresh, brightly flavorful, and the meat was perfectly cooked. The house wine was great, too. Didn't taste cheap, and at $9 a glass, it better not be! The kids' menu was totally do-able for my picky 6 year old. She had a quesadilla with fruit salad and gobbled it up. We told her no churro for dessert if she didn't...that did it! 

Dessert took 20-30 minutes to come out. Not sure what happened, but they noticed, and they comped the dessert, plus gave us a $10 voucher for next time--very classy move, and saved the experience. 

I'll be back, probably not with the husband, but with my friends who are more adventurous!"}
{"text":"Been dying for the $5 cocktail deal lately and ended up taking a chance on lunch today, and it was glorious. I went for the tacos this time and while they ain't cheap, I wouldn't call them overpriced for the quality. The Pork Adovada, Braised Beef, and Crispy Fish were all scrummy (the latter two a bit more than the first), and the cucumber orange salad we ordered alongside was very near to perfect (they should cut the cukes a bit smaller). We also got the veggie burrito (whatever it's called) sans rice, and it was so frickin good, our eyes were rolling back in our heads. We were sweet talked into dessert and got the churros, a little too much sugar on them but they were so so good.

We got out of there for $42 bucks before tip for all of that and two happy hour cocktails. Very reasonable for such a flavor-packed meal, with succinct but personable, knowledgable, and speedy service, and of course the energetic atmosphere. I'll definitely start coming here more often."}
{"text":"My wife, and I went to your restaurant on 5/25/17 for lunch. My wife loves your tortilla soup and I feel the same way about your shrimp tacos. I loved those tacos so much I NEVER ordered anything else. My second favorite thing was your pinto beans. Whole pinto beans that taste like refried beans. We both equally love your chip salsa.  So imagine our DISAPPOINTMENT. Its 105 degrees outside. Inside it's comfortable but EVERY door in the restaurant is OPEN. There are no blowers on the doors so we are immediately swatting flies. Once the chips and salsa arrive it becomes a battle. It takes ten minutes to get the ice tea and we were never offered a refill thru the entire meal. Once the food arrives it becomes a take a bite of food and then swipe a fly ritual. My shrimp tacos are so over cooked even I notice. Trust me it takes a lot for me to not like any shrimp. As for my wife's tortilla soup, it isn't on the menu. My whole pinto beans are dry and taste like they just came out of a jar with a bunch of salt dumped on them. Last but not least. If you want a refill on the SMALL bowl of salsa and chips it'll cost you two bucks! We will not be returning. Best guess as to the \"fall\" of Joy Ride. New owners/management? They lost the original chef? We still don't get the \"every door in the place OPEN\". So, so sad."}
{"text":"I would've given this restaurant 5 stars, but the service was awful. The food is terrific, but we waited forever to get anyone to take our food order. Our drinks were served quickly, but we waited a long time to place our food order and then waited even longer for the food to arrive."}
{"text":"Between friends have been many times, always had a great experience until today, during lunch hour. Regardless of what happened their customer recovery was amazing (Preston at the bar) without being asked for."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great happy hour. I love the blood orange margarita. Every time I come in I try a different taco and always never disappoints."}
{"text":"I traveled from San Tan Valley to eat with my wife and son, also joining us was my buddy and his wife and son.  we first ordered drinks. the horchata was at best not what i would call horchata. we also ordered jamaica which they call hibiscus another disappointing drink .  the lemonade was ok. the salsa was failed attempt as was the chips.  four dollars for street tacos and no sides you have got to be kidding me. we decided to leave before we got ripped off, our bill for just  four drinks came to about $18.50. we will not return."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place. I love how vibrant the colors are, it has such a happy vibe. I went on a Friday during lunch and it wasn't crazy busy which is a plus! Service was great and the staff were friendly!"}
{"text":"I DON'T GET IT? This place was packed was everybody in there a first timer. The food not only was straight up bad but it is sooooo over priced! The service was just as bad as the food, you will dehydrate waiting for something to drink but don't order ice-tea unless you like fufu fruity flavors. When it finely did come I ask why he did not tell me that's the only flavor they serve? I was told no one has ever questioned it before WOW I guess it not questioned because your so thirsty by time it comes you will drink anything??? However my water did come out just in time for my ice cold food.. They get the 1 star from me for nothing but the atmosphere. But if you want a good Taco go ANYWHERE else!!!!!"}
{"text":"Saying that this restaurant sucks is probably the nicest thing I can even come up with! The food was boring but expensive. The soda was flat the entire night and our drinks would sit empty for 20 minutes before anyone would think to refill them.  The service was absolutely horrible and to top it off when we paid our bill the server also ran my card for someone else's meal. Instead of giving me a heads up that they made a mistake I found out the next day when balancing my check book.  When we contacted the restaurant to make sure that the transaction was canceled the manager told us he would call us back the next morning because they were very busy.  No big deal until the phone call didn't come. When we called back to follow up you could tell that the manager was annoyed that we were asking him to verify that the $70 transaction was canceled.  The least that could have been done was an apology but that never came! I will make sure that nobody in my family or group of friends ever return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and have never been disappointed. The beer battered fish tacos are the best around! The churros in chocolate are a must. They have a good beer selection and service has always been on point. We even came here with an infant a few different times and they even made special accommodations for us. I always find myself recommending this place to people!"}
{"text":"Negatives:
Hipster hangout. Looks like a 70's lounge. 
The Mexican mule does not deserve the name. It was a passion fruit cocktail in a regular glass with tequilla. No TACO TUESDAY deals! What kind of taco place does not do taco tuesday? Tacos were flavorless except the chicken tinga. 
Servers keep their phones in the retro ice chest at the front of the restaurant (weird, I know). 

Positives:
The Big Lebowski picture
Chips and Salsa"}
{"text":"Had the best customer service tonight at joyride.  I didn't even tell my waitress I didn't like my food. She asked me what can I get since you don't like your food. I said nothing I'm fine. Then the manager came out and said I'm not leaving till I ordered something else and it would be on them. I ordered some braised beef tacos and they were amazing. The customer service I had tonight was AMAZING.  They went out of there way to make me happy. Something that you don't usually get when you go out. Very impressed with there service."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The salsa that was served with the chips was actually spicy, which I have never experienced at any Mexican restaurant ever before. I ordered a Raspberry-Ancho margarita and the veggie enchiladas, both of which were absolutely delicious. I tried some of the carne asada from my friends beast burrito and enjoyed that as well. I wish there was one of these in California - favorite food spot in AZ so far!"}
{"text":"If I could eat their fried fish tacos every day all day I would!! I also really like the salsa they give you!!"}
{"text":"I didn't think there was anything special about the food, it's more about the atmosphere.  Off the bat got free chips n salsa.  I got 3 tacos and a side for about $14: chicken,  beef, fish with black beans.  Tacos were street taco size but they jammed it with plenty of meat.   Black beans tasted plain but probably made from scratch.   Also got the almond horchata which was good but didn't get a lot of it since they filled the glass with mostly ice.   For dessert, got the churro with chocolate... If you've never had the real churro from Madrid then it's pretty tasty.  Would I come here again?   Probably just to hang out with friends but not for the food."}
{"text":"Great food, great music, and bomb Chips and salsa
Only reason for not giving it a 5 star was the enchilada sauce tasted like it was from a can. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We have been huge fans of Joyride since they opened.  Today was disappointing.  They now charge for chip/salsa refills.  They added rice to the burritos as filler. Hoping they go back to what made it so good before the menu change last month."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are admittedly pretty good.  If your familiar with Chevys restaurants, the salsa is similar.
Avoid the ceviche, nothing more than shrimp, a little cilantro and jalapeno.  No marinade sauce, very dry.
The two types of fish tacos were ok,  they were not bad but they also did not stand out.  The fish wasn't extremely moist, nor was it dry.  I would call it unspectacular.
The most egregious was the $1.00 charge for a small ramekin of salsa.  Whats next, charging for ketchup, salt and pepper.
$10 margarita... Again, not great with booze volume despite previous review.
Simply too many other places that offer better value as well as better quality of food.  If you're a 25 something, this may be a hip enough place to plop on aFriday.  Other than that, search elsewhere."}
{"text":"I go here regularly on Tuesday's for \"Taco Tuesday\" and love it!  It is one of the best taco Tuesday values in central Phx.  A choice of $2 tacos plus signature margarita's for $5 all day, not just happy hour!  Regular happy hour is in place until 6:00P but on Taco Tuesday the taco's and marg's are on sale the whole time.  It gets crowded starting about 4:30P and stays busy the rest of the night.  People love good food and at a value so this place packs em in on Tuesday!  The staff is friendly and the outdoor patio is perfect right now.  I have been here other nights of the week too and always have good food and service, but Taco Tuesday's are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Service, food and drinks are all great here. Atmosphere is pretty trendy and the patio is great. Happy hour is before 5 each day."}
{"text":"Place looks awesome, has great music and great waiters. 
Menu is a little pricey. 

I got the Baja fish taco and cochinita pibil taco and they were both amazing! But small."}
{"text":"There were 11 of us yesterday.   It was Taco Tuesday and the place was packed. We were t old that it was a two hour wait. We waited outside in a very comfortable patio.   Larry the manager was very professional and awesome.   All our needs were catered to, he was on top of things and accommodated our our requests.
The rest of the staff was very friendly and patient. This is my fav places to go to and have always been happy with the ambience and service.
Management: Larry needs to be recognized and promoted.. He has what it takes to be in a leadership position.    Great customer service,friendly , aware of the restaurants workflow.
Thanks Larry and your crew."}
{"text":"We go here far to often.  The tacos and margaritas are so delicious! Awesome happy hour to boot! This place gets super busy,  especially on taco Tuesday,  And the staff always seems to keep on top of everything,  it blows my mind. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We went to joyride a couple of times over the past few weeks. The tacos are all pretty tasty. My favorite is the shrimp taco. We also tried the nachos and the guacamole. Both were quite tasty. The ambience of this place is pretty great as well. Nice open space. It can get pretty loud and crowded, especially on the weekends. All in all I think joyride is tasty and a fun place to eat. I'd go back for sure and would recommend it to most."}
{"text":"Today was my first time coming here and as soon as I walked in the door I was in love, beautiful restaurant great food but the service was horrible. I had to wait 10 minutes for a drink and had to wait another 15 to get asked what I wanted to eat. A table came in 10 minutes after we got here and got asked what they wanted to eat within five minutes of being there yet I had to wait longer than that for a sofa. Our server wasn't at all concerned with my table. Not to mention that it took another fifteen minutes for us to get cashed out because again, lack of concern."}
{"text":"over priced to start with, not traditional
Mexican food, more fusion style.  they poured the mole sauce on the chicken enchiladas and. green chili (salsa Verde) on beef enchiladas.. waiter didn't offer to fix....they used flour tortillas for the tacos so everything was soggy and had no crunch, also no heat it's like Mexican food for people from Iowa...Well margaritas were expensive and the tequila they used was awful."}
{"text":"Just tried this over the weekend. Went with a friend of mine and our tacos were yummy! Loved the hip/trendy décor. We each ordered three tacos to get the free side. I ordered the carne asadas and one Baja fish and a side of beans. She ordered one Baja, one chicken, and one shrimp and a side of orange cucumber salad. I loved my carne asada, the fish was fresh but I wish it was more tasty. She didn't like her chicken very much, liked the fish, but said the shrimp was the best. We both liked our sides - actually she loved her cucumber side! My side of beans was very generous and could have been split between both of us. Service was efficient, wish it was a little more friendly but can tell they wanted you in and out."}
{"text":"Great spot for a lunch or dinner date. I've had business meetings, beers, tacos,...whatever. the scenery is fantastic, close to a few other spots. The crowd is slightly sophisticated with zero pretentious fools. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and family"}
{"text":"Small and causal. Tacos are good. They have a liquor license. It gives you the sense of a fast food place because it's so small but you get a server."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night on the patio.  Only thing good were the tacos, but they came out luke warm.  Didn't want to say anything to waitress because we waited a long time for order to be placed and longer time for food.  Then they forgot the side of black beans I ordered, which they brought out And they were hot.   And it wasn't all that busy for a Sunday night and there seemed to plenty of staff."}
{"text":"Most everything is cooked in house making the options for dietary restrictions is easy to accommodate.  Nice selection of gluten free food. 
I live in florida and found joyride online and emailed them requesting information on gluten free options and the manager emailed me back with a very thorough and nice response. 
The staff was AMAZING, so friendly, wish I could frequent this establishment all the time!"}
{"text":"By far the worst dining experience- I will not be back.   First heard about this restaurant shortly after then opened thru coworkers who went for a work related dinner.  They had said both times they went the had terrible service.  I just assumed it was due to the large party and still wanted to try joyride as it had nice reviews and is always crowded.  Me and my boyfriend went on a Sunday night right at the dinner time rush.  We were greeted by the host who used her cell phone to check us in.  That was quick and efficient.  We were told it was a 20 min wait and were pleasantly surprised that we were taken to our table in about 10 mins instead.  When we sat down we were given water and then waited about 15 mins for our waiter who looked tired and worn out.  We ordered our drinks which took another 10 mins to come out (Diet Coke and iced tea) brought by another server.  We were rarely catered to by our server but rather many different people walking by.  We finally flagged down our server to order our tacos.  The quality of the tacos to be honest was subpar.  The food is much better at otro cafe or taco guild.  Ordered carne Asada and chicken Tinga.  The chicken Tinga had a piece of gristle in it and I had to spit it out.  Bland under flavored and over priced.  Next we had just finished when a third server came to clear our plates taking my dates napkin and fork and we told him we would order dessert.  Oh and prior to this we had to ask several times to get refills on our drinks and they kept forgetting my dates iced tea.  No apologies.  As the third waiter kept clearing he threw the fork and knocked it on my dates cell phone.  Once again no apology.  We ordered dessert and sat for 30 mins.  No new silverware was brought.  My date finally had to stand up and grab his own.  Apparently our dessert was forgotten about and again no apology.  We sat there after asking 3 times to get another iced tea (which never came) for we timed it 30 mins for our dessert we would of left.  No offer to comp the dessert no apology again.  Worst service ever.  I finally agreed with my coworkers.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Sorry this one is a miss.  Love Postino's and Windsor, but Joyride is not too good.  Food was really disappointing. Tacos were so average and service so so.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  I think I'll stay with America's taco shop."}
{"text":"Not as great as we thought. We had to wait about an hour which is not a big deal when you think they are as great as the reviews say. Ordered drinks while we waited for a table. Didn't get the drinks until about 5-10 mins before our table was ready. We still weren't complaining we knew they were busy. Our server was too busy to serve us so someone else helped us. It took about 30 mins to get our order in and 30 mins until we received our food. The shrimp tacos we ordered were burned to the point where you had a lingering after taste of charcoal in your mouth. They gave us another taco for free but the food was not as good as reviews made it sound. Maybe it was not a good night for them but we waited forever to get food that a hole in the wall place could have served in a fraction of the time. The staff was very friendly but the food was not good in my opinion. Very unlikely I will go there again."}
{"text":"Clint the manager was very helpful with me when i lost an item at the restaurant. This was great customer service."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Great place to take your friends. The music is on point playing trap/ real good hype stuff you can vibe to. 

The staff will treat you right and get you set right away and if anything is wrong they will not hesitate to fix it immediately and we had multiple staff members constantly checking in and I appreciate the customer service!

Our group went in late almost closing time and they took care of us as if it were any other time.

The Food is worth the trip as well -very delicious and well done, they have some pros cooking for them. A real gourmet taco that serves bomb a** carne asada (so my friend says-meets \"grandma\" standards)
And they have vegetarian options that they also made vegan for me. They were very accommodating with options and substitutions."}
{"text":"I went today for happy hour, my friends and I were less than happy. We ordered food that never came. I had one happy hour drink and the waitress asked my friend if she wanted another round and walked off without asking me, my drink was empty. Then 30 minutes pass and the server said \"oh did you not get your margarita\" to my friend. So we both asked for a drink then about another 30 minutes go by before we got our drinks and her response was \"I'll make sure you don't get charged double for your drinks\". Well I sure hope not! Then about 45 minutes to an hour pass with ZERO service, and another server stopped by asking if we were ready for our check. She cashed us out, we have no idea what happened to our server. One of the worst experiences I've ever had! Other people have told me that the service has become terrible there, but we gave it a shot anyways, bad idea! Myself and my friends all said we will never go back there again!!!"}
{"text":"I have one main criteria for rating any sort of \"mexican\" restaurant, and that is how they prepare the chicken.  Unfortunately, this place failed my test.  The chicken in the tacos merely tasted like chicken, and it was a sizable hunk of fairly dry breast that I had to chew through.  With all the stuff included in the taco, I still found myself reaching for the cholula  to give it some moisture and taste.  My tablemates had \"heat\" issues with the salsa that came with the chips and I have to admit I couldn't dunk as freely as I like.  A burrito ordered came smothered and I mean smothered in a green chili sauce (looked like typical salsa verde and not green chilis).  He had to scrape it all off.  So, the end result is I will probably not go back.  We were forced there by the huge crowd across the street at Postinos and apparently Joyride is owned by the same folks.  I guess if you charge high enough prices the undiscriminating crowd here in Phoenix will just assume it must be great.  Not me!"}
{"text":"Been going here since they opened.  Really great tacos. My favorites are the shrimp and braised beef. Food is definitely 5 stars but giving it 4 stars because I really wish I had one server when we went. All the servers help out each other which is nice but never quite sure who to ask for something when we need it. Everyone is super friendly and fast. This is definitely a great place to bring family and friends."}
{"text":"The yelp pictures are either deceiving or the cook that day did not make the rice correctly. I am a big rice fan and it did not taste very well. However, my family enjoyed their tacos and beverages. They did have really good chips and salsa though. It is worth to check out if you aren't picky about good rice. Cute inside decor but they play the music way too loud."}
{"text":"This is an awesome fun place with food you love to eat and come back to.   Our server Jackie was a Rock star!"}
{"text":"Came here again to see if anything had changed, Nope . Servers are slow and blame the bar for being slow , which we saw drinks waiting to be served by servers still at the bar.  I brought my aunt and friend , I feel bad for bringing them here. There is way better places in downtown phoenix to eat. Don't waste your time here, cause obviously they don't care about yours."}
{"text":"Awesome place - great food, drink, and service. 

I've had a bunch of their tacos, all very good choices, especially the pastor and crispy fish. Margaritas are also very good, especially for the long happy hours on Saturday afternoon when they are only $5. 

The place can fill up but service is usually pretty quick, kitchen's been fast every time I've been there.

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great spot to get a bite! The lunch special is such a deal, two tacos and a salad. The restaurant is so pretty and put together."}
{"text":"We ended up here after the place next door had an hour wait. They sold us on their $5 drinks but ended up staying for lunch. I got the chicken burrito which looked unassuming but was full of flavor and huge. My wife got the kale salad and it was awesome. We will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"This place was good. Nice bar. I enjoyed the open air seating while the weather is cool. The house chips and salsa were tasty. I didn't do a margarita, but my wife did. She got the blood orange which I tasted and it was tasty as well. She wanted the cucumber serrano, but she was unable because they didn't have the ingredients ready. That was kind of a bummer because she was talking about it before we got there.  We got the lunch special,  2 tacos and choice of soup or salad. I did the adobada and crispy fish tacos with one of their salads. Food quality and taste were all great. Good place to stop for lunch and a drink."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Joy Ride.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is great and the food is even better. I typically go in on the weekends and sometimes we have to wait a little bit to be seated but it is worth it.

The chips and salsa are amazing, and normally I go for the tacos. Crispy Fish is my favorite. Tortillas, batter, and sauces are so yummy.

My only complaint is that sometimes with their style of service (you don't have one particular server, they all kind of split zones and help out), you end up telling multiple people \"No, I don't need another refill\" or whatever the case is. But all in all, wonderful!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a conference and ended up at Joyride on a Tuesday afternoon. I was with a friend.   We had each had three of their $2 tacos. I had two chicken and one steak. They were incredible. Unlimited chips and salsa, banana pudding on Graham cracker crust with caramel sauce,  and $5 pitchers of Dos Equis completed our meal.   The best part of the experience was the service. Our water glasses never went below half and they brought me a new chilled glass each time I poured a beer. I will revisit Joyride any time I am here in the future. 

Btw, we took the train out from downtown and Ubered back. Easy trip and an enjoyable time. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Have been regularly coming back! Good modern Mexican food and good service. The enchiladas, tacos, and street corn are favorites. Also, Taco Tuesday is a great deal for trying new flavors. Usually a wait for the food, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the east valley! We've taken several friends here, and they have all loved it. Awesome veggie tacos, Mexican corn on the cob, and super fresh margaritas! Great service and system they have to get people seated & fed."}
{"text":"I've seen better street tacos and service at Taco Bell. This place is extremely overrated and your better off heading to one of the other restaurants in the area.  Very over priced for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing food, tasty drinks, and salsa that was to die for! I had the taco trio and was very impressed, chicken, pork, and grilled fish were all fantastic. The blood orange margarita was mouth watering and at $5 (even on a Saturday afternoon) it was a steal. Our server, Fransisco, was very knowledgable and got us very excited for the food. I enjoyed the large selection of tasty yet dairy free options - as a dairy free individual I find it hard to find a good variety of Mexican food that still tastes good without the cheese. But now I have since they use house made aioli in their yummy sauces! Can't wait to go back and try more heavenly creations!"}
{"text":"You let me down, Yelp!

For the first time ever, Yelp has been way off on this one. Like some of the other reviewers, I too am obsessed with Upward Projects restaurants. Which was why I was even more excited to see this new place getting great Yelp reviews. And as we walked in, the ambiance got my hopes even higher. Here's why we are never going back:

-Over 30 minute wait, and they don't serve anything but chips and salsa in the cocktail area. It was even more frustrating to see empty tables inside during the entire duration of our wait. Poor service on the patio.

-When we were seated, no one greeted us for 5-10 minutes. Very odd, a server finally came up and asked if we were \"still doing alright?\" Umm since we've been here for over 45 minutes, were ready to order. 

-Food came up quick but was mediocre at best. A beer I ordered when the food arrived wasn't brought until everyone was done eating. Attitude from the waitress when I sent it back. 

-At some point during our meal, a waiter approached us confirming he had given the card back from our tab on the patio. We told him he hadn't so he said he would look for it.

-While waiting for our bill, at least 4 people asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa. No, but wed like the bill! It finally came but the waitress didn't even make eye contact so we couldn't tell her they still had our card!!! Another 5-10 minutes we finally flag down another server and ask her to find our card. She brings it and takes it with the bill. Several minutes later we see her arranging a table for a large party and wonder where she put our bill. Then our waitress comes and asks where the bill is, and as were pointing out the other server a 3rd server drops it off. This place is certainly some kind of ride! What a mess. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My experience at joyride tonight was pretty disappointing. I am new to the area and had several recommend joyride to me. We were a group of 5 - 3 kids, 2 adults.  I knew that this was a busy restaurant and was not upset to have to wait about 30 min for a table, I was less happy to sit at our table for another 10 min or so before seeing our server. Our server was friendly and efficient but perhaps a little too busy, as she was pretty rushed every time she stopped at out table. 
  Our food came at strange intervals, kids food first, then our appetizer, then once the kids were pretty much finished my and my husbands meal came out. We split the 3 taco plate. 2 grilled fish tacos and one shrimp. Here's where things really went down hill. The fish smelled pretty fishy before the plate was even at the table but we thought maybe we were just being weird for some reason. Nope. The grilled fish in the tacos was definitely less than fresh and had a sour low tide kind of taste. We each took one bite and decided that it was a no go. Our server was great and took the plate right away and replaced the order with veggie tacos which came out in about 10 minutes. 
 I know the restaurant did everything they could to take care of the problem but by the time we got our new tacos our kids were bouncing off the walls and ready to go. The veggie tacos were just ok, the kids food was ok at best and the wait times were a little too much for me. Not to mention, how did no one in the kitchen notice the stink of the fish?!?
 Our server did comp the taco meal and offer us free desert, which was nice but this place did not live up to my expectation at all. Sorry joyride but I think I will be getting my taco fix elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a large group of friends celebrating a birthday. We were all riding bikes, this place is made for this. We sat outside, it was beautiful day. Had a couple pitchers of the Black Market beer. It was very good. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We have dinner and drinks last night, with friends. I would like to say our server Austin was excellent  and I believe the Manger (Chris) was very help full.
They both were spot on with there service.
The taco were great too!
Will be back again."}
{"text":"Love this place for ambience and good quality food. Food was fresh and I was able to find Vegan and Gluten Free options. What more can I ask for? Oh wait, house Salsa needs a little bit kick for another 1 star. Overall great experience and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Not bad for american-mexican food. Honestly it was a toss up between 3 & 4 stars.  I went with 3.  The veggie burrito was good with meat added but the tacos needed a little extra something......especially the fish taco.  I also didn't really care for the salsa, not bad but i expected more."}
{"text":"Went in January for my birthday lunch.Loved the laid back vibe, especially compared to Postino next door. Skinny margaritas was fantastic!!! Got a taco combo and split with the hubby crispy fish, baja fish and the standard side of black beans and a carnita taco. Would skip the crispy fish next time, beans were ok. Others were above average but the soft corn tortillas get messy fast so eat quickly. Another upward project success story."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and welcoming. Food is great and the drinks are consistently flowing! Everyone needs to come here."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The decor is beautiful but the food is bland. Disconnected service. Parking is a nightmare! The manager is very sweet and tried to correct everything from mistakes on our order to mistakes on our bill but the food isn't good enough to return."}
{"text":"As many others have posted, the chips and salsa were definitely DELICIOUS. I was shocked when I ordered a side of salsa for my entree and was told there would be a $2 charge for it? WTF?! The food was okay, my fish taco was fried beyond eating, but the carne asada was pretty good. Service and food to table after ordering was EXTREMELY slow, but the staff was friendly. Like the décor and location, not my favorite place in the world, but I didn't hate it. I'll give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"I order the chicken and beast burrito to go. Food is amazing but the service isn't. They forgot items in my order and when advising them of items missing nothing was done. They told me to come back after driving 30 mins there and 30 mins back. I prob won't be back."}
{"text":"The first few times we came here we were SO impressed and we were really looking forward to our last visit here. However, we were surprised with our extremely disappointing experience. 

The first problem started when we ordered our drinks, one didn't come, the others took forever to get, and one of the drinks (the mule) was overly sweet and gross. This was sad as we loved the drinks here prior to this visit.

The second problem we encountered were menu items we loved and came back for taken off the menu. No more delicious scallop tacos and no more roast chicken. Instead, we decided to try some new things and order the crispy fish taco we loved before. The fish taco came and it was fishy. Once again it took forever to get our food and some of it came out incorrectly. Of the things we tried we had the sidewalk dish which was just meh. 

The final problem is one I am just assuming to be the case. I think they may have taken the amazing chef that opened Joyride and moved him to the Phoenix location, but who knows. 

Not sure if we will be going back which is sad considering how much we loved this place when it first opened."}
{"text":"Loved the guacamole and the nachos! Great service! I sat outside with my friends and enjoyed the great food and beautiful desert weather."}
{"text":"It seems like they spent too much time focusing on the decor and atmosphere and forgot about the quality of the food. The decor and ambiance are stellar;however, Taco Bell does a better job than Joyride at food. The taco shells are all store bought and the food is uninspired at best. Store bought chips which were stale and a mainly raw flour tortilla on my Crispy fish taco. Additionally, the extremely overpriced shrimp \"ceviche\" appeared to use pre-cooked cocktail shrimp. 

Give this place a miss."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday....enough said. Their happy hour specials are much better than they originally had. The atmosphere is casual with a cool vibe. Most of the time I like the music, just not the 50's era. The staff is always attentive and friendly. They all let it be known they work as a team which is nice to hear, so you don't feel rushed to close out your check with one certain server. They have seating at the bar, inside, and the patio. The drinks and food are good. It's a fun place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed with the margaritas. DO NOT order one. They are $10 and small. But the worst part is the lack of tequilla . We don't mind paying $10 but you should feel a slight buzz after drinking it. There were 4 of us, I who hardly ever drinks. And everyone agreed that we felt nothing afterwards, hence , expensive drinks and no tequila"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!!  Over priced and very deceptive pics too!!!  Must have used a microscope to posts the pics because the tacos are only 3\" in diameter.  I ordered a taco and it arrived open faced, flat, and the diameter of my center palm!!!!!!  WTF!!!!  And it was almost $4!!!!!  Taco Bell is better prices, better tasting, and bigger portions too!!!!  Also, almost 99% of Mexican food restaurants DO NOT charge for refills on chips and salsa, yet I was told it would be $2 per refill on the chips and salsa!!  Tacky!!!  Service was very bad and lack luster.....  Probably because the music was so loud that communication cannot be heard.  Very bad if you are on a date!  Can't even hear or make out conversations--- I guess you are suppose to be an expert at lip reading.   I travel all over the continental US, and have never been to a more horrible Mexican food place such as this.  Hard to believe that they are focused on more fluff such as ambiance than substance ---FOOD!  The flour tortillas are so undercooked and bland tasting!!  Awful!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the food here. Enjoyed our meal at the Gilbert location when it opened and thought this location would be just as good when it opened, but it was super average. 

I will go to the other Postinos owned restaurants in the area before I come back here."}
{"text":"The ahi tacos were out of this world! I couldn't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place! Upscale enough to give you a comfortable environment on a date but also casual enough to call this your go to spot with friends or your family. The staff are all so sweet. From the girls at the desk trying to accommodate seating arrangements on a busy night to the waitresses that go out of their way to visit their repeat customers while managing their tables when they don't get to serve you. The fact they remember you gives you a warm inviting feeling. I've been going there for years so I've picked my favorite waitress but I don't always get seated with her so found other waitresses to be good too. Torí is by far my favorite, my whole family loves her. If you see this review, ask for Torí, you will have a warm experience. Tacos! Omg! You will love them but other people do too... make sure you give yourself enough time to eat and experience the place without rushing off to another location. Dinner time on Taco Tuesday is a bit of a wait. Why? Because people love it of course and I'm sure they'll agree with my review."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food, awesome atmosphere and wonderful service. Taylor was a great server. On top of everything, didn't have to ask twice. Very great server. I got two of The Standard tacos and one crane Assad taco. We went on Taco Tuesday where these tacos are $2 :) the civiche is soooo good! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Joyride since we are addicted to Mexican food in our family. We tried the Mexican street corn and it was delicious but the rest of the food didn't live up to the hype. I'd eat here again but I honestly suggest eating at another taco place downtown."}
{"text":"THE Sunday Funday Spot.  Great food, music and even Better service.  Shelby took fantastic care of us and introduced us to Chandler, her Manager who willingly set us up with reservations for 14 (booze cruise posse). Other restaurants around here won't take reservations!!!  The food is fresh and delicious.    We love the standard tacos, the salads are unique and full of flavor.  Their cucumber Serrano margarita is the best margarita I have ever had!  Their happy house specials are amazing."}
{"text":"Got a to go order there about 45 minutes before they closed. Had never eaten there but drive by it a lot. Got the 2 battered fish tacos and 2 carne asada tacos. Took about 20 minutes for a to go order and they weren't busy. 

I went straight home but found that the food wasn't warm. After biting in, I realized I probably should have heated it up. Not bad but not very flavorful. Overall ok and I'm not going to turn down tacos. They also forgot my side that was supposed to come with the meal. There is another taco chop nearby that I'm sticking with.  I will give them 5 stars for their churros though. I'm really picky about churros and these were great. 

I tried it which was my goal but I don't really see myself returning."}
{"text":"A must stop for tacos every time I'm in town. Not to mention those fabulous margaritas at happy hour."}
{"text":"Tacos are really good...when they have happy hour.  Otherwise kind of expensive.  Sides and drinks were awesome!  Outside seating and inside seating are both fun!  I think the fish tacos were my fave."}
{"text":"Packed and for good reason.. Went for taco Tuesday and great prices on a variety of tacos ($2) and margaritas. Best taco is carnitas, best margarita is the pear.. Just my humble opinion.

Great atmosphere and feels a bit like old town Scottsdale, except that the bartenders and staff actually give a crap about their patrons.

Come and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Joyride's Gilbert location started out strong on the burgeoning downtown Gilbert Main Street as one of the best places for trendy Mexicana in the east valley. My first experience there was phenomenal as I was given the full rundown of the menu and even a sample of some of their newer tacos. Since then, it has become a regular spot for myself and my Gilbert dwelling friends to enjoy an afternoon repast of beer and fish tacos. The atmosphere is great, the wait staff is friendly and attractive, and the music they play never disappoints. 

I give four stars rather than five however, because over the last year or so, some of their recipes have undergone some changes. To this day there are a few dishes that remain inconstant, and some of my personal favorites like their pulled pork torta have been removed altogether. 

Don't fix what ain't broke, joyride!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, good food, fun place to hang with friends."}
{"text":"Over priced food and drinks. Noisy atmosphere, and they are always trying to upsell you to buy more appetizers, drinks, etc. Unique food and drinks but nothing really that great. Won't be back. Perhaps it'll improve over time as I like the concept."}
{"text":"This place does have a nice atmosphere, but the fish tacos were average.  This is a nice place to grab a drink while waiting for a table at Postinos next door."}
{"text":"I ordered the Garden Variety Burrito and it was fantastic.  They are cool about leaving things out of the dishes if you have allergies, etc.  I appreciate that.  The vibe is great and everyone is very friendly.  We're thrilled to have it so close by.  Go Gilbert!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a second try after poor service the first visit. We were let down once again, so we won't be back. Food was lukewarm (veggie enchiladas), service was extremely slow (again)  and even though it is clearly noted on the website menu,  NO ARIZONA WINE. Too bad. Going forward  I will spend money on a real local first business."}
{"text":"Met some work friends for lunch. Wonderful atmosphere, great service, food really good (if a bit much on the salt). We liked their taco-Tuesday lunch special and that you can have burritos in a bowl. I had the machaca burrito in a bowl. Tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent team service even while waiting for a table outside. Overall on pricey side for what it is, music is loud, chips are on heavy side, carnitas and carna asada overpoweringly spicy hot for my taste. Other 4 at my table said 6 out of 10 overall."}
{"text":"Unacceptable cold food and strange service model. Went to Joyride for dinner with my young children, wife and mother in law on Sunday night at 6:30. We were seated promptly in a booth, which was nice.  Friendly waiter introduced himself and took our drink order. Ordered mild guac with no chilis for the kids. Different server brought drinks and another brought guac with lots of sliced jalapeños on top. Had to pick them out. Thankfully no chilis in the guac so we didn't say anything. We waited 30 more minutes for the entrees to come out. Much like other reviewers, different person brought us each couple plates and drinks - very strange. When the entrees finally came the food was cold. I almost never complain or send food back. But when the Mexican corn came (arrived before the entrees) it was cold. We took a bite and asked to send it back. We asked someone who wasn't our server but hadn't seen him so didn't wait (entrees still not arrived so even more strange we were receiving a side so long before entrees). Grilled corn on the cob shouldn't be cold. I don't mean room temp because they plated it too early before they brought it to our table - it was clearly prepped/cooked some time long ago, refrigerated and then brought to us without re-grilling or warming for us. It was actually cold. The person we spoke with agreed and brought back another cold piece of corn. Not sure if it was the same one but it was clearly cold too - not even warmed. Irritated at this point. Then the entrees arrived. The braised beef taco was the same - not just room temp but was literally refrigerated cold, chilly to the touch. Cold beef in a supposedly warm dish is completely unacceptable. Fried fish taco was crispy but room temp at best. BTW - I understand how restaurants work. I don't expect them to be braising new beef in real time just for me. But if you're going to make it yesterday and serve it to me today, warm it in a pan/on a flat top or even put it under a heat lamp... something!!  At least pretend to serve freshly prepared food! Grilled shrimp in the shrimp taco was the same - clearly cooked some time very long ago and then topped for us but not even remotely warm.  After waiting so long and being served inedible entrees, the kids were tired and we were irritated and weren't going to wait any longer. We spoke with the manager and asked him to please give us some fresh, warm food to go - we were there for nearly an hour and we had had enough. I understand that lots of people like the cheap taco Tuesday deal at this place... But this was a really disappointing experience. Be warned. If you're not going for cheap drinks and drunk food, beware... You may get some very modestly re-heated corn and cold meat tacos.  This experience was all the more disappointing because we are huge fans of Postino and Churn. This was a fail from start to finish."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here last week. Loved everything! Sat at the bar and was planning on having a margarita only and then moving on to another venue for dinner (Federal Pizza which is next door). The bar is situated by the open kitchen and once we saw food walking past quickly changed our plans and started ordering food. So glad we did!  Started off with the ceviche, loved every bite. Next we ordered the Lola salad, was savory and light. I was pretty full but my guest suggested we order a round of tacos. My 2 personal favs were The Standard and The Veggie (white magic is magic!)  Excellent food, impeccable atmosphere and stellar service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best drinks!  Love the Strawberry Aqua Fresca. Tacos are Yum, fish and chicken are my favorite.   Guacamole  is worth adding ."}
{"text":"Bailey hooked us up with all the right tacos and they were delicious! Love all the Upward joints but Gilbert is on point for taco Tuesday, literally ordered a taco and it hit the table in less than 2 minutes. What whaaaat. Big ups y'all."}
{"text":"Plan on taking ear plugs so the concert style music does not make one deaf. Forget having any conversations unless you use sign language . The staff is helpful but it wasn't their fault the the fried fish tacos were not a big hit. The fish was strong and smelled before arriving at the table, and were over cooked. The shrimp tacos had no flavor, but I find that everywhere. The beef ones were good and the black beans .
After going to Tacolicious in San Francisco nothing in Phoenix really stands up to what they should taste like."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and prices! Very quick to get your food out to the table and accommodating for children. Only thing is that it is difficult to tell who works here because of the lack of uniform and instead of having one server you seem to just get helped by whoever is around which is a little confusing. All around great place though. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have gone to Joyride couple of times with my bf and it's always an amazing experience. The salsa is a very good start (the best salsa i ever had i guess). I ordered 3 different kinds of tacos and all are fantastic in their own rights. The staffs are friendly and accommodating too.. We will go visit again for sure"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a pretty lovely dinner at the bar. We walked up and the wait for a table was 50 minutes, but the bar is first come first serve and we magically found two seats next to each other at 7:30 on a Saturday night. Kismet. 

The bar is big and comfortable, a wrap-around that's probably big enough for 30 people. My only complaint is there wasn't a place for my purse, I would love a hook for it underneath the bar. Our server was attentive and we got a smaller pitcher (about 2.5 beers) of good beer for $7, which I thought was a pretty stellar deal.

The complimentary chips and salsa came out hot and spicy. The salsa was good to me, I love cilantro and smoky heat and it delivered. I ordered three tacos, the standard, carnitas and tuna, and also got the refried beans. It was all delicious, from the tortilla to the toppings! My favorite was honestly the standard - it was the quintessential street taco. Delicious marinated chicken with smooth avocado and a great pico on top. 

I'd definitely recommend it, and we'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Service was FANTASTIC - and the food was very good. Had the chicken burrito as an Enchilada- delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's a cool atmosphere and fun to meet friends for drinks after work. The food is pretty average though, the tacos weren't as good as many other Phoenix places."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The wait time is usually pretty long but definitely worth it (for those tacos!) and you can always buy a beer while you wait. Environment is great and the people work as a team there. Bartenders are cool as shit and always stay on top of their people! Always enjoy going back!"}
{"text":"Multiple varieties of tacos, carne and standard chicken are the best. Their happy hour is great and the drinks are even better. Service is fast and friendly. nice outside seating as well."}
{"text":"This spot is where it's at when it comes to tacos! The staff really makes it a point to provide good quality service, the location is perfect for a quick stop for lunch and the carne asada burrito is a good choice to start off with."}
{"text":"Came here for a few drinks with a group of friends and it ended up not being just for drinks. 

Elotes! Elotes! Elotes! What else can I say? On the menu it's called \"Mexican Street Corn\" which it pretty much is. Back home we say elotes...

We also ordered their \"Churros Con Chocolate\" which was so tasty! Great amount of hand-sized churros and a chocolate dip, what more can you ask for? 

Their beer selection was great and for you cocktail lovers, their Aguas Frescas are amazing. I only tried my friend's (I'm a beer girl) and you have an option of \"no booze\" or \"con booze\". Definitely get with booze for a good time!

I only gave them four stars because of the service. They got slammed with a large group of bicyclists and rarely checked in on us. It took about 10 minutes for a drink order after being sat and 15+ minutes just to get a food order in. 

Sit outside. Take in the outdoors and enjoy the scenery of it all. 

P.S.
Did I mention they have adobada tacos? I haven't seen that on a menu unless I was in San Diego. Definitely trying that next time!"}
{"text":"Soooo, I made the trek out to Gilbert to give Joyride a whirl and I am pleased to say that my gasoline was not wasted. Everything was fantastic! The atmosphere is cool and the staff were completely helpful and friendly. We arrived for an early dinner and were initially blown away by the street corn and the ceviche. They were so fresh and damn near a complete meal all by themselves. But I was not to be cheated out of some meat (and no, fish does not qualify as meat).

For our entrees we ordered the Beast burrito along with three street tacos (carnitas, short rib and carne asada). The carne asada was flavorful and moist - so unlike the tire rubber you get from other places. The carnitas and short rib were also awesome. We rounded out the meal (and ourselves) with vanilla pudding and I almost had tears in my eye it was so freakin good.

We shoveled everything back and doused it with some Cucumber Serrano mixed drinks along with a Corona - the coolest looking 32 ounce beer bottle I have laid eyes on in some time. So tasty. 

The patio looks amazing (although I can't say that I even contemplated braving the 112 degree temperatures when we were there) and should be stellar when the weather creeps down. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was one of the lucky attendees at the Devour event this past weekend (which was awesome) and had this awesome taco. That's how it all started. A simple fish taco that blew me away. I visited the original Joyride Taco Shop out in Gilbert several months ago when they first opened but it fell off my radar. How silly of me. 

So one taco was not enough and I found myself up the street after Devour closed up shop and I definitely was not disappointed! What an incredibly beautiful restaurant! Chowed down on the Chilaquiles - enjoyed some cucumber mint aqua frescas (with vodka - so cool that they offer it with your choice of spirit), ate way too many chips, and shuffled into a cab that the staff was more than happy to call for me. The service was stellar, the food was amazing, and the ambiance after the weekend rain was incredible. (I still can't believe that I ate an entire meal after Devour - my waistline definitely does not thank me. Ahh gluttony . . . .)"}
{"text":"Food was a little more than okay but not great. The happy hour drink and tacos cannot be beat. The service is great as well."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos and food, a little expensive though. Can get crowded and loud. Would be a good place for a group of hearing impaired people that can communicate through sign language. Which I actually did witness there when I went."}
{"text":"After dining here recently and loving both the food, drinks (margaritas!! yumm!), and service, we decided to hold a small gathering here for my sister's baby shower. I can't say enough about how accommodating the staff was. I called a couple weeks in advance to reserve space on the patio. Even though we only were planning to have appetizers for the group, they bent over backwards to make us feel welcome. When we arrived today, our patio was rained out and they worked hard to get us a table inside. When we saw that things outside had dried out and asked to move, they cheerfully helped us get set up outside and moved all of our cups, plates, gifts, etc. for us. The food was amazing and the guests were very complimentary. I'm not sure what other people who complained about the food were ordering. I've had most of the appetizers and have sampled many of the tacos now and can say that they are all delicious. Perhaps some people have different flavor expectations and aren't ready for the unique spin on each of their dishes...but that's what I personally like about the menu. I mean, who knew almonds BELONG in chili rellenos?"}
{"text":"I was recently invited to a gathering here which I was thrilled about due to many great experiences at joyride. We sat on the patio near the beautiful fireplace ready to enjoy our fall evening with friends.  I'm loving the music here!

Our server was Trevor and he repeatedly let us down through the evening.  He was super slow to take orders and we had been sitting quite a while before he welcomed us or even took drink orders. When ordering, I inquire if they have Chambord.  He does not know but says he will check- he takes all the drink orders and when everyone gets drinks around us we do not see any for us.  When he runs by a few minutes later I ask \"no Chambord?\" Which he gives me deer in the headlights... I'm like \"just give me the house margarita!!\"  The guy next to me gets his 2nd margarita before I get my first. He does finally explain the bar is backed up- but still takes no ownership or makes any apology.  A simple \"thank you for your patience\" would have made a world of difference.  Just the servers knowing what spirits and liquors they have in stock would be great!!!!!!

The nachos were quite good as well as the chicken, crispy fish, and shrimp tacos.  Unfortunately the rice & beans came out way after the tacos were eaten. 

Of course when it comes time to pay trevor tries to give me card to some random guy... Who tries to give a card that says Samantha to a guy? 

Trevor is a lackadaisical finger pointer with the memory of a goldfish.  As a business manager I would not have him interacting with clients."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by...everything. 

Short wait for a table of 6, drinks while we waited. I was impressed by the salsa, I think it had jicama(?) as did the guacamole. 

Tried 2 different agua frescas (cucumber mint with gin & horchata with amaretto) both delicious & $5 on happy hour. The taco combo (3 tacos + 1 side) is a lot of food. Tried the shrimp, carne asada, and some chicken one...the shrimp was my favorite. 

I was very pleased by how clean and decorative the inside is, the staff is friendly, and of course delicious food. 

Will definitely come back. I'm craving a Mexican mule now..."}
{"text":"Holy amazing food batman!  We usually get the tacos and they never cease to amaze!  Our favorite tacos in order are: Crispy Fish, Braised Beef then Shrimp.  We had these the first time and loved them so much, we end up getting them every time we go! The margaritas are also amazing!"}
{"text":"Love that Gilbert AZ is coming up in the world. When I moved to Chandler, 6 years ago, finding a decent local restaurant was a pipe dream! Now we have Postino and Joyride. God bless Craig DeMarco and Lauren Bailey for bringing us these restaurants. Love the hipster atmosphere, margaritas, fresh agua frescos, crispy fish taco, THE FILA SALAD, and don't event get me started on the churros. Btw, if you ask, they will bring you fresh caramel for the churros and you will pretty much think of nothing else for the next 3 days."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The girls had too many tables which made them nonexistent, been here before and it was the same way. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times now and I have had a good experience every time so far. The service is good and the tacos are tasty.

To anyone who doesn't eat meat - the vegetarian taco is so flavorful and delicious!!!! Order a couple of these and a beverage ;)

I love how they fresh squeeze all their juices and the happy hour is a great deal. I recommend the fresco drink with fresh pineapple juice and tequila."}
{"text":"The food is nice. I found the portions to be rather small. The salsa and chips were fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is cute. This is more of a bar with tables, at least it seemed so the Friday lunch I ate there. The noise level was way to high for me. A table next to ours complained but I did not notice any change"}
{"text":"The service was good from checking in to paying our bill. Loved the open feeling even while sitting inside. Food and drinks were excellent and priced well. All in all a great experience and will be coming back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Hmm, I am kind of torn on this one. Big thumbs up to Upward Projects for the renovation on the building. The vibe and the decor are top notch. I only wish the food matched the building. The drinks are very good - Blood Orange Margarita was very good. Also, a few good Mexican beers on the menu. As for the food, I was not really impressed. The nachos were okay, but not great. The ceviche was overwhelmed by the lime. I had \"The Beast\" burrito enchilada style. It had an underlying sweet taste that was simply unappealing.

I am sure that there are great things on the menu; however, the items on that picked would not be on that list. 

N*joy"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!
Never a bad time or meal!!
Want good food, atmosphere, location, price and laughs?
This is where you need to be then."}
{"text":"MUST GO AGAIN!!!! Most awesome fish tacos! Happy Hour includes taco, guacamole, & drink specials! Wait staff was great - they all helped each other bring food & drinks out! Audra was SUPER!! Atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"I love Joyride Taco!  Their tacos and Mexican street corn are the bomb!!  Everything is delicious here!  I love their outdoor patio that's dog-friendly.   I've always gotten great service here, as well. Everything is very fresh.  We eat here often."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, I don't know what the hype, on any level is about. My family and I went there this evening as a recommendation as one of the top 5 places in Gilbert, hardly! Our food was cold, my Sons soda was flat after two tries of two different kinds and it was still on the bill, the waitress reached right across my face mid bite to take my Sons plate away, the portions were ridiculous for a $5.00 street taco, the carne asada taco tasted like it should have been a hawaiian taco, the shrimp tacoâ?¦..what shrimp, the guacamole was bland, the chips were stale, the margarita was weak, the beans were runny, the grilled vegetables were cold with a blob of tomato paste thrown atop; the meal all around for a family of 4 @ $80.00 was HORRIBLE!!! We will never ever go back. Disappointing and unsatisfied is a mere understatement."}
{"text":"Love this place for their Elote, it is delicious.  I was in the mood for tacos so we went to Joyride.  Parking is valet unless you park on the street.  We sat at the bar and our bartender was great. I had an horchata with almond milk and bourbon and a little nutmeg, pretty fun since I cannot enjoy eggnog.  I also had a cucumber/mint agua fresco with gin, also very good.  We ordered a quesadilla for appetizer, just plain cheese and that was also very good, nice and crispy on the outside and melty gooey on the inside.  Then I had the tacos and my husband ordered the enchiladas.  That is where it went south.  My  tacos were barely warm, and that is not good with fish or shrimp tacos.  The enchiladas were no bueno either, very little sauce or cheese.  I only gave three stars because we had good service and I should have said something but I didn't."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. Only one veggie option though. Margarita was yum as well. 
I give 4 stars because for a teeny tiny bowl guacamole they charged $8! 
Go on Tuesday, and don't order guacamole. It's totally worth the long wait."}
{"text":"Fantastic all around. We're in town for a week and we went twice. The $5 margaritas and pitchers for happy hour are a great deal, that's even before you get to the food. Had tacos, queso and burritos and they were all top notch. The place has a great vibe. We might be back for a third round later this week! Service was friendly and prompt both times we went."}
{"text":"I went here on Friday afternoon with my friends after just landing in AZ from NY. We sat outside and braved the Arizona heat. Our server was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. A total plus was that it happened to be happy hour! $2 tacos and $5 pitchers. What's strange is that a pint of beer is $6 but $5 for a pitcher during happy hour, so I clearly had to go for the pitcher. I ordered the crispy fish tacos. The breading was delicious but I wasn't too keen on the fish used inside. Overall a great experience and I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We come here every Sunday for the best \"high roller\"margarita in town.  The service is always A plus, music is great and the food is delish!!!  YeeHawwww!!"}
{"text":"Everything here was great! Very cool spot, cozy but big enough that we didn't have to wait for a table on a Saturday night. Chips and salsa were addictively delicious and wait staff was unbelievably attentive with refills. Our server was great, very knowledgeable about the beer selection and other good places to check out in the area (since we are out-of-towners). All the tacos we tried were delicious, and the churros were great, definitely recommend adding the caramel dipping sauce. Would absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Waited while there were open tables, waited for our server. Chips and salsa ok. Main dishes terrible. Fish taco was garbage, shrimp taco - shrimp under cooked or rancid. Beast burrito not so good.  Everything else was not really edible... what is the draw? Service was weak. We left feeling fairly irritated. When you pay for a meal with your hard earned money a person deserves more. Get your act together Joyride!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place today.  We've attempted to come a couple of times but were deterred by the two hour long wait.  We went in today (a Saturday) at about 4:45, and there was no wait!  The tacos were really good.  We especially liked the fish taco and the braised beef taco.  The ahi taco was not impressive at all.  The guacamole was pretty good... not amazing but good.  Drinks were good.  Loved their salsa that comes when they seat you.  Very fresh!  I'd definitely go back, but I would never wait two hours for it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Attentive staff, always thoughtful and great service and food. A definite must! I can always count on a good experience here!!!"}
{"text":"Not too bad. I was gifted a night out from a friend who raved about the food here. We brought extra money since we planned on having a few drinks (we can walk there), but didn't need it. $40 fed us both, with appetizers, dinner, drinks, and dessert. I think they have a weird wait staff situation going on, because they all seem pretty flighty, running around all nilly-willy and bothering other tables. Maybe it was just busy, but I prefer to have less people interrupting as often. My table was overly taken care of by everyone but our waitress, who disappeared as soon as we paid the check. I expected a pretentious hipster vibe, but I think they did a nice job with this place, it's more eclectic than that. There's a very peaceful feeling under the trees and in the open air. That get's lost when the chatter of nearby tables becomes yelling to hear over the music. So, if you're like me, go on an off night and sit on the patio, look into the trees, and have a relaxing dinner. It's an A-OK place to be, and sometimes that's exactly what you need. **I've removed my comments on the Cucumber Salad as they have removed the Cucumber Salad from the menu**"}
{"text":"I have come here many times as I live right down the street and it is solely because of the food. Everyone is friendly but every time we dine here whether its busy or slower it takes forever for anything. To take our order, getting our drinks, getting our order, our check etc. I don't seem to have this problem at their other neighboring establishments just Joyride."}
{"text":"Seriously good Happy Hour spot!  Lunch specials are amazing, and only $10 which was more than enough to fill me up.  Friendly and attentive staff - even when the place is packed."}
{"text":"The food is good- the prices are only good on taco Tuesday but even then it's not really worth the wait. Didn't quite understand why we had to wait as long as we did (1 hour) when we walked past 8 empty tables before being seated outside. We did say we were fine with first available, but there were 4 or 5 open tables inside. There were plenty of open seats and still people waiting"}
{"text":"We visited this taco place in pursuit of amazing Mexican after a recommendation from a friend.  I ordered the cucumber Serrano margarita, a chicken taco, & a fish taco which also arrived with chips and salsa.  It was all delicious.  The tacos were small but complex in flavor with layers of melt in your mouth meat, tangy sauces, and other toppings like fresh avocado.  The margaritas were a bit pricey - but had a good kick and good ice ratio.  My fiance ordered beer and they were happy to provide some beer samples.  The service was really good as well - our drinks were never empty.  I was told this location is very busy, and we arrived before 5 p.m. and the bar was full and we had to wait 5 minutes for a table.  Not a big deal, but couldn't imagine at a peak time.  Great place for tacos!"}
{"text":"They sell Mexican food and have Star Wars posters on the wall, so they're off to a good start with me.

Service is outstanding here. When I sat at the bar, they were very quick to keep my water glass full.

Their tacos, drinks, and ceviche are all tasty and well made. The carne asada taco is a little on the spicy side, so be ready for it.

I have enjoyed both times here, and I'm sure I'll come back for more."}
{"text":"We tried it, liked it but probably won't return. I found the margaritas sour, the blood orange one too sweet, the chips too thin, the experience fair. Loved the outdoor space and the service was excellent... thus the three stars."}
{"text":"So came here because searching for Food Trucks in the area this place came up.  It isn't a food truck and is your average bar.  Seemed like a busy place however if you're not interested in hooking up and getting wasted then the staff might blow you off.  Food is average and drinks are really expensive I'm not from the area so maybe pricing is part with the community its but I felt portions on tacos and drinks were not price appropriate.  On another note if you're looking for something sweet Creamistry is right around the corner and really good.  If I'm in town earlier in the day I'd give them another shot I know it was a busy Thursday night and I was just in for a quick bite but got horrible service."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed brunch here last Sunday. The food was good, we really enjoyed the tortilla chips with ceviche. The drinks were fresh and tasty. I would highly recommend trying Joy Ride if you have not yet checked them out."}
{"text":"Shelby was awesome.  It was our first time there.  She recommended the perfect sides and tacos.  Definitely will be back. They had us at 5 dollar pitchers of beer ."}
{"text":"I was simply craving a fish taco when my husband recommend this new place he drove by the other day.  I love the food and cannot get enough. As such I am willing to pay $4 for a taco. The guacamole alone will keep you coming back night after night. 

I can not bring myself to eat inside as the facility is cramped and SO LOUD.  We always enjoy our visit on the patio.  I really enjoy the weekday staff, who are so professional and willing to help."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the tacos which were moist and awesome. My cucumber mint water came out a tiny bit after the food and the manager (? I only assume) said it was on the house because it came out late. Totally awesome service. We were very pleased. Plus we needed a really quick meal and they delivered despite being really busy. Thanks Joyride!"}
{"text":"I went to Joyride with a friend and we were blown away by the customer service and food. The mojito we had was delicious and the tacos were incredible. The crispy fish taco was my favorite. Go as soon as you can! It's right next door to Postino's East which is also outstanding. Both owned by same owner."}
{"text":"Love this place, great decor, food - while not traditional Mexican, is very tasty and reasonably priced as are the drinks.  We stopped in the first time just for drinks and they kindly gave us chips and salsa and kept giving us more and the service was very attentive. Close to the light rail grid for easy transport. I feel like I am on vacation even though I live here so they have succeeded in my mind!"}
{"text":"Joyride makes up for some inconsistency in flavor profiles with a super cool ambience, friendly and capable service, and reasonable pricing.  Some of the tacos we ordered were well-seasoned and flavorful, and others slightly bland - the shrimp could have been fresher.  The nachos were to DIE for, but the side of pinto beans was heavily over salted.  

The setup is open with a hip and inviting color scheme that speaks to the casual and laid-back vibe.  There is a sizable bar with interesting drinks (aguas frescas) which are all spike-able.  

The hostess was probably the friendliest person I've ever met and servers were definitely capable and friendly.  A little more work on food consistency and this place would easily earn a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. Ordered 2 shots of patron and asked for a pineapple back...no pineapple...pickle back? No pickle..orange juice? I gotta go hunt in the back for it..never mind, 2 coke backs..okay..guy pours us 2 full flat cokes...gives us our bill with no thank you or have a nice day..charged us $3 a soda...umm really? $30 tab for 2 shots of patron ? Never going back!!"}
{"text":"I was waiting to try this new spot so I finally did.

As you can tell, I'm not a fan.

I'm not a hater nor a guy who has a bad experience and opens an account just to trash a place. So this is my opinion based on my visit:

Service: Pretty bad. It was like a bizarre play with two waiters who didn't know what the other was doing. Things like one bringing more salsa and the other asking if we wanted more salsa. Or one took off to the kitchen after taking the order and the other showing up asking if we were ready to order. Awkward. 

Decor: This is probable the only highlight of the place. Nice decor, different flare, pretty interesting artwork on the walls.

Ambiance: The music was super loud, the light was extremely soft (flashlight recommended) and the music playing was hideous. But come on, everything starts with the name. Joyride? Really? AYFKM? What has that to do with a mexican restaurant? The wheels on the wall might give the feeling of a joyride to nowhere.

Food: The only dish that barely approved was the beet salad (not that mexican, though). The cochinita taco uneventful (plus it's a huge pet peeve for me that restaurants use names to call dishes that have nothing to do with the real thing). Carne asada taco, meh, plus the tortilla was breaking and everything was falling apart. The street corn was a tragedy packed with butter. I tried the strawberry fresh water wich was actually pretty good although super sweet (maybe ordering one and water it down would be the right way to go). The almond horchata, same thing with the cochinita. They label something with a name that is so far away from the real thing that it doesn't make sense at all. The rice was also gooey and hard (not well done and it seems that they were stirring it while cooking)

Price: OMFG, are you kidding me now? 3.50 for a taco? And that's the less expensive one. Everything is super expensive specially for what you get.

Sorry to the team who brought this concept but there's a lot of work to do if they want to be there for the long run."}
{"text":"Third time I have been in the past month, sad to say it will be my last. Poor service, long wait, dirty tables. When we finished our food we had to wait for over 20 min for someone to come back over. The waitress stated that she could not run our card due to her family being in town??? Yup, that's what she said! Another girl came ran our card and gave me a box to box my own food. Now the server that stated she could not run my card was able to come over to grab the tip though. Great food! It's just a shame that the service is going down.

A manager by the name of Brad has since contacted me. He stated that he working on correcting the issue. I appreciate the fast response, maybe give them another try next month?"}
{"text":"Great team service style! Kind of ridiculous that they charge for salsa. But it's good! The tacos are tiny but packed with great flavor! Every time we go to JR we always say \"why don't we come here more often!\" IT IS GOOD... EVEN THE $10 House Margherita is good!! Love their fresh Mexican Slaw!  Expect to pay $50 for 2 people for dinner including 1 margarita each...  it's all good & trendy..... just spendy for tacos."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Taco's!  Two-words of advice: Queso Fundido."}
{"text":"Lunch there yesterday was a big disappointment !  I ordered the  three taco carne asado  with a side salad of cucumber and oranges.  The meat in the tacos contained so much gristle that I couldn't chew it.  I gave one to my husband and he agreed. The salad was a bowl of oil & vinegar with cucumbers and canned mandarin oranges, the tiny ones not AZ sliced oranges, floating in it. Twice my husband asked the wait staff for a coffee refill; it never came.
We'll not go back!"}
{"text":"Good service the food is delicious I went with a party of 7 and everyone LOVED the food and let me tell you they are picky especially when it comes with street tacos the asada is nice and juicy with lots of flavor fry fish tacos are by far the best I have had carnitas delicious juicy I would definitely be back and plus $2 tacos Tuesday 2pm-close"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I took a friend here for a little birthday celebration and we had a great time! Staff here is so friendly and sweet and I don't know how they could improve. Just super! It was Taco Tuesday and all were pretty good. They have their own twist on fresh Mexican cuisine. Their Margaritas were killer. One in particular stood way out. It is the Cucumber. Fresh, smokey, and balanced. Just great. Will be back to try more of menu. Churros were delish too. Nice vibe. Demographics were across the board which makes for excellent people perch spot too. Will be back. 
UPDATE:  The food is inconsistent.  Went back on Friday and the steak burrito was grisly and bland. They swapped for a chicken and that was bland and sparse meat...all for 12 bucks...drink here, but food needs help."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch yesterday. The atmosphere is awesome and our server was friendly and attentive. The food was the best!!!  Tacos were all awesome. I can't wait to come back try them all.  Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"The best Taco Tuesday ever. Seriously great veggie tacos - though the 'white magic' is too much, they are amazing without it! Also amazing guac served with fresh jalapeños on top. Awesome staff and a laid back vibe. Authentic, not so much, but healthy and delicious, yes!"}
{"text":"We recently had a late night light dinner at Joyride. The combination of great food and service made our evening. We enjoyed the variety of the Tacos to choose from and the fresh sides were a hit with everyone. My favorites were the shrimp tacos and the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Great vibe service was excellent my wife and I had Mexican street corn to start. And it was amazing, followed by happy hour tacos. At $2 each the tacos are good size and they are not skimpy on the meat which is always good. Drink specials are really good I had a house Margarita  also once again they aren't skimpy on the  tequila. Overall great place to chill I'll  definitely be back."}
{"text":"Joyride has been a staple in our Lyft driver community! The food is great and has been able to accommodate our large group on many occasions with ease! We all appreciate your excellent service. I enjoy all of your other restaurants as well!"}
{"text":"Service is great very clean environments food very good salsas are excellent.If I could give it a 4.5"}
{"text":"The food is great for vegetarian, dairy/gluten free options. Fish, vegetables, shrimp and grains, all good stuff. The best Horchata in the valley!

The service is a bit touch and go.
That being said, I've been here before with a guest and we were completely ignored after ordering a drink and being seated. We got the drink and were left with our menus for over twenty minutes. We left cash on the table and left completely unnoticed... this has also happened to me once before on a busy weeknight. 

I come here at least once a month since DT Gilbert is in my neighborhood and I appreciate a place where it's easy to find foods that I can eat on this menu!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent Joy Ride.  The waits are often long for a table but we're usually lucky enough to find a spot at the bar.

We've never been disappointed with the food.  Most of the time, it's really good and occasionally, amazing.  The house cocktails, while not classic, are good in a spiked fruit juice kind of way.

The atmosphere is awesome.  Bustling but not overly loud.  When the weather is nice, the patio is a nice option.  The music is right in my wheelhouse.  

Prices are fair and sometimes a bargain.  For instance, they do a 32 ounce pitcher of draft beer for somewhere around $7.  The beer selection, while not terribly craft-centric, has a few good choices, i.e. Dale's."}
{"text":"3.5* would be more accurate. But, consistently good service pushes this over to 4 stars. Overall, a staple casual place for a quick dinner or happy hour.

The good:
- Quick, efficient service.
- Food is above average - and relatively inexpensive.
- Cocktails are average - nothing that'll blow your mind (or taste buds).
- Desserts are acceptable.

The not-so-good:
- Weekends and busy evenings may result in spotty service.
- Beer and wine menu/selection is not very extensive - but, then again, this is a taco place.
- Place tends to be a bit loud - but, then again, this is a super-casual place."}
{"text":"Come for lunch! $5 pitchers two tacos and small salad lunch special! Try the chard habanero salsa if you dare."}
{"text":"Came with with my girlfriend and our dogs, as there is a large dog-friendly patio.  I loved the location & look of this fun, festive, trendy lil spot. The music was great, lots of Dr. Dre, Snoop, & a whole bunch of other 1990's rap that made me feel like it was 1996 all over again.  

Now, the food itself was not super impressive, but there were some items that really stood out.  Personally, I would suggest the chilled ahi-stack,  the cheese y mas, and the Mexican street corn.  As far as drinks, I would go with the frangelico horchata as opposed to a margarita. Pretty good service too.  I'll update review once I try a few more dinner dishes."}
{"text":"I would give the food one star and then two extra stars for atmosphere and drink selection. I don't know if that makes the place worth it, especially when you have so many other fantastic options nearby. I've tried eating here 4 different times and each time the food was a big disappointment. Bland guacamole. Boring salsa. Tacos are ok, but just ok. Love the bar, the cocktail menu and happy hour specials."}
{"text":"First time here! Great place love the Blood Orange Margarita !! Food was greattasting ,  portions are small for the price ! Would go back !"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed going to Joyride and our favorite drink is the cucumber Serrano margarita. The beast burrito is really good, probably the best carne asada in town. But the last couple of times they seem to be adding more rice and beans and very little carne asada. Very disappointed.  Wish they did a survey so that I could tell them what we think but they don't so will post on Yelp. It's good but not as good as it used to be.  Oh yea and it you ask for more chips and salsa they charge you!  Not cool."}
{"text":"Edit:  This place was great when it first opened.  I've ordered food twice lately that was just bad.  The first time I thought it was just a bad day for them...the second time they sent me with a cold to-go order (I was there early) with zero flavor and they didn't even add in chips and salsa.  When I am paying $10+ for a standard taco lunch I expect something pretty phenomenal.  This was not it.  I won't be going back.

I'm only giving Joyride 4 stars because of the price.  It seems a bit expensive (if you don't go on a Tues) for some tacos.  With that being said, I've tried 5 or 6 different flavors and they are all delish.  I don't know that I will drive great distances to go there, but if I'm in town I'll definitely eat at Joyride (if I'm not already at one of the other amazing Gilbert restaurants)."}
{"text":"This place is a trendy and super yummy little place. It reminds me very much of LA and West Hollywood. This is not a good place for large groups... they can put a few tables together on the small patio outside but unless it is one of the few nice days of the year in Arizona, you won't be comfortable. Also, the wait can be really long. Ask them about an app you can download on your phone and you can put your name in at a restaurant and they are one of them. I forgot what it is called. The wait will very likely be 1-2 hours wait on Friday and Saturday nights. Brunch there is fun too though!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My friends and I bike here almost every weekend. The staff is amazing and the food is great. Not much else to say but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really beautiful environment, laid back with a little pop of color but not overwhelming to the eye... And more importantly, the food! How do you beat $2 tacos on happy hour and $5 margaritas? You don't. The crispy fish taco was amazing, it didn't have fish that was falling apart and the crispy exterior was just as satisfying as a bag of your favorite chips. Enchiladas had great flavor and everything from the meats to the tortillas were the exact texture that you look for in the two. Meats weren't too tough and neither were the tortillas. Our server Francisco was wonderful as well, great attitude, upbeat, kept it light and easy, and dished out subtle but amusing remarks. Will definitely be coming back. Love the food, love the ambiance, and love the service!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at  Joyride yesterday. Absolutely amazing. Fabulous service, fun atmosphere and the tacos were off the charts. I had the Carne Asada, chicken Tinga and Ahi tuna tacos. All were amazing but my favorite was the Chicken Tinga. 

I would highly recommend this spot. I will certainly be returning soon."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! I have been obsessed with Joyride for the past 6 months. All They're tacos are amazing. The Fila salad is also great. The first time my boyfriend got the Mexican street corn he said every single person should have this on they're table. And he's not usually impressed by food. I have never been disappointed with the food drinks or service at joyride."}
{"text":"Super deluxe, delicious taco centric fare with a modern healthy take and margaritas.  Waited outside for about thirty minutes on a busty Saturday night.  No problem, because the Host takes drink orders and there's ample seating to wait.  Busy night overall and a definite hot spot.  Service was great carried by a hosting staff that supports the floor with deliveries, drinks and table turns.  Awesome food. Tacos excellent. Cucumber Serrano Margarita, the bomb.  Can't believe our three year old slept through it all. Note: noise level due to busy dining room and bar."}
{"text":"este lugar es muy delicioso. happy hour era genial! Sugiero la margarita de naranja de sangre o un mojito de piña! la comida es increíble. la salsa es adictivo!"}
{"text":"Great for happy hour!  Good beer prices for pitchers and world fabulous margaritas!  The margaritas were all good!  Tacos were also pretty special.  Cheese dip was \"so so.\"  Service was friendly and helpful.  All in all a good experience, and I'll be back!  Glad to have this gem in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"We were seated 5 minutes to 6 pm and they honored the happy hour prices so we tried 1 of each! It is nice to have someone who likes the opposite of you so I loved the veggie and fish tacos and she carried on about the fried fish, beef and pork. The blood orange margarita hit the spot as well. Great service, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"this place was base camp for us n a recent visit to Phoenix, luckily it was the first place we stopped at and we loved the food, the service and the very generous drink specials. The pork tacos and carne were both delicious and well presented. Atmosphere was fun, and a real nice room, too."}
{"text":"Unable to wait for \"Taco Tuesday\", we headed down to Joyride Taco House on Central Avenue on Monday afternoon around, coincidentally, Happy Hour and discovered what promises to be a fantastic new addition to our rotation of favorite spots. It was the first visit for any of us, though we'd driven past on numerous occasions.

We were greeted warmly immediately on entering and led to a table. There is a nice patio area outside, complete with gas fireplace, which I'm sure is where you'll want to be during the more pleasant months here in Phoenix.  Hannah was our server and she was just great. Fun, prompt and just friendly.  Chips and salsa were quick to follow. 

For drinks T's mom and I chose the Blood Orange margarita, while T had the Cucumber-Serrano margarita. Loved the Blood Orange. While I thought the cucumber-serrano was good, it just wasn't to my taste.  For our meal we each chose a small variety of the street tacos. I had one each of the carne asida, standard and pork adobada, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed. Still wanting a bit more, I finally tried the Crispy Fish taco which was also a winner. Everyone came away just really pleased with their selections. 

Joyride has a nice, open feel to it while at the same time providing seating that still feels intimate. While we didn't visit the bar area in the center of the space it looks to be a great spot  to spend time. The decor is pleasing to the eye and really well balanced as far as the selection of tones of the furnishings. Maybe strange to note, but it does make an impression. 

So, overall I really like Joyride and definitely be returning. No question. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I don't care much for their menu, but the carne asada (steak) quesadilla I ended up ordering was HUGE and very tasty!  The waitress was attentive.  The leftovers were great.  Oh, and parking here was surprisingly
easy in their lot (no need to go to the overflow across the street).

However, I will never go back here as the music was turned up to a deafening level and was blasting some type of screaming-as-lyrics type noise \"music\" that was painful.  The restaurant was also packed, so people were yelling OVER the yelling \"music\" which made me want to just leave, which I would have if I wasn't with my mother (who thankfully is getting a little hard of hearing and so was saved from some
of the horrendous experience).  I feel a weekend lunch is supposed to be a relaxing affair, and not feel like a night club!  If this was management-approved music, and not some employee's iPod plugged in to the sound system, I disagree with their \"mood/environment\" choice and will just have to stick with Federal Pizza next door."}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere which is only trumped by the awesome tacos.
Drinks are poured with a heavy hand.  
Long time favorite"}
{"text":"There is such a WIERD vibe in here tonight . We waited 20minutes for our drinks after ordering them, while,   in the meantime three different people came over to take our food order!!  take our food order!!!! Can I take your food order?????  CAN WE GET OUR DRINKS FIRST? The girl with the bull ring in her nose, was just clueless. I reordered  a diet coke three times and when she brought me the last one, you'd think she would have taken away the  three REGULAR cokes that were piling up, nope, just left them there. Ughh! It's Not like anybody is really rude or mean, but there is no attention to detail or customer service.  The waiter, as precious as he thinks he is, is rushing by and throws down drinks without stopping, spills water all over the table as he refills the water glasses, giggling  it off as he saunters away, leaving us to wipe up the splattered water that is on the table and cell phones with our own napkins. Then he hounds us to order order order! Ready to order ready to order ready to order???????????????????we haven't  even gotten our appetizers yet. I thought the place was closing based on the urgency to order only to be told
They are open another 90 minutes. We are paying the bill for our appetizer and going over to Postino. Something is just to weird and it's making me a NERVOUS WRECK!"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner in a Friday night and had a good experience. It was busy and they told us it would be about 45 minutes for a family of 4. We ended up waiting only 30 minutes, and they had a server outside making sure people could get drinks while they waited. They use the Nowait app for their wait list, so if you have it check before you go to get added to the list. 

Once inside, our waitress came up to ask about drinks and starters. They also brought out water and chips and salsa immediately. Our food was good. They serve street tacos and some burritos. I ordered the bandit taco platter which had carne asada, carnitas, and chicken tinga. They came fajita style so I could assemble them myself. My husband ordered three tacos:shrimp, Baja fish, and carne asada. The Baja fish was really good! All the others were good too, but most were a little too salty. 

I also ordered a couple drinks. I had the blood orange margarita and the pineapple mojito. The margarita was strong, but good. I liked the pineapple mojito better, it was really tasty!

I'd say that the main thing for me was the service. Our waitress and the server outside were very attentive and friendly. We went with our young kids and while they were prepared for families I think it's a better place for adults looking for a night out. I would definitely go back again but next time maybe with friends for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Not my favorite, it's an OK plan B spot.  I had chicken enchiladas that were pretty bland.  It's a good place to go with a group."}
{"text":"Fun place, California atmosphere good food. The corn on the cob is excellent, the black beans are excellent. Tacos are very good with good selection. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance, and drinks! Not the most authentic Mexican food, but it's fresh and flavorful. Not a fan of the beans or rice though."}
{"text":"Bad service today! So disappointing.  The margaritas were very weak this time. We were never offered chips and salsa despite looking at all the other people being served them. 45 minutes it took her to come back and finally place our food order, then Ceviche wasn't made right- I asked another bar staff about it and he kindly took care of it. But my sister was short changed when we closed our tab by Ten dollars. I will never come back here again.

So update: went back to Phoenix. The manager was so kind to contact me and I went back .  The staff was attentive, we were quickly served drinks and chips and salsa. Of course the fresh made tacos are ALWAYS ALWAYS worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times and I'm finally going to yelp it! This place is one of my favorite spots to relax. On a Friday, I want to go out to a trendy spot with fresh food! This is the place. In this part of town you can't be sub-par. And Joyride meets the mark! The atmosphere is warm and easy. The staff all have smiles on their faces and everyone seems to be having a great time working. Food is great; despite previous reviews, I never had a bland bite. My shrimp taco had two pieces of over cooked shrimp and the third piece was perfect. Consistency would have been reviewed with 5 stars... I'm still in love with Joyride! In fact, I can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"My friends arrived from the east coast and we were all hungry on a Friday night. I wanted to take them somewhere nice that is not swarmed with college students. Everywhere was closed at this point or not serving drinks. The manager there opened the kitchen just to make us dinner even though it was last eleven. He was really awesome about it. On top of that he gave us a half off discount. Not only that but the waitress, waiter, and everyone that worked there was super friendly. I have not had service like this on years. The food was also delicious. love this place! Love their food! Love their service!"}
{"text":"Came here basically just for the brownie and dessert. The person with me got the pineapple mojito which was really good and really strong didn't get a chance to try the tacos but would come back here to give them a chance. Apparently another restaurant postino's is right across the street so if you don't like the menu you have you have other restaurants within the facility that you can check out without having to drive to another location."}
{"text":"Yay for an awesome taco place! Service was good; a very casual atmosphere. The food was awesome! We built up a taco plate (you can do a la carte as well), and had the guacamole. Portions are decent. Convenient location in downtown Gilbert. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Five star rating is for the great food:  Baja fish taco, braised beef, and carne asada taco--all great! Chips and salsa also fresh and very good.  Service on the other hand was subpar.  Not bad enough to lose me forever.  Since the food was so good I will give them another shot...just hope service is better this time.

Update -  had to bring down to a four after eating at barrio queen--new standard."}
{"text":"If you have lived in Phoenix for 30 + years, you would agree that Gilbert might not be worth a special trip for anything since you can get just about everything in Phoenix!  Well, HELLO GILBERT!  It has totally redone the downtown strip and it is lined with great restaurants like JOYRIDE.  My first time in there, TayK took such good care of me!  Great recommendations, suggestions for next time, and more.. She was totally passionate about her craft and it made me want to try everything on the menu.  I had tacos (of course) and the Corn... AMAZING.  Oh, and the blood orange margarita was absolutely perfect!  I will be going back for Taco Tuesday!!!  See you there!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The tacos were amazing and we got the cheese app which wad also delicious!  The margaritas are super tasty and the ambiance is relaxed and friendly.  Our server was great and we loved the meal!"}
{"text":"I love love love the ambiance of the restaurant. It is fun and funky, great youth for Gilbert! The margaritas are great and you can't really mess up chips and salsa!

Having worked in restaurants for 6 years, I have probably sent food back less than 5 times in my life. Joyride would be one of those times. Very bland carne asada. Management was great in offering me something else and giving me coupons for my next visit - I really appreciate the customer service. 

So basically, I will go back, but I will stick to drinks and apps :)"}
{"text":"Service was good... seemed like we have 3 different servers though. I guess they share tips or something. Food was good... the only thing I didn't care for was my friend and I were brought refills of our ice tea and lemonade but were then charged for them. Usually places do free refills and that would have been fine had we been asked if we wanted another round but we weren't. We were just given the drinks so I would assume they were just refills."}
{"text":"I keep reading about people going to Joyride for Taco Tuesday but they neglect to mention that the $2.00 tacos are not available until after 2pm.  I went last week at 1pm for lunch and was a bit disappointed that I couldn't get the tacos for the Taco Tuesday price.  

I found the food to be on the spicy side, which some people like but I don't.  The chips they brought out was good and the salsa was fine-but again, it was too spicy for me. 

Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't come here when they are an hour from closing and sit at the bar.  All the wait staff was so focused on cleaning up and shutting down the bar to busy to ask how your meal was, had to flag them down to order dessert. No one checked up on me once.  Will not come back again late night.  The carne Asada taco had huge chunk of grizzle in it, fish taco and the standard were good. Churros were good but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted like watered down chocolate milk.  Bummer because it's a cool place."}
{"text":"Awful and over priced!  Water spilled all over me and my new coach purse and snobby staff all expect for our waiter. Hated everything about it. I knew we should of went to the BBQ place across the street."}
{"text":"Great setting.  Inspired food.  Generous portions. Really good music.   Friendly, approachable team.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I came for Thursday dinner and was seated pretty quickly. This place has a nice well decorated, dim atmosphere and good service. If you are trying to find a place to sit down and eat this is a good place but the tacos were alright and overpriced. The tacos are small but three seemed like a good amount for me. The pork adobada taco was good and would probably get that again. The carnitas and standard tacos were mediocre, a little plain/dry, and boring. I also got the Mexican slaw that had cabbage, corn, and cheese which was good but not a must have. Also it was disappointing to see they charged extra to refill the chips and salsa. Either I would come back and try some other things besides the tacos or I would come during happy hour/taco Tuesday because they seem to have good deals."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously awesome great atmosphere!!! Good music and bartender Daniel took great care of us even though it was a full bar all of our food and drinks were on point this is the taco Tuesday spot !!! Try allthere specials you won't regret it"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This place is amazing. I'm not even a fan of margaritas but these are so fresh and so delicious, I couldn't resist. The tacos are more like hipster Mexican than authentic, but still delicious. The guys at Upward Projects, who are responsible for awesome spots like Postino's and Windsor, do such an amazing job of bringing culture and atmosphere to Phoenix. These guys really set the bar and I love it! I hope more restaurateurs and business people follow suit by opening up businesses that offer a truly unique atmosphere while highlighting the local culture."}
{"text":"Nice taco spot here in the heart of Gilbert. Tacos are similar to street style tacos but slightly bigger and made a notch up from your typical street tacos. I mixed and matched my tacos with my personal favorite being the carne asada. Restaurant has a full bar as well as inside and outside seating with misters. Unfortunately I have been here twice now and have received less then spectacular service on both occasions specifically relating to getting the bill way after we are finished with our meal and clearly waiting around"}
{"text":"Upon arrival we were greeted kindly at the door. The ambiance is nice; colorful and inviting. Music is chill and the seats are comfy. 

As far as food is concerned, the chips and salsa are tasty but they charge you for extra. That's fine if the main course comes out promptly, but to charge for extra chips and salsa while waiting for food for 15 plus minutes is ridiculous.  The tacos are good, not great.  The service was ok, no one went above and beyond.  We often had empty glasses needing refills and it would take a while for the server(s) to come by and refill them.

I'd consider going back to try the cocktails, but I will probably sit at the bar in hopes of more prompt and friendly service."}
{"text":"Food is to die for and happy hour rocks!  Seriously one of my top five favs...."}
{"text":"There food is probably a three, they have taco Tuesday which is nice, with two dollar tacos, however they charge for there chips and salsa something they previously hadn't done in the past. Paying two dollars to get some extra chips and salsa when historically they were free is unacceptable. Especially when there food is nothing special to get you through the door."}
{"text":"Love the \"standard\" taco. Also, the Elote and Agua Fresca's are delicious. Tortillas are always fresh! 4 stars because: A little over priced when not doing happy hour and they give you a huge basket of chips with a TINY portion of salsa  (refills on the salsa cost extra)."}
{"text":"My family and I were recently invited to ,\" Joyride Taco House\" we were extremely blessed to have lunch there. The atmosphere is cool and the waiters & waitresses were excellent ! The food is extremely fresh& tasty. I would go here 5 times a week. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today after constantly driving by.  First impression was that it was too dark, I had to shine my phone onto the menu to be able to read it.  Then the real issues started with the service being the biggest one.  Took a good twenty minutes to order and then an eternity to get my tacos.  They were okay, nothing great though.  Server came by one to all if o wanted a refill however never brought it out.  Between the mediocre food and terrible service I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"If I'm ever on Gilbert Road starving to death, and Postino/Joe's BBQ/Liberty Market/SoCal Fish Taco Co. are otherwise unavailable, I would return. Absolutely nothing to write home about here. The carne asada was meh."}
{"text":"You get just ok value for the dollar. The food is just ok, nothing exciting. I had veggie enchilada and for the price of $14 not worth it and the flavour was just ok.  Will not go back..."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and fun craft cocktails, but during our visit the host staff was less than cordial. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the food and service, but our first impression at the door was mediocre. We will give them another shot, though. Sometimes people have bad days!"}
{"text":"This place hits on all cylinders! Great food, excellent service, awesome atmosphere, even the music is perfect. The tacos and nachos are great but the pinto beans are the best I've ever had! The pineapple mojito is the best tasting drink I've ever experienced. If you go for lunch or dinner you will not be disappointed. I've already been twice this week. Great taco Tuesday specials too!"}
{"text":"Yay, a taco shop in Old Town Gilbert!  I was somewhat apprehensive but having a good taco shop close by that doesn't look like its 50 years old was a must try.

Glad we did.  We went in around noon today, Saturday and sat right away at the bar :) The salsa we got right away was great!  We ordered the tomatillo salsa and it was way to sweet for us but the rest of everything was wonderful

I had the veggie taco which was a great mesh of veggies in a home made tortilla, was great.  DH had the carne asada and one of their pork tacos.  Said the carne asada was awesome as did one of the other guys sitting next to us.  

Atmosphere is fun and inviting.  Pitcher was 7.5 which was great since each draft pint was $5.  All in all one of the cheaper lunches we've had in a fun place and the food was good.

We did have really good service and it was fast unlike some other reviews, maybe because we sat at the bar but definitely no complaints here.  Overall, really happy this place is close to us as we moved out here a few years ago from Scottsdale and have been waiting for a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place to get tacos! 

Came with a group of four and got sat down immediately for a prime dinner time.

I really like their taco combo and would definitely recommend. Their joyrice wasn't the most worth, in my opinion, but the tacos were wonderful."}
{"text":"I haven't had one thing here that sucked. I've had questionable service once but because of the style of service someone else quickly stepped in & made it all better again. I love tude of the staff. All very chill & helpful to give you their take on what they like. which I like. I also love that they had Four Peaks Ode Lay & loved it even better before 5 as it was happy hour priced. Sadly they are out of that now & are serving another Four Peaks beer which I will try when I stop stomping my feet about the Ode Lay loss. :)"}
{"text":"Went for tacos at Gilbert location.  I love old town Gilbert so great location.   The tacos were amazing! Place is super cool and staff is fun."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 14 during their anniversary week and the place was crazy. I have to say they could not have done a better job considering the situation. I've been before when things weren't so crazy and the service was good but I must say they rose to the occasion! This place has some seriously yummy food and great drinks! Don't let the prices scare you, the quality is there."}
{"text":"We spent our weekly date night at Joy Ride Tacos tonight. Our server, Gabriel, made our experience great! His taco recommendations were spot on, and he was fast, friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Met up with my brother & a friend. Had high hopes...but the theme... Not even sure how to describe it I guess \"Mexican fusion\" restaurant Is the food is so bad. I truly dont understand what is so difficult about basically making tacos  rice & beans. My tacos were ok. The beans were served cold & tasted like hormel out of a can so...sent them back. We sent back the \"salad\" not even sure the description matched what we got. The service....for what you pay..was eh & I HATE that you cant tell who does or doesn't work there. I realize Phoenix is a casual city for the love of God matching t-shirts the name of the restaurant on it so I know who you are might be nice. One of the worst part is where you have to stand to wait ... Seriously in the doorway? The drinks were good though. I might give it one more try maybe it was an off day? But nobody I know has given it rave reviews"}
{"text":"This place was awesome you dont see these kinds of places in Philly and with cheap prices. Food was so good and the service was exceptional. She was really nice and energetic and made me feel really comfortable :) I am only in AZ for one more week and I def have to come back before I leave."}
{"text":"This place is fun trendy and the servers are enthusiastic and energetic. The guacamole was good  and the waitress comped it for us.  The pink grapefruit mint aguafresca was the flavor of the day. It was good and refreshing. Cucumber one, not so good.Needed simple syrup and more straining. Horchata just okay.   
 I did not care for the type of fish they used for the crispy fish taco. Didn't seem mild enough.
 The chicken tinga was okay but I make it with more balanced spice and better texture in my slow cooker at home (its super easy) We got a couple of desserts and they were yummy! 
 All in all, I can appreciate the taqueria which serves  aguas , homemade tortillas , and a good complement of desserts."}
{"text":"The tacos here are delicious! The ambiance is fun and retro. I probably wouldn't recommend it for big groups. Seems like a great place for happy hour; I'm looking forward to checking out the patio when the weather is nicer."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  Good atmosphere, tacos, drinks, and prices.  On Tuesday tacos are only $2.00."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  And healthy! I had the nutty cabra salad with chicken and it was wonderful! !!"}
{"text":"We went twice and had okay-poor experiences both times and haven't been back.  Both times the hostesses seemed generally uninterested and couldn't even manage a smile.  Both times the service at the bar was slow, I get it when the bar is busy but you have to acknowledge a customer when they arrive at the bar; ie, \"I see you, I'll be right with you\".  The food was okay, the fish and shrimp tacos were good, the chicken tacos had no flavor and everything is pretty pricey for what you get.  I did not like their signature drinks (maybe it's just my taste) they were very sweet and had the consistency of puréed fruit."}
{"text":"Similar to Gallo Blanco, it's style over substance here.  Maybe it's just my palate, but there's nothing more discouraging then knowing what something is probably going to taste like before you even order it: sickeningly sweet margaritas and inedible, salty food.  I love Mexican food, but very picky having grown up in So Cal.  Even so, I thought I'd give an open mind.  We started with some guac, which for $8, came served in a tiny dish and was riddled with brown pieces.  We sent it back for another only to find brown pieces (surprise) folded under good pieces.  The staff informed us \"this happens after sitting out for a few minutes\".  A few minutes??  Oxidization occurs after a few hours...not minutes. Yuck.  I know guac.  Come on.  I then ordered the Lola Salad (striving to add some greens to this meal) which was mostly quinoa (how did I miss \"grain\" in the description...sorry, \"Lola GRAIN salad\".  I then reluctantly (anticipating another bad experience with a similar item at Gallo Blanco) ordered the \"Beast Burrito\" which ultimately confirmed that it was conceived for the menu by very small eyes. Chipotle gives you a hardier serving...this was a below average size.  I didn't understand what was so \"beasty\" about it.  This turned out for the better as it contained predominately black and refried beans in addition to a bit of over cooked, drowning-in-salt marinade-based carne asada.  There was a nauseatingly sweet taste (fire roasted salsa??) and it was luke warm.  It was very much like Gallo Blanco's carne asada burrito. And my worst peave, BROWNED tortilla to give it a hard, card board like texture. WHY?  WHY must you do this? The whole thing screamed \"left over\". I couldn't finish it.  Blah.  The only thing that my mind could imagine being worse is if it had been deep fried into a chimichanga!!!  

Overall, predictable and not great food.  I'll give it another try some other time, but messing up guac is really annoying and not being able to finish an entree because it's so gross just made it worse.  Hard to find places that don't pander to the point of exhaustion...I don't think you'll get a better experience at say Blanco Tacos either.  Overly thought menu items that just don't deliver.  

Sorry, better luck next time. If I can muster up the nerve to go back."}
{"text":"Great family friendly place!! The atmosphere  was really nice, whether you sat inside or outside. The food was great and the cocktails were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in Central Phoenix.  I haven't been here when it's too busy, which always seems to be the case at other Upward Projects restaurants.  So I'm happy to have Joyride be my new go to.  I can find parking, get good drinks, good service, delicious tacos etc, and the best churros I've ever had.  (the cheese y mas is a must try but dangerous for the dairy intolerant)  They have a lot of open doors windows, so depending on the weather it can get a bit chilly and they keep it kinda dark.  But otherwise, we've been very happy with our dining experiences here."}
{"text":"For the high price I would have expected better flavor. We had the fish tacos. The presentation was nice, the service was good, but we felt it was too pricey for the experience.  I have to say we are don't drink alcohol so I can't rate the drinks."}
{"text":"Our party of four decided to try Joyride's Happy Hour and have an early dinner. We arrived at 4pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. They offer their regular cocktails (not bottom shelf) during happy hour for $5. I had the Cucumber Serrano and it was the perfect blend of smooth and spicy! We enjoyed the house salsa while waiting, which had plenty of kick while still bursting with flavor. We ordered standard tacos, battered fish tacos, shrimp tacos and the nacho plate. Each dish was fresh and perfectly balanced. The white magic sauce makes the nachos out of this world! There is also ample bar and outside seating. I will definitely go back the next time I visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant. Gilbert location was amazing as well, almost better experience than the central location but just about tied. Amazing drinks and food. Glad to see Mexican food modern and yet still a little traditionally represented. Experience is great at the bar or a table, from the first time they set the chips and salsa down!"}
{"text":"An OK place to hang with friends or that special someone... but that depends on when you go.  At times, it seems management is keeping the staffing too thin in order to keep labor costs down.  As a result, the service here is terrible a little too often.  Additionally, the staff is not very friendly unless it is your specific waiter/waitress.  I've read other yelp complaints that the staff ignores people, walks right by them, won't smile.  One has to wonder if this business is building on transactions rather than relationships.  Only relationships will grow their business."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place.  My dear friend and his girlfriend love this place, but my experience wasn't that great.  First of all, this place is in old town Gilbert and the location is poppin... They don't take reservations and we had about 45 minute wait.  The hostess was super friendly and typed my number and name into her ipad for a text message reminder of when my table was ready.  After waiting for only about 20 minutes, we were seated.  

We had had 2 bowls of chips for a table of six waiting for us when we got to the table.  Our waiter came to the table and got our drink order, however forgot to write down one of the drink orders and we had to remind him of that drink twice before it came out.  Once our waiter took our drink order it took him about 15 minutes to get back to us with our drinks.  Then another 15 minutes went by before he took our dinner order.  Our dinner order took awhile to get made and when the food came out, our tacos were cold.  The tacos are served \"family style\", which means they are all on the same taco holder and if you're allergic to fish or shrimp, sorry your carne asada taco will be served right next to the fish taco.  

All of the meat tacos lacked flavor, I would recommend trying the fish taco.  It had the best flavor out of all the options we ordered.  The waiter forgot to write down a few things that we ordered and those things never came out with our food.  We decided not to remind him about those missing sides as he would visit our table once every 15 minutes.

I don't think I will be back here again.  There are other taco restaurants that I perfer over this place."}
{"text":"This place was just ok for me.  The drink meme was limited, nachos short and staff was rude.  We sat outside which is a better option on a Friday as you get a personal waitress...the bar is still slow."}
{"text":"The service was astoundingly attentive, seated immediately and drinks and chips to table within minutes. The braised tacos are fantastic! Will return often."}
{"text":"Great food ! Great service , the Carne Asada tacos are the best I have ever eaten. Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"What, what  a great find! I usually am on top of the new restaurants that are opening in the area, but somehow this one got by me. Wifey spotted it the other day and we decided to check it out yesterday. It just opened on Tuesday, so it was perfect timing. The location is great, it's located right next to Postino on Central. The decor is done awesome, very urban but warm if that makes sense. The restaurant was very busy but seemed to run like a well oiled machine. We were seated pretty quick, they have a nice patio and tons of indoor/bar dining options. We started with a few cocktails, traditional margarita and I went with the blood orange margarita. Wifey wasn't over the moon about her traditional margarita, was a bit flat but my  blood orange margarita was great. they have a well rounded menu with tacos, tamales, tortas, burritos and a few specials. They also have a short list of apps/shareable plates. we started with the guacamole, which was done perfect. I opted for 3 tacos: Fried fish, braised beef and this spicy chicken. They were all great, my fave being the  braised beef. I also got the Mexican street corn, which was delicious. Wifey got the Chilaquiles, and LOVED her dish. They even have a kids menu for my daughter, which is always welcome. All in all, great good, superior service and perfect location. I'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Good tacos, great margaritas. I had the prickly pear, coconut, and cucumber - the cucumber is absolutely insane! Highly recommend. For tacos, I had the Baja fish and chicken tinga. Both were okay. I was a little disappointed at the lack of heat in the chicken tinga since it was marked as particularly spicy- it was honestly so mild that any hot sauce you can think of packs more heat than it did. 

All in all; I'll definitely be back... likely for $5 happy hour margaritas over food."}
{"text":"My husband and I are moving to Gilbert from chandler so decided to try a new date night place. We were both very hungry but knew joyride had good reviews so we went to put our name on the waitlist. Hubby got a little cranky because there was a long wait but we were seated out on their back patio, it was so beautiful with the trees and lights! Once our food arrived he admitted that the wait was well worth it and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"So I went first to Joy Ride back when it opened about 4.5 years ago. I really enjoyed the uniqueness of the dishes and came back a couple of times. Then, a year later I came back and their menu had drastically changed and the meal I got that my server recommended (since my previous meal was no longer there) was very spicy (but I am SUPER sensitive to that). I was totally disappointed that whatever I used to order was no longer on the menu. But I guess it hadn't been that popular or else they wouldn't have changed it. The atmosphere is good and the food to me is just now \"OK.\""}
{"text":"Taco. Tuesday.  Need I say more?  Several of their tacos are $2 a pop and $5 margaritas!  I strongly recommend the battered fish paired with a delicious cucumber serrano margarita (or 3).  Be sure to arrive early as the wait can be up to 45min/hour but well worth it.  THe staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive.  Parking is also a bit of a struggle on tuesdays but I'm not sure about any other days of the week.  Patios are inviting and comfortable- in fact, I would prefer sitting at the patio rather than inside.  Will continue to come back to Joyride as a loyal and happy customer!"}
{"text":"Alright.. I've officially become a bit of a regular here, dining here for Sunday lunch and during the work week. Consistent food quality and friendly, attentive service inside  I stand corrected on my first impression!"}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa, nachos, and guac.  Tacos are mediocre.  Don't get the tuna tacos, they are NOT good.  Crispy tacos are good.

I fear this place won't last long unless they just pick up the overflow from the other busy restaurants.  I expected more from the postinos owned restaurant."}
{"text":"First 
Taco's 5 stars. Healthy and flavorful. 
While I would like more sauce. 
Service 5 stars. 
Beer. 2 stars.  Kinda warmish
Wife ordered a rum relaxer. ( recipe online or on any smartphone search)
1 star.  Wasn't even close. 
Ambiance 5 stars 
In and out fast. 

I particularly liked that you don't get service from only ONE server 
Anyone walking by helps you out.  It results in chips, beer , guac, showing up faster.  
That alone  earned them an ample tip. 

Slight disappointments. 

Beer temperature and taco juiciness."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out at.  Margaritas are amazing, especially the seasonal ones. Not real authentic Mexican food so stick to the tacos, they are good."}
{"text":"Not sure why but every time I go here and order a Dr. Pepper I get a Diet Coke and have to send it back. Last time they brought me a diet coke two times so I finally gave up and stuck to water. Usually go for carne asada tacos. I found Joyride in Gilbert and thought oh lets try the one in phx, closer to where I live. Yeah, ill stick to the Gilbert location when I visit that side of town."}
{"text":"This place said they had homemade corn tortilla when I received my order the corn tortillas looked like the were out of a package bought from store terrible service and the host laughed when I asked if they were homemade if you want to see true authentic Mexican food don't come here"}
{"text":"Don't come. Been waiting over an hour to be seated. People just sitting inside done eating but not leaving. Horrible service outside getting drinks too."}
{"text":"The complementary salsa can be a hit or miss. But other than that the food is great as well as the atmosphere. I really recommend the chicken nachos! Those are soooooo yummy!"}
{"text":"$2 tacos + $5 pitchers? I think yes! Chicken tinga tacos are soooo yummy and the staff is always friendly  I LOVE JOYRIDE"}
{"text":"Went to Joyride on a Friday night. Cool vibe, nice patio area with a server to get you cocktails and chips while you wait for your table. 

Pros: 
awesome decor, patio. Yummy chips and salsa. Reasonable prices. Braised beef taco was solid. 

Cons: 
Taco's came out cold, nothing hot about anyone's entree's. 
A touch too loud 
Nachos were ok, was expecting more flavor. 

I'd be willing to go back on a week night and try this place again!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! The drinks are unique and fresh and the atmosphere has a California cool meets hipster vibe. We love this place and it's located in the heart of downtown Gilbert. The service is the only thing we haven't had good luck with, but we keep going back because the food is just that good."}
{"text":"I love this trendy restaurant! They serve authentic Mexican food - zesty dishes that use the perfect Mexican spice blend. The Tortilla soup is a must have! The carnitas tacos were served with a green salsa, avocado and cilantro were tasty - you get a free side if you order 3 tacos. We also had the Mexican Sweet Corn as an appetizer - so good! The servers were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I also wanted to write a great review of this place. Especially when they opened the sliding doors and it was such a great night. First of all i remember all too well the old saying \"if its too loud, your too old\"! Yep, im too old. Perhaps its because its partly a bar but i really don't want to eat with really loud music. I'll drink with really loud music. But i don't want agita! ( thats my old Italian lady word). Off the bat the chips were way salty. That may just be me. Im kind of salt sensitive. I was excited for the tomatillo salsa since its not easy to get. Disappointed, it was bland and had an off taste. My daughter had 2 tacos. One beef, one pork. She downed them both. Preferring the pork. They looked great. I had the tamales with rice and veggies. The rice was bland but i was starving. The veggies standard but tasty. The tamale was extremely tasty and saved the meal for me. Also, the staff was easy going, not rushed and ver accommodating."}
{"text":"Had a mini-staycation in Gilbert this weekend.  We started at a big bar in the evening, but decided we weren't ready for that.  So we walked over to Joyride Saturday night and had the best experience!!  We were seated immediately in a cute little restaurant w great views of Downtown Gilbert.  We ordered fish tacos, spicy chicken nachos, and then had several margaritas.  One of us had the regular house marg, which was great but the other two of us had the cucumber Serrano margs which were FANTASTIC!!  At one point, we also had tequila shots and our waiter Hunter tracked me down some cinnamon to make them to my request.  Our service was AMAZING (thanks Michael and Hunter) and we just had a great time!!  Would highly recommend and definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A really fun Mexican restaurant with a great vibe. 

Tacos are great, the burritos are a really good size and tasty and how does love Mexican corn!

Very good drinks with a great happy hour on margs and pitchers and the Agua Fresca are there real hallmark if you are into that thing."}
{"text":"Super tasty tacos, salsa, and my favorite is the beet, papaya, goat cheese salad and add shrimp!  So good!!  It is busy and it's a bummer when it's super busy because it can become a servers frenzy, but so worth it once you eat the food!  Like the venue as well!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night with my husband. We sat on the patio. It was nice and the food was very good! We each ordered a bunch of the different tacos and also some sides of rice and beans. I had a margarita that was amazing! The service could have been better though - Our server only came by to check on us once and we had to wait for 5-10 mins when we were done eating for her to come with our bill. Not sure if that was because it was a busy Friday night. Overall a great experience though."}
{"text":"We went there for a couple's date and sat at a lovely table on the patio. It faced Gilbert Road, adjacent to Postinos and it was very loud. However, the music slightly drowned out the street sounds. The service overall was ok. Our waitress came around to check on us periodically but I understood as it was a busy Friday evening.  We were first served chips and salsa.  You could tell the chips were made fresh and the salsa was good not great. I ordered the cucumber mint tequila drink. So refreshing, but paying $8 for this it was a little weak. My friend got the almond horchata with frangelico. It was good  not too sweet, but I felt it didn't have enough horchata flavour. For an appetizer, we ordered the queso dip. I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5. Now on to the tacos...we were all very confused by what they meant by \"family style\". All it means is they come on taco trays not in any sort of order. You get one taco $3 to 4. The best at our table was the shrimp, braised beef, chicken tinga and Baja. We also had two sides...black beans (So very good, probably cooked with ham as they were very rich) and rice (didn't finish it as it was dry and slightly bland). Our table agreed we would come back perhaps during their happy hour,  which is from open to 5 everyday, as the bill racked up quickly from everything being al la carte. At the end of the dinner, we had a chance to meet the manager and he was delighted to know we found it because of yelp. So next time I have my eyes set on one of their tamales. Yum! We will see how that goes..."}
{"text":"Pricey tacos are good, just pricey.   I am a real fan of the atmosphere, it's like hipster before hipster was cool which made it not cool.  Anyway, fun place to pretend like you're in California where Mexican food is made by sous chefs.  Feels corporate...yet hipster corporate."}
{"text":"Really delicious food,I strongly recommend their chilaquiles. I could eat them everyday and never get tired. The Horchata is also amazing it is refreshing, home made and with an almond taste to it.  They also have excellent service, It does get packed during rush hours of dinner and lunch but that is because the food is top quality and the wait is never too long."}
{"text":"Eh, food was really expensive. It was okay food, the carne asada was good but still it was all a bit too pricey.  Short and sweet- service was garbage. Might have over looked the price but couldn't with the slow service. I did like the music though. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The mojitos are worth the visit alone. This place is awesome. Great vibe, great service, and the food is good too. A bit of a wait on the weekends as this place is very popular. It has indoor and outdoor seating and is located in the heart of downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Love the tacos here. They are street tacos and you can get them just about anyway you like. I have to mention the charred habanero salsa. Wow is all I can say. It is hot (it is habanero after all) but that charred part just adds some super flavor to it. The staff was super friendly and as we waited for a table outside they had a server taking and bringing drink orders. That is awesome and all restaurants should be that way. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC. Fantastic food, fantastic drinks, fantastic atmosphere... And most importantly a great great staff. This was our first time here and, even though it was crazy busy, they wanted to make sure we understood the menu and all the things that were so good. Big big kudos to Shelby who took care of us beyond what we were expecting. Warily do I go to a restaurant and ask for a specific server, but I will in this case in the future.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has great tacos and a large selection of unique margaritas. And additional plus is that their HH prices are amazing and you can take advantage of them from anywhere in the restaurant, not just at the bar! Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Joyride.
We had many different tacos...all of them were awesome.
My GF said the fish tacos were fantastic.
The salsas that we tried were great and the ambiance was also very nice.
We had a very nice server.

Only tried it once so far but i'll be going often"}
{"text":"What a great place! The vibe was fabulous with great seating (indoor and outside), the decor is vintage fab! Servers are attentive and friendly and the food (my God!), devine!!! I ate until my stomach was uncomfortable, but I couldn't stop! The portions are generous and ordering the Mexican street corn is a must!!! This has been one of the best eating experiences I've had in a long time. An over all ten!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

A group of 4 - about $75 
On our table: 
Mexican street corn
Vegetarian tacos
Crispy fish taco
Carne asada taco
Carnitas taco
Nachos
Beast burrito 

Drinks: 
Almond horchata
Rosemary mint tea
Iced tea
Coke

The atmosphere: The atmospheric here is cool. It had outdoor seating and indoor seating, tables and chairs and some booths with pops of color here and there. The seats are adorable. The only odd thing was that I sat back to open water pitchers and if I had left my hair down I may have been able to get in another bath for the day. They have outdoor seating and on a less windy day I would have enjoyed our meal outside but I like my food hot when it's suppose to be hot. 

The service: I don't know who our server was. A younger guy came and took our drink order and another brought out our drinks and then a young lady came and took our order and the younger guy came to take our order again then someone else brought our food. We had water refilled but not offered to refill our soda.. They did continually bus our table as we finished plates though.   I think the only highlight of the service was the last guy came to talk us into desserts and named every ingredient for each dessert like his life depended on it but couldn't sell us on it but did sound good. So right here is where a part of my 3.5 star review came into play. Honestly if there was a good flow here I think lunch would have been better but in their defense they were absolutely nice. Just not attentive and no communication between each other.  

The food: 
Mexican street corn was probably the only thing I'd come back for. 

My hubs did enjoy his beast burrito. 

The tacos were really the only thing we had come here for in the first place but they didn't hit the mark. Maybe I'm not used to cold food, maybe the the corn tortillas is supposed to be that thick? Is this typical & I just don't know good tacos when I see them? I've eaten a lot of tacos in my life (it shows) and these were ok but not wow. The crispy fish taco I think could have been really good but was a tad too salty but at least it wasn't greasy and rubbery. 

The nachos lacked cheese. I think good nachos should have good coverage, layered for every chip to hang out with some cheese, a protein and pico. A good nacho can then have a cohesive marriage. These nachos were in a long distance relationship.

What I like is going places that have a vegetarian menu. This place offers such but the offerings  taste-wise were just okay.

The horchata - technically our only specialty drink. It was ok - not overly sweet but idk if it was too nutty with the almonds for my taste. It almost had a nutmeg flavor in it and maybe I'm just used to a more cinnamon-y rice drink. 

So overall it was ok all around. Not overly disappointed when we left but not excited for another visit here. 

Would I recommend? There's potential. The location is great. The people are nice. The food could be better and customer service could be better. -----but no I probably wouldn't recommend or bring my friends here if they were craving Mexican fare."}
{"text":"Okay so the food tasted very yummy and the atmosphere is hip and loud music. But I got the WORST FOOD POISONING of my life from this place. Sadly I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite taco shop! They have an excellent chicken spicy taco thing (chicken tinga) that is fantastic and always leaves me wanting to come back!!! Not to mention their chips and salsa are delicious! The atmosphere is so nice and all the employees are great, I love how they work in a team environment! Seriously, you have to come by and eat some tacos (or nachos) as soon as you can! And by the way.... You can't beat their prices!"}
{"text":"Second time in a row having Jason as our server. Hands down, the best server I have had anywhere. Before these last two times we have had less than stellar service and he has completely changed everything for us. The food is terrific and that is mostly why we continue to come back but because of Jason it's now our number one pick when we dine out."}
{"text":"I've had good and meh experiences here. Hasn't been consistent. The burritos have always been pretty good, though. And, they are dog friendly on the patio, which is a huge plus, so I'll give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for margaritas. The blood orange is my absolute favorite. The guacamole is good as well as the Mexican street corn. Actually, it's the best I have had. All of the tacos I have had are really good. My favorites are the carne Asada, veggie and crispy fish. They have really good happy hour deals and taco tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Creative tacos that are flavorful and fresh. Thoughtful cocktails that pair nicely with many entree options. Staff is laid back and casual which sets a comfortable mood for the restaurant. My first visit I ordered enchiladas which was a poor choice as I did not enjoy them very much. However, the second time that I have been there, I ordered a variety of tacos and I was very satisfied. Additionally, the build out of the restaurant is funky and cool."}
{"text":"When placing an order to go, make sure you double check your order before you leave. The staff is not competent enough to make sure it's right."}
{"text":"The wait was longer than we would have liked, and we ended up getting in sooner than expected after we negotiated with the hostess. The food was great though!"}
{"text":"Had the most amazing time at joyride! I loved my braised beef taco the most! Also Clint was amazing, he was so friendly and amazing. The smallest mistake happened with our margarita order it literally wasn't a big deal at all! They comped our margaritas because of it which was so nice but also unnecessary! Just shows how important it is to them that you have an amazing experience there! I encourage everyone to try it! Love you Clint!"}
{"text":"Cool place - great name!  I've been there a few times and had a great experience on both.  The service was very good the second time likely due to the manager? who gladly rolled up her sleeves and helped out with everything.  I spent more than a decade in the restaurant biz and I really like the way she runs the floor and talks with guests.  Yeah OK and she's cute too!  :)

The first time I just drank at the bar and service is always top notch with Chris who I have seen at a few other places in the valley.  He is a professional bartender for sure.

I like the décor and love the fact that they planted desert cactus and succulents outside rather than the typical landscape mix in AZ.  Nice job to the designer there.  The art and materials inside are also pretty cool.

I'm tempted to drop a star because the food is a little pricey as mentioned in some of the other reviews and the chips and salsa are average and could use some work.  I'd also like to see more awareness of specials which we had to discover.  

The place is busy so be careful about showing up with a big party."}
{"text":"So honey and I wanted a lunch out one fine Sunday afternoon.. so, with our baby in tow, we hit this joint up.  Not busy, so we got seated promptly.. outdoor in their patio area with the great weather.
Our server guy was great - very friendly, talkative, prompt and gave good recommendations.  I had the spiked Horchata (with Frangelico) and hubby had on-tap beer.
His three tacos came out and, unfortunately, I didnt' get a chance to taste them but he appeared to enjoy them as I didn't hear a word otherwise.  My dish, the cochinito pibil torta was SOOO GOOD... that pineapple slaw was a perfect accompaniment and they *perfectly* buttered and toasted the soft, yummy torta the way I would!
I thoroughly enjoyed that torta and really really liked the horchata.. grainy the way real home-made horchata is.
I'd definitely come back, though not that regularly as it is a bit pricey for regular eating out for me."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a negative rating because the service was good, atmosphere was good but this comes down to food and price. The tacos aren't terrible but they are nothing special and for the price definitely not worth it. Street tacos are very small and with a price tag of around $4 a taco, it's  hardly a bargain. I wouldn't be hung up on price if there was such a reason for that price, yet these tacos fall extremely short to dictate the price. I could go to an average authentic taco shop and get something just as good, if not better for $1.25. I feel as if whoever started this company thought they could reinvent the wheel yet the wheel is already amazing and a lot cheaper than their wheel."}
{"text":"This place always has wonderful service. Chips and salsa are delicious. The first set is free and then $2 after that. During the weekdays they have a lunch special $9.99 for two tacos and either a half salad or soup. Margaritas are extremely enjoyable and well made here."}
{"text":"We received a gift card and went back to try Joyride again.  We have been back 3 times since my first review.  We obviously love the tacos, because we keep coming back.  Definitely go on Tuesday or during happy hour for $2 tacos!

The service is still hit or miss, sometimes it is good, sometimes you have to ask for things multiple times.  You never know how its gonna be.

We try something new every time we go....the beans...huge disappointment, don't waste your money!  The cheese y mas is very good!!  Not worth the normal price of $9.00 (outrageous), but we will get it again during happy hour for $4.00."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, not so flavorful meats.  Definitely a place to go for happy hour, but not tacos.  And not the grilled corn.  No good.  Sorry guys."}
{"text":"I was actually a little let down when I went to Joyride. There is a location by my house that is ALWAYS busy so I decided to give this one a try when I saw this in the area. The employees seemed very busy and didn't really connect well with each other. The food was pretty good. Nothing I would crave in the future. I got a shrimp taco and a chicken taco and they were pretty good. Maybe it was just the time of day I went in but I expected more based on the large crowd I often see."}
{"text":"Upward Projects is AMAZING. Postino is my favorite restaurant, with Federal being a close 2nd and Windsor in 3rd place. Churn is heavenly also. I will wait in that 25 minute line with no frustration, and I have introduced and created literally over 50 new Postino and Federal addicts. Because I absolutely LOVE everything Upward Projects touches, one can only imagine how, as a Hispanic who has eaten authentic Mexican food my whole life, would be beyond excited to see Upward Projects open a taco restaurant. A new age one too?!! I'm in! 
.....that was how I felt before I actually tried this restaurant. After a long day of wedding dress shopping, I sacrificed eating at Postino to try this taco restaurant that I couldn't wait to rant and rave about, like I have done in the past with everything else that is UP related. I ordered three tacos, rice and beans, my friend ordered enchiladas, rice and beans, and my other friend ordered tinga with rice and beans. I can't tell you how terrible everything tasted. We didn't even finish half of our plates and didn't take the leftovers home.  Everything looked delicious, but the taste did not match up to the presentation. I was so, so, so dang disappointed. :-(   The salsa was semi-decent. That is the best I can say/do."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I had the Carne Asada Taco again.  Very good.  The cheese y mas was absolutely yummy.  The chips were on the burned side and hard, mixed in with a fresh batch.  We asked the staff and the whole batch was that way.  :(  I feel at that point, they should have made a fresh batch and not mixed the bad batch in them.  I got a watermelon Margareta.   If you like Solbe Life water w/tequila, you would like this drink. ;)  very light tasting.  I will give them a third
 try because some of this was very pleasant and yummy and I am hoping it was an off day.....plus the staff is really awesome.




I had a Carne Asada Taco and had them add cheese. They forgot that and I had to send it back. :(   It was a good taco.   My friend had the chicken enchilada with 2 different sauces.  I took a bite and I liked the green sauce better.  They were both delicious but it was just preference. 

I had so many people coming to my table, it was confusing who my actual \"waitress\" was.  I just grabbed the nearest staff member when I needed something.  They have a nice happy hour but the drinks were on the weak side.  I would like that for my drinks, lol but my friend did not.  Again, that would be preferences.  ;)  

The ambience is casual and friendly.  I liked the staff.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about Joyride that I was super excited when the opportunity came up to try it out. I had very high expectations. I guess it goes to show, that time & time again, when expectations are high, they are hardly ever met.

My comments about the service are very positive .. No complaints at all. When we walked into the restaurant, there were quite a few tables open & the hostess let us pick where we sat. The establishment isn't that large, but it was kind nonetheless for her to offer us the option. In general, we noticed they are really quick about bringing chips & salsa to the table as they do it as soon as all patrons are seated. They are good at keeping water glasses filled, making sure any questions are answered about the menu, orders are put in right away, etc.

My comments about the food are not so positive. I opted to get three tacos (comes with a free side when you get 3) - the shrimp taco, the crispy fish taco, & the chicken tinga taco (the second two per recommendation of our waitress). None of them blew me away .. Nor were they even that good to mention to someone. The chicken tinga was just spicy, which I am ok with, but lacked flavor. The shrimp was the same way. I would say of the three, the crispy fish was the best, but again, nothing to rave about, & almost too heavy with the added stuff on top. I got the black beans as my side ... My mistake. They just tasted like beans out of a can topped with a little bit of cheese. No seasoning. I didn't understand nor enjoy them. My dining-mate got the veggie burrito & it was really good. For how much he paid, he enjoyed it & more.

Lastly, it's to be noted that there are a ton of flies in the restaurant. It was not only annoying, but also felt un-sanitary. I almost wanted to leave before we even ordered, but decided to stick around. I guess I should've gone with my original gut instinct!"}
{"text":"I've been in here before, but decided to leave a review this time. I had the same experience both times. They have great margaritas. My girlfriend and I got the blood orange margaritas and they were delicious! We ordered the guacamole, cheese y mas as appetizers. The guacamole was 2 stars at best. We asked for no tomatoes in them, but were informed that the guacamole was pre-made. At that point, I didn't want to order them, but did anyways. The guacamole was bland, flavorless. We received the queso, and it was just okay. It tasted like velveeta. I ordered the two veggie tacos. They were bland. No amount of salt and cholula could help that. The tortillas were good. My girlfriend got the carne asada taco. She said it was pretty good. There was too much cabbage. She also got the fish taco. The fish was good but semi non-existent. I gave it three stars because the drinks and ambience were nice. The service was okay, as well. Food came out rather quickly. I might come back, but I would only sit at the bar and order drinks."}
{"text":"Well did something spontaneous and asked wife to find a great place for Taco Tuesday. She found this amazing hip place that just gives off the coolest vibe. Most of the tacos were 2 dollars and Margaritas were 5 dollars to close. Tired several different tacos which were all great would have given them a 5 but the corn dish off cob was just too salty for Us. I am really on the fence about the not giving the 5 star because our server was over the moon in service and even gave us her favorite dessert on the House because it was our first time. Because of her Catlin H our server, we will be back with friends and family. We will have to sit in your area again thanks so much for making our Tuesday night date night for my wife and I so wonderful. All the other staff we had contact with were so happy and just made the place a fun place to be. Excellent choices and looked like great out door seating to include an out door fireplace. Choose to sit indoors tonight but next time may give it a go."}
{"text":"What to try: Cucumber Serrano cocktail, crispy fish taco, chicken burrito with the veggie medley, veggie taco (weird, I know), and the beet salad! Awesome lunch special: 3 tacos and half salad under $10. $5 cocktails every day until 5pm.

The one pitfall: although the complimentary salsa is decent it lacks spice. I like spicy and I think it's ridiculous I have to pay extra to kick it up a notch at a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"It's just alright. The service is great. The decor and vibe are great. But the food is pretty whatever. If you get something that sounds good on the menu, it probably isn't good. Stick with the basics here.. Like tacos and fountain drinks or just water. I've had salads, tacos, dessert, burritos and margs here. I've liked nothing I've ordered besides the brownie and tacos. There is something missing about it all.  And the rule about filling up water glasses that are half full is a great rule! However, I was signing my check to leave and told our server that I didn't need anymore water as she grabbed it and told me it was a rule to fill up all water glasses... I agree that this rule is great for summers that hit 118 degrees, but when I am leaving and telling them not to fill my glass I think it's fair to leave my glass half empty. It's a waste of water, especially in the desert."}
{"text":"We moved from central Phoenix and have been to the Joyride on Central multiple times. Great food, great service. We just left Federal Pizza, owned by the same company on Central. Just like always.. excellent food and service. My family has been to Joyride in Gilbert multiple times and it's been a disappointment each time. The service is sub par. It's as if the servers are stressed and almost annoyed which transfers a negative dining experience. The staff doesn't handle pressure well at all.  Great food but the staff needs to step it up."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here. Obviously, my favorite time is happy hour (2-6) and taco Tuesday! Their salsa would be my favorite part if the margaritas weren't so dang good! :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE the tacos here but its really annoying that they charge for chips and salsa. They give you a super small bit of salsa and a HUGE bowl of chips but if you want more of either you have to pay. The servers are pretty nice too.

 I would not go here for anything other than taco Tuesday. I went with four people and the bill was 60 dollars!!"}
{"text":"So yummy!! The space is clean, modern, open, airy and the decor is awesome. They have fast friendly service and our waiter was awesome. Great Happy Hour Specials!!! The salsas are delicious."}
{"text":"Food is average if you even get it while it's still warm. The staff is so nonchalant and could really care less. It takes forever to get in and out of here."}
{"text":"I just went yesterday for TACO TUESDAY! I just loved the crispy fish tacos and the carne asada. There are about 8 options each for two bucks. Next time I will try the horchata, but overall a great date with my love!"}
{"text":"I'm in town visiting a friend of mine, and last night we dined here on here suggestion--so glad we did! 

The hostess let us know it would be about a 30 minute wait, but let us know we could grab a seat on the patio and order drinks and appetizers. (Or grab a seat at the bar - they're first come first serve. But it was pretty full.) 

I love the atmosphere here! Very \"Art Deco\" in my opinion.. Funky wallpaper, awesome lighting/glass work around the bar, headlights on the walls that lit up as it got dark! The staff was all very friendly and helpful, and brought candles to all the tables as the sun was setting outside. Not to mention the 3 or 4 extra large doors they had open, giving the whole place a very laid-back vibe. 

We opted for a spot on an outside couch, and were welcomed with chips and water. Before we had a chance to order anything, we were getting seated! (10-15 minutes) 

Our waitress was a doll, and recommended the blood orange margarita. It was strong (I love a strong drink) and was perfectly sweet. Definitely a winner. The chips were really good, they tasted fresh! The salsa was excellent as well, but too spicy for me to try more than a few times. 

I had 'The [Chicken] Enchiladas' and they were tasty! It's too smaller enchiladas that equal the size of what you'd except the size of one to be, served with half red sauce and half green sauce - very cool!

The enchilada itself was delicious, very flavorful and the meat was juicy. The red sauce was my favorite - full of flavor and a little bit of kick. The green sauce fell a little flat for me, I found it somewhat bland - which was a major bummer because green sauce is my jam! I appreciated that it wasn't smothered in cheese, like you usually see in American versions of Mexican food.  

I would be a regular if I lived in town. Great food, vibe, service, and prices!"}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions and I've always enjoyed the experience. The outdoor area looks like it's current under construction, but if it remains pretty similar, it's an ideal place to hang out and catch up with friends. Inside is a little loud with music. I usually get the tacos but friends have always liked their food too. The churros and the agua frescas are amazing!"}
{"text":"What they've done with the space is really cool. The food was good but bland. The service was hip with some attitude unnecessarily thrown in. Mediocre beer selection. Mixologists on duty. Unless you go for happy hour, the prices are high for what you get. The atmosphere is great, but there are so many places to get better, more flavorful Mexican food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour deals!  I like their carne asada tacos and blood orange margaritas. Staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I went back today because I was craving the chips and salsa! I stumbled upon a beautiful little money saving sign at the table for a lunch deal :) Any two tacos and half a salad or soup for $9.95. I ordered the shrimp and ahi taco. Both delicious of course. But I am here to praise about the fila salad. The fila salad blew my mouth and mind, it has kale as a base  with jicama, oranges, tomato, avocado, pinto beans, corn, crunchy peas + queso fresco in a quince vinaigrette. It's definitely worth a try! 

I had fantastic service. My water was not even a quarter empty and it was refilled, twice! The place had people in there but it was not during peak times or super busy by any means. I am already planning my next trip but next time starting with dessert."}
{"text":"Awesome! Service was great! Ambiance was great! Food was amazing! Highly recommend: crispy fish taco, braised beef taco and shrimp ceviche. This might be my new favorite spot!

One thing I would change, is I would love for these tacos to be a crispy shell. The soft was good, but crispy would have been the BEST (for most tacos, not all). Maybe the option to choose???"}
{"text":"Paleo language is a difficult one to translate to Mexican food. While much of the cuisine is beans, rice and cheese much of it is also fresh and full of flavor. Joyride offers an impressive taco menu. I was nervous to ask if I could order sans the taco shells- oh and sans cheese- oh and gluten free. Our bartender immediately reassured me it was NO PROBLEMO at all to accommodate my needs! I had three kinds of tacos the way I wanted along with a side of fresh guacamole and cucumber+orange salad. All freshly made and full of fresh herbs and veggies. Gracias Kate and Joyride!!"}
{"text":"I should start by saying that I'm a native Arizona girl born and raised on authentic mexican food. Epic joints like El Ray, Casa Reynoso, and La Casita are my favs...Globe/Miami kind of mexican food. So, in comparison to what I'm used to I had to give Joyride 3 stars. 

The parking in downtown Gilbert sucks and that's where Joyride is located...parking is a real negative. The decor is bright and awesome! Very hipster type decor. I loved the Star Wars art and the really cool chairs. The seating is indoor/outdoor so there was an issue with flies at our table. This definitely took away from the experience. My son was grossed out for sure.

The customer services was great, really nice people and prompt service. Without asking the waitress brought out water for my toddler with a lid so that was nice. 

Chips and salsa are served free as an app, it's okay I guess, kind of a smokey/Chipotle type salsa flavor...not really my style. I ordered some tacos, they were okay, more upscale American infused, fancy pants style. My husband has a more refined palate and he enjoyed his dish. He got the The Beast burrito. It had a smokey fresh grilled flavor, pretty good if you're into that. The execution of the dish was stellar, you can tell they have some pros in the kitchen. The guacamole seems to be fresh and it's good. The jalapeños on top are a perfect heat, not too hot. The plating of the dishes was very nice and professional. 

Bottom line: if you enjoy eating more of an upscale American style Mexican food, this is a place for you. If you have a simple palate, like mine, and were raised on authentic mexican food, you may be disappointed. Service is great, environment is neat, colorful, hipster. I didn't have a drink, but the bar looks cool. It would be a nice place to kick back a few with some girlfriends on a Friday night. If you want to check it out I would go early. We went here before dinner rush with no waiting. I had a friend who tried to stop in and there was over and hour wait."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! The blood orange margs are the bomb. Our bartender, Ray was awesome and took great care of us all afternoon making a wonderful Sunday Friday. $5 margs are amazing. Great tacos. My fav was the carne adovado....beautiful. Go."}
{"text":"First time there and we will be back. I broke down and went out of my comfort zone and had the Crispy Fish Tacos.  They were amazing.  The guacamole was excellent.  The only disappointment was the margarita.  It was very weak and just not good.  Fish taco will bring me back, but the $9.00!margarita needs to be better."}
{"text":"Cannot express how much I love their tacos! They are the perfect size and price. Service is quick and friendly. The bar carries and good selection of local beers which was the clincher for me. It's gets really busy during the cool months so get there early during their happy hour times and you'll get right in. Definitely one of my favorites in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to mexican food or any kind of latin food. I am of Mexican italian decent and my wife is from central america so we know what is good. I was kind of skeptical about this joint due to the name and location. Gave it a chance and WOW I was impressed with the quality of the tacos and other food they had. Very tasty food and is done with pride...I would say it is a little pricy but if your having drinks and a night out its the perfect food to have with a beer,,"}
{"text":"I was craving some Mexican food and was delighted to find this place with all the good reviews! There were four of us that ended up going on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed but we got a table right away. As soon as we sat down we received water and chips and salsa. I have never received such prompt service. We had not even been there thirty seconds! So far, I LOVED this place. Nothing worse then waiting for water in the summertime (ok it was Sept but still felt like summer) in AZ. The waitstaff was fantastic. They were friendly and prompt which is a great combo! Our group ordered two \"Garden Variety Burritos\" (one with no mushrooms ewwww) and two of \"the Beasts.'\" It was fantastic. I was worried there would be too much salt in the food since I have experienced that in the past at other establishments that serve Mexican food. I was pleasantly surprised. It was seasoned to perfection and no one had any complaints. I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Great tacos - loud so you can bring the kids. Great service - always a perfect place for lunch."}
{"text":"Nice hip ambiance, and service was fine, but the food left much to be desired. The house Margarita is unusually sweet and somewhat odd tasting, possibly from the triple sec they add. I ordered the carne asada tacos and the beef was tough with sinew and gristle. The food is expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"Just went to Joyride with the man friend ;) and we had an AMAZING time. What they have in limited menu selections they make up for in extreme flavor and unexpected flavors (can you say roasted pumpkin seeds??). Their alcohol menu is great with the addition of the agua frescas and their full bar. Billy is an AMAZING server; her \"Indian Jones\" hat was very \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and not \"Temple of Doom\". She was very knowledgable about the menu and made our experience great. Hey manager- keep her in mind! You've got a great one on your hands! 

Thank you, Joyride! We'll definitely be back, hoping to see Billy and her fun attitude and fashion trends. We love you!

{"text":"Were seated immediately, giving water and chips and salsa within the first 30 seconds of being seated. The chips were super yummy and the salsa was lightly mild.  We had enough chips and salsa to go around 3 people which is nice. We went for Taco Tuesday, $2 tacos and also some special rates on other products. I got 3 carne Asada tacos and 1 shrimp taco which wasn't featured on the taco Tuesday list. The tacos themselves were small, about the size of your palm. The shrink taco was okay, it was kissing something, like a spice of sals... The carne Asada tacos were amazing, they were seasoned great and grilled to perfection. Very flavorful! For an app I got the Mexican corn taken off the Cobb. It was sweet and had a taste of garlic. Not a lot of cheese or mayo, it was lightly sprinkled on... It was obviously the company's take on Mexican street corn, none the less it was yummy. We also got two sides, pinto beans that were cooked with chorizo and some delicious rice covered in tomatillos sauce. 

Small parking lot in rear and side, we went for an early dinner but by 5 we saw the parking started to build up. The place itself is decorated nicely Ana the staff was friendly. I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The tortilla soup was just plain delicious. I also had some of the nachos with spicy pork and jalapenos and I am pretty sure they were the best nachos I have ever had. The service was below average though. The waitress was not very attentive so we had to keep getting up and asking if we could order food or for more lemons/limes. We came back later and did some shots of tequila and they were extremely expensive... but they were delicious. 

I would go back."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet...

Carne Asada and Crispy Fish tacos....yes!! Sub corn tortilla for the flour on the fish. 
$2 tacos after 2pm on Tuesdays, and from 2pm to 6pm weekdays. There are actually SOOOOOOO many specials. $5 drink specials until 5pm like the other Upward Projects establishments, but some specials until 6pm.
Service is hit or miss but it's better than Windsor, that's for sure..
Sit at the bar as long as there is more than one bartender. We've never had an issue until the one time there was only one guy doing everything.
Pineapple mojitos....that is all."}
{"text":"This place is so cute!  I had the Prickly pear margarita and it was delicious!  Next time I'm going to try the watermelon margarita.  Looks so good. I had the fish tacos.  My favorite was the Baha fish taco.  The shrimp taco and crispy fish taco were also excellent.  My fiancé's favorite was the carnitas tacos.   The salsa is fantastic as well.  Just slightly spicy and chips are served warm. Yum!  It was a little loud in the restaurant, however it was a lot of fun.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Joyride is a perfect combination of delicious food, awesome decor, good service and, if you'll excuse the hippie descriptor, \"good vibes\".  It's cool to see so many people's bikes (think beach cruisers, fixies and Schwinns...not Harleys) outside the restaurant. The restaurant opens almost completely to the outside patios so that the indoor/outdoor feel on a perfect Arizona evening is obviously only going to enhance your experience. The agua fresca I had was delish and we tried a sampling of tacos, appetizers, sides and dessert all of which met or exceeded expectations. The prices are great as well. Of note, the guac is on point, the battered fish taco is tasty tasty and the mandarin and cucumber side salad is bomb.com (who'da thunk?) Shout out to our excellent waiter Justin who was enthusiastic, efficient and most importantly, very nice! Joyride was indeed a joy."}
{"text":"The best creative, fresh and delicious southwestern/baja Mexican style food in The Phoenix Metro Area

I'm partial to the vegetable burro add grilled shrimp. Get that and you're tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"Service was amazing..... Along with the food and must try pineapple mojito.... We definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I heard all of the hype about this restaurant so I tried going there with my friends 2 times now.  Both times we had great service. 5-stars in that section, very nice and attentive. The -2 stars are for the pricing vs. the quantity for food. You can easily rack your bill up here for some of the most standard dishes. Food itself is good. Drinks are good. But I cannot believe how much the menu items are. The wow-factor was not there for me unfortunately.  However, it is worth trying once if you're looking to splurge on a night out."}
{"text":"What I find fascinating are the many sub-par, below average restaurants who prey on the masses of local unsophisticated patrons.  This place is no exception.  The food is truly below average and the service isn't much better.  They should require common uniforms.  The girls walking around had parts of their body exposed and/or hanging out that NO diner should have to see while eating.  Poorly run restaurant that I'm certain will not endure.  This place should have stayed Humpty Dumpty!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff. Food was okay. The desert brownies with ice cream and spiced walnuts were absolutely off the charts. Would go for drinks and desert at minimum!!!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Joyride was disappointing. We showed up and were seated within 10 minutes(the only good thing that happened). When our waiter came to take our order, my friend and I, ordered soft drinks. The waiter said they were running next door to borrow some, and that he would have them out to use in a couple minutes. After he took our order, we asked about our drinks again. He said that he would go get them. The waiter seemed like he was too busy and focusing on everything else. We waited about 15 minutes for our food to come out . After we got our food we asked another waiter if he could get us our drinks. He said that he would go back and check on them. Food was okay. Tacos are overpriced, and the side was bland. After eating, we asked for the check. He charged us for the drinks that we never received. The manager came over, covered in food, and told us that she would take care of the drinks on the check. She brought us back our check, and said that she had given us $5 off for the inconvenience. The drinks were still on the check, so all this did was take of the cost of the drink. 
Nobody on staff seemed happy or like they even wanted to be there, including management. We will not be returning to Joyride."}
{"text":"Good lunch or hang out spot for sure. Hipster approved. Had an order of fish tacos. Not so impressed. Very bland, nothing special. At almost $4 each for a \"street taco\" I would expect a bit more discovery in the taste bud area. However, the tortilla soup was great. Service on the other hand was mildly annoying. Three different employees came to our table during the meal. I'm not quite sure who was the server, the runner, the busser. The one I'm assuming was the server took our order, stopped by once and ...poof. Never saw the person again. We were left sitting with empty dishes and that we-need-to-get-back-to-work-look on our faces way too long. Everyone was nice, but the restaurant manager needs to tighten up the service process if one expects weekday/workday lunch crowd approval."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. Plenty of options for $2 tacos and killer margaritas for $5. Highly recommend the street corn, which was awesome."}
{"text":"Tried it out for the first time this weekend. The drinks (Agua frescas with alcohol) and food were good. I ordered a couple of tacos, and my friends also enjoyed the good (tacos and vegetarian burrito). 

However, the service was blah. They forgot an item and drink we ordered, and they arrived about 20 minutes later. So late that everyone else was done eating. There seemed to be confusion over who was managing our table- different people kept stopping by to tell us the food and drink were coming, but we continued to wait. They did credit our bill, and I'm willing to give them another shot because I liked the food and drinks."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great tacos just small portions for the price. Their home made tortillas are great and it's nice that they don't fall apart. Their spiked fresca drinks are good too.  Fun place for lunch or happy hour."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is hip. Service is very good. Music a little loud. We each had a crispy fish taco. Notice I said taco... not tacos. We expected a little more food based on the price. The tacos here are pretty small. The taco was good but too watery (don't know what that juice was dripping all over my plate). Chips are ok, salsa ok. When I compare what I get from the popular local fast food fish taco place and other Mexican restaurants I have to wonder if this business plan will work.

Quality is ok. Too expensive for what you get. I don't mind spending the money if I feel I am getting my money's worth. Don't know if we will go back or not... probably not."}
{"text":"Joyride is the best new retaurant downtown, hands down.. My waiters were personable and knowlegeable.  If you like postino, federal pizza, and windsor, you'll love joyride, their most recent success.. the staff is attentive, and the management cares about your experience.. Enjoy a hand crafted, organic cocktail, and a glimpse into the street taco world!"}
{"text":"This place is a hotspot for hipsters.  I went there a year ago on a date because she was a big fan of Mexican food, as am I.  She ordered a burrito and I got three tacos: 2 fish and 1 carne asada.  We also got the almond horchata.  

The food was incredibly forgettable.  It wasn't spicy or flavorful in any way.  The presentation was great but who cares if the food is bland.  We were both very disappointed in the food as well as the horchata.  I got the feeling that this place was so busy creating a hipster-friendly environment that they forgot to worry about their food.  

Overall, the place had a cool look, friendly service, and the prices weren't terrible but I'm never going back simply because the food was not that good.  I'll be hitting up Joe's BBQ across the street if I'm ever in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"Joy ride is so hip and perfectly decorated but their street tacos are just not good. The elotes and margs on the other hand...FIRE! I've been there about 5 times now and every time I try a new street taco and am disappointed. From now on when I go to joy ride I will stick with any margarita flavor (I've tried them all, cucumber Serrano is my fave) the chorizo cheese dip and elotes."}
{"text":"Had my 30th birthday gathering here. Food is awesome. Prices were affordable. Staff were friendly and make sure we were good the whole time. I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Kept seeing friends posting pictures from here so figured it would be worth a shot. The cocktails were refreshing and unique. My favorite was the agua Fresca cucumber with vodka. The tacos were great too!"}
{"text":"Carnita Taco was ok not bad at all but nothing spectacular.The cucumber margarita was pretty good not too sweet, but flavorful, which was perfect. The horchata was reallllly sugary and sweet so I just diluted it down a bit with water and it was fine. Overall, not a bad place but not necessarily worth the 50 min drive."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for a date night. My wife and I had a fabulous visit tonight. Food was great, little cool, but the server brought a heater close to our table.  So fun!!  Crispy fish tacos were excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here after hearing good reviews.  Lived up to the hype.  Good spot vintage Palm Springs  vibe.  Sat right away but waited until awhile and no one approached our table about drinks.  Luckily another waitress swung by and took good care of us .  

First bowl of Chips and salsa are complimentary but we also ordered the guacamole.  Guac was yummy - topped with jalapeños so beware .  

Tacos are ala Cart grabbed a few of each carne Asada was my 

Joyride Marg was ok I tend to like my margs a bit sweeter. 

Deff will be back to try some of there other dishes"}
{"text":"I have been to Joyride a handful of times, and while the food was always pretty good. The service (as you can read in plenty of other reviews here) is somewhat less than ideal. I never know who my server is or who will receive my tip.  I'm willing to overlook the wonky service for decent food and a fun atmosphere - however, I can't overlook food poisoning.  

The last time I went to  Joyride I got food poisoning from the chicken tacos (I was the only one at my table who had the chicken, and I was the only one who got sick). I emailed Joyride as well as Upward Projects - explaining what happened in hopes that nobody else gets sick - but my emails were ignored. I expected more professionalism from Upward Projects. I have always had great luck at their other restaurants, but after this experience I won't be returning to Joyride."}
{"text":"After driving past this place since its opening I figured a visit is finally in order. We had 6 people in our party and it took a while to get seated, which was expected. The table was not wiped down when they came to get us so there was a scramble to get it cleaned off (even though it was \"ready\"), but eventually it was clean and read to eat at.

The chip and salsa seem endless and are slightly addictive. Service can be a bit awkward as its hard to tell the patrons from staff as the staff have no set uniforms. 

I ordered the fish street tacos, which were very good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal. The Churros were for desire, not a favorite as they seemed a bit dry and I was not a fan of the dipping sauce. We were not rushed out after dinner and had some time to talk and get caught-up, which was nice.

All-in-all its not a bad place if you like this type of concept."}
{"text":"Everything we had was excellent. Great flavors, reasonably priced, and not too heavy. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"WHO DOESN'T LIKE STREET TACOS!?!?!  I mean, no offense, but if you don't like street tacos, I can't trust you.  Plain and simple.  Hubby and I went here for an early dinner/late lunch/craving prevention.  It was TACO TUESDAY!  So most tacos were only 2 dollars!!!  Jackpot!!! Winning!  One of each please! Thanks! Don't judge me.
On the first go round, I ordered the Crispy fish, the carnitas, and the pork adobada.  Crispy fish was good.  Really tasty and the texture is to die for...That crunchy batter with the flour tortilla and just the right amount of white magic sauce was perfect.  Next up was the carnitas.  Now typically that's a go to for me, but this time is was just good.  It didn't blow my socks off or anything, but it was tasty.  3rd in line was the amazing ADOBADA!  It was SO good.  I think I did a little dance after my first bite.  I loved the flavor, the crunch of the radish and onion, the tons of juice dripping off the meat...Just do yourself a favor and get the adobada, you won't be disappointed!  

We also got the guac as an appetizer, which was overpriced and kinda bland...It could've stood to use a bit more lime, garlic and salt...but the fresh chips kinda helped to salty it up a bit.

I also tried the churros which were good, but the chocolate sauce was blech!!!  I wasn't a fan AT ALL...I wish they served it with fresh whipped cream like they do as Paz :)

All in all it was a great experience!  We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. But it is overpriced and the service is not very good. We had four different waiters, but I don't know which one of them was our actual waiter. We had to flag people down to get actual service. So there was always a long wait between asking for the check between getting the check between getting the check split and getting our change back and the change we got back was not correct. facility itself is fantastic very airy and breezy."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, just not up to par with their other offerings like Windsor and Federal Pizza. I've been twice now, and tried several of their tacos. I think the Cochinita Pibil was my favorite so far, and the sweetness of the pineapple made it stand out. None of the tacos were bad, but no other ones particularly stood out.

On my first trip I had the Cucumber Serrano cocktail, which I quite liked. On the second trip I went with the house margaritas, which were pretty nice by house marg standards.

The decor was nice, and the service was good both times, so no real complaints there. But if you're in that area looking for a tasty, relaxing bite and a drink I think you'll do better at Postinos overall."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant! First of all, visually speaking, the restaurant is so fun, colorful, and just pretty. Great staff who are ALWAYS so friendly! :) My kids (5 and 3 years old) LOVE going there for the yummy chips and food and LOVE the temporary tattoos they get with their meal ;) The drinks are delicious as well. The carne asada nachos are the BEST as well as their tacos (duh). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The staff here is awesome. The food is pretty good, too. We always sit at the bar and they take care of us :) i love all the different salsas and the blood orange margarita is a must!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a couple of friends. The overall ascetics of the place was inviting. Service was good and food was okay nothing spectacular. For what you got and the quality of food I thought it was a tad over priced."}
{"text":"Really cool place particularly on a nice day... They open up all the roll up doors and there's a perfect breeze!! Now to the food... VERY yummy!! We had the street corn and the guacamole for starters. Really great my only quibble ( if I have one) would be, it can be a bit tricky cutting the corn off the cob! However it's well worth the wrestle. My hubby had the carnitas taco and the carne asada... I THINK they were delish but.... Someone pigged them all up w/out sharing a bite!!! He said they were GREAT! I had the pork Adabado and the crispy fish (requested corn tortilla rather than flour and they graciously accommodated) they were both amazing! I had a house margarita which was fine but a bit sour... No matter, followed that up w/a kettle one and soda which was sublime! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times and each time has been a joy! The service is pretty quick even during their busy times! I absolutely love the music they play. Although I could do without the flies that buzz by because of their open windows. I especially love their agua frescas! Fresh food and fun atmosphere! Come here if you're looking for something fun!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first spots my husband and I found when we moved in town. We love the atmosphere, music, and the food is yummy! The ambiance is laid back, but not so laid back you don't see your server for 20 minutes at a time (HUGE pet peeve for me). We eat there more than we probably should admit, but we love it! 

If I had to find a negative it would be that the chips aren't endless...  just give us the chips"}
{"text":"The food here is great- the crispy fish tacos are awesome, as are all the other tacos we've tried. The meat is the farthest thing from dry and is super flavorful. The churros dessert is insanely delicious too!

Side note- if you're not a cilantro fan (I'm not) just know that it's mixed in their pico and they can't really remove it. I had asked for no cilantro on my fish tacos and the bartender didn't know they couldn't remove it and I ended up having to scrape the pico off of the top, leaving me with a tortilla and a piece of fish (not really worth the $4.25 price tag!) the customer service was great though, the bartender was incredibly sincere and offered us a free dessert to make up for it. Would definitely come here again besides the cilantro aspect- we saw a table by us get some Mexican corn that looked super delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place and come often, but the service is HORRIBLE. I understand it's happy hour and they get busy, yet that is no reason to give bad service. Every time I come, I see my server only once and I have to always ask another worker for a refill, more food, etc...I am a server and I have to deal with being busy, although I always give my best service. I expect be same when I go out to dinner. It's weird because it's only this location that gives the worst service! If you want a better experience I'd recommend the Joyride in PHX."}
{"text":"Salsa was very good.   The Enchiladas I had were not very good.  Was not at all impressed with the cochinita pibil tacos, they were not like any I have ever had before."}
{"text":"After a not so great experience joyride reached out and is making the situation right which I appreciate. We will be giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I never like to review a restaurant that opened just 24 hours ago, but I'll make an exception for Joyride. Upwards Projects has this restaurant thing down pat! I met my husband here at 10pm expecting it still to be busy, but there was tons of seating available both inside and outside underneath lanterns hung on a large tree.

I love the decor and ambience. There is lots of fun decorations and bright colors that work well together without being garish. The big U-shaped bar area is fantastic with cushioned, velvety barstools. We were seated at a table near the bussing, but next time, I think the bar area would be the best place, if only for better service.Our waitress wasn't particularly bad, but she didn't check up on us enough. She walked by a few times with a smile, but never stopped to see if we wanted another drink. We always want another drink! Like we often have to do at Postino next door, we started placing orders with the friendly food runners.

The food and drinks lived up to my expectations and then some. I got a veggie torta filled with squash, mushrooms, corn and avocado. I couldn't taste much of the \"white magic\" (the lime aioli), but the pickled jalapenos on the side really punched up the flavor. The telera bread was sweet which paired well with the spice and smokiness of the veggies. My husband said his carne asada burrito was ok. I loved the red salsa that came on the side. The complimentary chips are excellent, crispy and substantial. They come with a green salsa that's pretty good and is different than the typical tomatillo-based salsa verde.

I really wanted to try a dessert (and salad, street corn, guacamole, etc), but the torta and two excellent cocktails left no room. I got the almond horchata with frangelico and the Mazatlan Mule. The horchata was basically dessert and went down very easy like the other cocktails. My husband got a blood orange margarita made with the standard Sauza tequila, and it was much better than any margarita I've had in a long time. Like their sister restaurant Windsor, I don't think you can go wrong with the cocktail menu."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch here on the patio on a Sunday afternoon. The complimentary chips were SO tasty it convinced me to order the nachos...which are made with different (and in my opinion, not as good) chips. What!? Service was so-so, food was better than so-so but not great. There's a strong chance we'll come back but it's definitely not a top choice in Gilbert for Mexican, we find some of the other options much better for us."}
{"text":"Had a very late dinner here and was very excited to try this place out. The atmosphere is very laid back and the hostess nicely greeted us when she saw us walk in. We had the taco platter and ordered the beast burrito. The meat was deliciously flavored and I loved the fact the there tortillas are freshly made! There salsa is so good and spicy and we couldn't get enough. To finish off our meal we ordered churros which tasted freshly made! I can't wait to come back and have some more great tasting tacos!"}
{"text":"We went there yesterday to try it for the first time wow bad Service the tacos were nasty tortillas were cold the fish was bad!! And when we told the waiter he had a attitude about it then we order a shot and there was stuff in it like the shot glass wasn't clean right never will I go there wow I thought it was gonna be good it wasn't !!!"}
{"text":"On my several visits here the tacos have always been delicious. We enjoy sitting on their shady patio. The decor is also very nice."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out with my boyfriend on Cinco de mayo since they were offering $2 carnitas tacos all day. Like all upward project restaurants, it has very cool, hip vibe with a decent size patio...definitely looked like a cool hangout spot to grab drinks with friends. Unfortunately I will not be returning as the food was nothing impressive & service was terrible. The only thing we did like was the complimentary chips & salsa. The tortilla chips were thin & crispy & the salsa was a nice, fresh roasted tomato salsa. So we tried the carnitas tacos...it was decent but nothing I would come back for. I've had way better street tacos elsewhere like Los Taquitos.  So If you're looking for authentic tacos, this is not the place.

As for the terrible service, maybe they were short staffed or that it was cinco de mayo but we came around 9:30-10:00pm (late dinner) and the restaurant was not that packed but a simple \"sorry we're short staffed but we'll do our best to attend to your needs\" would have sufficed & we could have forgiven them for their slow service, not refilling our water or the fact they constantly walked pass our table without acknowledging us.

Will not be coming back & definitely will not recommend this place to our friends."}
{"text":"It's gets high marks for its trendy atmosphere and inventive taco combinations, but I prefer more traditional Mexican street tacos.  This is a fantastic place to go on a date, but there are certainly better taquerias if you simply want great food."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but agree that it sometimes seems a little on the expensive side for what you get during normal hours.  Happy hour prices are great though, we love the $5 drinks and $2 tacos!"}
{"text":"Joyride is our go-to Mexican restaurant. It's fun, fairly inexpensive, has delicious food and most importantly, they are really great with food allergies (from our experiences). I've visited many times before, but realized I never left a review, so here we are.

First off, they serve free corn chips and salsa at all tables, which are gluten-free (YES!). They also don't fry their chips or tortillas in peanut oil (another YES!!). Surprisingly, a lottttt of restaurants int he area use peanut oil in their fryers, which is a big no-no for those with peanut allergies.

Secondly, their drink menu is so great! They have happy hour menu most days of the week, and on Tuesdays, from 2pm to close, they have $2 tacos and $5 margaritas! Highly recommend.

Third, they can virtually adapt most recipes on the menu to your food restrictions, allergies or intolerance's, which is amazing for those avoiding gluten, dairy or eggs. I got a burrito in a bowl, without the tortilla, and without cheese, and it was so delicious (as always!). Their tacos are incredible, and their apps are delicious as well.

Fourthly, I want to give a shout-out to our amazing server, Tory, who took care of us this evening. He was so incredibly patient and knowledgeable about the menu, and took extra precautions to make sure we could eat with a food reaction. THANKS TORY! 

The only thing I need to mention is that parking can be challenging, but you should be able to find street parking if the lots are full.

We highly recommend Joyride (either location), because they are great people, have great food, and really want to make your experience as positive as possible. If you haven't been, go!!"}
{"text":"Trendy new place in downtown Gilbert, adjacent to the equallty trendy Postino.  Joyride has a good menu, and fresh ingredients.  The carne asada taco is excellent, as well as the fish taco.  

There area couple of reasons why I'm only giving three stars.  First, the atmosphere is trying to be very hip and trendy, which I found a bit of a turnoff.  The servers were friendly enough, but I just personally prefer a cozier ambiance, rather than feeling like I'm in downtown Scottsdale.

Also, I thought the prices were a little high.  They offer an excellent in-house salsa, but offer additional \"premium\" salsas for an additional charge.  I like trying different salsas, but found my choices to be fairly bland, and not as good as their house salsa.  The tacos are priced ok, though.

Joyride is a decent restaurant, and I'd definitely try it again - but it didn't make me put it on my \"must-return\" list."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of the nice part of central Phoenix! I ordered a plate of tacos and a side of rice; man was the food good! Washed it all down with a strong mojito. I'd return, the place is a great venue.

One thing I didn't like about the place was the amount of flies just pestering around. But then again, I went to the restaurant during monsoon season and frankly outdoor restaurant concepts like Joyride suffer briefly; I'm surprised there were no mosquitoes!"}
{"text":"I am going to name two things that are musts when you stop here, but above all, there is one ultimate reason. There can be only one. 

The Prickly Pear Margarita. House. Prickly. Pear. Syrup. Ambrosia, straight up nectar of the Gods. And ye be warned, they make 'em potent. Don't let that adorbs cactus glass and that beautiful fuchsia hue distract you. 

Also, that second thing. Churro bites with house made chocolate dip. Because if I learned one thing from my Labor Day Weekend trip to Arizona, it was that Arizona = Churros. 

There's also really cool bartenders here who think Californians are hilarious for some reason. Yes, we say hella. Yes, I did pack entirely San Francisco Giants branded items on this trip. Décor is also on point. Blown glass bottles adorn the bar area and my bestie and I were transfixed by the bulbous red lamp covering that mirrored our faces.

All in all, Joyride is an awesome stop for specialty drinks. I have never tasted anything like that before, and doubt I will again. Can't speak to the dine in options, but they looked tasty. The interactive menu that they have online is pretty sweet. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of all Upward Project restaurants. 

Joyride is a new addition to my list. 

I ordered in. The person over the phone was super nice and helpful, which made my ordering experience that much easier. 

Picking up was a great experience as well. Fast, with great customer service. Food was nicely packed so when we got home, everything was kept fresh and temperature of food was excellent. 

Food was delicious. I do not know what I was fan of more, enchiladas or tacos ;)

They have advised us that now they have a happy hour every Tuesday. We attempted twice already; however, the wait was petty long. We will keep trying as I would like to experience of dining in the restaurant. 

It has perfect location. Parking is well situated. 

I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My family and I came for taco Tuesday, and we got all around great service and food. First they provided is a spot to park our stroller because it didn't fit by our table. We ordered and the food came quickly, the sissy refills were on point too (I believe our servers name was Taylor). I had three tacos with three different types of meat which were delicious. The carnitas was my favorite. The tortillas even seemed hand made. The place had really cool art on the wall. I saw some Star Wars stuff which is always cool. The only thing I kinda bothered me was that the music was too loud because it took away from having a conversation."}
{"text":"Best shrimp tacos and atmosphere. Our favorite place for out of town guests and date night."}
{"text":"First of all, I used the \"Add to Waitlist\" feature on their Yelp page and it was awesome! We arrived just in time and got seated immediately! My friend and I each ordered 3 tacos. My friend loved her fish taco that the waitress recommended and I really loved the shrimp tacos! I was a little sad that my taco shells fell apart and they became pretty messy. I would request flour tortillas next time! They have really good tequila and margaritas as well! It is quite loud in there at night so if your looking for an intimate setting, this probably isn't it. But this is a great place to go with a group of friends! Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and it seems the food quality is dropping off. The salsa is not what it used to be and the food is getting more expensive with more fillers. The Beast Burrito used to be $9.50 and FULL of the BEST carne asada. Now the burrito is packed full with Spanish rice one one side and charge $11.50. No thanks, I'll take my rice on the side. Sad day when a downtown idol takes the back seat. Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I like the food, but they have something wrong with the way they seat people.  I don't know why it is all wrong, as Federal and Windsor don't seem to have a problem.  First off, they say they are on the app \"No Wait\" - but they aren't.  For a while, they showed up, but where listed as 'closed' all the time.  Now, I get a text from 'No Wait' but when I go on the app, I can't find them, and even when I use the link - not there.  Last night I never even got a text that my table was ready.  I am guessing the hostess deleted me.

Anyway, we showed up and there were literally (I counted them) 12 empty tables, and we were going to have to wait 45 minutes.  I guess they were short-staffed - but it is only a guess because she wouldn't tell me why I couldn't have one of those tables.  She was kind of rude.  

I have never been there without there being some fiasco surrounding getting a table.  How could they not have this figured out?  They aren't new at this."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, great service. But the food is expensive and not that good. Today I had the \"The Beast\" burrito: carne asada. It was saucy and tasted like teriyaki beef--so sweet! Come on you guys! That is not how you make carne asada. I will say that the tortilla soup is delicious ... but for real tacos and burritos, I'll go to Phx Burrito House or Mi Patio."}
{"text":"So yummy! Happy hour is definitely a must and my favorite tacos are the standard, crispy fish, and pork. The drinks are a little too sweet for my liking but the food and the atmosphere are so great!"}
{"text":"We love the food and wait staff is great but we probably won't be back. The music was so loud we couldn't even have a conversation. We asked if they could turn it down and we were told no."}
{"text":"Great set up, bright and happy colors. Energetic waiters and waitresses. This company knows what they are doing when they open restaurants. The tacos are amazing and their twist on mixed drinks is quite interesting and unique. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places for tacos. I have been coming here and bringing people I know here since I moved to Phoenix and discovered it in 2014. Just when I thought it couldn't get better I get Morgan as my server/bartender and she made the experience that much more incredible. Kind, knowledgeable and attentive. I will continue to dine here and request Morgan as well. She took it from a five star experience to a ten if I could rate it."}
{"text":"Bruh. The carne asada in the beast burrito was trash. The elote was over priced but was the only saving grace to this god awful place my boyfriend and I tried on a whim. Couldn't get a drink refill for the life of me, but after I'm finished with my meal the waitress decides to refill my drinks. $12 for a cardboard burrito. I enjoyed writing this painfully honest review more than I did the food. 

On the bright side if you love dubstep and terrible remixes of Sam Smith and Adele you'll fit right in with the try hard atmosphere."}
{"text":"After giving this place two times, I will not be returning. The margaritas are like juice and not at all worth the price. Bartender was rude and clearly not liking his job. I tried to give them a little slack since it was Taco Tuesday, but there are way better places out there without the long wait and much better drinks and service."}
{"text":"Good tacos, chips and salsa and great service. Although I wouldn't consider it authentic ol' school mexican it certainly is tasty fare and will definitely be back. Probably my only complaint would be the portion of fish in the crispy tacos other than that good stuff!"}
{"text":"Great food but I've been up for a few hours with what seems to be food poisoning. This is all I've eaten out of the norm."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  From the food to the service to the music to the overall ambiance, it is amazing!  

Make sure to try the street corn!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars. Atmosphere, food, service... A perfect hipster place! Something for everyone on the menu. Nice cocktail list... Not too overwhelming with choices, which is nice!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food, fun atmosphere and fun bartenders.  Makes for a great place to meet friends and relax.   Great guac and the tacos are worth the drive."}
{"text":"My husband visited this place yesterday for lunch it was great!  He had the chicken tacos and I had the grilled fish tacos and they were excellent.  We both had the Joy Ride Margaritas and they were, by far, some of the best ones we've ever had. Fun atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We had a $5 picture of an outstanding IPA and the best burritos we've ever had. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cheap tacos.  Cheap beer.  Excellent quality of both.  Service was great, I believe the guy behind the bar was Gary.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I ventured here for some prime time World Cup viewing as well as  some delicious noms (or food, if you will).

First thing's first. This place has the coolest atmosphere  ever (As far as restaurants go). Complete with laid back tunage and retro decor, I was instantly enamored. The smell that emerges from the kitchen is also to die for. Did I mention that they have a weekend happy hour that includes alcoholic agua frescas as well as local pitchers of beer? My goodness... could it get any better...

The food options are plentiful and everything is extremely fresh. I can't even begin to describe to you the wonderful appeal to the senses that each bite provides. My boyfriend ordered a make your own type of burrito and I ordered the chicken.  (Which sounds plain and boring but is anything but!) Inside the chicken burrito was butternut and chayote squash, spinach, mushroom, avocado, corn, queso, tomatillo salsa, pico gringo and aji amarillo. (i'm salivating just remembering it!) I also washed it down with an ice cold glass of some Four Peaks.... 

Overall, if you aren't in the area, this place is worth the drive. Devine food, amazing customer service, and extreme satisfaction all around. I will DEFINITELY be coming back."}
{"text":"Loved the service.  ordered the Fish, shrimp and carnita tacos.. classic. Oh My Goodness in every bite. Great portion, not feeling stuffed but very satisfied. We got there pretty late, on a random drive to find a new restaurant. Will be back!! Thanks everyone there!!"}
{"text":"We were seated promptly.
The menu was simple and easy to read.
Prices ... Some were slightly pricey.
We liked the ambience. Retro fun! ^_^
Service was prompt, and those who helped us seemed knowledgeable of their offerings.

We ordered tacos and chimis. Oh and salad as well. We liked the fact that it's not processed. However, it seems to lack flavour. It's either salty, spicey, or tangy. 

Their chips were yummy, and like the fact that Darth Vader kept us company! Lol

Give this spot a go! ^_^"}
{"text":"Every Tuesday you can find me at Joy Ride. You can't beat $2 tacos and $5 margs. The service is exceptional and the managers go above and beyond to ensure the best dining experience. 

LARRY is the man"}
{"text":"The guacamole is fantastic.  My wife and I can ride our bikes there.  Occasionally they have a special that if you ride your bike you get free tacos on your next vist."}
{"text":"Solid bet for lunch or dinner in the Gilbert area. I live in Arcadia, but grew up in the East valley and have many friends who still live out on the east side. Since most of them have babies now, I am always looking for decent spots in the east valley to meet for lunch, etc. since it's easier for me to travel (no kids) than it is for them. 

Joyride is similar to several other iterations of the same sort of upscale Mexican/taco concept, like Sol or Barrio Queen. They have a nice deal where if you order three tacos they give you a free side, which rounds out the meal. 

I had the veggie, shrimp and ahi tacos (photo posted) and they were all good. I liked the shrimp and veggie the best, might switch out the ahi for a different option on the next visit. The prices were reasonable for this sort of restaurant  and my friend was pleased that they had decently priced kids menu. 

All in all, we enjoyed our visit and I would certainly visit agin or hit up the Phoenix branch."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was terrible. I have got to Postinos next door and had the most outstanding service but this place was laughable. First, we had reservations for 6:30 on a Monday and we had to wait with our kids until after 7 to be seated. It is my understanding that it you have  a reservation at a restaurant they will plan for your table to be ready at the time you reserved it.

Then there was our server, Michael. Well, Michael seemed to me not to have a care in the world. We had two tables and I guess two servers. My daughter sat at the other table but we informed Michael that we would like her dinner on our check he said, that's not my table. Um, okay but we still would like her \"kids\" meal on our tab. Okay, I'll take care of that he said. We ordered our meal and he/we forgot our son's \"kid\" meal. I had to wave him down to order it. I said he'll have the quesadilla, Michael asked no other questions. Like what would he like to drink? What side would you like him to have? Nope, just said okay and took off. I had no time to ask for the additional parts of my son's meal. He is 2 and was climbing all over the booth like any other terrible 2 year old. Finally, when I got a second to ask for his chocolate milk I said doesn't he get a side too. Michael said, oh I ordered him the fruit. Um, okay, I hope he likes the \"fruit\" thanks for giving us a choice. I hope he isn't allergic or have some sort of other problem with \"fruit\". Why would he take the chance and just lazily order what \"he\" thought was right for my child. I had to ask twice for the chocolate milk to because Michael forgot.

Oh, and guess what? My friends at the other table got the bill for my daughter's meal. Really? After we specifically said, \"please put her meal on our tab\". Instead of trying to get Michael's attention again, we just told our friend we would pay him later and we left because it was getting super late and our kids were melting down.

Michael, you need to learn how to serve people food. It isn't super hard. I did it for 7 years, you just have to care. Maybe go over to Postinos and ask any one of their servers for some training."}
{"text":"It's meh. I'm not a huge fan of the tortillas they use for their tacos. The meats are so-so. I'd rather hit my local taco shop to avoid the wait and the prices here. The margaritas were very good and compensated for the lack luster food."}
{"text":"I recently started coming here for taco Tuesday.. Every Tuesday.. Not only for the amazing food but the excellent staff! Kim the hostess greets me by name! I've never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"Yummo! Went around 6:45 on a Thursday and had a 25 min. wait to eat inside (outside was no wait). You can use the No Wait app on your phone to make it even easier. A kind gentleman offered us water while we waited outside by the misters. They sent a text once our table was ready. We were at a four top near the bar in really cool looking, comfortable chairs. Immediately, our server, Allie, greeted us and we were given warm chips and salsa. We liked the chips but found the salsa to be mediocre. The decor was neat, kinda hipster with funky wallpaper and multi-colored chairs. The bar area is pretty big with cool lights hanging down. Those were pretty much the only lights because it was super dark and loud inside. 

We ordered:
-Street corn
-Nachos with chicken
-Carnitas taco
-standard (chicken) taco 
-crispy fish taco
-cucumber orange salad (as side that comes with 3 tacos)

The corn was brought before the rest of our food with a knife to cut it off the cob. The best street corn I have ever had and the large cob slathered in cojita cheese and spices was well worth the $5. Get this! Hubby liked his nachos, especially the addition of magic white sauce. He did feel that the addition of chicken was overpriced for what he received. 

To try a variety, I ordered the three tacos and cucumber salad. They forgot to bring fish taco and the salad with my meal but this was quickly remedied. The salad side was great-vinegar based and refreshing. The standard taco was not very good and lacked any flavor. The carnitas was pretty good but again, could have used a touch more salt or sauce. The crispy fish taco was great and the ingredients added all the necessary textures to make each bite mouth watering. Even though they are small, I found the tacos to be filling.

We will definitely be back on a Tuesday to get $2 tacos and $5 margaritas. The prickly pear and watermelon versions looked fabulous. For all that we ate, our bill was only $32. Great date night meal and we are excited to have tried this out. Park in the large free lot off of Page to avoid parking headache. Now go get your taco on!

{"text":"I previously came to this taco house on tues and it was absolutely packed, which is an amazing sign that you've struck gold! I was able to snag a seat at the bar and only indulged in a beverage due to how busy it was and the margarita's were fabulous. Morgan was a wonderful bartender who gave me detailed rundown on her favorite drinks even tho by the looks of the bar she didn't have time she treated every customer as if they were the only one there! She was great. I came back today and had two carne asada tacos and two chicken tinga tacos and they were also great!! Perfect size, didn't skimp on meant and there presentation was great too! I'll definitely make this place a favorite of mine!!"}
{"text":"Everything started out good. The girl who took our name was super friendly and nice and took us to our table, she then quickly brought us waters and chips. Two baskets of chips was pretty nice since it was only 4 adults and 2 kids. Moments laters our waitress showed up and look like she was pretty nice she took our orders my dad ordered the nachos with carne asada I ordered the beast. My dad also got a agua fresca and the kids a kids meal. The waitress never brought my dad or the kids their drink someone else had to. Just to say the least our own waitress didn't even bring the food. She would pass by and then turn around. The nachos came and they were made with braised beef. I was cutting into my burrito a long hair was in there they took it back and still had to pay for it..My dad kept getting refills of the agua but little did we know they were charging him everytime. So food was an ok and service just sucked. Never had been to this one in Gilbert only the one on Central. We live in Tucson and decided to go since we had such a great experience from the other one but never again will we be back!!"}
{"text":"2nd trip and not disappointed. Wait staff super friendly and responsive. Tacos are amazing with Grilled Shrimp and Pork Adobada being a tie for 1st. Local beer on tap which I think is important and dog friendly for the dog crowd."}
{"text":"Yum! My husband and I came here for a quick, early dinner. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Taco and the Chicken Tinga Taco. My husband ordered the Chicken Burrito, which I had a couple bites of. The flavors of each were so different from the other, but equally scrumptious. Not to mention, you can never go wrong with free chips and deliciously spicy salsa. This place not only has delicious food, but the atmosphere and set up are great! I definitely want to come back at night to enjoy the lights, fireplace and drinks."}
{"text":"As cute as this place was, I was so disappointed in the tacos. I got the chicken tinga taco and the meat was very tough! The one thing I hate is when I get rough chicken....boo! The flavor was unfortunately a bit bland. I was expecting more spice due to the fact that there was a fire emoji next to this item on the menu. I also wasn't a huge fan of the chips. I typically like thin crispy chips but I was more concerned about my unimpressive taco. My sister got the shrimp taco and said it was great! So if you like shrimp, I'd go for the shrimp!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great :) We ordered only tacos for Taco Tuesday, one of each. They were all incredible, and I recommend the carne asada tacos. The meat is excellent, seasoning superb, and the service, well, it's reasonable. We waited for an hour, with warning, but the servers looked overloaded. I'm so impressed by the food, though, and that's why i am readying 4 stars."}
{"text":"When a taco house commands this type of price tag, I except very very good food, and we gave it a chance.. 

We noticed immediately that the waiter was very attentive and they kept refilling our cups every 2 seconds... that's good I guess, but it's a little distracting. Even though I'm not a very big person (at least that's what I think), there was not much elbow or table room. Almost a little crowded for me. For dinner time, the music can be a little higher than the normal 'family' restaurant, but I love the music selection! Lots of good rock with a mix of dance. I can see myself and a few friends hanging out here for drinks, but probably not bring the 3 year old back.

The nacho app platter is probably going to be our favorite.. it was plentiful! The rotisserie chicken juicy and tender, fresh and full of flavor. Very soft to cut, and easily pulled apart. The eggplant/veggie mix and lime rice that it came with were to die for.. very light and delicious. Just enough spice. Hubs had the horchata, steak burrito and grilled fish taco, in which he said was delicious. Kiddo had the quesadilla kid's meal.. Food is definitely more elevated than other 'gourmet' mexican food restaurants.

All came to was $65 for 2.5 people. Tasty food, lively and interesting decor, but pricey food if you don't mind that."}
{"text":"Tacos here are fantastic!  Try to make it on taco Tuesday, but expect to wait a while."}
{"text":"The absolute perfect place to hang out, eat AMAZING tacos, and have a few margaritas. The servers are very attentive and friendly. Great service even when they are busy. They have a nice outdoor patio with space heaters and a fire place which is a plus. And..... $2 tacos on Tuesday. BOOM!"}
{"text":"Terrible management... arrogant and no courtesy whatsoever .... company should think very very hard about the way management treats its customers... terrible..."}
{"text":"We (spouse and kids) love it there. And they totally welcome kids - LOVE that they have organic milk to give the kiddos. My toddler loves the beans and nachos. The chiliquiles and enchiladas are good."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos!!! Gluten free options. Perfectly satisfying. The margaritas are incredible and only $5 on Tuesdays! We had the same waitress twice in a row, and she rocks! She brought out an extra margarita that they made and our night was made. 10/10 recommend. If only there were 10 stars. There was this one weird thing... a guy named John making duck noises. But at least he's cute. 

Also, for sure order the street corn. No regrets."}
{"text":"For my first time, I decided to go full out. I ordered a pineapple agua fresca, a carne asada quesadilla, and three carne asada tacos with joy rice. Chips and salsa were complimentary. 

My pineapple juice was great! Just the right amount of sweetness! 

Chips and salsa were okay. It needed more spice and flavor. The salsa tasted sweet to me. 

My carne asada quesadilla was BOMB! Probably the best food item I ordered. 

I got my meal about 35 minutes later. The waitress took forever with everything and I didn't like the tacos. The meat had a teriyaki flavor to them topped with some more sweet salsa. I disliked them very much. The rice was better than the tacos, but still tasted off. 

The decoration was nice. The atmosphere was clean. The best way I could describe this place was \"Mexican food with a hippie twist.\" If that's what they were going for, they nailed it. This place would not be my first choice or on my list to go to again."}
{"text":"Because this place is so close to home, I feel badly to say that I'm not a fan. The first time we came here many months ago, it took 30-45 minutes just for our food to arrive at the table. I don't remember disliking the meal, or anyone else having complaints. However, last night we went back and did not like anything. 

The kids nachos were burnt and not very appetizing. 

The Baja tacos were dry, bland, and the added salsa and other garnishments on top did not help make it better.  

Pinto beans had no flavor..

The beef in the beef tacos was shredded and over cooked (Crispy over cooked). Not my preference for a beef taco I guess. 

My boyfriend really disliked that we didn't have 1 waiter. We had several different people (some waiters, some bussers) come to our table to try and assist. What I really disliked the most, more than anything else was how loud the music inside was. It was way too loud for the place. You had to fight to talk louder than the music, that's just not enjoyable. It's a restaurant with families and kids inside, not just a bar. 

I'm giving 2 stars because I really liked the 1 busser we saw more than once who came to our table more than once and was very friendly."}
{"text":"double wow, I had friends from France visiting, me, they were staying at the Best Western Hotel on 16th and Northern, and wanted to find something close, so I used Yelp, and what a great choice, first time ...would diffidently   come back and bring new friends to this fantastic place....wonderful ..."}
{"text":"Solid. Great service! Food was very good. Price is right and you should not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent food, drinks are good, nice ambiance.  Service and food has been  hit or miss  for me. I love tacos but this isn't  my to go to place."}
{"text":"So disappointed....Been to the location in Phoenix and it was so great, everything from the staff to the food, not here in Gilbert.  Went in late last night about 10:40pm the posted hours are open until 12am so figured we had plenty of time.  We were greeted and sat immediately. While we were given water and had drink order taken at 1045 pm we were told it was last call for the kitchen and to hurry and order. We ordered Guacamole, and each ordered 2 tacos, we also requested pico since the salsa that came with the complimentary chips were too spicy for our taste.  The pico was awful it came out warm and tasted off but since we placed the order we have not seen our server, he was cleaning and getting ready for closing, plus it wasn't busy. The tacos were good but that's really all I can say.  Had I never been before it would be my last, its my last time at this location, I may try Phoenix again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Today I tried Joyride Taco House for the first time. There was a lot of rave and talk about this place, so I have been wanting to try it. It is usually really crowded, so I never want to wait, but since today was Easter, there was no wait. I read a lot of reviews about the service not being good, but all of the staff, waiters and waitresses were nice to us. I got a carne asada taco and the standard taco. They were both pretty good, but I think the carne asada taco was better than the standard taco. The tacos were both $3.75, but on Tuesdays they are $2. You get complementary chips, salsa and water right away before you even have time to look at one thing on the menu. They were quick with that which I liked. The restaurant is pretty hipstery and cool. I like the feel. I would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"Very average. Kind of a hit and miss. One day it's pretty good, the next day things aren't seasoned right. Went on a Tuesday for taco Tuesday. 1.5 hr wait time. Walked around downtown Gilbert and they texted me when the table was ready, which was nice. (So we didn't have to wait at the door and lose our spot in line) Not all of the tacos on the list are $2. Well, the best ones on the list aren't $2. Lol. But if you get the $2 tacos they're pretty filling and it's a pretty good price, but not the best tacos in AZ for us taco enthusiasts. Still on the hunt!"}
{"text":"The place was really nice we sat outside on the patio which had the fire place and the lights made it cozy and comfy. The food wasn't really that great the tacos were loaded with too much cabbage and veggies barely any meat and the nachos had the white magic sauce which was really gross maybe not for my taste buds. Customer service was great!"}
{"text":"This is how a restaurant should operate. Amazing staff, amazing food, amazing atmosphere, and amazing rolls of toilet paper with their logo stamped on it.  

Gabby, Daniel, Ashley, Jeremy (501), all take care of us very well every time we visit!  Even the new faces working there make us feel at home.  

If you come to town, are planning a trip to uptown, or just need a nice place to dine with friends without hassle, please come take a Joyride!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Joyride tacos, they are so delicious. The carne asada is so flavorful and the chicken tinga tastes so authentic. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some good tacos!"}
{"text":"Good food and good drinks! The ambiance is chill and the happy hour menu is great as well!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all of the great reviews on the food at Joyride. I visited last week with my son. I love the atmosphere, the service was great. The food however, was terrible. We had the nachos. very little cheese (not melted) and too much of a white sauce with a very strange flavor, did not enjoy them at all.  Also tried the carne asada tacos. The meat has a very sweet flavor, very noticeably sweet. When I asked about it, they told me the meat is marinated in orange juice and does have a sweet flavor. They traded them out for the shredded beef tacos which I also did not enjoy. The corn tortillas on all the tacos are soft and quickly become soggy so the whole thing falls apart when you try to pick it up. My son had the red chile tamales. Besides red chile, they also had strips of carrots and zucchini inside (not indicated on the menu). The beans had no flavor. We love mexican food but were so disappointed. Despite the fun decor and atmosphere, we would not go back. If you are looking for good, authentic mexican, this is not the place. It's nothing like Carolina's or La Canasta (very good simple authentic mexican food) - they can't even compete with Macayos. The chips were ok, didn't like the salsa though. In addition, our bill was over $30. I don't mind paying for good food but expensive for terrible food? Seems like the kind of place that gets a lot of one time customers."}
{"text":"Way better than Blanco if you're looking for Americanized  Mexican food. The salsa isn't spicy enough that they bring out with the chips, but ask for the habanero instead if you like spicy food and they will gladly oblige. I have never had an issue with service. Always been prompt and polite. 

The tacos are great and the food is moderately priced. Nice ambiance too. Perfect spot for a date night or girls' night out."}
{"text":"First off, I love how open and hipster - looking this restaurant is. The staff is nice. You can spot the manager keep going around checking on customers. Their tacos are great with beautiful presentation. Tortilla soup has a fresh taste with a subtle kick so be careful if you're not good with spicy food. 
I came during happy hour so I decided to order a fresh pineapple  juice with rum. However, I'm pretty sure they forgot to put rum in there. The manager happened to check on us right then so I told him I didn't really taste the alcohol. Immediately, I watched him making me a new drink at the bar. This time, he made sure he filled the glass with what tasted like 50% rum ;) Great service recovery. Will definitely come back again to try another dish on the menu."}
{"text":"Went in last night with my family and this place was packed! As soon as we walked in, the bartender said that it was open seating in the couch area. We walked found a couch table and someone else very rudely said, \"it's not open seating.\" Her tone was like \"duh.\" I apologized and explained that we weren't sure where we are allowed to sit and she pointed to the section. 

We sat....And sat...,and sat. No one came to us, so I got up to order drinks from the bar, and they told me someone would be right over. I saw the same woman who scolded us before and explained that we've been sitting and no one has come over and she said someone would be right over. No one came...

We were there for a total of 45 mins from when we walked in to when we walked out. We never were able to order a single thing.

It was weird to say the least."}
{"text":"This taco joint has a retro feel to it. They have a pretty decent lunch menu (plus taco Tuesday starting at 2pm). They bring out chips and salsa for you to eat before ordering (chip refills cost $2)."}
{"text":"Shelby was awesome.  It was our first time there.  She recommended the perfect sides and tacos.  Definitely will be back. They had us at 5 dollar pitchers of beer ."}
{"text":"Excellent food, awesome atmosphere,  and even better staff. A must go if you near bye, actually it's just a MUST no matter where you are."}
{"text":"Friday night 7pm

Food: excellent, no nonsense presentation carnitas, fish and  pork tacos were delicious, not over-marinated or so stuffed w extra stuff that you wondered if there was any meat.  Very Tasty. Very Filling.  Kale salad also delicious...new favorite since Zinburger no longer offers a kale salad.  Get the Mexican corn appetizer.  It's messy but oh so delicious! CHips standard--warm and crispy, salsa excellent (flavorful, smoky. We went through three bowls!). 

Drinks: excellent.  Margaritas are yummy 

Service: above par especially for as BUSY as it was
Wait time: reasonable for a busy Friday night (just under 30 min)...hostess was amazing during the wait. Indoor and outdoor seating with roll up bay doors for ventilation when needed. 

Noise level: extreme. Difficult to hear general conversation, background music added to the noise level. (Not a restaurant for romantic whispering!) Great place for gathering of friends. Fun atmosphere, great food and drinks   

Joyride is excellent....indoors needs a noise dampening system but overall great atmosphere, excellent food and drinks and service."}
{"text":"Gilbert definitely has a new spicy hot spot, Joyride Taco House complete with festive decor with a relaxed and friendly atomosphere! I joined friends and family on opening night 7 in all, Justin our waiter handled us like a pro. Not only was he a good waiter but everytime I blinked there was someone at our table with water, drink refills or clearing our table asking us if we needed anything else, they rock the team work attitude!  From the homemade chips & fireroasted salsa of which we devoured 3-4 helpings to the tasty chicken tinga, shrimp & scallop tacos,chicken nachos,machaca burritos, empanadas and El Domingo dessert with carmelized pineapple, caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream we finished every tasty bite! 
An extra thank you for replacing my picky princesses taco, which came with beans she wasn't willing to eat, once the beans were gone so was her taco! Happy kid, happpy Mom!
This is the place to go to add a little spice in your foodie life! I'm looking forward to going back to try the variety of drinks and dive into the charred habenero \"melt your face\" salsa! Oh yes, and more chips please!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to go to Joyride on a lunch date and give it a try.  After many good recommendations and reviews, I would have to say this place met and exceeded expectations.

The chips and salsa were phenomenal.  The chips were fresh and crispy, but didn't taste like the other paper thin generic chips served at other chain establishments.  The salsa was also very fresh and flavorful, and had a great kick to it.  It was a little spicy for my wife though, which is not necessarily a good thing.

I ordered a quesadilla and my wife ordered a few tacos and we split the meals.  We only finished about half the quesadilla and had half a taco left after we were both stuffed.  The food was great!  Great flavors and awesome presentation.  I wasn't surprised at food or service based on reviews and will be returning here to enjoy another lunch or dinner soon.  

The staff was very friendly and the service was excellent.  It looked like a replica staff of the one at Postino.  I'm not sure when Gilbert suffered a hipster movement, but apparently this historic Downtown Gilbert area is attractive to the new age hippy as a place of employment.  Regardless, the staff was pretty good and service was above average. 

Joyride would be a great Saturday afternoon spot to have a couple of drinks and some tacos and I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I did not want to write a review based on my first experience but now that I've gone twice I have to put in my ten cents... First off, I love the decor and love their bar. I'm a big fan of Upward Project but this place isn't my cup of tea...the first time I went it was opening week. One of the owners spilt a glass of water on me but they compensated by giving our table a complimentary appetizer. We had the ceviche and am glad it was complimentary because it did not taste that great. I ordered one of the burritos  and asked for enchilada style...the sauce was sweet. How can chile sauce be sweet?!? The rice was not cooked and the beans were bland....since it was opening week I decided not to judge the place by my first meal..

We decided to give it another try. The food again was lackluster. And the service was great at the beginning but after they dropped off our food we never saw our server again. Thank goodness they have other options that I enjoy. Just wished Joyride would was more authentic with the flavors..."}
{"text":"This restaurant was retro 1960's in decor and super fun! The food was superb and the service was phenomenal! I highly recommend this establishment. I went there for lunch but it looks like they have a great happy hour as well.

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The tacos are pretty good. Basic soft tacos. Today i tried the chilaquiles and they were ok. Not the chilaquiles I'm used to. Basically layered tostada shells with chicken and a little sauce in between. The service is very good and all of the servers were very polite and attentive. It's convenient from where I live so will come back."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this hyped up place. Granted $2 tacos (only for taco Tuesdays) seem like a great deal, you can find other places that taste better and cost around the same amount.

Cons:
-Long wait on taco Tuesday (over 2 hours for my party of 5) we came at 7pm and didn't get in and get our food till 9:30pm
-Tacos, their star dish, was just okay. Some were flavored well, others weren't, which makes it not worth the long wait.


Pros:
-Friendly service and workers (my party was kind of obnoxious and they handled us so well - they deserve 5 stars for service)
-Yummy margaritas 
-Yummy Mexican Street Corn

Would I come back to this place again? Yes I would, but on a different day where it isn't so busy and to venture out on their menu. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the 2 hour wait just to get seated (something I'm not used to for dining in AZ). And also because I think their tacos were just okay compared to other places which have them for cheaper and shorter wait time."}
{"text":"Yummy! Great atmosphere and good food. Loved the outside seating. The fish tacos were very fresh and the chicken tings very flavorful. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I stop by whenever I'm in the neighborhood. Lots of gluten free options. The shrimp tacos are my favorite, followed by the chicken tinga tacos. Very good chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Tacos I've had in years!!! We enjoyed sitting outside for lunch in downtown Gilbert where you can find many new eateries that are also very, very good."}
{"text":"First time I came here was on a Friday night and the wait was too long, so we decided to take a seat at the bar. 

First round of chips and salsa are on them. We decided to order 3 tacos -- carnitas and crispy fish ( my favorites, strongly recommend) and the braised beef ( it was ok, felt oily). You get to pick a side for $1 each but we opted to pick the Mexican street corn as our side and it is amazing!!! That's my favorite thing they have on the menu. 

For drinks I love love love the pineapple mojito. It tastes so good and refreshing, although I feel like there's really not enough alcohol in it. We also tried the margaritas and those definitely kicked my butt. We tried prickly pear ( felt a little sweet ) and cucumber Serrano -- very good!

I love the atmosphere in here, very laid back. I like the decorations, just everything about it makes me feel like I'm in Cali."}
{"text":"I think as far as the food is concerned, Joyride deserves 5 stars. I had two of the carne asada tacos and one of the carnitas tacos. The carne asada tacos were among the best I've had. So tasty, such flavor, wow!  The carnitas taco was also super good. I ordered a side of the habanero salsa and while it was not as hot as I was hoping for, it had a lot of flavor to go along with the heat. Don't let the fact that it contains habanero peppers scare you off, it is more than doable, even for the chili challenged. Maybe they should make a ghost pepper salsa.  My wife ordered a pair of the baja fish tacos. I must admit, even though I'm usually not a seafood person, the bite I had was
also tasty. If you like horchata, do yourself a favor and try their \"spiked\" horchata with amaretto. It's really good and the fresh ground cinnamon on top was a nice touch.  Overall, I'm looking forward to hitting this place again. I wish I could say that I would sample more of their offerings but I'm not one that likes to \"go off the reservation\" once I find something I like.  Only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is because, we sat at the bar, and the staff was a lil slow in responding to empty drink glasses. Yes, a lil room for improvement but not a big deal. Give Joyride Taco Shop a shot!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and staff is friendly. Very casual and laid back. The furniture almost has a retro feel to it. I definitely love the free chips and salsa. The only thing that turns me off is everytime I give this place a chance on their tacos the meat is not hot. This last Thursday I went the carne asada I ordered was a bit warm but just didn't satisfy. The taco Tuesday deal has to be the best day to try these out for those who haven't been."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos! Any of them I like standard or fish! Bartenders are all so cool and fast and recommendations are on point! Super cool spot!"}
{"text":"My night was full of juxtaposition during my first visit to joyride. Let me explain... My blind date asked what I was in the mood for and I said tacos. He suggested joyride and he was handsome online so I figured what the heck. He said they were the best tacos in town and that was the only thing we agreed on all night. We arrived at our table with chips and salsa served immediately and to my pleasant surprise the chips were slightly warm and salted. The conversation was just plain salty.  I had a shrimp taco, a veggie taco (hold the shroom), and the standard. We connected immediately...tacos not my date. The chips and salsa arrived promptly, the chemistry did not. The servers work together as a team so you never feel forgotten unlike my date who forgot my name. He kept calling me bro!  One of our servers Mark was very attentive and had an infectious smile. 

Joyride:1 Bumble:0

Shout out to Posy for recommending all my tacos. Couldn't be happier with her acute sense of what the customer wants."}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out with friends and catch up on a Saturday night. 

The aguas frescas (with and without alcohol) were delicious, also making it a great place for drinkers and not drinkers alike. We followed the suggested mixings (ie gin and citrus agua fresca), and they were dead on.

The band was fun and loud but not too loud. 

We had the ahi stack, which tasted very fresh. And the chips were perfect. 

Would love to go back. Seemed much more chill and fun than the place (postinos) next door."}
{"text":"This place is so damn good. That's kind of all I have to say. Definitely recommend. I love all the upward projects restaurants but this is my favorite. The interior design of the place is genius. And branding is impeccable. 

Keep up the good taco work!"}
{"text":"Omg. I have no words. I asked for a manager who did not even acknowledge my presence. Whatever."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience!!!! Everything is gorgeous! Indoor and outdoor areas have a fantastic look and feel. What a wonderful place to curl up and chill. 
Just Escape or maybe even be romantic. 
The food? What is there to say? Perfect. Unbelievably yummy and creative!! 
A MUST SEE.
A must return too!!"}
{"text":"The food and the service were great. They have tasty vegetarian options, which is very exciting to me. This will definitely be a place I regularly visit."}
{"text":"Great place to have a quick bite and a beer only if you're sitting at the bar otherwise you're going to have a long wait"}
{"text":"The customer service is unparalleled to any other Mexican restaurant I've been to. Their happy hour is 11-6 which is an alcoholic's haven...not saying that's me, but I truly enjoy this place. If you are ready to indulge in light Mexican cuisine try their Pork Adobada taco or the Carne Asada Nachos, by the way... Happy hour food prices are amazing! They even have a healthy side option such as the orange cucumber salad. The point is, this place is a must especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"Their service surpasses their food, but that isn't a bad thing because their food is pretty dang good. They have a decent selection of food and similar to their company sibling Positions, have achieved a remarkable atmosphere that makes ya' just want to relax. Joyride is a decent place to grab some gourmet tacos."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not here every single week is because the wait is always so dang long. 

Besides that, this place is the bomb! One of my favorite places to get some tacos. My favorites are the standard and the chicken tinga. Go with those if you're a chicken and avocado fan! 

They also have really awesome margaritas! Traditional and some other unique flavors like cucumber and prickly pear. 

ALSO, be sure to stop by for taco Tuesday! 2 dollar tacos and $5 margs....score!"}
{"text":"Fun vibe and great staff. We came for happy hour and sat at a booth in their indoor/outdoor dining room. Free chips and salsa all night long. Drinks ranged from good to great. Love the $5 mini-pitchers. I forgot how much I like the San Tan Epicenter, which I used to order from Postino next door.  Some of the cocktails were a little sweet for my liking but they offered good pours. The aguas frescas tasted good too but I had to ask for some extra kick from the not-as-strong liqueurs. Can't say anything about food other than it seemed overpriced. Irrelevant side note: I really enjoyed the wheel knobs on the bathroom sinks."}
{"text":"Went out of our way on a Sunday to experience something new, first time to this place was looking forward to a margarita with my boyfriend. We ordered two flavors and we both thought they were too sweet. We  also ordered the ceviche which was so so - very pre-made - not fresh.  Add poor service due to an inexperienced server and understaffing.  Our waitress was missing in action and we had to beg for service from anyone who walked by who looked like the were employed at Joyride.  The only reason we offer 2 stars is for the location.  Great location - which proves that you can survive as a restaurant with bad food and service as long as you have a good location.  Choose any other along the same road and you will do better than we did!!!"}
{"text":"Had the crispy fish taco and the carne asada taco and they were probably some of the best tacos I've ever had. They were well seasoned with great toppings. The fish was fried perfectly and the meat was also cooked very well. Bonus: we came during happy hour which is from 2-6 pm M-F and got them for $2 each!! As an appetizer, we had the Mexican corn.. Delicious!! They also have authentic Mexican drinks such as horchata, which I tried and was very impressed. First round of chips is complimentary and waiter was very attentive. Will return."}
{"text":"Not bad; we'll probably put it in the rotation of places to eat, but it really doesn't stand out.

-Food was good. I had three standard tacos with a side of pinto beans and was happy with everything. High quality marinated chicken, and an avocado slice on top was a great addition.

-Service: um, ok. Our waitress was friendly, but service was somewhat slow. Took 5-10 minutes for our waitress to show up after we were seated, 5 minutes for our drinks to come out, then another 5-10 for her to return to take our food order. We stopped in for lunch on our day off, but if I had to return to work within an hour I would have been getting nervous...

-Value: No major issues. We averaged about $17 per person. We missed Taco Tuesday by an hour :( (it starts at 2pm). Seriously though, a Mexican restaurant charging $2 for seconds on chips?? That takes some brass ones. Not cool.

-Atmosphere: I really like the 50s/60s decorations. It fits the neighborhood and the building well. The patio surrounds three sides of the restaurant and looks like it would be beautiful after the sun goes down, but there's not a lot of shade out there, so avoid during the day. The background music was pleasant, but it was way too loud. We had to raise our voices just to converse.

One major positive that you don't really see with these trendy/hipster type of restaurants is that this place is good for both kids and adults. A lot of the newer restaurants in the valley seem to make their restaurant like a nightclub that serves food, but this place the whole family could easily enjoy.

-Parking: The restaurant was about 85% full for lunch and we snagged the last parking spot. I could see this being a problem on a Friday/Saturday night. We were there for a Tuesday lunch.

-Bathroom: The bathrooms are individual one person at a time rooms, so they're probably empty over 50% of the time. In the one I used there was a pyramid of 15 rolls of toilet paper stacked on a cabinet with a lit candle in front of them. You do the math."}
{"text":"Great experience. Nice people start to finish and absolutely considerate. We simply wanted an appetizer and the nachos fit that desire and were amazing!"}
{"text":"I blew it!  I had the job of ordering a big birthday dinner to be catered by Joyride Taco House in Phoenix.  The ordering process could not have gone more smoothly.  I contacted Natalie, Joyride's Catering Manager, who made recommendations and sent quotes for my review.  Everything looked great, a delicious dinner for 20 at a good price.  Party day arrived and 30 minutes in the food had not arrived. Then reality hit, I had given Joyride my brother's birthday date which was on Sunday and the party was on Saturday. 
 
In a panic, I called Joyride and they could not have been more gracious.  After checking with their kitchen, they assured me that, yes, they could get the order done AND they got it done in 30 minutes.  Guests had a little more time to enjoy their drinks and appetizers and no one was the wiser.  

Everyone loved their Braised Beef and Veggie tacos and the crunchy delicious side of Mexican Slaw.  Joyride really came through for me and I am grateful."}
{"text":"My last and final comments on the matter:

I gave them credit for being honest,  however with that comes with FILLING THE OBLIGATIONS you make during our call. 

Clearly,  once you thought I was placated you simple slid me back over into the ignore pile.

Shame on you Upward Projects.......

It wasn't that HARD just do what you say your going to do, less people will get angry if you do.

{"text":"Tried Joyride for the first time on Tuesday. I loved it. Their salsa was amazing and they have a really good selection of draught beer. I had the Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye. 

What made me especially happy were the really nice options for vegetarians. This can sometimes be difficult at Mexican restaurants. I asked our server (we sat at the bar) about suggestions, and she said that anything with their signature veggie mix was good. I chose the enchiladas, which also had goat cheese, and they were AWESOME. 

The veggie mix was delicious and not boring, the creaminess of the goat cheese, and just the right amount of heat (I selected red sauce) made a killer and satisfying combination. At $9.00 the portions were more than generous, but my companion and I worked together to finish them up. 

This will definitely be my new go-to spot for Mexican in this neighborhood. Again, they only lose one star for the parking situation. I'm never keen on forced valet, because I rarely have cash to tip."}
{"text":"Wife said she wanted to try Gilbert's Joyride Taco House. \"Taco House,\" I said? \"Meh.\" But holy moly was I wrong. This place is fantastic. We had the chicken and carnita nachos, carne asada tacos, roasted veggies, and finished off the meal with a Mo's Definitely dessert. Everything was delicious and so unique from the other Mexican taco shops in town. Very relaxed place to dine and the service was excellent. We sat outdoors on the patio and they did not try to get us to move along but let us take as much time as we wanted to enjoy the evening. Taylor was our waitress and was so pleasant and helpful that we wanted to adopt her. Anyhow, we will be back for more tacos and are eager to try the other menu temptations. Our only regret is it took us so long to finally stop in and try the place."}
{"text":"Really wasn't impressed with the size or flavor of the tacos especially for the price. We had the standard, Carne asada, and grilled fish and none of them were particularly amazing. Loved the atmosphere but unfortunately wouldn't be back due to the lackluster food. 

Also, it would be nice if they told you Taco Tuesday doesn't start until 2 pm. I called to ask which tacos were included but they didn't bother to mention the time. Was pretty perturbed to show up at 1:30 to find we had to pay full price."}
{"text":"My Wife and I decided to try out this place of a so call street taco.  The name Joyride says it!  they will take you for a joy ride on there so call tacos.  Im not going to pay 4 dollars for a taco with no sides.  The drinks are horrible.  Salsa is mushed up with who knows what.  Everything on the menu is so discrimintive.  Why GRINGO?  or is this place is only for whites.  I wouldnt eat here ever.  If you want good street tacos, go to a real mexican resturant, at least youll get sides with it and real food.  If there were a choice on the star, I would not even give one.  Horrible.  never eat at joy ride again."}
{"text":"I love this place! They seriously have the best tacos. On Tuesdays they have $2 tacos and $5 ritas. How could you not go?! I like their fish taco and their veggie tacos. They have a select list for their taco Tuesday deal but they still have a few to choose from. They also give you one free bowl of chips and then I believe it's $2 after that, or something. It does get CRAZY busy. So, have patience when you come here. It is worth it tho."}
{"text":"Went to the one on Central. Chips/salsa average, tacos average, mango margarita decent, slow unfriendly service, decor ok. 
Not sure I'd go back, nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"Pros:
the tacos!
plenty of parking (maybe this is not a big deal for locals, but as an out of towner - always appreciate easy parking)

free chips and salsa.  Feel like this is a dying tradition.

Mixed:
Frescas - Cumber Mint is delicious and refreshing. But I got their special, which was Mango, tasted like a weird watered down Mango Lassi.  He actually recommended it and when he asked me if I liked it, and I said, \"my friend's cucumber mint is better\" (as my passive aggressive way to change drinks) he sadly didn't bite.

TIP: ask them to go light on the ice. Half the glass was ice, it was a bit much.

meh:
Cheese Y Mas - appetizer, on paper sounds great - but once ordered, was a bit disappointed.  I think I was hoping for something more like how adult mac 'n cheese when done righ can make me gladly fork over $14 for mac 'n cheese, or what restaurants have done to burgers to make them fancy. I was expecting a queso twist, but just got Velveeta. 
 
service - started off attentive and friendly, and than ignored at the end, was so thirsty had to ask to drink some of my friend's water.

Even though I'm giving it a 3 - I'd still come back."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place from the food, the staff, the ambience. What a gem for our city."}
{"text":"Came here last night with some friends.  We were seated quickly on a Saturday night.  Got our drinks , and chips. The chips were thick, and not my favorite style, but the salsa was great flavor. We also ordered the Habanaro salsa- it was spicy, but not too bad. My blood orange margarita wasn't very good. Tasted like a mix. I ordered a fish taco, and a salad with walnuts,  goat cheese, yellow beets, and a great cumin vinaigrette.  The salad was wonderful! !I could eat it all day!! The taco was good, but super small, and it had a weird mix of corn and flour tortilla consistency.   The fish had good fresh flavor too. My friends each picked 3 tacos. They were done,  and waiting on me to finish my salad. If you are a big eater, get 6 or 7 tacos, or an entree.  Very expensive too. My margarita, salad and taco was $31 with tip."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! Excellent food. Awesome drinks. Fun environment. I've had many of the tacos and they're all good, but I highly recommend he Braised Beef and Carne Asada. And, they're Cucumber Orange Salad is AH-MA-ZING!"}
{"text":"I had done my research but this place was a letdown. Terrific ambience and decor. The food left something to be desired though- service too. The place is part of a larger restaurant group-- and somehow the food tasted like it was made in a larger commissary-- not a stand alone restaurant. While the servers were very nice-- the drinks only came after multiple requests-- and the food came out at different times- without any real sense of sequence."}
{"text":"The  place looks very hip, surprisingly they were not that busy at 12.pm the waiter was friendly and kept the chips  coming , we ordered the harbernero sauce which was hot .the wait was long but the food was good"}
{"text":"Their salsa has a nice kick .We ordered their wacamole was a nice portion and the chips were plentiful. Their servers are very friendly and always attentive.  We had their lunch  special which is salad plus choice of two tacos we had the shrimp which was very flavorful"}
{"text":"I've been here at least ten times, and just getting around to a review. We love this place! It's affordable, the food is always spot on, the service is consistently friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere leaves you feeling relaxed and happy."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant with a good ambiance.  We eat here at least twice a month!  I almost selfishly hesitated to post this review because it's already so popular it's already crowded; but, it's worth the wait!  Check out the Mexican Street Corn, it's the best thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Still working out the bugs??? Undercooked rice, SMALL tacos for the price....Not sure this place will last....We won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times, decided that I've gone enough to write a review. 

Putting it in bullet points to make it easier to read: 

PROS:
- Cool looking spot to hang out with friends (Not completely friendly to large groups).
- Outdoor seating area is nice on a warm night. 
- When waiting for seating to open up, they have a texting service so you can wander about (but don't wander too far!).
- Drink TASTE is decent. 
- They give you chips and salsa when you're waiting (They do charge $1 for refills).


CONS:
- Drink prices are on the higher side. 
- Food prices are a little ridiculous as well (I guess you're 'paying' for the atmosphere as well).
- While staff are friendly, but guest service is pretty horrendous. 
- Food takes WAY too long to get out to you, so forget coming here with a large group of people (as mentioned earlier).
- The food isn't the most exciting in terms of taste. 

Overall  the price you see on the check I believe is too high for the quality of service and quality of food/drink you receive. If the service greatly improved, I wouldn't have a problem with how much the bill comes out to. 

Go at your own risk! Hopefully, you have a better time than myself."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly but the food was overpriced and skimpy. The Baja fish tacos needed more sauce and fish was dry. Carne asada was tasteless and dry. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Loved the friendly staff. Food was great. Have to love the carne asada. Will defenetly comeback for more."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Joyride on Tuesday for the Happy Hour.  They have $2 tacos and $5 margaritas from 3-close. My favorite tacos and margaritas are the Carne Asada and Braised Beef tacos and the Cucumber Serrano and the watermelon margarita.  

The service here is always amazing and fantastic.  Everyone that works there is always in a awesome mood and they are always smiling too.

You should totally try out Joyride if you can."}
{"text":"Joy ride tacos is pretty damn good. Their tacos are very creative and delicious. Big bonus that their happy hour starts at 2. $2 tacos for happy hour (don't mind if I do). I ordered 3 which filled me up. I sat at the bar, the bartenders were super friendly. The restaurant was very cool. Walking distance to other restaurants and shops. I'll be coming back
Fasho"}
{"text":"How can you mess this up? A casual, hip taco joint sounds amazing to me. Too bad it didn't live up to the hype. 

Service was pretty awful. Long waits, messed up orders, forgotten food, no apologies, no kindness. 

The decor is brilliant and it has so much potential, but unfortunately, it's not quite working. Total bummer for Upward Projects--usually their restaurants are amazing. 

I'll skip this place next time I'm in town thankyouverymuch."}
{"text":"I will not be back. We made it in time for happy hour, probably 15 minutes to spare, but they didn't get our drink orders in until 2 minutes before so we had to fight them to get our tacos the happy hour price as well. Hubby ordered both pork, I got fish. The only thing I could taste was the huge wedge of avocado on top of the fish, the tortilla was stale and the fish wasn't crispy. My husband complained his carnitas was tooooo citrusy with no other flavor, and the adobada tasted like a very mild BBQ sauce. Very disappointed:/ and my margarita had about 2 sips in it."}
{"text":"\"meh\"

gave it three stars for the great ambiance and nice service, but food was a little lack luster."}
{"text":"This is a real cool place to take a pit stop.  This is the old Aiellos Italian restaurant (a place I really liked) and I have to tell you they did a fantastic job of converting it.  Top notch, complete with co-ed bathrooms.

The happy hour is very appealing as well, and I would say this is a great place to stop in and have lunch (or what the heck, start your friday night).  Chips and salsa were very tasty, and the guacamole dip (with sliced jalapeños - brilliant)!

Good five dollar pitcher specials (sorry, I am never one of those helpful people that can quote you what the time frames are) but I think 11-5).  But worth looking into.

Couple things I will say on the negative side (yeah I know, wish ever review could be positive and amazing), the cheese-mas dip (basically cheese queso) was okay, but NWTC (not worth the calories in my opinion).  

Tacos - if you love tacos and are really a connessieur, you might not love these.  The crunchy fish taco was okay, but really just like eating a fish-stick on a tortilla if you know what i mean.  Good, but not a huge fan.  The other tacos (carnitas, chicken tinga, and baja fish) were so-so, didn't seem to be served very warm and for me, just lackluster taste overall.

Alcohol - I tried the \"hi-ball margarita\" (supposedly their version of the cadillac as I was informed) in my opinion is (how can I say this nicely) not the greatest value.  Try one and see if you agree.  I think they need to up their game in this area.

So at the end of the day, I love the location, love what they have done with the place, great vibe, staff is friendly and very energetic, MUSIC ROCKS (possibly best in town, loud but I like it that way) and so I find myself a big fan, but looking for a go-to meal that I can call my own.  Yes, I will be back hunting for that in round 2 and open to any great suggestions.

And by the way guys, you need to sell some cool t-shirts (love bright colors, great to promote your brand), and give discounts to bike riders.  We like to ride our bikes with friends!!

Have fun, and find your sizzle!

{"text":"I returned thanks to the courtesy of the project manager and this time I was eating meat . The fish and shrimp tacos were pretty good , rice and beans still need a little work but was overall satisfied with the food atmosphere and great management to customer service ."}
{"text":"Aioooght. 


This place is pretty good. On a short list of restaurants that I consider extremely consistent with their service, menu, and mood. Have been coming here for like 4 years now and have NEVER had a close to bad experience. Very rare to see these days. 

Good luck to this place. Shout out to Kate. The second one.. the first one too."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas, and the happy hour specials were fantastic. Lonnie the bartender provided excellent service as well, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is has a nice atmosphere both inside and outside. My boys got the kids meal with the chicken tacos. They did not care for the tacos that had beans mixed in them. We ordered the standard, carne asada, and the fried fish tacos. The tacos were ok along with the Mexican cold slaw. I think I was looking for more of a Mexican taste. The food is healthy but just not for was. The place was nice to try..."}
{"text":"Great food.  We have been a couple times with our toddler and she loves the rice and little chicken tacos.  Service could be better at host station.  One of them tried to push past my little one and I and didn't say excuse me.  Nearly bumped into us.  No manners.  Hipster waitresses were ok.  Pretty much what I expect from them.  Looking cool but not great at pretending they care that we have a good experience.  Still, the food is really good so we will be back again."}
{"text":"Visited this place soon after it opened on the recommendation of a friend. What a surprise! And not a good one. The carne tacos were waay expensive. $3.75 PER TACO! Traveled extensively to most all regions of Mexico, so I've seen many variations on the theme of ,\"Tacos.\" These were some version of \"Caucasian Tacos.\" The Carne had a slightly sweet flavor like the got the meat from Joe's BBQ. Tortillas were soft and pretty good. Many flavors of iced tea. Not saying that is good or bad, but hey. Focus on one good one and stick with it.The place was pretty trendy and reminded me of what a taco shop at the Biltmore would look like. But it was clean and pleasing. Crowd was full of locals with \"Man Buns.\" Urban chic I guess. I sat at the bar, and it smelled like a bar. No big deal. Took a while for uno taco, so when it did arrive, I jumped right in. Didn't notice a salsa bar. Like I said, slightly sweet flavor, not what I was looking for, as I was looking for AUTHENTIC. And I was honest when the waiter came and asked me how it was. Sat and enjoyed the view and finished my tea. When I asked for the check, the guy said that it was comped, and he was sorry for the dis-appointing taco. I graciously thanked him and left Almost the total bill for a tip. And for it's popularity. I guess it's not the authenticity that people come here for. And that's ok too."}
{"text":"I love the food here! Being vegetarian their veggie taco and garden variety burrito are amazing! My favorite is actually getting the garden variety burrito in a bowl instead of a tortilla and it is, in my opinion, even tastier! I am a spice whimp so to me their salsa has a little bite afterward, but it has a great flavor so I always eat it any way. Their happy hour starts early (i believe 2pm to 6pm but taco tuesday I think is 2pm to 11pm) and the $2 tacos and $5 margaritas are super worth it during those times."}
{"text":"Went today for an early lunch. We enjoyed ourselves and enjoyed almost all of our food. The reason I gave them five stars is because when one of the servers picked up our dishes she noticed we hadn't eaten the soup. She asked if we enjoyed the chicken tortilla soup and I told her it was too chili based which I am not a fan of. What I didn't expect was for them to remove it from our check. That was a big suprise and unexpected. Great customer service, so lets take a step back and talk about the food. We ordered their lunch special which allowed us to order two tacos each and either soup or a half of their salads (3 interesting ones to choose from). I ordered the baja fish and the ahi tuni with a half salad. My husband ordered the standard chicken and the braised beef taco with the chicken tortilla soup at $9.95. As we waited we enjoyed their homemade chips and salsa that had a little kick (yummy). I also ordered a yummy virgin aqua fresca (pineapple). The only disappointment was no free refills on the aqua fresca (but it was to be expected as they will also make them with alcohol). The salad had papaya in it and was a bit overdressed but thank goodness for a light tasting vinagrette. Overall, we will defintely be back. We also left feeling it was the right proportion of food. Joyride is on the other side of Postino's and also to the left of Oregano's. so many places to choose from in Gilbert but when in the mood for tacos I definitely recoomend Joyride."}
{"text":"This is a hard review to write but all the more necessary. We legitimately enjoyed the service, food, and margaritas we received; however, we were taken aback by the additional charges to our bill. In short, we had additional charges totaling $26 that we brought to our server's attention which he rectified by giving us two free margaritas that equalled $18. We ate the difference but were conflicted after we were: 1. Charged for an extra drink we didn't order, 2. Not comped a drink that was promised by our waiter after we had waited over 15 minutes for it, and 3. Charged regular prices on 2 margaritas that we ordered during happy hour. Overall, we will likely return but plan to be much more vigilant with regard to our check."}
{"text":"This place has been recommended by so many people and I finally got to come here. Fun atmosphere and great food. I came here for dinner last night with a friend. We started with the guacamole and it was great. I ordered the Standard chicken tacos and black beans. My friend ordered a coconut margarita and it was good. Everything was really good. If you haven't been here yet you need to check it out."}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars because service was on point! The crispy fish tacos are amazing! The atmosphere made me feel like I was out of town! Love the chill vibe and outdoor seating! Staff was amazing! We will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"What happened?   When joyride first opened it was a delightful place with great service.  I was just there today because I had not been in a while.  As soon as I sat at the bar and was not greeted by a bartender who just tossed a glass of water at us. Then someone brought some chips and placed them on the bar that was full of crumbs that I had to asked to be cleaned.  Finally, another bartender came over to take our order grudgingly.  After a while they asked if we were hungry.  Not what would you like to have.    After that I wanted another drink and was ignored.  Finally the one bartender that has been working the bar took my order.  Needless to say it will be a while or ever the next tine I come back.  Not good upward projects."}
{"text":"I had a group of 6 and a baby and we were all impressed by this non-traditional Mexican restaurant. With items like squash and goat cheese enchiladas and a dozen different tacos to choose from, each was extremely satisfied with their food. I also thought it was a nice, strong but not-too-sweet marg. loved the decor and kid-friendliness outdoors. The only small complaint was they didn't have a dedicated waitress per table, we kept being helped by different people, so you could say requests were a little slow, but the food came out fast. Maybe it was a Sunday night thing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a neat place! My S/O and I stopped in for happy hour after a long moving day. I ordered a prickly pear margarita and we each ordered three tacos and shared the food. Notable favorites were the carne asada and the pork adobado. Ordered a side of black beans with cotija and we were good to go!

I really like the interior design and overall feel. Neat furniture and decor really makes a place stand out to me. I was also impressed with the huge outdoor seating- it's a space the surrounds three sides of the building!

The only reason why I can't give 5 stars is because of the service. We came in at a time of day where the restaurant was not busy. Tons of empty tables, yet I didn't feel like our service was prompt and attentive. I felt that our waiter was rather standoffish and rushed through his time with us. He didn't smile once, and was not welcoming. I was not impressed, and hope for better service next time."}
{"text":"Visiting from Austin, TX!  Wanted to check this place out last Xmas but they hadn't opened yet.  You had to know this was my first stop in town once the hangover from the drive was gone.

Went with my boy Bry and little one E!  LOVED that they were kid friendly and offered a menu and the bonus upon delivery of his meal.  A temporary tattoo was a fabulous bonus!  Bry and I had 3 tacos each.  

Loved the build out!  Upward does a great job paying attention to detail and branding.  That's no secret.  Loved their standard margarita (we had two each).  The Pork taco was great!  Service was awesome as EVERYONE in the building was attentive to our needs!  HUGE plus in my book being a restaurant owner.

Chips and Salsa - okay.  Fish Taco - flavorless.  Other tacos were okay.

This place gets high marks for service and overall concept.  You always want to feel transported when you dine out.  I was truly happy with the destination I landed in.  Its one ride I would take again and again!  Keep it up Joyride and cannot wait to visit you again later in the week!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place,very friendly, we had a large group and they were very accommodating, even when I couldn't decide where I wanted to sit either outside or inside. Decided on inside and really enjoyed watching the bar tenders take care of everyone. Truly enjoyed the food. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!  Fun, creative and a very lively restaurant.  The menu was inventive and everything we had was outstanding.  The restaurant was very busy but we were able to get in on a Saturday night without a reservation for our party of 3.  Go visit, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Updated from my previous review... Great for a margarita and a bowl of chips and salsa... But if you LOVE tacos, I'm sad to say - go elsewhere. If you've never been to Mexico or had an authentic street taco you might think these are great as they use fresh decent ingredients and the spice them well.... But thats where the praise ends. In my opinion, tacos should be on corn tortillas unless flour is requested. Here they all come out on flour. Next, the ingredients must be HOT! Never serve lukewarm (from a steam tray on the line) food! Everything must be HOT! Two of the three tacos  (carnitas and asada) were room temp at best as if taken right off of a steam table of pre cooked and kept meat... Takes just a few seconds to sear and crisp up the asada or carnitas... Instead, cold and soggy tacos. The third also was a disappointment. The crispy fish was fishier than crispy... Like tilapia or other bottom feeder... Skip it. The staff is friendly, the drinks are great on happy hour, and there are other places to go after you are done with your chips to get great tacos. :)"}
{"text":"Super fun place and great food!

My husband and I wanted to find a fun place to have dinner with visiting family and we decided to come take a Joyride, despite the longish wait (45 minutes). We were all impressed with the outdoor waiting area because it is large and comfortable with great blue booths. Our server kept bringing us bowls of chips and salsa, which we happily consumed. Not only did we eat a ton of chips, we ordered a number of beers. Joyride offers beer by the pint and pitcher and we ordered some of both.

When our table was ready, we moved inside and were struck by the trendy interior. Low light emanating from the mid-century inspired light fixtures cast a warm glow over all the hipsters (and non hipsters) in the place. I liked the different color glass bottles in the bar as well as the warm wood tones throughout the restaurant. Our server was friendly and suggested a number of items that we all consumed very happily. Everything tasted fresh: veggies were crunchy, sauces were saucy, nothing was over or underdone. I really enjoyed the crispy fish tacos and Mexican slaw, both of which had great flavor and were gone too soon. 

Great place to hang out and enjoy some delicious food. Go take a Joyride soon! I know I will."}
{"text":"I was just passing through Phoenix when a local retailer mentioned to try this place out. We came in to be greeted nicely and seated quickly. A somewhat trendy taco bar with lots of different flavors on the menu like the blood orange margarita and some interesting salsas.

We had the queso which was pretty good but since I had just left Austin it wasn't up to the standard of which I had before, still we devoured it since we're from LA and can't even get mediocre queso.. We had a trio of taco plates in which I had chicken and carne asada, my girlfriend tried the fish (which she sent back because it was too fishy) and another suggestion from the waiter which were both amazing.

Ambience was nice for a Tuesday evening and we got served fairly quickly. I would definitely say to come give a try but it's a little too fancy for my liking. I enjoyed the food but I am such a nut for legit street food and taking the gamble on what I get. I would still go here for their great food and polite staff though."}
{"text":"First of all, I need to mention the decor and the ambiance, which hit you as soon as you walk in the door.  It is obvious that a lot of love went into selecting each and every item that went into this restaurant.  My friend and I went for the first time on Sunday, expecting a wait.  We were pleasantly surprised that although relatively small, they have made excellent use of space.  There was both inside and outside seating  available, as well as some very comfy and cool looking bar stools.  We opted to sit at a table inside and we were not disappointed.  We were frequently acknowledged and addressed by a variety of staff members, checking in with us to make sure that we were ok.  Our waiter did a great job of recommending items from the menu, including a few tasty non-alcoholic drinks (**Note, these drinks, at 3.50 a pop are not cheap, and refills will cost you).  I had the Pineapple Agua Fresca and it was really good.  A little on the sweet side, though, and I probably wouldn't  order it again, unless I added alcohol to make it worthwhile (an additional $4.50 to add alcohol).  The chips and salsa are both freshly made.  In fact, our waiter apologized profusely that he could not bring chips to our table immediately because they were still being made.  As we perused the menu, I noted that tacos are sold a la carte.  All sounded delicious, and I opted for one short rib taco ($4) and my friend opted for 2 chicken tinga tacos ($3.50 each).  The waiter explained that a lot of people order 1 or 2 tacos at a time, and then reorder if they are still hungry.  I was definitely still hungry after just one taco, and I was dying to try the carnitas tacos ($3.50 each), but I also wanted to try one of the desserts--\"Mo's Definitely\" (homemade vanilla pudding, caramel, sliced bananas, salted pecans, and cookie crumbs).  Dessert was $6, so including the 1 taco that I had already eaten, as well as my non-alcoholic, non-refillable beverage, my bill came to almost $14.00.  Definitely not cheap for a \"small\" dinner that didn't include a side.  My advice to Joyride is to change the menu so that people can choose 2 tacos and include one of your sides and charge about $9.00-10.00.  It would seem like more of a meal and a deal that way.  The way the menu stands now is that you want 2 tacos plus rice and beans, you would be paying about $13.00 or $14.00.  The current menu offers only sides a la carte, ranging in price from $2.50 (rice) to $5 (corn).  I am giving Joy Ride 4 stars, just because I prefer a more \"all inclusive\" option when eating out, rather than just a pricier a la carte version.  The food is definitely tasty, and the service is great.  I would have given 4 1/2 stars if I could, because at the end of the meal, our waiter presented both my friend and me with a $10 gift card, good for our next visit.  He explained that these gift cards are given to first time customers.  Definitely a classy touch!   We will be back and we will bring our friends :)"}
{"text":"From the minute I stepped out of my car and saw the wall art that said, \"Work hard &  be cool to people,\" I knew this was going to be an amazing place. The door this was next to seemed more like a back entry but either way, I was still greeted with smiling faces and helpful people. 

It wasn't busy so the host gave us a choice of sitting indoors or outdoors. We chose outdoors since it was incredibly nice out. Our server helped us out with drinks right away. We were celebrating so we went with a pitcher of beer to start, but I do love the option or ordering a, \"short one,\" here. It's just a choice a lot of places don't really offer anymore, so kudos for that Joyride! 

Moving along, I ordered a crispy fish taco and the Mexican street corn. Both really, really good and super tasty next to our beer choice. I highly recommend at least one crispy fish taco while you're here! 

But let's get back to the design of the place. Like all of the uptown restaurants, it's got it's own flavor of trendy design. Be sure to check out the wall next to the bathroom, it's interactive. When I was there, it said, \"In this life, I will...\" and guests can contribute whatever they want to the wall. Oh, and it you're chewing gum, make sure to use one of their cute little gum things (in the sugar caddy) to dispose of it before you eat. They are so cute! 

My only regret is that we got here a little before Happy Hour and had not realized it until after we ordered, but that's our bad. I'll be back for it! Really amazing place! Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday thrives at Joyride! My boyfriend met me here at 2pm for their happy hour menu. Check out this receipt. I'm a cheap date and I'm proud of it: 

1 cup soup (vegetarian lentil)
1 pitcher Four Peaks session IPA
1 veggie/mushroom taco 
1 fish taco (fan favorite)
1 chicken taco 
1 beef taco 

Grand total pre-tax and tip: $15!

The fish taco is by far the best! The vegetable one fell apart and I ended up eating it in a deconstructed manner. The flavor of the veggie taco was just ok. Making an entrée out of their sides is the way to go for veggies/vegans! They really know what they're doing. 

Their taco Tuesday lives on through happy hour throughout the week but is extended into dinner on Tuesday. Regardless, it's fantastic. Each of their selected tacos are $2. You get one free round of chips and salsa, but you can purchase additional for a very small fare. 

I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Their margaritas pack a punch. Make sure to order one of these at the beginning to drink with your chips and salsa.

The location is great! I've never had a problem with parking or too much traffic at this particular part of central phoenix. If you're bar hopping this is a great place to start to fuel up on cheap but delicious food and drink."}
{"text":"Love this spot for their tacos. 
Did not like their breakfast. 
The standard, the shrimp and the carne Asada are fabulous. They are pretty small and pricey. You get a $1 side if you order 3 tacos. Tacos run 3.50 to $5 each I believe. 
It's overpriced, but fun atmosphere, good service, good tacos. 
Pay for chips and salsa? Not okay. Think I need to remove a star for that."}
{"text":"This was by far the best fish tacos I have ever had. I have been to a variety of places in Florida and Hawaii and California, with some killer fish tacos. These rank right up there. I thought only two tacos for sure I wont be full and will want more. I was pleasantly surprised on how full I was.  Their pitchers of beer were very reasonable 7 dollars for premium Mexican lager. OMG the churros were amazing! Must get for dessert no matter how full you are. Very fresh overall!"}
{"text":"Did a fast lunch here. Not too bad but a bit pricy for 2 tacos, 1/2 salad and an iced tea. $14  It all was good including salsa and chips. For this price I would expect at least 3 tacos or larger than the street taco sized tacos they did serve. No doubt you're paying for decorum and location more so than food. Not bad but not great."}
{"text":"They have amazing vegetarian Mexican food. I would call it Mexican nouveau rather than authentic Mexican. Way more interesting than the beans/rice/cheese places you typically find in the Phoenix area. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very receptive to suggestions and imaginative with the drinks."}
{"text":"We ended up walking here because Postino's next door had a 45 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon. And boy, am I glad we did. We ordered the chicken nachos, 3 different tacos. My favorite was the braised beef taco. To drink we had their blood orange margarita, which was phenomenal. 

Only downside is that I couldn't ell who worked there and who didn't. The waiters do not use uniforms or even the same colors. I think the manager was our waiter and he had a Batman shirt on."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos. Really like the carne asada. Parking is very limited and this place gets rly busy. Decorations/ambiance are okay and they have large amount of space. Service is standard, nothing to complain or praise."}
{"text":"Good food.  Awesome atmosphere.
Service can be slow on busy nights but that's inevitable.
I love the classic margarita vs. the specialty."}
{"text":"It's not the greatest taco place but the atmosphere is food and the food is still pretty good. The burritos are standard size, perhaps a little on the bigger side which is nice. The salsa is delicious though you only get one for free and after that they start charging which is fair but im obviously partial to plenty of gratis salsa. I've had the shrimp tacos twice now but don't think i'd order them again as the shrimp has been a little over cooked or rubbery but otherwise i've been happy with the food and experience here."}
{"text":"Joyride really confused me the other night. I mean, I had this great waitress with the same name as me. We were like so cool. And funny. And both totally hated our names as children. I thought we had something ... then she just never came back. I was like, this isn't Tinder, you can't just ghost me before I get a taco out of it. 

I eventually got my taco (or three) and the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had in my life. The new waitress, who eventually showed up to take care of us, just wasn't the same. I guess, sometimes you do have to settle for second best or risk ending up alone and taco-less."}
{"text":"Tacos are very tasty - lots of choices on their street tacos. We had carnitas, braised beef and crispy fish with a side of black beans. Margaritas are over $9 each -- we had beer today. Service was very slow. \"We have team service here\". I've never had team service work better than one server committed to earning my appreciation."}
{"text":"Great food! Wasn't really feeling Mexican food but the restaurant next door had an hour wait and we were hungry. Since we have had Mexican a lot lately I choose the Beet salad which was amazing! Very fresh and yummy! The guacamole was fresh and de lish! Street corn to die for! I had a bite of the  ahi fish tacos and LOVED it! The staff was friendly and accommodating! GM even stopped by our table to say Hi! Water never empty. Great place and we will return!"}
{"text":"This. Place. Rocked. I remember when it first opened and I was excited to try it again last weekend. I was happy to see that they have mainatined standards. I went with my family and we enjoyed apps, margs and entrees. Everything was fantastic; from the food to the service."}
{"text":"I popped in here for Happy Hour on Friday with some girlfriends and was SO shocked at how cool their ambiance is and most importantly, their HH prices are amazing!!!! $2 tacos, $4 Guac, $5 {AMAZING} margaritas, some of the best salsa that i've ever had..... You get it, GO HERE NOW. The Cucumber/Serrano margarita was off the charts! They also have a fab patio! I cannot wait to come back soon! (It may even be this week...shhhh, don't tell)."}
{"text":"I dig it. The tacos were really good. I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken taco but we tried the carnitas, the other pork option that I can't recall the name of and the carne asada and those were all really good. The guac was also good. I really like the outdoor area and will love to try it out when it cools down. The interior is small, but comfortable. The servers were really attentive and polite."}
{"text":"I really liked their patio and ambiance for our big party, but the service was super spotty and even after double checking that I wanted no meat or dairy on my veggie burrito, it came with cheese (which I didn't realize til I was going to finish off the leftovers the next day). The others I was with loved their food. I like how they grilled their burritos. Drinks were tasty and had flair."}
{"text":"I love joyride!  I have been there a few times and everything I order is delicious.  I loved the enchiladas and had a yummy margarita.  The chips are great and the salsa is my favorite.  It has great flavor."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Seating indoors and outside. Very friendly and attentive service. Fish and pork tacos terrific and great salads."}
{"text":"I love going here for taco Tuesday with friends! It has a fun atmosphere, delicious drinks, and the  BEST. TACOS. IN. TOWN. The servers are usually friendly despite the chaos of taco tuesday.. 

I love their Standard Tacos and Blood Orange Marg. I get them every time... :)"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos,spicy flavor, but not too hot. 
One pork, one fish, one chicken. 
The side of cucumber orange salad was very refreshing. 
Nice casual atmosphere, a great place for lunch with friends. 
The servers were quick, friendly and helpful and pricing was reasonable."}
{"text":"GREAT NAME for a Mexican themed restaurant. My Pezola (Mexican soup) will be here shortly, followed by three fish tacos.

Tasty spot in a cool area, loaded with top quality restaurants.

Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Went there the other day with my family that was on town... 9 of us.  Didn't know it was happy hour but man that sure worked out awesome for us. Two dollar tacos and five dollar margaritas and pitchers. We all ate and drank a lot and for 9 adults it was only 115$  that's amazing. Love it!"}
{"text":"The tacos and the black beans here are delicious! they also have extended happy hour from 11-5pm which is fun for lunch!  really cool atmosphere and friendly wait staff!"}
{"text":"Love this spot!! My favorites are the pinto beans, fish tacos, and blood orange margaritas. Go any day before 5 pm for $5 drinks. Such a great deal!!"}
{"text":"Food was fair !! Not impressed by the flavors. Tacos were  so over priced but I guess thats to be expected in old town Gilbert.. First set of Chips and salsa free and in a small little container of salsa and chips were all broken up.. Service was not great not one refill on drinks for any of us party of four.. Just kept refilling water.. they for got the extra chips we ordered and my husbands salad.. Won't bother coming back"}
{"text":"Ice cold mugs, tiny pitchers, beer.  What a great way to start after a long hike on a chilly Sunday afternoon.  The warm chips and tasty salsa were immediately brought to the table.  Next came our waiter, a newbie to Arizona from Arkansas, with a cute southern drawl, easy demeanor and not bad on the eyes, either.  But most importantly, he was SO attentive.  Especially since one of our diners is gluten-free, lactose intolerant.  He guided us through the menu, made great recommendations, even went back to confer with the chefs to be sure everything was done correctly.  We each ordered the taco trios, an array of different smells, proteins, veggies graced our table.  Each of us having a favorite.  It was topped off with warm, sugary churros accompanied with a chocolate dipping sauce, on the house for our birthday boy.  We will definitely be back.  We enjoy that part of town, seeing old buildings (used to be Humpty Dumpty's Restaurant) coming alive.  Oh, and ask for Jeremy.  Hope he sticks around."}
{"text":"$5 happy hour margaritas I absolutely love the coconut and the $2 tacos are awesome my favorite was the fish!"}
{"text":"I was told to come here by a friend and had some pretty high expectations so I was pleasantly pleased but not overwhelmingly impressed. I ordered 3 tacos and the cucumber orange salad (if you order 3 tacos it comes with a side). I ordered 1 shrimp, 1 carne asada, and 1 pork adobada taco. I also ordered a $5 cucumber serrano margarita and 1 $5 spiked almond horchata :).  The margarita was not as refreshing as I imagined it would be, and the portion seemed a little small, but I really loved the horchata, which I spiked with vanilla vodka. The tacos were tasty, but I think I prefer the tacos at la santisima. The cucumber salad didn't taste very orange-y to me and I'm not sure why they are more expensive than the other sides. That said, I much prefer the service here and will be coming back to try more tacos."}
{"text":"First time here and not the last. The corn was Amazing can't wait to return for more.  The music is great the scenery quite unique and entertaining. It is a happening and busy place."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place in Gilbert. $5 pitchers of awesome beer during the day every day! Their carne asada is ridiculous. I usually get the beast burrito or a carne asada quesadilla, but everything I've ever had was amazing. Great service too!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the going to Oldtown Gilbert and this was one of the restraunts Ive always wanted to try. The service was excellent. Our food came fast and was hot. We ordered the standard chicken tacos. Other wise it wasnt too spicy. Since it was happy hour they were only $2.00 each. They were tiny, but surprisingly filling. The atmosphere was similar to the breakfast place next door. It was loud and almost had to yell across the table just to have a conversation. Desert menu only offered three items. We didnt see any desert we liked so went to another restaurant nearby for desert. Other than that I would recommend this place if you are looking for something quick and tasty."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, kind of hip and eclectic. Good selection of good food and drinks.  Great service.  Nice location in the heart of old town Gilbert. Went with the 3 taco plate where you get 3 different types of tacos. Did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great tacos and drinks.  Can't go wrong with free chips and salsa.  Fish tacos are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I went to joyride for the first time two nights ago woth a friend of mine, it was absolutely amazing! Great prices! Preston was our bartender and made our margarita it was delicious! Gabe was serving and was just being friendly talking to us and recommended a very tasty tequila. I had 2 tacos chicken tinga and my friend had the beast burrito. Both very delicious! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you want to stop by for Taco Tuesday, you'd better get here early! This place gets PACKED!!! Super cute place with a great atmosphere; definitely a retro vibe, which is different and unique. 

A friend and I ended up sitting at the bar for a quick bite. It's $2/taco during happy hour and $5 margaritas -- a deal I couldn't pass up -- so I ordered a Cucumber Serrano margarita... extremely refreshing, light, and yummy! While we waited for the tacos, we were given complimentary chips and salsa (careful, that salsa has a kick!), which were decent. 

For the tacos, I ordered \"The Standard\" (slow roasted chicken, avocado, Mexican slaw and aji amarillo) and \"Chicken Tinga\" (avocado, cabbage, cilantro and white magic). The Standard taco was, well, pretty standard; it was bland, basic, and a bit dry... I can't say I'd order it again. The Chicken Tinga was definitely better and more flavorful and I guess the white magic made it more magical than the Standard taco; it was decent.   

Overall, it was a good experience, although quite honestly, I don't know if I'd go here again; for all the hype, I was a bit disappointed with the tacos. I was expecting a little more pizazz, unique flavor, and authenticity in the tacos. Maybe I've been \"taco ruined\" with real authentic tacos in Mexico, but you'd think that with Phoenix having so many great taco places around the valley, Joyride would set the bar a little higher and stand out with their tacos. If I were to return to Joyride, the reason would probably be the Cucumber Serrano margarita."}
{"text":"Living in the Phoenix area, there are no shortage of Mexican food options.  To stand out, you really have to be doing something interesting.  From an aesthetics standpoint, Upward Projects is definitely bringing the goods by creating a Mexican cantina/taco stand with a hip urban vibe.  As for the food?  Well, that could use some work.

Came here on a lunch date on Saturday.  The place was busy, but not totally full.  We elected to sit out on the patio on a beautiful day.  The service we received was prompt and friendly throughout.  Seeing how this is Joyride Taco House we figured we'd find out if the tacos would indeed stand out.  Each of us got the same three tacos:  The Standard (a chicken and avocado mix), Carne Asada, and Shrimp.  The shrimp was good, the carne asada was adequate (though I've had better), and the standard was kind of disappointing.  The biggest letdown for me were the tortillas.  They were very dry and stale tasting.  Did not taste fresh made at all.  My side of Joy Rice with Salsa was also pretty average.

In terms of ambience and service I was not disappointed.  The building looks great with a cool bar area and a great laid back outdoor patio.  Upward Projects has done a great rehab of this old building.  But I've had much better tacos at nearby neighborhood spots like Tacos Atoyac and Gallo Blanco.  If Joyride's tacos can eventually reach that standard or better, then they'll work out just fine.  For now, the quality has room for improvement."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of buz about this place and the food was just okay. I has the carne asada and was terribly disappointed. I've had a lot of carne asadas in my time and never has been so fatty. The reason for the 4  rating is because of the staff. My waitress Dee was awesome and informative and very accommodating. I will try again."}
{"text":"OMG their tacos are so delish and they have this drink with lime and coconut that is to die for!"}
{"text":"It's so funny .... when Yelp sees that you've checked into a place on multiple occasions, it asks \"what keeps you coming back?\" ... oh I will tell you what keeps us coming back! Their $5 margarita happy hours!!!!!  They have $5 until 5 pm every day ($5 margaritas or pitchers of beer), then they have Taco Tuesday (which then includes an array of $2 tacos) .... but man, the margaritas are delicious ... the tacos are delicious .... THAT'S what keeps me coming back :)"}
{"text":"I decided to stop by Joyride for lunch during my stay. I'm so glad that I did. The taco had so much flavor, I especially liked the white sauce that comes with it. The margarita was also great, even though I got the prickly pear it didn't feel as though all I was drinking was juice and as you can see they're fairly big portions. The free chips and salsa also had a lot of flavor, slightly too spicy for me so I opt for some fresh pico instead. I would definitely suggest visiting if you're in Phoenix. 

There is tons of parking and the inside has a nice atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Everyone needs to try Joyride!

I've been here quite a bit and each time I enjoy my experience. I love the look and feel of the restaurant! This is a great spot for Mexican food with the family, out with friends, on a date night, and even with your co-workers!! I was treated here by my new co-workers and it was a fun experience. The staff was gracious and eager to help us find seating for such a large group during busy lunch hours.

Another time was with family after a visit at the Heard Museum to see the Frida and Diego exhibit. This gentleman (who worked at Joyride) was walking by our table and was so incredibly kind to ask how our time was at the Heard Museum. We ended up talking about the other museums in Phoenix and Scottsdale. I wish I knew his name because y'all have a great server!!

Note: If you want extra salsa, then you have to pay extra unlike other Mexican food restaurants... Although, the one specific server we had doesn't tell you until after it has been brought to the table... Odd. This was the only staff member my family and I were not pleased with. Once again, wish I knew his name because he really shouldn't be a server. Please give us enough salsa for the amount of chips given. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars.

BUT, nonetheless... Thank you, Joyride! Y'all always show us a good time!"}
{"text":"YUMMY! The watermelon marg was amazing. Great chips and salsa, and great tacos!!!"}
{"text":"For such a cool environment I was very disappointed. There other restraunts are way better. Food had no flavor."}
{"text":"Great service fast beautiful mister patio great tasting salsa... we came on taco tuesday 2$ tacos from 2 till close..."}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious. A little bit pricy but the atmosphere makes up for it. The nachos with carnitas were fantastic as well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food here is sooooooooooo good! The prices are a little high but the portions are a good size! Plan on waiting to be seated, most nights it's crowded."}
{"text":"Great server - great food.  Tried the cucumber serrano margarita - it was fantastic."}
{"text":"The street tacos here are some of the best!  My husband and I are always looking for a good street taco place and this is our favorite in the valley. The burritos are great also. The staff is great as well. Very friendly and always willing to go the extra mile to make the experience comfortable."}
{"text":"Lively place on Taco Tuesday, a great open-air setting in the the north end of Historic Downtown Gilbert.   The family chose here, it was a bit drawn out of an experience the day after Xmas but that's to be expected anywhere.   During the wait for food we were fed chips and salsa, $1 per basket.   The tacos weren't as potent as some other taco specialty restaurants I have visited but they were pretty good for $2 a pop!   The Chicken Tinga was best.  The sound factor was moderate (louder music/crowds) but we managed to up the volume.  Lovely place to take your time and enjoy the afternoon"}
{"text":"I feel like Joyride is the perfect place for margaritas and light bites. The ambience is great and the restaurant itself is cute. The food in particular is nothing special unfortunately. I was not a huge fan of their tacos, especially the corn tortilla. I have had the carne asada, carnitas, braised beef and crispy fish which I thought was the best out of all of them, thanks to our server's recommendation. I ordered a side of rice which came with some tomatillo salsa and I was not a fan of it. The best dish I have had at Joyride is their mexican street corn. I usually order it off the cob and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos and it was happy hour on Tuesdays so it was $2 for 2 tacos, great deal!! The place had a hip vibe and my waiter Jason, was very friendly! The service was a little slow, but it got busy pretty quick so I didn't mind. I'm only visiting, but I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely impressed! Taco Tuesday was a success! If you haven't tried the Coconut Margarita I HIGHLY suggest you ask Jeremy to make you one!! He's an awesome bartender!  Oh, and the carne asada tacos (they were sooo delicious!) We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from CA and our host took us here. I had the the three taco plate with chicken tinga, short rib and conchita pibil. They were all delicious. The service was good and a manager touched our table and gave us a complimentary dessert. My only negative was the bomb beans were under seasoned. This did not ruin my experience however. Would recommend this place! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Very hip place to be. I love the decor, the music, and just the general ambiance. 

We seemed to be served by all the servers, who were all friendly. They would all basically come up to us, and ask us how we were doing, and if we had ordered yet. Not sure if they were doing this on purpose, or if they were really disorganized that night.

Ordered the carne asada taco, crispy fish, ahi tuna, and braised beef. I thought 3.5+ for 1 taco was expensive, but surprisingly they were pretty beefy tacos. 3 will leave you satisfied/full. They were all delicious and the salsa is quite spicy. My only disappoint is that half of the tacos came out cold, which gives you a harder tortilla and cold meat. They were still good, but could have been better.

Also ordered churros with chocolate salsa. They were alright, a little doughy, and not thin and crispy enough to my liking.


3/5 Would eat here on a rare occasion."}
{"text":"Love the tacos at Joyride! The salsa is amazing too! Great atmosphere with great food! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos. Everything is amazing the food, the atmosphere and the staff. The margaritas selection is huge and flavorful. The tacos are perfect everything you want in a taco. Chicken tinga and pork adobada is the best 2 there!!! I will be coming back before I leave Arizona. I love this place $-$$"}
{"text":"We went in on a Sunday night, just two of us. The Service was slow, the food was okay, my drink wasn't great and the waitress figured she would just add my tip to the bill for me with her mediocre service. Wouldn't go back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Had an awesome lunch here today. I got the machaca burrito and my husband got the beast burrito chimi style. I recommend their burritos. The chimi style means deep fried burrito. You can also glaze your burritos with cheese!! Awesome! This is my second time here and I remember not enjoying their tacos last year so I didn't order them this time."}
{"text":"Just had my first visit to Joyride and I loved it! I had an amazing salad, the drinks are wonderfully refreshing and the atmosphere is heavenly."}
{"text":"Joyride, best fish tacos and good for welcoming Moriah's two new additions. Also they were kind enough to make me coffee and bring Everett regular and chocolate milk."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, cool design and layout digging the hipster look. The chips and salsa where awesome, salsa had a nice kick and the chips weren't those cheap chips. The highlight of the night was the awesome battered fish taco and shrimp taco and Im not a big fan of seafood, job well done, great flavor with an awesome corn tortilla, also, the carne asada taco was incredibly cooked but i could do without the sweet tasting salsa, however thats just my opinion. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"((Maybe it was an off day))
It looked promising.
1. The COFFEE tasted gross!
2. Need to use purified water.
3. Had eggs rancheros I think the Eggs we're bad! Along with the salsa! ((I got Sick later on that day))
My mom had Fish tacos she didn't finish them either the only things that were good was the quesadilla
 
((But like I said could have been an off day!))"}
{"text":"I love the tacos and margaritas here. The service is great! They are my go to place when I come to Phoenix. I definitely recommend you stop by!"}
{"text":"If you are an actual Latino. Then this is not the place for you. Its a nice place and the way the food is made looks good but there is no taste to it. My girlfriend and I went here because we heard it was good. The chips and salsa are good but the food was disgusting. I ordered chilaquiles and my girlfriend ordered inchiladas. They both looked amazing when they were brought up to the table so I can tell we have a good professional Chef in the kitchen but when we went to eating the food there was no flavor what so ever. The only flavor was the green sauce covering it. 
The people seemed nice but there was one waiter that was very rude and made a mess as he kept filling our waters. not professional at all. 
As I said if you are a Latino looking for some real Mexican food then this is the wrong place for you."}
{"text":"I might be harsher than some but to break down my review I'll give Joyride a 4 if not a 5 out of 5 for the atmosphere something I always find important but a 3/5 for the food (after my initial visit). I've known been a total of 3 times at the time of this review and can't say there isn't anything to dislike. I had heard about Joyride more and more from friends mentioning it on their FB walls and Instagram pics and finally made it there on a weekend. The place was quite packed but not so much that we had to wait to be seated. A nice and diversified group of patrons was there (families, 20 and 30 somethings groups of friends). Great mix.I've since come back. In terms of food I can't say anything about \"The Standard\" their chicken soft taco as well as the \"Baja Fish\" (I tend to lean on the milder side of things). I've had the Mexican street corn and black beans for appetizers and they were very good. The soft tacos are delicious, the waiters great and the whole mix makes for a place that you'll want to come back to."}
{"text":"Christopher (danger dog) is awesome!  This was my first time here at joyride and he is one of the best servers I've had.  Ask for this guy!  The food is great!"}
{"text":"First time here, came later at night (around 7) and we sat outside cause the weather is amazing. Awesome setting! Super nice people BUT we waited about 30 minutes for someone to take out order and then 20 minutes for the ticket and we only got a taco each.... We just say there waiting for almost an hour. Overall the tacos were delicious and we will definitely come back:):)"}
{"text":"Street tacos.  Came over for lunch and ordered the trio taco combo which were good.  The sides were poorly prepared so I'd almost pass even though they are a $1 extra, nobody finished the sides.  There's tons of seating for everyone.  But fun atmosphere for your meal."}
{"text":"Dated unadventurous menu. Service was good.  Food wasn't bad but wasn't memorable and we will probably not go back anytime soon.  We were hoping to find a cool spot in central Phoenix and it was just O.K. Would love to see them take a few risks with the food with not only this restaurant but their others as well."}
{"text":"Saw a lot of reviews for this place and we went as a group of about 10.  I am not sure if they weren't prepared for a group or if that service was typical there.  it was a bit slow going and I took into consideration that there was a group, but it was still slow going.  I ordered two different types of tacos.  Prices are per taco. (dinners do not include rice or beans or anything else).  They are street style tacos (aka very small).   It was quite bland and small, and there were no extras.  It was just some meat and a little extra pico.  Two bites and you were done.  Don't come hungry and expect to fill up.  Even with a small appetite, two tacos will likely still not be enough.  Three tacos would be good for lunch size portion.    They charge for salsa with the tacos and nachos and extra salsa for the chips.  I did get to try the chips and salsa (very small container considered they were serving 4-6 people per bowl).  There was no spice whatsover here.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"We go to Joyride every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday. Once you know what to order this place is amazing and the service is fantastic! David and the other bartenders are awesome people and great at their jobs, even on such a busy night. The carne asada tacos are #1 for sure. I like the crispy fish as well. If you're looking for a burrito ask the bartenders for a recommendation. They know all the secrets!  As far as legit Mexican tacos, that's not what you go here for. Order queso y mas, carne asada tacos or a burrito with braised beef. Add in the atmosphere and bartenders and you're golden!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour tacos and got just that.  You will need to order 3-5 of $2 tacos to be full.  I tried all of the various meat and fish tacos and they were all delicious with the juicy flavorful carnitas and pork adobada being my favorites.  Since those two were the juicier ones, they immediately tore through the fold of the tortilla and had to be eaten in a deconstructed manner.  The carne asada was well-grilled but was on the sweeter side and almost tasted like the grilled beef on Vietnamese broken rice dishes.  Chips and salsa free for first round only then they charge $2 for refills.  That was disappointing so we paid for only 1 refill and didn't even have extra salsa to put on our tacos. The whole point of Mexican dining is to endlessly and regretfully nibble on chips and salsa until you can't eat your entree.  I ordered the Mexican chocolate brownie which was good but too sweet.  The spicy walnuts though were delicious!  On a different visit I tried their elote which was as good as any other elote but 3x the price.  Overall, decent but menu too limited to come often. I know it's a taco house but still."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The food was really well made and our server Jon was by far one of the best food establishment food servers I have ever had! Professional, timely (even in the packed restaurant), and always smiling. I will definitely return and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The tacos were really good but the service here sucks!  Worst service I've had in awhile.  Had to wait 20 minutes for a coke and when we asked our waitress about it, she said it should be coming out.. Our waitress hardly ever came to our table. They need to step up there service a lot."}
{"text":"Great, innovative tacos! They're small so try all of them (but I recommend the chicken tinga, the standard, & carne asada to get started) The prickly pear margarita is the best! The service is great no matter if they're super slammed or not. They have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"The primary purpose of this post is to have the company recognize Kameron! He was an excellent waiter and helped us make decisions! This was our first time to Joyride, so my wife and I were asking questions left and right about the menu. Kameron answered our questions confidently and made sure we had a great meal. The food was excellent and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. I went with a group of friends for Taco Tuesday. We were a group of 9 and they seated us super quickly which was amazing. They have $2 tacos and $5 margaritas! They were DELICIOUS! Our server was Carn and she was the best, so patient and so nice. I will definitely return, no doubt. Especially for Taco Tuesday. The environment is great, it's a little noisy, but not too bad at all and they were playing the best music. If you haven't been yet, go! They're right next to Postinos and Federal Pizza, which I will be trying next!!"}
{"text":"Great service, waiters, hosts - poor to mediocre food. Got a real, real cold \"chicken\" taco which was essentially a skinless chicken tender for way too much money."}
{"text":"When the world ends, I want the the last flavor on my tongue to be the scallop tacos."}
{"text":"First off, you need to know that Friday and Saturday nights are busy so you need to be prepared for a wait. Also, the environment on these nights is festive and loud. Personally I don't think it's a good place for group events. 

The quality of the food was high. The carne asada, salsas, house made tortillas etc. were all very tasty. 

We were both impressed that when an error was made and someone took a special ordered item to the wrong table, thus causing a meal to be deliver late, they were obviously very concerned. We had 3 people come to the table to apologize and the manager (I believe) came by to tell us that they'd taken that item off our Bill (without us complaining or asking for it). That obvious concern and care for patrons goes a long way. 

The food alone is worth coming here for. The obvious pride of ownership and care for customers makes them even more impressive."}
{"text":"I would give it three and a half stars but it doesn't let me do that the food was decent the wait time on the food and drinks was not the greatest and the prices are a little high for tacos the place is a little loud but the servers were friendly"}
{"text":"My partner and I stopped here on a Taco Tuesday and enjoyed a couple of delicious alcoholic beverages (Pineapple Mojito, Blood Orange Marg) and some nice tacos. We felt that The Standard Taco was not as good as the Fish Taco, or the Carnitas, but they were all tasty. Kind of on the small, \"street\" taco size, but hey, for the price, it was fair. Sitting outside was heavenly under the big trees overhead and the sail cloth. Very cool looking location, quite a surprise. We'd passed this place many times and never stopped. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out after having some awesome tacos from the taco festival here , i really enjoyed the decor inside and the music , service was 'okay' , as well as the food , I don't think small sized street tacos should be over priced , food lacked flavor , but presentation and garnishment was there , roasted salsa that came with the chips was great"}
{"text":"We love Joyride and had only been to the Gilbert location until today. The service (Vanessa and a nice gal who wanted to buy my necklace-lol) was great. 

I tried the cucumber Serrano margaritas which were awesome (not too sweet and rimmed with a chipotle salt)  and the tacos of course were amazing, Yum!"}
{"text":"Tacos were way better than I expected and definitely worth the $2 on taco Tuesday. The margaritas were also excellent. Great vibe, definitely will be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"So so so so good!!!!!!!  -- My tip to you is ask your server what THEIR favorite thing to order is (not what's on the menu....to ORDER)--Without this question, I wouldn't have discovered the swap chicken for carne asada, chimi it AND ad the {fundido} !!!!!!

So I've had a burrito (Chimi'd) and tacos and some of the apps and some of the margs...for real you can't make a bad choice here people....but if you like cheese...ADD the fundido!!!!  It's worth the extra $4...not kidding...give me ALL the Fundido!! 

Tacos are the usual size and delicious, depending on my hungry level 2-3 is perfect for me and the burritos = 3 meals for me which is great during the week and makes my life a lot easier when it comes to meal prepping my lunches :)

It does get busy so just a heads up there, but it's totally worth it.  

Now I think I need an encore....soon...maybe even today...

// cheers //"}
{"text":"We were looking for a tasty Mexican restaurant and saw favorable reviews for Joyride. We were not disappointed. Located in the heart of old town Gilbert, Joyride is nestled between two other restaurants. We sat outside on a relatively cool day but were kept warm by the fireplace and space heaters. The salsa is outstanding with a kick and the Cadillac margarita delicious. We had a variety of tacos which are served on outstanding corn tortillas. Wonderful flavored. Impeccable, attentive service; we were brought more salsa without having to ask and were asked if we wanted more chips. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best burrito on the planet. Great nachos. Awesome tacos. One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The carne asada taco was the favorite taco of the trip, but the Mexican corn blew everyone away 10/10 recommend ordering that. The decor was beautiful and unique and the staff friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"good food staff is always friendly and great sour mix for any drink!!"}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere; friendly staff. Great choice of tacos: crispy fish is my favorite, but they're all pretty delicious"}
{"text":"Pretty sweet atmosphere. They have great deals (Go on a Tuesday, duh) and a diverse menu. The tacos aren't bad, but the drinks are the star of the show here -- this place is awesome for happy hours. After a few sips, you'll notice that the Cucumber Serrano is refreshing enough to wake you up a bit. If you're gonna go, bring your coworkers or your roommates to add some fun to a dull week."}
{"text":"Bless this taco house and it's delicious Mexican food. If there is such thing as Mexican comfort food, it's this place. It gets pretty busy on the weekends, but its worth a little bit of a wait. We usually only end up waiting like 15 min when it's most busy. 

Every time we go we get the 3-taco deal, and an appetizer. Trust me, it's PLENTY of food. I think I've tried each of the tacos,  but my favorites are the fish and machaca ones. Also pro tip: you can switch out the corn tortillas for flour tortillas, when you're not feeling the corn. 

The guacamole and queso are SO delish. I promise you won't regret getting either of them. I love this place and can't wait to see it's continued growth!"}
{"text":"Between Taco Tuesday and the lunch special this place is always great. Outside of those options they also have a delicious beast burrito that is big enough I have left overs for a second meal. The atmosphere is a bit unique, leaving things feeling a bit loud and crowded. This is made up for with very friendly staff, delicious food and a great overall value. For the lunch special I'd strongly encourage trying the soup of the day, they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Came in for the 1st time today in that weird hour between lunch and dinner. Happened to be taco tuesday so I decided to try the crispy fish, Carne as Adam, chicken tinga, and the pork. All decent (in all fairness I'm more a fan for traditional Mexican food, not this new americanized stuff). Ordered their house marg (the Joyride) and the pineapple mojito. Good taste, but again nothing that blew me away. Atmosphere is awesome though. And the patio area looked super nice, I can imagine larger groups in the summer/spring evenings would find this area amazing."}
{"text":"We randomly picked out a place for lunch while headed north for a raft trip, and holy guacamole!  This is one hell of a spot! 

The atmosphere is 1960's meets open air Mexican cantina. Whoever designed this joint needs a medal.  It's funky, clean, and makes one want to consume the delicious drinks that are both affordable and aesthetically pleasing.

The food was great. Get the guacamole. It's worth it. We had a group of 8, all different tastes, and there was not a single plate that wasn't delicious looking. 

Great service. Well worth getting off the beaten path, but don't take my word for it. Try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Overall the food was really tasty.  However, enchilada style means only enchilada sauce, no cheese.  Also, they need to clean their meat a little better.  The carne asada had a lot of funky bits in it.  I will go back though."}
{"text":"Ok first greet by the hostess great smile and since we were a party of two didn't want to wait for a table. Dinner rush.  So we sat at the bar.  The bartender was supper awesome sorry forgot his name but very helpful and recommended some nice drinks with our meal.  The drinks were on point and the tacos were bomb!  I must say tho they keep throwing the warm chips at salsa at me and I would have been full of of those!! Great spot! Great atmosphere 3 thumbs up if I had a third hand :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Insanely good tacos (try the crispy fish), unbelievable service and incredible atmosphere. Hopefully your server is Taylor because she rocks and is spot on with recommendations for drinks, entrees and dessert. Awesome place. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"ate there twice now. . the tacos themselves are a bit bland, the fish taco was terrible but they replaced it which was great. Tortilla soup was very good. service was good."}
{"text":"Don't go unless you are ready to wait for no one to know you are there. Extremely slow serving, I had 5-10 people walk by us before WE had to ask to get a drink. Then 15-20min later, WE had to ask about getting a food order in. We sat at the bar.
The place itself is a great looker, but the service is what's going to keep me away. Will not try this over priced taco house again."}
{"text":"A quaint scene with bright colors and a big bar in the middle with any margarita you could desire.  They have a vast taco menu from fish tacos to braised beef and everything in between. Service is good, but not stellar - food is delish!"}
{"text":"This place came recommended so we made the trek in an uber from Scottsdale to Phoenix and I'd have to say... wasn't really worth the trip for this. Main disappointment was the chicken quesadilla, it was over-salted and tasted bitter couldn't really eat it. Tacos were good... but not great."}
{"text":"This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant. They use an orange citrus flavor on many things which is delicious. I love their chips and salsa. 
The location is fantastic but they do get busy so expect a wait during busy hours. 
I usually get the Carne Asada Quesidila"}
{"text":"Staff/Managers could use a huge imporvement. Food is excellent but customer service is seriously lacking. My office placed a rather large order (15 people) the day before we needed it, and we were told to call back with payment, even though we were prepared to pay right then. We then called back 3 more times, and were told that the manager was not available, to try back again later. We called the next morning to try and pay for our order AGAIN, and surprise surprise, it was never even written down. It's now about an hour before we need the order to be ready. We order out often, and our business is usually much appreciated, but they made it seem like a huge hassle. We will never order from here again."}
{"text":"The ultimate experience.. From the minute we walked in.. Greeted by Vanessa who had a friendly upbeat attitude.. Seated and served promptly with ice water, chips & salsa! Exactly what you want when it's 109 degrees outside on a Saturday. She told us about their $5 drink happy hour- we were IN! Serrano Cucumber Margarita, blood orange margarita, pineapple mojito, & high roller marg! All the drinks were outstanding!!! We had a cup of the tortilla soup and added a spoon full of salsa.. So delish! We each had the 3 tacos with a side.. All of our tacos were fabulous! My husband is mexican and he was even impressed!! So you know it's good!! The service was top notch!!! On point, period! 
All in all --- a Hip Mexican joint with Great food!!! 
Cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"We came here once before, had the nachos and, meh, had better.  But decided to give it another try.  Thursday, 5:00, there were plenty of people but not extremely busy.  It was pretty clear that the waitress was new, but she was pleasant and smiled, she just needs more practice.
We had tacos.  LUV... the shredded beef and the crunchy fish.  SO GOOD, lots of flavor.  So much better than Queen Barrio we tried several weeks ago.  Just thinking about this, I am ready to go back for some more tacos."}
{"text":"Really not great. Waited an hour for a table outside because we have really great dogs. After a long wait (which was not great) they called us inside for a table. Not great. We proceeded to wait outside longer for a table and are not having a great experience. Our dogs are also not having a great time and my stomach doesn't feel great. The food runner even insulted my dogs BMI. The hostess stand was not great, food runner was not great either. I'm assuming the food is not great so I'm leaving."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best service and amazing food! Everyone was super friendly and the atmosphere is great. You cant beat Happy Hour prices. $2.00 tacos and $5 margaritas! LipSense, Tacos and Margaritas for the win!"}
{"text":"First visit to Joy Ride. It's interesting what you can observe while you WAIT for inattentive service. I give staff a pass on really busy nights, it's difficult I get that.  Not the case tonight. No smiles from any of the staff, audible complaining about customers from staff, the only real effort I saw from staff was complaining. No seemingly ability to multi-task. Bad energy. Bad attitude. We stayed, regret that. Remain hopeful for them. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"In the past I've been impressed with this business - not anymore.  Waiter argumentative.  The stack of appetizer plates appeared clean, but were covered in grease and previous food - the fresh napkin with fork was also dirty because of the unclean plate.  We were a party of four, but only received one bowl of chip pieces (some unbroken chips on top were covering the pieces).  When asked for another bowl, we were told there was a charge! We noticed that tables of two received the same sized bowl. As far as we know no manager was present.  Food was good, however, but in today's newspaper this business was shown as having several health violations.  We can understand why.  Oh, and we saw a waitress placing fruit pieces in drinks with her bare hands."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. Service was awful. I would not come back here again for the service. I couldn't even get a refill on my drink. You also don't get unlimited chips and salsa? What restaurant charges for complimentary chips when they run out? 
Again, good food but I will not return because of the service."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Tacos are OK. Had the fish tacos and I didn't think it taste that good.i was told they were the best tacos at Joyride but I personally would've just eaten their chips and salsa the whole time. It's too high in price, too."}
{"text":"My family loves Joyride's food. But the service is sometimes a little disappointing. 
Today we had the best visit we've had in a long time. The server (who I think is new) was great. My carne asada taco was the best I've ever had there. The bar is set high for our next visit, which will probably be soon."}
{"text":"The one in Gilbert is good ... first go at this one was not.

Walked in, no host/hostess and no acknowledgement.  Asked multiple people if we should grab a seat or wait...but even with several of the staff standing around we still got next to no acknowledgement.    

Hung out for a bit and the hostess didn't come back so we took off and headed across the parking lot to Federal pizza.  Good choice, federal was great."}
{"text":"It was Ok.. I thought they were Unorganized .. and its hard when every server asks you if everything is OK,, I am a fan of hard shell Tacos ,, I did like the Standard taco"}
{"text":"I went for a late lunch with friends and the place was still pretty packed at 2:30 on a Saturday. They have happy hour everyday of the week until 5pm, the prickly pear and watermelon margaritas were great and you can't beat the $5 price tag. We all ordered different tacos, the braised beer and the standard that I ordered were amazing! My boyfriend loved the shrimp and carne asada. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super cute little place with great vibes.
Food, drinks, and service here are amazing. Happy hour everyday until 5pm! The pineapple mojito is to die for."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Joyride. Real hipster, cool spot. The tacos are delicious!! I had a crispy fish and a braised beef taco, both of which were on point. Good selection of beers. Patio seating was perfect for a winter afternoon in Phoenix. Very cool place for friends, family, dates. Casual vibes"}
{"text":"It's a modern style Mexican restaurant.I loves the decoration here. If you are a  big fans of  80's 90's movie and star wars, you will love it.

The food tastes so good. My favorite is shrimps taco. The service is great as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. The margaritas are fabulous- all kinds of flavors. This is a great hangout place and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service was excellent. We had patio seating. The tacos were a hit with the family as well as the cheese quesadilla with chicken. Chips were warm and crispy but we felt the salsa was a bit hot. We will return!"}
{"text":"Great place. Chips and salsa were awesome! Tacos awesome! Service was great! I actually got moist!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the rave reviews. The food is moderately fresh, but the recipes are weird and the portions are tiny. I don't know if it's because I keep ordering the wrong things (tacos), but after 3 attempts here, my husband and I gave up. It seemed really gringo, and not not-Mexican-but-not-bad gringo like Chipotle, but not-Mexican-but-not-good gringo like Chile's, the chain restaurant. So if you feel like a hipster, expensive, Gilbert edition of On-The-Border because you've too scared to go to Mexico or even just Mesa so you don't know the difference, go for it. It reminded me of the time I went to Nogales and ate at place serving pizza - people get delighted at the idea that they're eating other people's food even when it has nothing even remotely to do with it. If you like decently fresh, authentic Mexican fare, I think you'll be more impressed with the patio than the food."}
{"text":"We really love the food from here! I only give it 4 stars because honestly every single time we have been the waiters are so raunchy and not very nice. Service is pretty slow and drinks are never refilled. Very short with us and just don't take the time to make sure we are satisfied."}
{"text":"I love Joyride for Taco Tuesday!  This was my first time going to the Gilbert location since I typically go the Joyride in Central Phoenix. Nonetheless I had the same great service and same great taste!

Taco Tuesday is just their happy hour special all day long. $5 Margaritas and Mojitos and $2 Tacos. The tacos are great to put something in your stomach for all the drinks you're throwing back!

They never skimp on the amount of ingredients in the tacos and they always look and smell so good!  My favorite are the carnitas, crispy fish, and the standard. 

I love the tropicale margarita. So many flavors and definitely a strong drink.

Joyride has one of the best Taco Tuesdays in Phoenix, hands down!"}
{"text":"Joyride absolutely has the best Taco Tuesday hands down.  Food is incredible, service is incredible, ambience is incredible. This is always my go to. 

Their taco shells recipe is fluffy and they put them on the grill. Ideal tacos are the carnitas and carne asada but you can't go wrong with any of their tacos. They've switched some margaritas out for new ones and they are very delicious. Try the tropicale and if you like mojitos you'll love be pineapple mojito."}
{"text":"visited with my cousin and the service was wonderful! We recommend the fresh fruit juices with the add of your choice of alcohol. Yum!  Everything was so fresh and good. The churros with caramel is the best. I'm happy heading home."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and It was a good one.  I started out with the lunch special of two tacos and a soup.  For the tacos I had a crispy fish and a carne asada.  I added the tortilla soup as well.  

The carne asada was pretty decent.  I've definitely had better.  It was a little dry and burnt on some pieces but good flavor and just enough spice with the salsa they add.  

The crispy fish however was really good.  Great crisp on the breading and the sauces they add give it a great overall taste.  I would for sure get multiples of these again in the future.  

Now as for the soup I had it was lacking in a lot of areas.  It came out just slightly over warm temperature which was my first turn off.  I also had next to no chicken in it with mostly broth and a lot of veggies.  Missing something as far seasoning but I couldn't pin point what it was.  I just know I've bad much better at other Mexican restaurants.  

All in all a good lunch experience and I will be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"Fancy Mexican food, not real authentic but not bad, just different. Great atmosphere, sort of pricey though.
   Doesn't make it in to my regular rotation of restaurants but I probably will stop in 2-3 times per year."}
{"text":"This was are first time there,  I am the pickiest person when it comes to food, atmosphere and good customer service.  This place went above all expectations.  My daughter ate all of her food which is very rare,  and the (I'm guessing the manager) made my daughter a hot chocolate wich they don't even serve.  My chicken burrito was amazing, the cheese dip was amaaazing.  The coffee and chocolate ice cream brownie were fantastic. They went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect and always was there right on time.  Not to mention the decor was beautiful.  We will be coming back many more times.  Thank you joyride"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch with various tacos and salad..our complaint...why do they have the music so loud ?  Can't have a conversation without raising your voice...this seems to be common practice in the newer restaurants...can understand at happy hour...but not at lunch."}
{"text":"Really like the food here.  Great variety of tacos--love taco Tuesday. I really like the fish tacos.  Blood Orange margarita is very good. Nice Happy Hour. Service is great, casual.   Nice outdoor seating area. Love the ambience and energy in here.  A younger demographic then Postino's next door if that matters. My hubby had a burrito that was great.  Wish I could remember which one."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had the chilaquiles  and my husband had several tacos. The spice profile is perfect. It's like food my mother would make but better.

I plan on returning many times. This is now my Mexican food place to go."}
{"text":"Such great food for reasonable prices! I'd have to say the Mexican food really tastes authentic. Unfortunately, this place is always packed- which really wouldn't be a problem if the staff here were more organized. Every time I come I really hope for a better experience with my waiter each time, but instead I find myself looking for someone to make eye contact with me to place an order, ask a question, etc. It always kind of feels like my table has been forgotten. Like I said, such a shame because the food really is so good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Staff was extremely attentive! Our waiter, Justin, was phenomenal. Love him! I would recommend to anyone looking for good drinks and better service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a late lunch. We've been here several times, but never managed to find time to write a review. 

We started with the Mexican street corn.  Super yum! I would definitely get this again. Smoky paprika and cojita cheese- lime aioli. Wow!

I got the new blueberry flavored margarita called the Sloe Ride. It was tart and ok, but I prefer the Cucumber Serrano margarita which I got second. But I always lean toward whatever is spicy. My second margarita ended up being free, as the bar seemed to forget to make it. Our server corrected the error by getting it for me ASAP and then took it off our tab.  Husband had a pitcher of San Tan Epicenter which he thought  was a great/yummy beer for our hot weather. 

We both got different burritos. We both agreed The Beast was better than the Machaca burrito. I will definitely go for The Beast next time. The smokey carne asada  inside was so very flavorful. I will dream about this burrito. The burritos are served cut in half, so it was very easy to share. 

Now to the part which makes me score Joyride down a star. The chips. What is with the tortilla  chips? They are so boring. We paid $5 to have the salsa \"flight.\" My favorite was the Charred Habanero. Oh what a lovely burn that kept growing the more I ate it! Second favorite was the Fire Roasted (first bowl is free) followed  by the Pico Gringo, and then Tomatillo. The chips tasted like a cheap store brand and contributed nothing to this meal. I live tortilla chips generally. But it these.  Please fix this misdeed ASAP Joyride. We love you otherwise and drive to you all the way from Surprise."}
{"text":"Wow... Just had the worst experience EVER at an Upward project establishment... We were seated promptly and the hostess was very inviting. Here's where we went wrong (apparently), the bartenders started off attentive, but that was short lived. Once our food arrive not once did either of them check on us. The busser/or server did, not the bartenders. They were so wrapped up in cleaning/side work  we didn't get to order our second round of drinks, ask for more guacamole or even get our check in a timely fashion. We actually waited 20 mins to ask some one if we could pay. Then another 10 mins for them to actually bring us the correct tab. I've been here numerous times! Truly disappointed....

On a good note, the food is always good.

We left and went next door to postinos to finish our meal. Had a great experience there...."}
{"text":"Definitely worthwhile to come here on on Taco Tuesday for their $2 tacos! All of them are excellent except the beef can be overdone and dry. Margaritas are delicious and not watered down.

It's not 5/5 for me because of the very long wait while we saw empty tables everywhere which is frustrating."}
{"text":"When you initially walk in it is hard to spot people who work there (they don't have uniforms) but someone will find you! Great food and for a great price. The servers are also extremely helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"really yummy food. I had their fish tacos and blood orange marg, and their street corn, and everything was solidly tasty. Nothing insanely different, but what was done, was done very well, and I actually liked it more than Taco Guild[ gasp.sorry TG], because it did not seem quite as greasy. 

We ate outdoors, and it -can- get loud in the evenings as its always packed so be prepared, those of us less extroverted or with kiddos."}
{"text":"Not a fan, too expensive and the food is below average.  Everyone raved about this place so we had to try it.  Fail, i'll never go back.  Staff wasn't exactly friendly or attentive either.  Not a great selection and if you really want good street tacos go to Lulu's for 1/2 the price"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food is here. I had heard mixed reviews, so I was sketchy on trying it out. I went with a large group of friends and started out with a variety of different appetizers. The guacamole and queso dip with chorizo were bomb!! Yeah the tacos are pricey, 3-5 dollars but honestly that's any price for a taco in the central-downtown phoenix area. I ordered the standard taco and also the crispy fish taco. Both were good. (crispy fish was my favorite) My boyfriend ordered the chicken torta and that was tasty and flavored very well. The pineapple aguas frescas with tequila was definitely a good choice too. Staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, I had a great experience and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is good, food is great, nice atmosphere (I love what they've done with the building). The habanero salsa is the best hot salsa I've ever had. It actually has an amazing flavor and then BAM the heat kicks in and kicks your butt."}
{"text":"I think I had a shrimp, baja fish and veggie taco and they were all good.  The bag of fresh chips & salsa was icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Boy, do I love this place!  My husband and I went on Saturday night with another couple and we were blown away.   All the tacos were great but the scallop, carne asada, baja and short rib were our favorites.  I am still thinking about the Mexican Street Corn the day after.  Amazing.  You would never know that this restaurant has not even been open for a week.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went to Joyride for the first time on Sunday, around brunch time.  Sat at the bar, ordered a cold Negro Modelo - they only offer it on draft.  Staff was very friendly and engaging. The place is super cute, love the outside patio, good blend of background music.  For the food, I started with guacamole, chips and salsa - all were tasty.  The salsa had a nice kick.  Tried the shrimp, fish and ahi tacos.  The shrimp was flavorful, fish appeared slightly under cooked - so that lost points.  The ahi was by far the winner - amazing actually.  Will definitely go back, thrilled to see more restaurants in Central Phx."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first experience at Joyride. I had shrimp and grilled fish tacos and tortilla soup. The tacos are amazing! The soup was good but not great but still worth trying.

The atmoshere and food make this a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place quite a bit. I had three different types of tacos. I liked the carne asada best. The meat had a slightly Asian flavor due to the marinade that my wife didn't care for. My wife liked the veggie taco. This place has a cool funky vibe. Be prepared to wait there is always a ton of people."}
{"text":"Just a mediocre experience.

My friends and I had a reservation for 8 at 7pm.  We were seated immediately upon arrival on a busy Friday night in the patio area.  Our waiter was nice and made good suggestions.  The food is just okay; nothing to brag about.  The tacos are very expensive for what they give you (average price is $4 for a SINGLE small street style taco a la carte).  The tacos come out on a rack family-style.  So while in the dark environment of the patio and main dining area, you pay $4 for a tiny taco and have to search all over the table to find your taco (RIDICULOUS- the waiter tells you all the tacos on the rack and then you go racing to find yours).  The drinks are average for their prices.

After dining, my friends and I were chatting at the table and catching up (pretty normal post dining activity).  About 8:30pm, a hostess asked us to leave our table as they had to accommodate a reservation at 8:45pm.  WOW....I don't think I have EVER been asked to leave a restaurant.  She hostess did ask in a nice manner and handed out coupons for free tacos as to make up for asking us to leave. 

We ended moving our party to the outside of the restaurant to continue chatting.  By 9:30PM, no party had ever been seated at our table!   

I will never return to this restaurant.  Paying over $40 for 2 tacos and 2 drinks and being rudely asked to leave my table is just not worth it."}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for a weekend afternoon to go with friends or solo and sit at the bar. The atmosphere is just right for any type of occasion really and they have plenty of outdoor space.  I had only been to this part of Gilbert at night and was carving some shrimp tacos and I must say I'm glad that I decided to check this place out. It was a little busy but they have amazing deals , I had a small pitcher of IPA for $5. Bartender told me they have great happy hour deals Monday - Friday!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I leave happy! Taco Tuesday's are the best also!!!!! This is run like a well oiled machine, great teamwork, awesome food, and overall great staff. Always a good time"}
{"text":"Come here for taco Tuesday, every other days it's very pricey. The tacos were definitely not authentic, teetering more towards hipster. Come here if you're looking for a cool ambience, don't come here of you're a foodie looking for authentic Mexican food. Service was okay and Arnold Palmer I had was... Sad. 

Might be back for taco Tuesday if other Mexican restaurants are full."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place and we were not disappointed. The vibe is modern trendy Mexican, so if you are hoping for authentic go somewhere else. The restaurant is situated in Downtown Gilbert next to other fantastic restaurants. My biggest thank you to the owner and chef goes to the portion and flavor. In an environment of over sized American gluttony this place provides the \"right\" size for an entree. I ordered 3 tacos, Chicken, Pork and Carne Asada with a side of Black beans... I was very satisfied. The Salsa was AMAZING and helped round out the meal. Overall a strong contender for an evening out, happy hour or even with the kids!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, great atmosphere.  Looking forward to returning to try more dishes.  My friend had the enchiladas and they looked fantastic.  Good appetizers too.  So much better tasting than Taco Guild!"}
{"text":"Really awesome food, good portion sizes and the salsa is fresh and awesome! 

Though I do wish they would give more salsa with their food, it was a great experience and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We started with the chips and salsa and we all enjoyed them and thought they were great. We had the nachos and at first they were great but then we realized they might have needed more cheese. My sister-in-law got the horchata and it's homemade and delicious. If you go here get that to drink. Even if you typically don't like horchata try it. The rest of us got the tacos for dinner. I loved my grilled fish taco but the rest of the group did not love their tacos. They thought they lacked flavor. My brother-in-laws food got forgotten and the manager did bring out the missed meal but no apology. Then about 15 minutes later they tried to bring another plate of food for him. They did offer us free dessert but not because they messed up on his meal but because it was our first time. They took so long for soda refills because everything comes from the bar. They just seemed really unorganized. They could use either more help or a better organizational structure. I don't think we will go back because overall it was not great."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, not fantastic.  Music was so loud that a normal conversational tone was not sufficient. Not sure if I'd recommend it, not bad...not great. Go next door and get a pizza."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to writing a review after going here so often! 

I always order the standard and the tinga tacos. The black beans are awesome too. My boyfriend gets the fish tacos, which he says are amazing. 

The cocktails are delicious and potent. I usually go for a pineapple mojito or blood orange margarita. 

We just discovered that Joyride has a great deal on Taco Tuesday- $5 margaritas and select $2 tacos. However, they are much busier due to the awesome dinner deal. You have to plan on waiting to get seated, if you can't snag a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"When the Snooze next door refused my reservation of 20 people for my wedding rehearsal brunch, it's safe to say bridezilla was about to make an appearance. Thankfully my now husband calmed me down and got us in at Joyride m, and thank god for that. What bride to be doesn't need a margarita at 11 in the morning?! Great food, great drinks and an even better staff. Thank you so much for making our rehearsal lunch amazing."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and I really like this restaurant a lot. Really like the ambiance and the great service always with a smile as it should be. Really like their Crispy Fish Tacos, shrimp, Carne Asada and the Braised beef tacos, did try their Serrano Cucumber Margarita and it is a treat. Definitely want to check out their Taco Tuesday deals!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Came here before my bridal appt to celebrate with a friend and was unimpressed to say the least. 
We asked for drinks with a small amount of alcohol and got the exact opposite. 
We ordered food at 6:05 and after taking our order the server avoided our table at all costs. Party of 6 came in at 6:20 and sat behind us. They received their food at 6:42. 
At 6:45 we still hadn't seen our server or our food. We excused ourselves from the table and proceeded to walk out the door. 
We had our bridal appointment at 7 and couldn't wait any longer. As we were leaving we stopped the hostess and informed her that we were leaving and I left $20 on the table for our drinks. Didn't receive an apology or anything. 
Absolutely disgusted and now more hungry than ever"}
{"text":"I love this place! I enjoy the ambiance - lovin' the hexagon tiles on the walls, the bronze lighting and comfy chairs at the bar (can I take one home? haha), and the outdoor seating area. I also love that they have $5 drinks until 5 p.m. every day AND free chips and salsa! I really like \"The Beast\" burrito or the tacos and a margarita on the rocks with salt on the rim. This is a great place for small or medium groups and I have never had to wait for a table, so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"where to begin with this place?  located in the heart of downtown Gilbert, this place has retro written all over it.  everything from the sign to the decor has a mid century modern meets a surf side grub joint style to it.  walking in i was really amused with the place so i knew i would be in for a good time.  

on this visit i only came for some beers and sadly did not get to try any of the food other than the chips and salsa which were quite tasty.  The beer selection was pretty decent with a large collection of Mexican beers.  i was happy they had my favorite which is Victoria.  Although I did not taste, the fish tacos looked pretty scrumptious as well.  

downtown Gilbert is really booming and if you're looking for a fun festive atmosphere this place is it."}
{"text":"Another great addition to Central Phoenix!  I absolutely love the atmosphere and decor of this place...wouldn't furnish my house this way, but totally appreciate and love it!  

The staff was super friendly and helpful with suggestions.  The food was great - we tried 6 different kinds of tacos and ordered a few sides too.  The agua fresca was amazing...combo of pineapple and strawberry - yummy!"}
{"text":"Crispy fish and stardard taco are the best!  Margaritas are delicious. Service is excellent. Very cool element about the restaurant itself. Happy hours and taco Tuesday are great deals."}
{"text":"Food was awesome..it took our server a minute to get to us...but they were busy..so not a big deal..highly recommend the blood orange margaritas and raspberry ancho margaritas"}
{"text":"Started out with the chips and salsa. Excellent salsa and the chips were very fresh.  We went at 7pm and the lighting in the restaurant was almost non existent. It was VERY difficult to read the menu. I had the beast burrito chimichanga style and it was amazing. We also tried the street corn and it didn't disappoint.  The fish tacos were great.  I especially liked the corn tortillas. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"I've dined here 3 times and have to admit that I can't get past the fish taco!  YUM!  Crunchy, flavorful--So yummy!  There are many other treats to try at this establishment.  The decor is fun, seating in a booth is comfortable with others and the service is always consistently right on.  They will do for you whatever it takes!  You place your order, and it's there in hardly no time at all.  Fresh!"}
{"text":"This taco place overall was not very good. 

When we got here we saw an empty table that could accommodate all of the people we had. They said there would be an hour long wait, and after waiting about 20-30 mins we got seated at that same table!

I ordered the crispy fish tacos and the shrimp tacos. (The crispy fish comes with flour and so I asked for corn). 
The tortillas were horrible quality, they fell apart relatively easily and in general were mediocre at BEST. The shrimp had a bad taste, and was rubbery. The best part of the tacos were the pico da gringo and the fish in the fish tacos. The salsa was super tasty, but the ceviche we ordered was eh. 
 The music was super loud, it was hard to hear people sitting across from me which was annoying. 
Overall the quality of this place could have been better. I think that this place is over rated on yelp, based on actually trying the food."}
{"text":"White folks do some bomb ass Tack Ohs. 5 dollar pitchers at Happy Hour and some ok salza with chips. Fave Tack Ohs in the valley by far....."}
{"text":"Oh Joyride...you disappointed me greatly.  I've been wanting to try this place for a long time and unfortunately we won't be back.  It's extremely loud so forgot about having a normal conversation with people.  They charge you $3 to refill your chips and salsa.  The salsa was super hot with no option for a mild salsa.  I had the standard and the carnitas tacos and they were good but the side of Joyrice tasted like the packets of rice you buy from the store.  My kids got the nachos off the kids menu and neither of them ate them.  The kids were fried and gross and the cheese type substance on top was interesting.  If you want good tacos and a better atmosphere, head down the street to Taco Guild."}
{"text":"We had to see what hype was about!!

A little bummed the chips were not gluten free :( but the iced tea is delicious!

The atmosphere is super fun and retro.

The food was outstanding. Tons of flavor and filling!

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We came to try the tacos, but they messed up our appetizer order so to correct the order we kept the carnitas nachos and they still gave us the carne asada nachos. Soooo we got too full to order anything else. We'll have to come back for the tacos because I'm confident they'll be as delicious as the nachos were! Both dishes were flavorful, the meat was tender & not chewy, And the portions were huge - enough to share for 4 people. The cheese didn't get dry, the creme wasn't too runny, it was simply tasty!
We also had the almond horchata w/rum in it. DEE-LISH-OUS lol"}
{"text":"very cool environment, great staff who have earned their chops at postinos and Windsor downtown (great to see familiar faces).  have been here several times with friends and each time very nice.  i had tamales and they were tasty but a little dry, asked for some enchilada sauce - excellent.  good food, house salsa is super tasty, margs are excellent."}
{"text":"Great place. We do work happy hours here and all and enjoy their margaritas, tacos and mexican street corn!!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the mixed reviews, my wife and I were a bit nervous to try what appeared to be an overly hipster Mexican joint.  It's an understatement to say we were blown away!  Our server Justin was super friendly and provided stellar service. We started with the Shrimp Ceviche which had just the right amount of acidity and copious amounts of fresh plump shrimp.

For our entrees, we shared three tacos: a fried fish, a grilled shrimp, and a cochinata pibil. All were absolutely delicious, but the standouts in my opinion were the shrimp and fish, especially the fresh guacamole which added just the right amount of freshness to the fried fish.  We also split the Enselada Fila which was fresh, crispy, light, and vibrant!  Although slightly overpriced, Joyride Taco House is well worth it with its fresh ingredients and friendly service.  Lesson well learned: never judge a hipster book by its cover."}
{"text":"My husband and I had some errands to run in Gilbert and We drove by this place so We thought we would give it a try. Wow! We weren't disappointed. We had shrimp ceviche, chicken burrito, pork and chicken and fish tacos. Everything was on point. Delicious and fresh. We will definitely come back here again when we in the area. Wish there was the one near by where we live."}
{"text":"I tried the Standard and Carne Asada Taco. I don't recommend the carne asada. I'm very particular when it comes to asada. 

I do recommend their chicken taco though. Very good with their salsa. A little over priced at $3.75 each. 

I did order this through Ubereats though. I can't wait to try the tacos, Mexican street corn and agua fresca in person. 

If you're interested in real street tacos let me know! I'll be happy to help with recommendations."}
{"text":"This place has better tacos than its neighbor barrio queen. I recommend \"the standard\", just a solid taco, yummy. Bartenders were nice. Kind of small dining area so if you're claustrophobic, it may be a turn off. It's also always super packed and busy. Only been here once so I will update with future visits."}
{"text":"Why no one else has given this an all stars review is beyond me. My husband and I went here for the first time today and being a regular at the other Postinos group restaurants, this did not disappoint! That entire block has all our favorites. Sure parking is a hassle but they pretty much all offer valet and it looks like they're on the process of creating a parking area for all their fans. The food was amazing and fresh, especially the carne asada taco and shrimp taco. Now we can eat Mexican food 3x a day, and this fresh and zesty menu definitely hit the spot. Reasonable prices as well. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful, and our server knew the menu like the back of his hand. Surprisingly a dying trait among servers. Everyone seemed happy to be there and were professional yet fun and personable. I'm happy to find my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Being right down the street, Joyride is a great place to go for a quick, delicious lunch.  First time I went, i was pleasantly surprised at the authenticity of the food.  The carne asada tacos were cooked perfectly, had great flavor, as did the pork carnitas.

Their salsa is good...a little mild--ask for the hot, you'll love it.  Only thing I would recommend is dialing down the music a bit as it's a little loud if you're talking biz."}
{"text":"$5 margaritas on a Sunday afternoon?  Yes please! Very cool place with a nice vibe. Busy place with delicious food."}
{"text":"Trendy can always cloud our senses.  A cute place, WAY too loud music!! I want to eat NOT dance!!! (At the moment). We were celebrating a birthday and we were seated by the front door so the ambiance was looking at Gilbert Rd.  The menu was simple and the food overpriced and underwhelming for tacos...I had a burrito which came out burned....it was extremely tiny for $8.  It was black, plunked on a plate, with no other friends, embellishments or garnish,  except an itty-bitty cup for a tablespoon of sauce.  Honestly how much does a thimble of beans, rice or salad cost!???

 I sent it back and they graciously and profusely apoligized,the manager even came by and apoligized and brought me an unburned version of the same, tiny, burrito.   My friends had three tacos that looked ok.  Since I'm from California,  the Mexican, or trendy Mexican food in Arizona , is substandard to say the least and not even close to what I'm used to.  Mexican food is not expensive...

The manager took the burrito off the bill but with tacos, burrito and non-alcoholic drinks $48 with tip.  Plus, no  treat for the birthday girl and the desserts did not sound appetizing..

I will never return,  It didn't WOW me...there are bigger and better out there , without the hype, the trend, the crowded location and full parking lots on a Wednedsay night !  It's no big deal!

I realize this is a bar atmosphere but I'm beginning to be extra picky about a little bit food for high prices....and the quality better rock, to justify those prices..."}
{"text":"Love their margaritas. Love their nacho's. Love their patio. Love the ambiance.  Always busy and usually have to wait for a table. The rest of their menu is good but nothing noteworthy. Great place to have a happy hour but I'd check out another Mexican restaurant for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Ate here with a large group of people in my industry. The service was prompt and the food was delicious. The chips and salsa were perfect. Awesome patio and great happy hour prices....."}
{"text":"Manager reached out so we decided to give it another try. 

Had a chicken burrito bowl style with a side tortilla and it really tasty. Enchiladas were different, but a good flavor. The almond horchata was very yummy. We all finished our meals, no leftovers. 

Only gave a 4 stars because our server didn't inquire about dessert, just brought the check."}
{"text":"I love that Gilbert is getting more and more non-chain restaurants and the food is fresh and tasty.  The wait to get in could be twice as long and still enjoyable because of the outdoor seating/setting.

However, the service was not good at all.  Our waitress was rude and kept explaining that they didn't know how to handle a crowd this big.  It was Saturday afternoon and busy but not overwhelmingly so in my opinion.

My sister asked if she could order a bowl of fruit for one of the kids, and the waitress said no that's not allowed because it has to go through the kitchen.  Um, my sister didn't ask to get it for free or to get it before the rest of the meal.

We asked for chips and salsa and the reply was Seriously you'll get them when they're ready.  Lots of people want them and they aren't ready yet.  Again...um...it was a question.  We weren't even irritated to have not gotten them yet.  It was a request.

And, the night went on with a defensive waitress who was either new, in over her head or recently screamed at by too many other tables that her reflex was always defensive.

By the end of the night she seemed to realize she needed to warm up to my sister if she wanted a tip because she was finally somewhat friendly when she dropped off the bill.

Had the waitress been friendly and the noise level a bit lower overall, I would definitely give this place more stars."}
{"text":"Muy bueno! Delicious street tacos. Fresh ingredients. Margaritas are tasty too. The decor is a much needed switch up from the norm. We love meeting friends there. Just like anywhere in downtown gilbert, it gets crowded on weekends."}
{"text":"Really love Joyride. Some of the best tacos and friendliest service in the valley. Great carne asda, super salsa and cool atmosphere. Try it, I'm sure you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The manager reached out to me and I really do appreciate the time and effort on her part to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"The. Best. Tacos. 
I've tried a few tacos in my day. It usually consists of driving to a stand somewhere on an intersection where car exhaust penetrates your nostrils and the local bums are looking at you as they salivate after your every bite. 

Enter Joyride. All the delicious flavors of your local stand without all the unwanted toppings! 
Amazing drinks! Awesome service and crew! And the  funnest eating environment. I highly recommend their braised beef tacos and the serrano cucumber margarita! OMGizzle! Fo shizzle!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was fun, food was great (don't miss the Mexican street corn). Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my bestie today it was awesome! My phone was dying and Alex moved us to a booth with an outlet lol super rad thank you guys"}
{"text":"Love this place for Taco Tuesday! They always have a rear selection of beer on tap as well. Their margaritas are also very pleasing with some chicken tacos!"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos & spiked Aguas Fresca! It stays open til midnight on weekends which is very convenient since nearly all of Gilbert is usually closed by 10pm. I am a huge fan of all of Upward Projects restaurants and the area of DT Gilbert so this is a plus in my book! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and solid food, with local beers. Spiked cucumber aqua fresca was perfect for a sunny afternoon. Horchata fresca, not so much..strong artificial almond flavor.

Their salsa was wonderful, as were the nachos with chicken and the carne asada burrito bowl. The chips for the nachos could have been less soggy. I'd definitely go back for the pitchers of brews & probably try the tacos."}
{"text":"Very good contemporary Mexican cuisine.

My FIL was visiting and was craving for some Mexican food. We decided to check this place out.  Very airy and open, perfect for the weather we're having at this moment.  Pineapple Mojito caught my eyes even before I decided on my food, which was a little too sweet for my taste.  Hubby ordered The Bandit (chicken, carne asada, cochinita pilbil plate).  FIL had The Beast carne asada and bean burrito.  Both paired their food with Stella.  To go with my Mojito, Vegetarian and Goat cheese enchilada with salsa verde and ancho chile sauce was a perfect fit.  My little cutie pie had his usual quesadilla and fresh lemonade.    No room for any dessert.  We do want to try their churro with chocolate dip next time around.

The service was impeccable!  Everyone seemed like they enjoy working there.  The manager came by to ask how everything was.  It was very good, thank you!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is the veggie burrito 
And the salads are delicious!!! 
AND THE CORN!!!! 
This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, great food. Never had a bad experience.  Except one time there was a lot of flies during the day. Other than that all food so far is delish and drinks are too!"}
{"text":"The trendy Mexican/taco scene is heating up in phoenix. and at 3-5 per small taco wouldn't you want to be in the game too?

Step in to a overly retro 60's themed inside, from the lamps to the wallpaper you would think you are in Austin powers. The patio is nice despite the terrible metal chairs. 

You will be greeted by the obligatory chips and salsa, but it is nice that they don't charge extra for this staple. 

The menu has salads tacos burritos and tortas. For vegetarians its pretty much salads, a taco or a burrito. For the best value go for the burrito it is full of great items like mushrooms and roasted veggies all for $8 they will even make it a heart friendly chimichanga for no extra charge. 

I tried a trio of tacos that included a side for a grand total of $14. They were good but more of an appetizer than a meal. Luckily there were more chips to gorge on."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed Taco Tuesday. Had The Standard (chicken), Carne Asada, and Crispy Fish Tacos along with a few Pineapple Mojitos .... Delish!"}
{"text":"This is quite a charming place in Downtown Gilbert. Great food, atmosphere, and service; what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I give the place 2 stars total.  

The place gets 5 stars for the atmosphere.  It's a good spot to meet people or take a date.  There is music playing and after awhile it starts to get a little loud.  The place was busy on a Thursday night.  The whole area was busy, gilbert is making their own little busy down town.

The food I give a 1 star.  The taste was ok but for the price it should have been better.  The beef had some fatty stuff.  The chicken and pork was ok.  The waitress bragged about the tacos and that they made the tortillas in house.  The tortillas were soft on the inside and edges were dehydrated.  The horchata was not that great, too much cinnamon. 

The bill for 2 of us was $40 which i thought was over priced.   I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Alright for starters let's just say the service here was mind numbingly slow. Sobered up between each drink yet they had the nerve to mention they have a five beverage limit. The tacos are what got them the one star, $2 tacos got what we paid for. Will definitely be enjoying our only day off at another happy hour in the future 

Ps. Getting out checks took even longer"}
{"text":"Best music good vibes tacos are ok drinks are better lol love the atmosphere though - tacos needs more flavor if u ask me"}
{"text":"Nice spot in old town, right on Main Street with nice outdoor seating.  Service was ok., place was busy and staff seemed hurried.  Food was mediocre., expected more flavor and richness but found it to be pretty basic."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients with house made everything!   The vibe is cheerful and friendly with a hipster edge.   Beautiful patio with fireplace and they are dog friendly.  The baja taco is crispy and satisfying..   The grilled shrimp taco has a great barbecue flavor.   You are guaranteed a great meal here!"}
{"text":"Joyride is so deliciously hip!

Although it's not your typical authentic mexican food restaurant, the creativity of the menu makes up for it.....oh! and the happy hour menu is everything! 

The 'Cheese y Mas'  is a must! very cheesy, topped with chorizo and paired with homemade chips......yummmn!

I also ordered three tacos: chicken tinga, carnitas and pork adobada. Noo regrets! the meat was flavorful and very delicious!

If you happen to be in the mood for a drink or two, try their 'Prickly Pear Margarita'...super tasty! it compliments anything on the menu.

As far as service, Tony was amazing. His taste buds were on point, everything he recommended was delicious! He was also very attentive and friendly as well as everyone else who serviced us."}
{"text":"Loved the fish tacos! Oober tasty! The cucumber salad is soo delicious... YUM! Just the right amount of sweet and spice!"}
{"text":"Good - not great, although my 13 year old loved his burrito. The food was O.K., nothing I would crave or go back for. Everyone we came in contact with was very nice and attentive but I personally prefer having one server. We had 3 people asking the same questions 3 times over."}
{"text":"Loved the tacos here! Husband & I have been wanting to try this place for a while. Went out for dinner with our friends & we will all be coming back soon. Margaritas we're delicious! Salsa that comes out with the chips is pretty spicy. My husband was impressed by the selection of craft beers available since he was expecting domestic drafts & corona. My only minor issue was sitting out on the patio and not being able to read the menu because the lighting isn't that great. I would love to see some cute and festive patio lights strung across the patio!"}
{"text":"Since our first visit to Joyride Taco House on July 7th we have been there numerous times.  We are huge fans of Upward Projects restaurants.  It's one of those restaurants where you just like \"being\" there.  Great music, great service, yummy food and don't get me started on the Mazatlan Mules-hands down my favorite current drink!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night with some friends for my husbands birthday dinner. Got there at 6:30 and was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. We got ourselves seated at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender. He walked us through the fresh Agua Frescas drinks and their signature cocktails. I ordered the cucumber lime Agua Fresca with gin and my friend ordered the blood orange marg. Both were knock your socks off good! Little hefty on price, but delicious! Also ordered the Citrus Agua Frescas and a Pineapple mojito....same caliper...delish! Chips and salsa were amazing. Nice hefty chips with just the right amount of salt. Smoky, spicy salsa that wasn't too chunky. We waited for our table for about 30 minutes before the waitress came and grabbed us. She was very apologetic but we told her were fine waiting with drinks and chips! 
Next came the food. Our group ordered the machaca burrito, short ribs tacos, carne asada burrito and a grilled and fried fish taco. Also ordered the mexican street corn. 
Starting with tacos: 
We were told the best seller was the short rib tacos. I found them to lack any flavor at all and had to add salt and salsa to give them any taste. Same goes for the grilled fish. Very bland. 
Burritos: Carne Asada burrito was ok. Not great.  It was a huge burrito that my husband only ate half of. 
Machaca burrito was good. I didn't try this but was told by my friend that it was really good at the beginning, but then lost it's luster half way through. 
Grilled Street Corn: I consider myself an aficionado on Mexican street corn. When driving through Mesa, I drive slow so that I can look for the carts and will stop and order it. I love, Love LOVE street corn. While they made a great attempt, it wasn't on point. The corn was way over cooked...almost mushy.  Didn't have a great deal of spice, even though there was chili powder on it. The cotija cheese was yummy. 

All in all, this place is great for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers. I will definitely try it again, but will order something else.
I give the drinks a 5 out of 5
I give the food a 2 out of 5. 
I give the chips and salsa a 4.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"We love Joyride! I have a severe Gluten allergy & they are always accommodating to my needs. The food is amazing, service is great & we love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"You should only be eating here if you care about being seen and want to be surrounded by hipsters.

The tacos were some of the most bland i have ever had.  Add that to the price and there is absolutely no reason to go here.

So sad to see people flocking here when the food is sooo underwhelming."}
{"text":"We have been to joyride about 5 or 6 times since becoming vegetarian. Food is wonderful and the service is typically good. 

They have a wonderful vegi taco and there salsa is very tasty. Top all of that off with the pinto beans and it's a wonderful meal. I took my mom for Mother's Day and the parents were very impressed. This is a must visit place."}
{"text":"Joyrides was delicious, I got the tacos and they were great. But this place is very overpriced. The atmosphere was sweet and I had a great waitress! She has blue hair shout out to you!  good food just to expensive."}
{"text":"This is now our favorite Mexican restaurant in Gilbert. Great ambiance, friendly and helpful service, and delicious food. Blood orange margarita and horchata with amaretto were amazing. Tacos and quesadilla were flavorful and generous portions. Really good choice! Recommended!"}
{"text":"I'll start off with the horrible seating process which starts off with a 45min wait for NO reason. We arrived on a Friday night about 7:30pm and had a seat at the bar until a table was ready. As we looked around, there was easily 6 tables and a booth available for patrons. The hostesses just keep chatting amongst themselves and then they'd call all seven parties at once causing a huge cluster at the front. You'd think they would keep the flow moving and sit parties as guests leave? My biggest gripe was that they nickel and dime you for literally everything! You are limited to one basket of free chips and salsa then you are charged for more- want hotter salsa... upcharge of $3! Want more red sauce on the burrito you already paid an upcharge on for enchilada style... $3 more! I was super disappointed with the burrito which was very dry. I'll admit the black beans and cheese y mas appetizer were amazing though. Add in the horrible parking situation and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. Sat at our table waiting for so long ended up just having to leave."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places I'm at at least once a week. The salad is fresh and tasty. I always sit at the bar and Timmy, one of the bartenders is always great conversation."}
{"text":"Ok, so I had great expectations for this places and I was left hanging. The dollar taco stands in Puerto Penasco are better than this place. Im very picky when it comes to Mexican because a lot of people fall short when trying to put a spin on what in my opinion doesn't need fixing. The environment was nice and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I would come back more for the attention the staff gives rather than the food. Don't get me wrong, food is good just not the ALL THAT it's made out to be. Some people like the Gringo version of Mexican food. I on the other hand I like traditional. Give them a shot."}
{"text":"Never had bad service 
Tacos have all been great.. Tried most 
Mexican 75 is the best margarita 
House salsa is yummy"}
{"text":"Cucumber mint agua freasca... Enough said"}
{"text":"It's my second time coming here and I love the margaritas... but that's it. The cucumber Serrano Margarita is so good! The tacos on the other hand are really sad. No flavor at all. I didn't like the tacos the first time and thought ok well it's Taco Tuesday maybeeeee the cooks are in a rush, but I've came to realize that it's just how they are made. Which is fine, the ambience of the place is hip and the servers are really nice. Just wish the food was as good. I will be back for a margarita."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight with my boo and  I am definitely a fan. He loved his carne asada burrito and my enchiladas were super tasty. They are a little different than the traditional saucy enchilada, but good flavor.  The rice was very good and the mexican slaw had pumpkin seeds in it, which added a nice crunch! The main thing that would keep us going back was the amazing service. Our server was Kimberly and she took care of us from start to finish. It is refreshing to go out and actually get great service."}
{"text":"Decent food if you're super hungry. Horrible service! Don't come if you are in a time crunch."}
{"text":"Great food.  Service so so.  2nd time there.  Waited a bit for drinks order,  never got a refill on salsa. Just ok service.  Hoping for a better experience next time..."}
{"text":"No biggie, just the best street taco's north of the border. sides were great, service was great waiter was dry and slightly snobby. what else do you want. It was loud and super cool.  this place is a \"must go to\" for all of your out of down guests. They don't have a place like this in Des Moines Iowa."}
{"text":"Tacos are good (not change your life good, but good).  Service is fan-f'ing-tastic... not just once or twice- every time I come in.  Very reasonably priced.  Very good ambience.  5 dollar mini-pitcher during HH. I highly recommend checking this place out for lunch or HH."}
{"text":"Truly great service! I was excited to order my food and actually ordered myself the wrong menu item. They have two styles of fish tacos and didn't think twice about it... when I received grilled over crispy I realized my mistake... the bar tender was so nice and understanding he quickly fixed my order to ensure I got the meal I wanted! He was so polite through the dinning experience they truly understand customer service"}
{"text":"The newest member of the Upward Projects family!  They have a pretty good selection to chose from ranging from cute little tacos to big burritos. All of their food is fresh. If you order 3 tacos you get a side free, the tacos range about $3 to $4 so your looking at about $9 to $12 for a taco platter. I ordered two chickens tacos and a fish taco with a side of rice. All were really good. Like their brothers, Winsor & Federal Pizza, if you visit before 6pm for happy hour (everyday) you can get a pitcher of beer (a good selection including local) for $5. The service was really friendly, and the brownie that topped off my meal was delicious. The seating is comfortable with a great outside area complete with fire place for those very small winters."}
{"text":"It's a fun place. But limited to their Spanish menu. So don't order an old fashioned. Stick to the stuff they do well and you'll be happy"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It has become a haunt of mine and my boyfriends. They have great drinks, great happy hour, great tacos, and quesadillas that I'm pretty sure are made with voodoo magic because they're AMAZING. Beyond that, the service is always excellent and the staff is so welcoming. 

We come specifically for Jeremy who mixes amazing drinks and provides the best experience every time. If he's not around Karn always takes such great care of us!

Overall, great crew and always a fun, laid back time. A must check out!"}
{"text":"Came in thinking I would give it a shot, I will be back very soon with how great he food and service was."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place more stars.. but after not being greated by anyone for over five minutes in an almost empty restaurant it's hard to. I have been here prior and the service was never great, but the food is."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and certainly won't b my last!  Went for Taco tuesday and was thrilled with the $2 taco selection and the $5 margueritas!  
I had the carne asada and the chicken tinga both were moist and flavorful.  Came with chips and homemade salsa. the chips were thicker than I like but held the salsa well! We also ordered the guacamole which had bites of corn in it to sweeten it a bit.  my choice of drink was the coconut and boy was it delicious! my friend had a different one and we loved them so much we had two!
I also want to comment on the staff operations.  Constantly we were approached to make sure we were satisfied and not only by our regular server either which was pleasant. Someone was always checking and wiping spills and food and this was at the busiest time.   When entering we were immediately greeted with friendly smiles and even though we arrived at 450 pm there was a wait of about 15 minutes but we didn't mind that because it's always an indication of good food. One complaint is parking. It fills up fast! So get there early if possible!  
The same owners as Postino, Churn, Windsor and Federal Pizza.  WHY GO ANYWHERE ELSE?"}
{"text":"Nice bar, good music, great tacos! Salsa with chips was good. Happy hr price of pitcher was great- dos Equis- was cold and mug was ice cold. I had the 3 fish taco selection of Baja grilled fish, ahi tuna, and crispy fish. They were all excellent - grilled probably the best. Orange cucumber salad ordered with tacos was a nice cool off to the spicy salsa. Total bill was $19 and well worth it. Very nice and upbeat atmosphere - but wondering about the open air design when summer rolls around in Gilbert with the cow dairies close by.... You know, flies may be a problem -but I guess they can always shut the windows. Nice addition to downtown Gilbert! I will definitely return to joyride!"}
{"text":"Excellent taco Tuesday!  $2 tacos, $5 margaritas!  Great ambiance and fast service!  Ask for Chris or Lucas to be your servers!"}
{"text":"It's been too long since I've had their tacos. Usually i stick with the lovely Lola salad, but today its taco time. MY OH MY they are extremely tasty and fresh. I ordered the braised beef...it's crazy good and overloaded with meat and avocado. YUM"}
{"text":"So I previously posted a excellent review, but I will have to rescind that review for my dinner experience.
We had a less than enthusiastic waitress who was rude. This was clear as she sighed after every request and made it seem like it every request was super inconvenient. 
We weren't impressed by the salsa so we asked if they had other salsas. She brings out three and never mentions that she is charging us two dollars for every small bowl of salsa. We didn't like any of these any better than the first (but were charged $6 for the three salsas). 
Because I had had such a good experience before, I was hoping my friend would be equally impressed and love the food. 
We ordered the Bandito thinking that would be plenty of food for us to share. It was and it was delicious, but we were disappointed that we were charged $2 for every plate of four small corn tortillas when it's clearly evident that four is not enough. (Also not told about this charge).
For desert, I decided to spurge and get the churros. Churros were average, but you'll want to skip the chocolate and Carmel sauce ( which has no resemblence  of a sweet taste and tastes a bit what I would imagine battery acid to taste like).

I was shocked at the bill and decided to pay it and leave. We were not told about multiple additional charges on my bill. I was not in the mood to argue, but my friend was and the manager did a good job of attempting to make it right. 

 Joyride has great food. Still bad services overrides any desire any desire to come back to this restaurant and I will not be back."}

{"text":"I don't understand why people wait for over an hour to eat here on taco Tuesday. Dined here Saturday 10/14 around 530 pm with no wait at all. It was my first time having the Mexican Street corn, it was ok, looking forward to trying it a other restaurants. Ordered 3 tacos, chicken, fried fish and shrimp. The fried fish was the best out of the 3. Ordered the brownie with no nuts. The brownie was very dry, so I ate all of the ice cream and left like 3/4 if the brownie. I love dessert it's probably what I look forward to the most, so when I leave my dessert unfinished that says a lot and not in a good way. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a great time as always! Love the atmosphere, food, and service. The staff is very attentive and friendly, adding a comforting touch to the experience. The surrounding area is perfect for the type of vibe Joyride exudes, very laid back and inviting. Definitely a staple restaurant for my boyfriend and me, as we love to come and enjoy a couple margaritas with some chips and salsa. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Tacos were good, nothing to rave about. None of the less a good dinner option for taco tuesday ($2/taco). The chicken tinga was not spicy as I had anticipated based on the flame next to the option on the menu. Be prepared to wait a good hour before being seated."}
{"text":"So I know I have written reviews about this fun place before but every time we go we take different friends with us and they want to go back again and again AND AGAIN.... now we are just part of this fam....We love this place.. ambiance is unbeatable.... tacos rock, drinks outstanding.... people are AWESOME!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for taco Tuesday and I was disappointed that they were soft shell tacos. The carne asada tacos aren't even carne asada. The meat was chewy, tough and gross. The standard taco was good along with the adobada taco. Their margaritas are amazing.  Strong but good, 5 dollar margs! 
Tacos are 2 dollars. I've been to places where they have 1 dollar tacos and taste 10x better. Therefore I would not recommend taco Tuesday here. I'd go for the margaritas though, and maybe try something different"}
{"text":"Had the chicken tinga, carnitas, and baja fish tacos and they were all great!  Had the Mezcal Paloma to drink first and didn't love it.  I had never had mezcal before so I'm guessing that's why.  Had the prickly pear margarita after and it was great.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After two visits, it is just an ok experience.  There is no real waiting area in this small place, and there is always a wait, even when they have two tables open and cleared.
The prickly pear margarita was overly sweet with more syrup than tequila.  I just wanted my tacos to be hot, and they never are.  Just no real reason to try again."}
{"text":"I've had a few family members say this isn't their favorite spot, but we loved it! Really great atmosphere and DELICIOUS tacos! Street corn was also very good."}
{"text":"I had the Carne Asada Taco (without the salsa) and a Shrimp Taco, both are Gluten Free and so yummy!!
The wait was on the longer side (30 mins or so) around 8pm on a Saturday night.
Our server was Tim and he was super nice and knowledgeable about what was on the menu.
But with the restaurant being so crowded we didn't get service as quickly. 
But I definitely want to go back (probably during Happy Hour or Taco Tuesday) and try their Blood Orange Margarita, because it sounded so good!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place... but it's hard when postino's is best door! It was just me and my kiddo (2) and we enjoyed lunch on the patio. Service was great, they seemed to work as a team, it did take my burrito a little longer than expected (carne asada & other deliciousness). I just got the kiddo a said of beans (they were different, topped with some sort of oil??), had I realized they were $4 I would have gone with the $5 kids meal but I didn't think he would eat it all (entree, side & drink - smoking kids meal deal!). I'll bring the husband and six year old next time and give a margarita a try!"}
{"text":"My favorite hip place to dine in Phoenix! I love Joyride so much! The tacos are probably some of the best tacos I've ever had! I look forward to be a consistent customer when I go back to school in the fall. My friends and I plan to have taco Tuesdays and get the $5 margaritas."}
{"text":"If I had to choose one word to sum up my latest trip to Joyride it would be: Egh.

My wife and I went for happy hour on a Friday night. As we walk in patio side we see one table open. We check in and are told it would be a 10 minute wait. 15 minutes later, were seated at that same open table! 

The menu states $2 tacos during happy hour. Sounds like a pretty good deal. In addition, if you order 3 tacos, you get a side for $1. So, we order 3 tacos each and a side (for a dollar extra as advertised by both the menu AND our server).

Tacos come out fast enough, but not with the sides. Had to remind our server for those. I asked for hot sauce, it was delivered several minutes later. Our waters were not refilled ONCE the entire meal, even though we mentioned it a few times.

The bill: came out with all the tacos and sides at full price. I was quick to correct the server. She took the bill and said she'd take care of it. 5 minutes later another server comes out with a new bill. You would think she was describing advanced calculus to justify the reason why some tacos are at actual price and some are at happy hour prices and why the sides are not a dollar extra during happy hour. So confused. I was ready to pay and get the hell out.

Good thing SoCal fish company is right down the street. I won't be back anytime soon.

Only reason it's 2 stars was for mediocre tacos. Service was baaaaad."}
{"text":"Having been favorably impressed by other of the Upward restaurants, I looked forward to my first visit to this new addition in north central Phoenix. I was not much impresssed.  The service was more aggressive than attentive without really being service-oriented.  Servers and bussers were quick to remove drink glasses, for instance, but not to inquire if we wanted another drink.  When the food arrived, our order was incorrect.  The salad we had ordered was replaced by a side of rice, and it took an inordinate amount of time to correct this. Companion and I were halfway through our entrees when the correct salad finally arrived.  I really like Mexican food,  but I was not impressed with the selections we ordered. The oranges in the orange and cucumber salad tasted canned.  The tacos were small and bland.  The chicken burrito was barely warm, tasted like boiled chicken in mayonnaise sauce.  I got the impression of Mexican food for people who do not like Mexican food.  We will give it another chance, maybe just for drinks after work, but not for the food."}
{"text":"Waitstaff is awesome, caters to 8 yr old requests :) food and ambiance wonderful too!"}
{"text":"Good, but not great.  My experience was similar to that of other yelpers.
- cool atmosphere
- condiments were the star more so than the actual food.  Excellent salsa
- drinks were delicious, but mostly ice"}
{"text":"Since having a daughter with celiac disease, we are always on the lookout for gluten-free friendly places. All their GF items are marked on the menu, even their tortilla chips are gluten-free, where many restaurants contaminate the chips by frying them in the same fryer used on breaded items. 

Everything we have had here so far was excellent. Baja and carnitas tacos rank as my favs. I also think their tortilla soup is outstanding. I don't do a lot of mixed drinks, but my wife loves the blood-orange margarita. I tasted it. Good and strong. The atmosphere is nice, staff is on their game and bathrooms were clean. 

Once it gets cooler, this place will be even better. They can open large doors to two separate patios. Maybe even bring in some talented, live local music, like Vinyl Station."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas....yes $9, but worth it.  Tacos are perfect and the guacamole is yum.

What stands out is the service.....best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time in for dinner before my sisters graduation. I really enjoyed the decor. The burrito I ordered was surprisingly larger than I expected although it was pretty difficult to eat but a fork helped with that. Only complaint really is the tight space and the music was way too loud. Almost had to yell across the table. Otherwise good, I'll be back at some point to try some tacos."}
{"text":"Wow... The only word is wow... Great food, no scratch that, AMAZING food AND the best service we have had in a very long time. Let's just say that they made a mistake on my wife's burrito, and realized it before they even brought our food out. They then informed us of the mistake, and had a new fresh burrito out within what seemed like 3 minutes. A big thanks to Daniel and Vanessa for making our night out even better. You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Tacos here are really good, the drinks are really good, and the ambience is fantastic. It was about a 30 minute wait on a Friday night. I would definitely recommend and will be back probably for drinks and Tacos. The salsa on the other hand is OK but due to the fact that if you drink at the bar you get free chips and salsa is a plus."}
{"text":"Went for taco Tuesday, left super satisfied. Some of the best tacos I've ever had for $2 each! I ended up ordering 3, then 4 more to go! The carne asada is some of the best I've had, and that's saying a lot living in AZ. I totally recommend that and the crispy fish! Service and atmosphere was also great!"}
{"text":"Impeccable margaritas! Bartenders were super friendly and the food was memorable."}
{"text":"I loved this place until they started nickeling and dime-ing you. Chips used to be free, now they're a dollar for a refill. You used to get a free side with three tacos, now it's another sneaky dollar. The server wasn't forthcoming with the chip charge. They took all the mezcal cocktails off the menu. Total bummer."}
{"text":"great atmosphere, good food  wasn't too impressed with the salsa though."}
{"text":"Such fantastic service here. The staff works as a collaborative group and np drink is left behind. 
Love the modern ambiance and local art on the walls. 
Cannot beat th Wie happy hour specials either!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Never been to Phoenix, and I was in the mood for taco Tuesday. Since I was traveling alone, I was weary, but super welcoming, fun, and poppin atmosphere. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Love Love Love This Place.

We went on a Sunday afternoon and were able to take advantage of the Happy Hour that runs till 5pm all day every day. The guys stuck with the pitchers of beer, while us girls tried out a few of the \"coctels\" and \"agua frescas\" My favorite was the Mazatlan Mule.

We started with the nachos and found them to be amazing. Ordinary nachos just will not do it for me ever again.

It was hard to decide on what tacos to order, they all sounded great, and no one was disappointed in what was placed before us. The carnitas, short rib and shrimp were among the favorites. 

And don't forget to order a few sides....among the best were the mexican street corn and the heirloom anasazi beans

We cannot wait for much cooler weather so we can enjoy the great outdoor seating they have

So run to Joyride Taco House if you are in the area...."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour and had the strawberry agua fresca with vodka, it was so refreshing and for a great price. Also had the ahi tuna ceviche, was a little spicy but again great flavor. Must try the chicken burrito! Was a great experience all around and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Family suggested Joyride this spot serves Tacos, Enchiladas, Margaritas, Guac and is great for groups. The waiters are nice  to look at and also good at their jobs. Food was great, company even better. The spot has outdoor seating as well as bar or table seats. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the company that created Postino, Windsor,  etc so I had no doubt that Joyride was going to be less than fabulous. Wrong! The restaurant is very cute and the drinks were great but that's about it. The food is overpriced and bland. We shared queso dip as an appetizer, and I had a fish taco with \"bomb\" black beans. The fish taco wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I expected more for the price. The black beans were boring as well. I would skip Joyride and head to Otro Cafe or Blanco Tacos at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"I tried a trio of various tacos. All of them were fantastic. Fresh ingredients. Very tasty! Fun atmosphere. I have to go back for the taco Tuesday and margaritas special. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are good. So is cheese y mas. 
Found a hair in our chips, server and manager apologized and comped the cheese y mas.

Fried fish tacos were crispy, dish tasted previously frozen. Chicken tacos were the best thing."}
{"text":"Joyride is good, but not worth the price.

Everything here is pricey. The tacos here are between $3.75 and $4.50, the small bowl of guacamole is $8 and the drinks are about $9. 

They serve up a complimentary basket of chips, but charge you for refills. That INCLUDES the refill you need to eat the $8 guac you just ordered. Hard to believe the $8 doesn't include chips...

The food was tasty and the drinks were creative, but overall the experience didn't match the price.

I recommend going during happy hour. Maybe then you can still afford rent!"}
{"text":"my visit here was NOT a joy ride.  As a matter of fact, of the three tacos i ordered, only one was decent.  i won't be back and i would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place.  Always busy but their carne asade and crispy fish tacos are amazing!  Great char which adds a Smokey depth To the carne asade.  The fire roasted salsa is delicious. And don't miss out on the churros.  Add the caramel- it's worth it!  Love to sit at the bar.  It's a cool, hip place."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night for the first time! Service and atmosphere were great. Tacos are just ok not something I would rush to get again. I ordered grilled fish taco which was pretty dry, veggie taco was ok and so was the shrimp. The standard chicken taco was kinda tastes and dry as well. But that's just my opinion. My cucumber margarita was good. The other margarita that was ordered was not the best and actually the bartender noticed that we didn't like it and he took it off the bill. Very good customer service. Over all I would suggest this place for drinks and atmosphere .

Changing the review from 3 to 4 stars due to the manager reaching out after reading my comments! Definitely deserve an extra star for customer service and striving to be better!!!"}
{"text":"This place is over priced, food quality is a 0 refills for soda takes more then 10 mins. This place has extremely small portions. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Did I mention they charge for chips and salsa? Overall DO NOT COME HERE. Service here was slow even though they weren't busy"}
{"text":"Wow! What a wonderful experience. Delicious food and drinks that are locally sourced with plenty of healthy options. The retro/modern decor and hip vibe make it a very attractive option for lunch or dinner. Very friendly staff round out the experience. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Great Bloody Mary...nice and clean place.fish tacos not so great.rice was mush and bla.if your just having drinks great food not so much. Very nice workers."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time. Food was descent and good value but will not return due to horrible service. Our waitress was very rude, cold, and nasty too us. Made us feel like we were bothering her just being there. I was really looking forward to trying the crispy fish taco and she delivered the grilled fish taco to our table. She argued with me back and forth saying I ordered the grilled fish and she wrote down grilled fish. First, I know I ordered the crispy fish - I was looking forward to it. Second, I'm the customer and I'm always right, I don't care that she wrote down the wrong order. Anyway, she finally agreed to bring me a crispy fish taco. She never came back to the table, someone else dropped off our check and she charged me for both tacos!! Didn't want to argue with her again so paid the bill and decided to never return. Your in the hospitality business, learn to be hospitable."}
{"text":"I am not one to complain but hands down the worse service I've encountered in a long time. Was told an hour wait and an hour later they told me it would be another hour. Took 30 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our party and take an order. Food came before drinks. Moved inside to our table and waited over 40 minutes for a beer. 

Billy the manager was great and the only reason I'd give this place another shot. It's a great concept but such awful service leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth"}
{"text":"Wow, wow. First off, the service was phenomenal. Thank you Breezy for such a wonderful, helpful, and attentive personality. Secondly.. the food. The fish tacos. Yup, don't question it, don't argue it, don't even be hesitant. (Because I was a bit.. something about fish tacos always sorta made me worried of trying it) - Absolutely the best taco of the 3 I tried. Sorta sad, I almost don't remember the other 2. A chicken adobo, and some pork one? Both really great as well, but that fish taco. Yup, its a winner. If you're looking for a good app, go with their street corn. It was tender, and crazy delicious! Their margaritas are fantastic, and their super hot salsa, didn't melt my face like it claims, but was spicy, and fantastic. Ask for Breezy, she is a rock star. The only disappointment with this place, is that it doesn't exist in Kansas, which is where I live.. which is awful."}
{"text":"Somewhat pricey for what you get. I do like aqua Fresca they serve. Service is ok and wait can be long."}
{"text":"Loud, unbelievably so. The food was ok, nothing to write about. The service was meh, and I'm being generous. I mean, it really isn't a memorable place and that's ok, not all places can be. If you are looking for a sit down place to eat and have a conversation this is not it. If you are here in a larger group this could be your spot as long as you are ok with crappy service. Even so the music was a tad bit too loud to have a conversation and lets be real, there was no joy to be had in joyride."}
{"text":"Five stars for exquisite customer service from all staff. Food is pretty great, too! Love the fish tacos and chicken tinga tacos. Salsa served with chips is very fresh and flavorful,  love that chips are thin and crisp,  not stale. There are a variety of sides..bomber beans and orange cucumber salad are faves."}
{"text":"Joy ride has great tacos and margaritas.  I had a carne asada taco, carnival taco, standard taco and crispy fish.  Each one was well built and the flavors melded nicely.  None of the meat was dry.  The service was great and the building its self was cool.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice, food was good but the service wasn't the best. When you have to ask for empty plates to be taken away, it's kinda annoying especially when it's not busy. We had dinner at 7:45pm."}
{"text":"Joyride is one of my favorite restaurants. I go regularly and always have a great experience with both the food and the service. I love the lunch special: 2 delicious tacos and a wonderful salad for less than $10."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of fish tacos, and the Crispy Fish taco topped the chart.

Recommended: Order 2 crispy fish tacos, one Standard taco, and get your free side order of cucumber orange salad.

Atmosphere: 9/10 (good music, out doors, lights)
Food: 9/10 (crispy fish and standard taco)
Price: 6/10 (little pricey for what you get)
Service: 9/10 (they have text alerts for seating!)

Good stuff, definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"I have visited the Gilbert location, was unaware this one existed!  Close enough to my office for a quick lunch.  Collectively, our table tried every taco on the menu and we were all pleased!  The Crispy Fish & Chicken Tinga tacos were my favorite!"}
{"text":"Love the tacos!  Can be noisy inside during busy times.  I prefer to eat on their spacious patio in the cooler months. Still one of my favorites places."}
{"text":"All so good! The kids really enjoyed the guacamole! So did I. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. I liked the quirky little gum papers in with the sugars. Also the workers really seemed like they liked being there. My veggie enchiladas were sooo good! I only gave 4 stars because it's not my favorite but a close second"}
{"text":"The service is great and the tacos were good,  but the prices are too expensive ($3.50+ per taco).  Especially when you consider that you can just go up the road and get great street tacos at Charlie's for $1 each."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at this location.  The staff is always friendly, and the service is fantastic.  Just beware of Taco Tuesday...the place is packed."}
{"text":"Joyride is right around the corner of my house and I will definitely be back again! The staff was friendly as as soon as my roommate and I walked in the door and the bartenders were really helpful in guiding us through their menu. I have seen a better beer selection but the Short Rib Quesadilla was phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Joyride yesterday and had a super experience. The service at all levels was excellent and on point. Suggestions were offered, plates were cleared, water refilled and all with the best attitude. Cheerful and enthusiastic without being cheesy 

Food was delicious. Get the corn!!!! Don't even question it. Get the corn. Tacos, tortilla soup, burritos, everyone at our table was satisfied. I can't wait to go back for happy hour or dinner so I can enjoy something(s) from the bar menu!!!"}
{"text":"The hipsters at Upward Projects have stolen Nana's old family recipes, awesomely re-purposed another old Phoenix building, and given us a reason to head up Central Ave for a Friday happy hour. in the same vein of other trendy taco joints like Diego Pops, Taco Guild, and Milagro Grill."}
{"text":"I was there today with my 4 year old daughter, and it once again reaffirmed the fact that this place is way over-rated. Their food is good (not great) and is seemingly overpriced. 

Luckily today, being mid afternoon on a Sunday, there was absolutely no wait. There was plenty of seating inside and outside. Considering it was not extremely busy, it seemed less of an excuse to receive absolutely crappy service. 

We probably waited 10-15 minutes to get a drink order, and by that time my daughter was getting restless. We ordered drinks and our meals, and it came out rather quickly. The server gave my daughter the wrong drink and then messed up her order. Ok, not a huge deal. 

My daughter was getting tired so I was holding her, and I asked for boxes to take my food home. He gave me the boxes and the check and then leaves. Someone with some common sense would've at least offered to help me with the food and the boxes considering I was holding my child. As I'm leaving, no \"thank you\" or \"have a good day\" (not even from the hostess as we were walking out the front door.) I probably will not go back there again."}
{"text":"It's not often where everything comes together but it's been Achieved at JoyRide!! Great funky atmosphere, diversity in staff that dig what they do and a menu that gives your tastebuds reason to Party!! David was our Amazing and Entertaining Server! He steered us towards great choices like the Blood Orange Margarita! A trio of salsa as we devoured the salty crispy chips!!
We all had the special for under $10 and we ate Like Queens!! Tacos all Fantastic with bold flavors and the salads were a delicious compliment!! Perhaps it was also my friends joining me that made the meal so FUN!! Thank you for the Enjoyment of Friendship and Food & Spirits JoyRide!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Some of the BEST Spanish Rice I've ever had - usually not a fan of it in general, but tried it here, and LOVED it. Tacos are good as well, lots of options. Recommend getting several kinds, including the baja taco."}
{"text":"Very friendly and inviting environment!
Staff was friendly!
Tacos were great! 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Consistently a favorite for its awesome food, relaxed and fun decor, great energy and fantastic service! I avoid the downtown area in general during peak times, but always sneak into Joyride midweek for an early dinner that never, ever disappoints!"}
{"text":"Love this place, always friendly staff and creative modern menu items always hit the spot.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has great food and margaritas, but geez the service is always SOOOO SLOW! Yelp profile shows they take reservations, but when I called they say only for parties of 8 or more. Update your profile!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Their carne asada tacos with avocado were super delicious! The wait staff was attentive and helpful. But really, the best part... they played 90s music the entire time I was there and I seriously didn't want to leave!"}
{"text":"We got a table in a timely matter, chips and salsa came out quick, drinks came out quick, and entrees came out quick but the fast service stops here. Our waiter ignored us but not his other tables, he would just walk right passed us, i had to ask 3 times for a refill for my soda for it to finally come, when we were obviously done eating 4 or 5 other waiters came to our table with other people's food and drinks and we had to keep telling them thats not ours! Then their was an error on our bill so we had to flag down another person (not out waiter because he was no where to be found) then 20mins later he comes back and said \"we fixed it\" and handed me a receipt with another person's credit card! I never handed him a card in the first place! Took another 20mins for them to fix that problem! Hands down one of the worst dining experiences i have had! We will not be returning to joyride because of that one waiter"}
{"text":"This family of a restaurant always exceeds our expectations. They all share in the responsibility of making sure we are comfortable. The wait was slightly shorter than quoted but the waiting area with misters made life easy, even with the infant. There was a second overflow wait area with similar accommodations on the other side of the bar. Someone brought us waters and chips while we waited. A server came buy to grab our drink order. Once we had our table the host met us on the walk over there and our tab was combined without question. EASY! This happens every time we come in. The food was perfect. Bean burrito and rice for the little one, enchiladas for myself and tacos for the lady. Had a little elote as a snack and life was good. Love this place."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday

It was the last minute that we decided to visit Joyride Taco, but I'm glad we stopped in.  The restraunt was very busy so we decided to take a seat at the bar, which was open seating.  The music was retro and upbeat, just overall a great atmosphere.

We had the cheese y MAS -- very good, with just the right amount of heat. We also ordered the street tacos -- pork adobada, braised beef, chicken, and pork carnitas. All four were delicious although I liked the braised beef the best and the Salsa and the Guacamole  were wonderful.  I had the prickly pear margarita, which was very light and refreshing. 

Great service and atmosphere,  reasonable prices, and food, it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"we honestly stopped in because postino was super packed.. so it was kind of a back up plan.  but definitely happy we stopped by.

joyride is super cute.  the decor is fun & the atmosphere is upbeat.  i had to try a mazatlan mule, which ended up being delicious.   we snacked on the chips and salsa & cheese y mas.  the cheese dip was ok.  but the street corn was amazing.

i'll definitely come back to try some of the entrees & more booze. :)"}
{"text":"The service is extremely hit or miss.

The first time my girlfriend and I went here our server was great - everyone else ... the other 4 people who brought us something or sat us... were bad.

At first we were going to brunch down the street, but they were on an extremely long wait. Then we walked past Postino's and decided to try something new.

Our server was attentive, yet the chips and salsa were slow initially and for refills.
The food was delivered by what seemed like a manager and she did not ask if we needed anything else or offer to refill our empty waters.

Great beers on tap, the tacos are very good, and the servers make up a little bit for the overall way too laid back service. The decor is nice and the location is great, but get there early on the weekends or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Jason was our server we came on a Monday evening with our good friend and my boyfriend. absolutely excellent food every single time. Also excellent service every single time Jason is the section to sit in! one of the most chill servers to have and knows a lot about his beers as well. Come see Jason at joyride! Amazing food!"}
{"text":"Always an excellent choice! All of their tacos are perfect and you can't go wrong with the Cucumber Sorreno Margarita! Very nice atmosphere and Taco Tuesday is ALWAYS a hit! This is my favorite place to grab tacos and Margs. Great job Joyride!"}
{"text":"The food and the service here are amazing. I got the Bandit Plate and my friend got tamales. The flavors were perfectly balanced and incredible. We got the brownie with dulce de leche ice cream and is one of the best desserts I have ever had.  The chips were fresh and the salsa has just the right amount of heat. 

Trevor is an terrific server - attentive and friendly without being overbearing. Everyone from the hostess to the bussers were all very polite and helpful. I would go back in a heartbeat - if the rest of the food is as good as what we had, you would never go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth it on taco Tuesday's, but not necessarily on other days, unless maybe you're not getting tacos. The only tacos not available on the $2 menu are the Baja fish, the shrimp, and the braised beef. Definitely try the crispy fish and the carne asada, although sometimes the carne asada meat is a little chewy. The Ollie salad was just ok. The fresh herbs mixed with the kale salad made it taste a little grassy to me, and the lemon couscous was just alright. The yucca chips were good though. Also, their chips and salsa are great! At dinner time the inside of the restaurant gets very dim, but your eyes adjust I suppose. Be prepared to wait a little if you come on Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere and of course excellent food. Got the beast burrito in a bowl which is what I get everytime. Always comes out right with balanced portions of rice, carne asada and avocados. I always recommend joyride to everyone I know."}
{"text":"The $5 blood orange margaritas are now my new fave!!  Tacos are good I would choose the carne asada and fried fish taco because they were bomb.com, however, didn't care for the Baja fish. Would certainly come back for the happy hour margaritas and it was good pricing over all. Service  was good and very chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good meal. Multiple servers. Comped without asking for a large portion of bill due to service delays. Friendly and yummy."}
{"text":"First time here for happy hour with a friend.  Loved the Joyride margarita and pineapple mojito.  We got tacos and those were really good, too.  The bartenders were fantastic and attentive.  Only complaint is get a foot rest around the bar!!  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"It's... it's... something missing. Whether it's the staff you have no idea is your staff or a bum on the street serving you I'm not quite sure what to make of it. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. The food is okay. The flavor doesn't really jive for me but it's always busy so I'm assuming someone else's taste buds click for The Joy. This is atypical bc I usually eat about anything. I'd say it's definitely a place to try, it just isn't my flavor."}
{"text":"Went with a bigger party. The service was really good and the vibe of the restaurant was nice. However the food could have been hotter. Everything that was served was room temperature. If the food was hotter I would of put more stars."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!
Smoked sweet corn - this is my first try for a sweet corn. Topped with 3 kinds of cheese and paprika. Totally loved it. Worth a try.

Veggie tacos - most delicious tacos I have had after velvet tacos in Dallas. Week days deals are the best - $2 tacos.

Margaritas - bang for the buck."}
{"text":"I just EASILY had the BEST lunch I've ever eaten!  It was THAT good!

The chicken tortilla soup was out of this world...light and delicate...fresh and HOT!!!
I had two fish tacos with no tortilla.  One was a regular fish taco and the other was a beer battered fish taco.l

The fire roasted salsa was EASILY the best salsa I have ever had, too!

This place is a serious gem!  I could go there every single day!

Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is my weekly go to place for the best tacos and margaritas! My friends and I make it a point to get together here! The employees are always so friendly and it's so clean!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my absolute favorite places to go.  The food and service are great. I had a problem with the nachos and the manager (Larry)not only fixed the problem, but was so warm and genuine.  Hire for personality and train for skills.  You always feel welcome, can you tell I am a regular? The drinks are interesting and delicious and you can't beat their happy hour.  I usually get the fish tacos no slaw and extra sauce.  My husband and child love this restaurant as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Food was deeeeliisshhhh. The only thing is their menu is pretty strict. They don't have anything else you can add to your meal, you can only take things out. No substitutions. Other than that it was delicious! There is inside and outside seating as well as awesome indoor decor. We shall be back!"}
{"text":"I came in recently with a friend. Staff greeted us immediately and seated us at a comfy booth. I started with a cucumber Serrano margarita. It was awesome! I might ask if it could be extra spicy next time, but I loved the flavors of the cucumber, cilantro and pepper mixed with lime juice and Tequila. I ordered three tacos, the grilled fish, the chicken tinga, and the braised beef. For an extra dollar I added a side of black beans. The beef tacos were my favorite, just so juicy and full of flavor. Chicken tinga had great flavor but again could have kicked it up a notch on the spiciness scale for me. I added some hot sauce and it was good. Fish tasted fresh was also excellent. 

Ambiance is vibrant and fun. Loud music and open floor plan. I'd love to go back at night."}
{"text":"OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!!  Five stars isn't enough for this place. No joke. The tacos feature delicious hand-made corn tortillas,  fresh pico, fresh guac, and they're exquisitely seasoned-- including the veggie ones that are so good they'll satisfy even the most picky meat eater. Delicious sides include the must-have cucumber orange salad, and desserts feature fresh made ice cream from sister-business \"Churn\" across The street.  The staff? On the ball and attentive are understatements. They're also extremely friendly and accommodating-- especially for a joint this busy. Topping it off is a retro-modern atmosphere coupled with wicked good music. Wrap it all up with a cozy-lit full bar and almost unbelievably reasonable prices for a place this good, and anyone with a discriminating palate and taste for tacos and legit margaritas should be coming here weekly -- if not more often!"}
{"text":"Great variety of fresh tacos. Excellent service. Fun atmosphere. Frequented by the college aged crowd. Saw on TV that they had some health department issues which is worrisome."}
{"text":"After work drinks with the girls! We love the Blood orange Margarita!
Served by everyone that works there. Hard to decide who our actual server is, 
there was problems with the communication that way. We seem to get alot of apologies from the servers telling us that it was shift change and that was the problem for the long delay in getting our drinks. Personally, if it wasn't for going out after work with the girls, i wouldn't be coming here. Not a fan of the way they work things. Love the guacamole and the chips and salsa. Not a lot to chose from regarding gluten free options."}
{"text":"Tried Joyride today for the second time. First time I did take out and really liked the braised beef taco. Was not a fan of the chicken taco. 
This time I joined a business contact there. They weren't very busy but the service was rather slow. Our server was really nice but I think she was preoccupied on something in the kitchen. 
I'd recommend Joyride as it's in a great spot for work downtown."}
{"text":"Joyride, what are you doing? I was just about to update my review to reflect a much more positive experience but you had to go and let me down again. 

I'm way happier with your food. Garden Variety Burrito is so delicious with the roasted mushrooms, squash, spinach, tomatoes, and corn combined with avocado, queso and \"magic\" sauce make the burrito just the right amount of healthy-unhealthy, especially if you get it chime style. I'd highly suggest getting it chime style or enchilada style by adding red/green sauce. And you give unlimited chips -- Yes, please!!

However, amazing food can be over shadowed.  On 5/30/15 in the \"Gals\" bathroom around 1:30-ish pm, the body of one little Ms. Coc K. Roach was not laid to rest. She was on her back, legs in the air, with no life left for anyone who used the bathroom to see. That's a pretty fast way to make someone lose an appetite. So gross! Check those bathrooms! 

The service is finally solid with servers who are knowledgable about the menu and attentive. The food is pretty good but dead bugs in a restaurant, even in a bathroom, is something I would think should be top priority to get under control. They usually say \"If there is one bug then there is...\"
 
And as per usual, splitting and getting the check proved to be difficult. Why don't you want to take our money? Please, I really do want to pay for my food and I typically like to do so in a timely fashion.  

I hold out hope that one day this review can be sunshine and rainbows but for now it's meh and dead bugs. Sad times, JR."}
{"text":"This is a cute place. 
Good size menu and pretty good alcohol selection. 
Chips and salsa were very good. 
Shrimp ceviche did not impress my boyfriend but I liked it. 
Tacos were just fine. I expected to love the Baja fish taco but it was disappointing. 
The standard was pretty good. 
My boyfriend loved the battered fish taco. 
For dessert the bf had some banana Carmel bread pudding thing. Can't remember the name. 
I had the churros. 
I loved mine, he was not excited with either of them.
$5 pitchers is a good deal. 
Good service! 

Overall I think the food is overpriced for the quality. $13 for ceviche it really should be more impressive"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Tuesday it was a bit of a wait but damn it was worth it i had the crispy fish tacos they were delicious by far the best I've ever had..my bf has the asada tacos and he loved them said the flavor was great oh and the margs my goodness they were delish and only $5!!!! Would definitely return"}
{"text":"Chips are $2  after first order?! Really? Is there a shortage that I don't know about? Seems a little greedy."}
{"text":"Solid choice for tacos, burrito bowls and margaritas, especially at happy hour! All margaritas are on happy hour pricing until 6pm, so you can swing through after work and have something super tasty.  Love the original house version and the blood orange.  Its tricky to order vegan, due to the magic sauce and their beans and rice aren't all dairy or meat free. Be sure to ask.  I did get a veggie burrito bowl recently and they subbed out the rice (made with butter) for quinoa.  It was really good.  My friend tried it and liked it better than all three of the traditional meat tacos she had ordered.  =)  They have lots of space at the bar, in the restaurant, as well as the patio too, so wait times and minimal if any."}
{"text":"Off work an hour early and want to hang out?  Hip little open-air Mexican joint, is a solid choice.  Clean, fun, patio vibe with great beer pitcher prices and good beer on tap. If you're going for just food, you can do a lot better.  If you're intent is to unwind and graze, very solid choice. Did I mention their happy hour beer prices are awesome?"}
{"text":"When we were seated..... we waited almost 10 min. for service and they weren't even busy!! They didn't bring is chips and salsa until we asked, my husbands water glass was dirty. They are overpriced. Did I say they are Overpriced!? Ordered ceviche for 12.95. Surprised at how small the portion was. Ordered guacamole and that too was pricy and the portion small. Usually appetizers are meant for sharing but for those portions and prices I won't order either one again.....the drink my hubs ordered was not refillable. We were not told that prior to ordering... all and all less than stellar experience. Sorry to say we won't be back. Postino is next store so will be going there instead."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool atmosphere! Service is good. I got the standard tacos and they were absolutely amazing. I like it because it's very unique and they even tie that in with their menu. Not a typical Mexican restaurant but I definitely love it. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"One of the best customer service experiences in a restaurant ever! Thank goodness for good servers & bartenders to guide me through my traditionally awkward journey to a new eatery. Upon existing my car I do remember saying \"ah, shit they're playing techno, do you want to go somewhere else?\" Also weary because the dirty word \"hipster\" was used to describe the place. But ALAS! The drinks were fantastic and I'm overly pleased with the beer selection. I personally got a cucumber mint tequila \"juice\" and loved it! I'm looking forward to trying out the different combinations of flavors and liquors (hey there's a logical excuse to drink more!). Food was fantastic as well. I ordered the standard the Baja fish tacos. They are served up in taco stands and I could have managed to polish off one more. The flavor combinations are classic enough to please a skeptic and creative enough to satisfy the more adventurous such as myself. The date got a chimi-style carne Asada burrito and claimed it to be the best he's had in Phoenix this far. And that says a lot, trust me. His burrito and my tacos had fresh sliced avocado to top off our foodie perfection. Even the restrooms were an aesthetically pleasing experience. Prices were reasonable, and like I said, our server and other employees eased our social anxieties and earned their 25-30% tip to boot. I will quote, \"If this is a hipster place then I guess I will join them.\""}
{"text":"Go on Taco Tuesday for $2 tacos. The meat is always tender and the tacos flavorful. My ultimate favorite though, is their market veggies. Y'all need to order a side of their market veggies - it's not what you'd typically find at your usual restaurant. The veggies are slightly spicy, flavorful, and are melt in your mouth delicious. The market veggies change daily, so come in with an open mind!

This is my favorite taco shop in Gilbert. You really can't go wrong. True to their name, this place is an absolute joy to go to. 

Also, they have a great happy hour (2-6 pm)!!"}
{"text":"I had a great time being checked on by 4 different employees just sitting at the bar. The bartender was friendly and helpful when deciding on what to order to eat. His name was Alex and made sure everything came out quickly and to perfection"}
{"text":"Awful service, hit and miss food.  It was a revolving door on the wait staff.  Our waitress showed her face to take our order then everyone else had to pick up the slack.  I had to flag down bus staff for drink refills.  The good taco was the braised beef and the rest was okay.  Really the service is what blew it.  Walked up to the manager to have him tab me out after waiting 10 min with a cleared table.  Then he forgot to return my card.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Opening night! Great food! Great service! Great drinks! Billy and the staff are first rate. All in all, could not be more pleased! Michelle was a great waitress, as well!  Great stmosphere, as well."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night at 5:45 so as expected we waited about 45 min to be seated.  In the meantime there were people bringing around chips and drinks so you could have something while you waited. There was lots of outdoor seating  (Adirondack style chairs with little tables) to hang out in while you waited and enjoyed your refreshments. They also have misters going to ward off some of the heat. Once seated service was a bit slow but once we had our order taken the food was out amazingly fast. I had carne asada tacos, no cilantro (always a test to see if they can handle specialty orders) and my husband had the beast. Both were very good. The salsa is a bit too hot for me and it came on my tacos so I drank a ton of coke.  My husband loved it,  he tends to like really spicy things.  Definitely a hipster staff but not so much that you feel out of place. Lots of families, older couples and young couples there on dates.  Decor is very nice also.  It is kind of loud,  I'm sensitive to that because my grandma has hearing aids, I would never be able to take her there unless we sat outside. Overall great place and we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm so thankful Upward Projects - the restaurant-building brand that brought the Valley favorites such as Postino, Windsor and Federal Pizza - finally opened a Mexican food joint with their Gilbert spot Joyride Taco House. The Central Phoenix version debuted last month, and I went there this weekend to sit on the colorful expansive patio in this gorgeous Valley weather.

The décor and menu at Phoenix's Joyride is the same as the Gilbert location. I love Joyride's chips and salsa. The salsa is the perfect level of spiciness, while the chips are thin. They're the perfect way to start your meal.

At both locations, I ordered the Veggie and Goat Cheese Enchiladas ($9) - they were just so darn good the first time! They come smothered in both red ancho chile and salsa verde sauce and are bursting with that delicious goat cheese.

It's a really massive entrée, but I still ordered a side of rice ($3) and black beans ($3) - am I the only one who thinks rice and beans need to complement every Mexican meal?

That is actually probably the one thing I would change here: make the entrée portions smaller (for example, one enchilada was plenty for me), and add rice and beans to meals. As it is now, I received two complete meals with what I ordered - at only $15, that's not bad, either."}
{"text":"Was really craving tacos for dinner and was trying to decide this place or Tacos Guild. Ended up choosing this taco place because of the margarita selection.  

Margaritas - We ended up ordering the Blood Orange, Prickly Pear and Cucumber Serrano.  Here's my ratings for those:

Blood Orange: 5 out of 10 - it was way too sweet and it hardly tasted like what I expected of a blood orange. Semi pulpy, yet very sugary and sweet. Not my fave.

Prickly Pear: 5 out of 10 - I was expecting a deeper taste of prickly pear but this one was a miss as well. It really lacked that nice pear taste that I've had before at other places.  

Cucumber Seranno: 6 out of 10 - after drinking the sweet blood orange, I needed something less sweet for sure as was referred this. Has a strong cucumber taste and the serrano heat was very light and tingly. The overall drink waswas refreshing. I'd probably order it again with one more shot of tequila.

Tacos - 

The little tacos we excellent. We ordered the shrimp, crispy fish, adobada, and carne asada. The snall little tacos were packed with flavor. The crispy fish was on point. Fish was nice and crispy, plus the sauce was flavorful. The shrimp taco was also cooked very well and seasoned with flavor. Carne asada and adobada both were delicious and topped with a pickled raddish slaw. The carne asada almost had a taste similar to a BBQ bahn mi sandwich. Overall, great tacos except a little pricey. I can get these flavors in Mexico, however we're at a restaurant in Phoenix so the price is understandable. Another plus is that they offer the first round of chips and salsa on the house. So yeah good deal.

AC"}
{"text":"What I enjoy about this place the most has to be the atmosphere, laid Back and relaxed. Don't get me wrong the food is also good, but the tacos aren't the best I've had. They have pretty good happy hour specials! It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"I would rate the nachos here about 3.5-4.0 stars.  Nice flavor and homemade nacho chips are awesome!!  Steak is decent.

The baja fish taco was inedible.  I ended eating all the toppings like the guacamole and left the fish alone.  I just tasted so off, I couldn't eat it.

Complimentary salsa sucks.  But once again the chips are good.

The $5 tropicale margarita was horrid.  I had to return it after one tiny sip.  I just can't stand cheap quality drinks.

Service was great.  Staff was very nice."}
{"text":"This place has great food.  They are pricey, it's crowded and loud but the food is amazing and so are their signature drinks.  They also have terrific service which I loved."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are so good, taco Tuesday and HH are a great deal, and staff is always fast and friendly despite it always being busy in there."}
{"text":"Alright so I'm going to start off with the negative part of the review. The customer service was absolutely terrible. Worst I've ever seen. I got to the restaurant and there was an open, clean table, waiting for someone to sit at, and they made us wait 15 minutes to sit there. We order our food, not one waiter/waitress introduced them self or offered to help. They didn't replace the chips or salsa and the wait was very long. None of them asked if we needed a refill of anything, and when the bill came out , it was not separate like we requested, but all as one. When we left the lady at the front did not say anything to us, did not say \"thanks for coming in\" or \"have a nice day.\" She was on her phone tweeting about her day. It was ridiculous. The food was pretty good but it was a little over priced. $12 for my burrito. But i smacked all of It. Maybe will attend again, if they hire new employees."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday with about 25 people.  BIG place - we sat outside/patio.  $2 tacos - tasty!!   Food definitely has me interested; service staff seemed overwhelmed, moved at a snail's pace.  Not necessarily unfriendly, but not very suggestive, either.  So many choices when you dine out, the experience is a big part of the return.  I would do take out."}
{"text":"Not pleased at all by this place. We usually have a fairly large group when we go out on Thursdays, but service was horrible. It took almost 10 minutes just to get an iced tea. I was not impressed by the food for the price either. Furthermore, our server mixed up the cards for the split tabs and didn't even tell us about the mistake or even apologize. After talking to management they told me they were too busy to look into my issue and they would call me back when business died down, and never did. The only reason for more than one star on the review is because I called back again and the manager Sean looked into my issue and apologized on behalf of the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch and so glad this was the spot chosen! I love their lunch special which is choice of soup/salad and two tacos of your choice. This is the perfect amount of food. This time I had the crispy fish taco and the carne asada taco then the Ensalada Fila salad. I ate every last bite of it all. The side salad or soup is a very generous portion as well...all that for $9. The service is always great and they do really pay attention to the lunch hour time crunch. I cannot wait to go back and try more items!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, drinks reasonably priced for the area of town I was visiting, atmosphere at Joyride is always fun and easy going. Will be back"}
{"text":"Terrible place service is horrible food is okay By the way they cut u off after 6 drinks Waitress are super rude."}
{"text":"This was a lot smaller inside than I expected but they have a patio I will definitely check out when it's cooler. Came on a Tuesday at 5:30 and told we had a 20 minute wait but it ended up more like 45 minutes. Not a big deal since we brought our drinks outside. The margaritas tasted fresh and are on special for $5 on Tuesdays along with tacos. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food, attentive service and all the beautiful people you could ask for.  Seriously.  Everyone in the place was stunning,  I loved LOVED the crispy fish taco and would probably just keep ordering those if I returned.  Why mess with a good thing? My husband had a variety of other tacos and he enjoyed them all.  I am also now obsessed with their orange cucumber salad.  Since I don't live in the area I will be trying to replicate it when I get home.  Not a cheap meal, but worth the price.  It doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"Okay, 1st time here and I must say, DISAPPOINTED!!I know a few people who have recommend this joint. My brother, from Texas,  was here visiting and on his last day we decided to try .THIS place could be considered * Trendy* I call it artsy fartsy!! I wanted good tacos..  
I ended up with a lunch special of 2 tacos and a side. Now, these are small street tacos.  Corn or flour tortillas.  I had a braised beef ( shredded) and 1 shrimp taco. The side was a salad. Not traditional.  Kale based with crunchy dried peas, jicama, tomatoes and corn with cojita cheese. Chips were good and salsa was fresh and had just enough kick.  The chicken burrito plate was huge!!! All in all not my style for tacos and a bit pricey!!  Charging for a chips and salsa refill is ridiculous!!!  3 stars is for great service at the bar, MO AND TONY took good care of us."}
{"text":"Come for Taco Tuesday's for $2 tacos because $4.50 tiny tacos are hella not worth it.

$4.50 for a small taco? Even if it's shrimp, I don't care. You gave me 3 small pieces of shrimp. $4.50?????? Laughing out loud. Had to type it out.

On the up side, their Mojito was very yummy & refreshing. My friends all had margaritas & they loved the cucumber one! Try those out!

Their churro dessert was also delicious!

Verdict: this place is cool. That's that. The staff is very nice. It's cool enough to recommend others to check it out. However, for the prices, it's not necessarily worth it (unless you come for happy hour maybe? Or taco Tuesday's). The food was good, not the best, but again, you're basically paying to sit in a nice & pretty/trendy spot."}
{"text":"This was ....absolutely amazing . Great happy hour and wonderful food! Highly recommend the carne asada tacos and black beans . My husband ordered the beast burrito and was completely silent while eating . Such great flavors, wonderful drinks and nice staff! We recommend!"}
{"text":"Great Happy hour prices and food. Margaritas and fish tacos to die for. I will visit next time I am in Arizona."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! Great tacos and even better margaritas! I plan to go back often!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night for dinner. Hadnt been to downtown Gilbert in a while. 

The wait was about 45 min so we sat at the bar and had a couple cocktails w/tortilla chips n salsa. Pretty good salsa! I had the mandarin Margarita first & the almond horchata w/amarreto second. The margarita was good but not memorable, I liked the horchata even better. Would get again.

Once we got seated I decided on the chilaqueles for my entrée. Was my first experience with this dish. I'm happy I tried it. Lots of different textures and flavors that went went well together. From the crunch of the tostada and salsa verde, along side shredded chicken and beans as well as the sunny side up egg on top. The dish was hearty and filling. Would definitely order again. I'm hungry for it now while I'm writing this... ;)

My wife ordered the ceviche. Unfortunately I didnt try it. She really liked it and she's had ceviche in a number of places. So must be good. 

I saved room for desert at Peterson's ice cream & cafe down the street so we'll have to go back to Joyride to try thier sweet stuff.

We would go back."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! ! You get a free side with an order of 3 tacos. I had the  carne, standard, fish, Shrimp, adobada and carnitas. The cucumber and orange salad is super fresh and tasty. James the bartender was friendly,  helpful and nice.  Definitely try the pineapple mojito, fresh and not super sweet.and if you like Margaritas try the blood orange. And close it off with some churros and add the caramel  sauce.  Won't be disappointed! !"}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place got as good of a reviews that it did. Went during Happy Hour and while the prices are a steal and I did  enjoy the pineapple mojito, I found the food to be mediocre at best. Two waiters were managing our table and the one guy forgot to bring us the check. We must have waited a good 10-15 minutes and then told the other waiter that we thought the first one forgot about the check request. I won't be back. I feel there are better Mexican food options."}
{"text":"Dear God in Heaven, there is a burrito here called \"The Beast\" that is, hands down, the best burrito I've ever eaten. I'm not kidding, WOW! Also, the quesadilla with chicken was pretty much the second greatest thing I've ever eaten. A little pricey? Sure.. Worth it? I'd say so."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best. The $5 margaritas are so good and strong. Love the crispy fish and chicken tinga tacos."}
{"text":"Another great Gilbert restaurant. Tacos were excellent,location is great. It was a casual atmosphere that was great to take clients to.Good music, Good food and Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"First the salsa given with chips is really great. As far as the atmosphere its very beautiful and modern with a street art vibe. The food is exceptional, some of the best tacos in town. It's a bit boughie but it works for this place, they come at you with fancy trays for your tacos and they Deliver."}
{"text":"The weekly deals are fantastic. This place gets packed and for good reason! The food - especially burritos and margaritas - are amazing and packed full of flavor. On Tuesdays, the door is usually out the door so definitely come early and be patient...it'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"It was ok. The service was friendly. The seating was extremely cramped, felt a bit uncomfortable with all the small tables all together outside. I wasn't very impressed with the street tacos but they also
weren't bad either. The Elote was delicious and they also have some interesting and flavorful drinks on their menu. I would try it again but wouldn't suggest it as a must go."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good service, tasty food and a fun atmosphere. 

The drinks are AMAZEBALLS... Omg. Plus $5 for a pitcher of delicious brew before 5 pm makes this my go to weekend lunch spot. Salsa's have a lot a flavor and good heat and the tacos are delicious. I was not impressed with the Chicken Tinga, it was just OK, the fish taco's are wonderful and the tortillas are handmade. The tortilla soup is really tasty as well, it can be a little to thick, but has great flavor. You have to order the cheese y mas... oh buddy. I could eat that all day erry day!

Overall, you should go here - belly up to the bar, the bartenders are fun and the service is great."}
{"text":"Great tacos, margaritas, and the vibe and servers were fantastic. A perfect place for friends, coworker happy hour or family."}
{"text":"This place is delish! I like to get The Beast which is their version of carne asada, it totally knocked my socks off. I also love their chips and salsa, (not sure how they make it so good and not gonna ask!) They have a cool atmosphere as well, its very casual, but the service is still top notch. If you're going on the weekend you might go a little early because it gets super busy. All around its a great restaurant."}
{"text":"After reading all of the great reviews on Yelp, we decided to give Joyride Taco House a try. My parents, kids, sister, nephew and myself arrived right at opening so we could avoid the busy lunchtime rush. We were quickly seated and the first thing I noticed was the abundance of flies. I'd read about the fly issue, but was surprised by how many there were. I spent the entire meal swatting them away from my face, food and drink. I love restaurants with indoor/outdoor seating and understand that sometimes flies get in, but I've never seen a restaurant have as much of a fly problem as Joyride. Unfortunately, the flies weren't the only problem.

Pros:

Great décor and I loved the vibe of the place.
The outdoor seating area is amazing - I could see myself returning for a girl's night out

Cons:

Flies - See first paragraph for details.

Dirty dishes - two out of seven plates were dirty and one of our cups was dirty, I understand that sometimes dishes don't get clean, but a little due diligence would prevent a plate with a dime-sized piece of food finding its way to customers.

Food was subpar - Although I prefer more traditional Mexican food, I knew that 
Joyride has its own eclectic take on the cuisine and so I was prepared for the food to be different. Unfortunately, it wasn't just different but most of it lacked depth of flavor. The pinto beans and chili rellenos were bland and the kid's nachos were topped with the odd-tasting cheese. On the other side of the spectrum was the overly sweet carne asada. As an Arizona native I've tried a bevy of different carne asada marinades over my lifetime, but never have I tried one as sweet as Joyride's. Even though I have a sweet tooth, it was off putting. My nephew and my sister agreed.

Hit & Miss:

Service - The service started off great - we were seated quickly and our waitress was attentive - explaining various menu items and checking on us several times. Then she disappeared for about 10 minutes. Once we ordered, most of the food was delivered but they forgot one side and my nephew's entire meal. Thankfully the tacos cook quickly and so he didn't have to wait for long.

Overall: Not one of the seven of us said we would return for lunch or dinner. My sister and I said we'd give Joyride another try and meet with friends for drinks."}
{"text":"I loved the mango-mandarin margarita. It was awesome. Definitely try the standard, crispy fish, and pork adobada tacos. The servers were friendly and attentive.  I'm looking forward to coming back"}
{"text":"Ok, so my family and I went here for lunch today (Saturday) for the first time. We got there just before 1:30pm and we were seated right away even though 5 minutes earlier when I called them on the phone to see if there was a wait, the guy who answered told me there was a 20 to 25 minute wait. What's up with that? 

So we had no less than 5 different servers. They were all nice, hipster types but the girl that took our drink order never came back so I had to flag down the next random person to place our order. We got 4 different tacos (the carne asada, shrimp, crunchy fish, and grilled fish) to split between me and my son, my husband got the tamale plate, and we ordered the kids quesadilla for my 1 year old. Thankfully, the quesadilla came out first because the baby was getting antsy. As for the rest of our food, it took FOREVER to come out. In the meantime, we were munching on the chips and salsa. The salsa was good although the chips were NOT. But we were starving so we had no other choice.

When we finally got our food, it was good. But honestly, the gourmet tacos at Rubio's are way better and way more filling for less than the price they are here. We would have ordered more food but it was so expensive, we felt it wasn't worth the money or ungodly time it would take for another order to come out. We did, however, order the churros for dessert. They came out fairly quickly and were good and came with melted chocolate for dipping. 

So when we asked for the bill, they brought it to us on a clothespin! Basically it was the receipt and a clothespin which my husband and I thought was pretty weird but funny. However, the amount we had to pay for such little food was NOT funny at all... It was just over $60!!! Yikes! So not worth it!

So if you're a trendy hipster living in the burbs with cash to burn this place is definitely for you! My family and I will stick to Rubio's. Definitely won't be coming back to this overrated joint."}
{"text":"I was here on a short trip and my friend took me and my mom here to eat. I really like tacos and being in the southwest, I expected great things. 

I was kind of hungry, so I decided to try the beast burrito and my mom got some fish tacos. The burrito was good, but it just wasn't what I was expecting, like something was off. Maybe it was that it didn't taste as authentic to me. The tacos also weren't bad, but again, something was off to me. I thought it was slightly overpriced for what we got, since I was expecting more, but I wouldn't mind trying this place again given the right conditions."}
{"text":"Shrimp & Veggie Tacos with Mango Mandarin Margarita! Highly recommended! Everything was on happy hour menu besides the shrimp taco."}
{"text":"We have our weekly Lyft meeting there and the service was extraordinary   The servers all were helpful and everyone had a good time.  The food was excellent and the atmosphere was out of this world. Will be going there every week to enjoy the food and friendships there."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, good music, friendly and very attentive staff. Our waitress was always right there to refill our drinks when they got low. Over all great customer service. I believe something I ate there was either bad or I had a reaction because the whole next day I was puking... However I can't fully blame them cus I ate other things that day too . Would try again"}
{"text":"Oh Joyride!!  So so so good!  My favorite of the Upward Project spots for a meal!  Fun ambiance and friendly service.  Best happy hour in town!!  I would get any drink, aside from the prickly pear margarita unless you like super sweet, but the off menu naked and famous is probably the best cocktail in town if you like a smoky mezcal!   The food is all great but I always end up doing a taco plate, 3 tacos and a side with the great chips and salsa and you are set!  The trick is picking just 3 of the tacos!  My favorite hands down and always in the line up is the braised beef, and you can't go wrong with the standard, the chicken tinga, the pork adobada or the carnitas!  The side is another tough choice, they are all good, but the top 3 for me are the roasted veggies, the bomb black beans, and the orange cucumber salad for something a little more fresh and lite!  Great for a date or a night with friends!"}
{"text":"Margaritas are meh, they weren't balanced well.  They were strong.  I was hoping for Spanish rice, they have white rice with lime and cilantro.  Although, my sister and her friend really loved it.  The tacos we enjoyed were the carne asada and crispy fish.  I would definitely have them again.  Our friend lived the Mexican corn.  Chips and salsa were 10 out of 10.  We ended with almond horchata.  Thank you.  I am the loctose intoleranant queen.  Pleasing experience.  Not a wow, but I would recommend.  The energy is uplifting and relaxing."}
{"text":"Joyride taco house was really good. I thought because it was like an upscale taco shop that the tacos were not going to be good but I was mistaken. I had the crispy fish, carnitas and carne asada tacos and they were reeeeaaally good for an upscale restaurant,  they had a lot of meat so with just 3 tacos and the side rice I was full. I went there to celebrate my wife's birthday and we were able to reserve the cocktail lounge outside. It was amazing and comfy. I think we were there for around e hours and the waiter kept bringing us refills on our drinks and salsa. I definitely recommend Joyride..."}
{"text":"Loved the cucumber Serrano margarita! So delicious. Service was great and I was on the patio. Atmosphere inside is so adorable. Food is just okay to my Californian taste in Mexican but for Arizona Mexican it's really good. Loved the corn and the bomb black beans."}
{"text":"Yelp failed me. So, so unimpressed. Why is this place rated so high?
If you like waiting for 45 minutes to gnaw on nasty tacos in a black hole with music so loud you can't hear the person in front of you, you'll love this place. If that isn't your jam, go to Mucha Lucha taco shop for actual delicious, authentic tacos at half the price. 
The hostess was snap chatting the whole time we were there, on a busy taco Tuesday night.
The one good thing I can say about this place is that their tortillas were great. Not the fillings though."}
{"text":"Upon arriving for happy hour today, we ordered our first rounds of beverages and tacos. For round two a 29 minute wait for extra salsa and series of drinks was more than enough for our party of 6 to have some laughs and question the bar service and untimely delivery of Luke warm food.... apparently the ticket was lost by our new waitress. Complimentary round. Well call it fair-ish"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night (7-30-2015) for the first time with a friend of mine. She has been here before. . The customer service was great. And the food was great too. I had the carne asada tacos and she had the carne asada burrito. We both had some elote (Mexican corn). The elote was some of the best I've ever had. Grilled to perfection. There is plenty of seating inside and out. I will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is awesome. Loved their burrito and the constant free refills. Pricing is a little steep though. Still, recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and atmosphere!!!

It was our first time here and our hostess Kylie and server Cassie were fantastic!

Their knowledge on the history of the building and the story behind joyride as well as the food recommendations were beyond impressive.

The homemade corn tortillas are just like grandma used to make with that perfect blend of texture and taste that make them out of this world yummy. 

My favorites are the carne Asada, Carnitas and chicken tacos with the cucumber orange side... What a great combination.

And there is no better way to end a great dinner than with fresh homemade churros and chocolate dipping sauce.  

Place a definite must in my book"}
{"text":"Such a delicious and cool vibe! The vegetarian tacos and burrito were filling. We had the Mexican corn and it was so tasty topped with spices and cheese. I highly recommend that! 

Great service as well! Our waiter was personal and helpful. 

The bathrooms are so cool and clean."}
{"text":"Love love this place!! Great tacos, great salads, great ahi stacks, great salsa, great drinks (and like the non alcoholic options as well), great lunch specials, great service. I wish there was one in the tempe/Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite before a night out! Great location and service. Food was good and reasonably priced. The atmosphere was fun and we enjoyed ourselves. Good selection of tacos! The favorite for us all was the cheese y mas(cheese dip w/chorizo) it was sooooooo good!"}
{"text":"Good food, sorta messy! Flys outside were a little excessive. But cute staff, very polite and quick! Would recommend but would suggest to sit inside!"}
{"text":"This shop is in the same building as postinos but on the other side.  It took me a little whille to find it, but the shop itself is very cute.  The interior looks like a scrapbook with bright patterns on the walls. 

As for the food, each table is served up a dish of awesome salsa and chips as they are seated.  The tacos are about 4 dollars each.  Today I tried the Ahi tuna and the grilled fish.  Both had good flavors and were very unique, however, the Ahi was a little sweet and the grilled fish lacked a bit of a kick.  My friend said taco with cotija was also very good, and I plan to try it the next time a go. Two tacos was a bit small, so I'd recommend ordering a bit more, unless you plan on getting dessert (which I did of course).  

For dessert, I was craving chocolate, so I ordered the churros con chocolate.  For $6 I would say that the dessert was unimpressive.  The churros were coated in cinnamon and sugar, which really overpower the chocolate (which was also too thick and not heated enough to be a smooth dip)."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand all the positive reviews this place has. I've been there twice now and both times it was truly the worst customer service I've had at a restaurant/bar in recent memory. 
Both times we've waited at least 10 minutes after sitting down for anyone to come by and take drink orders, had at least 4 different people serving us through the course of our meal and felt like total inconveniences for the staff. 
The last time I was there I ordered a vodka cranberry and I kid you not, the waitress said \"is that on the menu?\" I just stared at her and said, umm.. I'm not sure. I didn't look at the drink menu\". A vodka cranberry? Really? 
The only things I like about joyride are the location and the food is great too. However, with such terrible customer service I'll eat food I like less elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a great night with friends and Tim was a great server! Great drinks and food. Dessert too!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked on yelp to try for awhile so I was excited when to come here with my boyfriend last night. This place is located in downtown Gilbert right next to Postinos. Since it was a Friday night the wait was long but We got there just before the rush so we only had to wait 40min. The inside was very hipster and the servers were all very friendly. They brought out the chips and salsa right away. It was so good we got seconds :) I had a coupon for a free appetizer so we started off with the Ahi Tuna Ceviche. It was a nice twist using ahi tuna on the ceviche instead of the usual shrimp. I got the crispy fish,chicken Tinga and short rib tacos. My boyfriend got the carne Asada, shrimp and Baja fish. I would defiantly recommend the crispy fish and shrimp tacos!!! The tacos were the perfect size and very flavorful. The only down side is that the tacos range from 3.50 to 4.50 per taco. A bit on the pricey side for the small tacos but there so tasty ;) then they gave us free dessert because of how long we had to wait to get our table. They didn't have  to do that for us but we defiantly appreciated it. We ordered the churros and took it home to eat. The churros were nice and crispy! I defiantly would come back & recommend this place to try."}
{"text":"Tacos are okay, bummer there's no option for crunchy tacos, it would change everything if there were. Chips/salsa, beast burrito are really good though."}
{"text":"After driving past this place and looking at the menu online, I thought Joyride would be the perfect taco place for me. They have a few vegetarian options, cool sounding drinks, and the atmosphere looked fun. I was a tad disappointed however.

There were some things I really liked about Joyride, and some things I did not like so much. One good thing was the service, the servers were very attentive. Even a few servers who were not our server for the night came up to check on us, which I thought was nice. I also liked the decor, very mod and I like the color scheme.

I ordered three veggie tacos with the cucumber orange salad as my side. It is nice they you get to have a free side with three tacos. The tacos were good but not great. The first one I ate had a soggy tortilla, the other two tortillas were fine. Also there was a tiny piece of something hard and inedible in my first taco, which was unpleasant. I wish I would have ordered the black beans as my side instead too because the salad was kind of gross. Also the side would have cost $4.00 which is ridiculous for like 3 cucumber spears, 2 mandarin orange segments, and a few seeds. I tried to like it, but I just couldn't! Also my boyfriend got the Key Largo drink, and I am glad I did not order one because I was not a fan. He thought it was too vanilla-y, but did not totally hate it. The chips and salsa were yummy though, so there is a plus.

Another downside was the price. Mine wasn't too bad, but my boyfriend's meal was nearly $30 for a drink, burrito, and a taco. Overall, Joyride is not bad, but did not quite meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks. Horrible service. I've been twice and each time got lost in the shuffle , as the work as a team of servers, this leads to laziness, lack of ownership and confusion. They were standing around talking and we had to wave them down every time we needed them."}
{"text":"To be fair, we came here because we had been told no more wine at Postino's across the way so perhaps we were a little grouchy already.  The atmosphere is cheery and bright.  The servers are pretty and helpful.  The food is good just not what I'd crave of think of when I think of Mexican food in Az.  Example:  queso ordered and no spice whatsoever.  This is the perfect place to take your hipster friends from the Midwest who would be a little to squeamish at the idea of going to South Phoenix for the original Los Dos Molinos, or simply and won't handle spicy food.  On the positive side, a good place to take friends who are vegetarian, a lot more offerings than your typical restaurant."}
{"text":"Went tonight for the first time to take advantage of the anniversary taco special. The food was good and the service was outstanding. I can't even remember the last time I've felt that good about the service in any restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"I have been to Joyride many times, but this is based on my most recent trip. All of my visits have been 4/5 stars. First, their happy hour is AMAZING! $5 (small) pitchers of cerveza, $5 margs, and cheap tacos! I would classify Joyride as American/Mexican, as opposed to the more authentic Barrio Queen down the strip. That being said, they have a lot of taco options and most are good! My menu go to is the Carne Asada Burro (can't remember the exact name of it), but it is delicious with red sauce piled on top. I knocked the review down to 4 stars this time, because I remember the Guacamole being better! This trip is was a little bit flavorless, and didn't have the usual jalapenos on top which usually give it a nice kick. The staff from the hostess, to the bartenders, to the servers are always super friendly and helpful. They can get you in and out for a quick lunch, but also don't mind if you take your time and make a day or night of it! We will be back for happy hour many more times. As competition continues to move into DT Gilbert, Joyride continues to provide a great experience!"}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert is trying to step up their game with all these new places to eat. if tacos are your thing Joyride is a great place to go. They have a taco for everyone and are happy to make a taco any way you want it. My fav is the shrimp and my hubs was the braised beef. The tortilla soup was delish. Nice atmosphere, clean, but service was a bit slow and I was confused about who my server was. Two nice outdoor patios. Ill go back....I like tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing. Great staff, great drinks, great food, great vibe. If i could only eat one place for the entire year it would be here."}
{"text":"This place was great. We had a lovely time. The food was delicious. In addition to those reasons to be back, our food order was correct for all four people, the margaritas/beer pitchers were $5 each, our server was magnificent, and we had fast and enthusiastic service. 
I recommend to anyone looking for good tacos/cheap beer/great atmosphere for a fun time."}
{"text":"I think I'm gonna have to come back here for a happy hour.  I can't give it a five, because the tacos just didn't merit a five... that said, the chips and salsa were spot on, as well as the carne asada quesadilla.  I love the ambiance and decor, and the service was really good.  In regards to the tacos, the main factor for me is the tortilla.  You can tell they were made fresh, but they were dry and a little bland.  They were white corn, which was cool, but I think the massa needed a little something.  I guess it was just meh - and when your joint is named after something specific, you should try to knock that outta the park.  Will I go back?  Yeah, but I'm not in a hurry to do so."}
{"text":"I ordered take out for a late afternoon snack, a cup of chicken tortilla soup, and a damn good one at that! Looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu. That was a 5 Star cup of soup!"}
{"text":"the best quesadilla ever! 

Great fresca's and margaritas too. 

Salsa is smoky and spicy. no mild spice here"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. The atmosphere was very unique. The tacos were very authentic...like a \"street taco.\" The staff was very attentive. We had a short wait for the table and while we waited on the patio, we all had waters within seconds of sitting down. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place and their tacos!!  A great place to hang out with the girls and have some margaritas, especially the blood orange one!!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos, great drinks, nice atmosphere and the service was on point. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Yummy food with a great, fun atmosphere. I practically drank the salsa--using the chips as mere scoopers, ha. Try not too fill up too much on chips because the tacos are great. I sampled so I could try more! Street corn was SO WORTH IT! Splurge baby! You'll become addicted to it. I really enjoyed the non-alcoholic drink options. It was fun and refreshing. Don't leave without that banana dessert thing. The name escapes me but the memory of it (in the cute presentation) remains! My feeling is enjoy it all! It's a great, friendly place to eat with friends!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp.  It has a hip vibe and was very crowded at 1 pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Music was annoyingly loud, but we were among the older patrons.  

Following our server's advice, I ordered the pork adobada and carne Asada tacos.  DH ordered those two plus the crispy fish taco.  It took an extremely long time for our plates to arrive.  No employee bothered to tell us our food would eventually arrive.  They give you chips and salsa as soon as you sit.  Salsa looked good but was boring with no distinct flavor.  DH said his meal was perfect.

Unfortunately mine was not. I was given the Adobada and another taco. I asked my husband if the second taco looked like his fish taco and he said no.  I am super careful because I can get anaphylaxsis from cod or snapper.  

I looked for a server, any server, but could not get anyone's attention for a few minutes.   After staring at it I finally bit into a tiny corner of the taco.  It was definitely fish. No anaphylaxis, but a slight itchy allergic reaction.

It took a few more minutes of waving my arm to attract the attention of a server who took the dish away. Finally, our server came over since I had no food.  We  told her I was given a fish taco. She knew I ordered the pork and beef tacos.  She said she would check on my replacement plate

The new plate came with no apology and the tacos were great. They each had a unique flavor with a nice balanced, yet interesting mix of spices. 

It's very sad that neither server expressed concern over the mix up.  People who do not have serious allergies often do not understand that they can kill someone by serving the wrong food.  I stop breathing if I eat certain fish or peanuts.

No offer to do anything except bring me what I ordered after my husband finished his tacos.  Also, the menu said one free side order if you order three tacos.  The server did not mention that to DH.

Then, when the waitress brought our change she shortchanged my husband. He tipped her, but maybe should have skipped the tip so she might realize the service was very poor.

No stars for service and 5 stars for food. If I lived in Phoenix I would probably eat here because the food is that good.  I think they probably have other servers who care more about doing a good job.  However, I haven't tried other Phoenix restaurants of this genre so maybe there are better ones."}
{"text":"I have only been here on taco Tuesday. It starts getting really busy at 4pm so we went for an early dinner. Very friendly staff and we were checked on several times. The tacos were great and cheese quesadilla was also tasty!"}
{"text":"We were seated on the patio and I thought, \"what could be better, it's a beautiful day!\" However, the trees maaaann! I think I ate about 14 little yellow flowers and seeds. Plus, a bird dropped a poo on my handbag. You've been warned.

Anywho, I ordered 3 happy hour tacos thinking they were the street taco sized version. WRONG! They were full sized and crammed with meat, slaw and guacamole. A great value at a couple bucks each. I could only eat 2 and the best one was the Standard. I don't even remember what was in it, it was just yummy! The carne asada taco had a one little bite of gristle :/

I asked the waiter which margarita he would  recommend; I saw several interesting flavors. Surprisingly he suggested a skinny margarita (I tried not to be offended). He was right though, it was a perfect balance of sweet and sour and just enough tequila. 

I really enjoyed the vibe, along with the fresh food at Joyride. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Busy lunch spot, parking was the biggest challenge. Once inside we opted for the bar.  Wow, the drinks are amazing. 
Chips and salsa can easily fill you while you are waiting to place your order.  Good thing they were fast with the drinks. 
We all had tacos, nothing special.   The drinks however, WOW.  Get the prickly pear,  yum."}
{"text":"Great tacos and street corn.  It's always packed and it's super loud.  But good service and good food."}
{"text":"Another place to add to the list of \"Places I Can't Believe I Haven't Reviewed Before.\" Joyride Taco House capitalizes on the Taco Tuesday infatuation us white girls have. From vegetarian to carne asada they have you covered. At $3.50-$4.75 they're not the cheapest around but order three and get a side for $1(I recommend the bomb black beans). The shrimp taco with Mexican slaw and pico gringo and chicken tinga taco are always my go to's and I would also highly recommend the Baja fish if you want something lighter but still tasty. The Beast burrito and the Machaca burrito are great if you want something hearty and delicious. Order them as a bowl or chimi style at no additional charge."}
{"text":"Would give 5 stars but it was SO loud. Great food & really good sangria. Portion size was perfect (I had the 2 tacos). Flavorful but basic. We were told it would be an hour wait (Fri night), but our party of 4 was seated within 15 minutes. Our server was brand new & very good & friendly. Pretty fun place."}
{"text":"Been here couple of times. Was here for dinner and ordered the corn, fish taco, shrimp taco and chilaquiles. My fish was dry, it felt like it was microwaved. Corn was a bit burnt- although still very good. Chilaquiles was very good.
The only thing that I did not like was our server-do not want to mention her name. She did not smile, did not even check to see if we were okay with our order.. Maybe she was just tired or having a bad day. The bus boys were awesome. I wish I got their names! I wanted to tell the manager that. They were quick, asked us if we wanted more chips, filled up our waters frequently and asked if we needed anything."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great happy hour and great food I would recommend joyride! On to too it off the service is amazing! I will defiantly be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere , great music , awesome staff . The chicken tacos are delicious and so is their bowls , their desserts I didn't love. But I would definitely go back especially to chill at the bar. They were also very accommodating with kids !"}
{"text":"Ok I had to come back and post something. I mean I had too!

We went back to Joyride after so many pleads from my husband. I gave in after two years! This time things went a little bit super different! 

First of all we picked the best day to go nice and rainy today we walked in and are seated by a nice gentleman. He asks if we'd rather have a seat by the window so we could enjoy the beautiful weather. Yes!!!! We picked our table since it wasn't as busy as last time. No wait! Nice and quiet! This time I was able to enjoy it a bit more since we didn't take our kids and it was calm.

Server took order for our drinks and chicken nachos. I ordered a prickly pear margarita. So good!  
Another gentleman came to ask if our order had been taken and he was happy to know staff was on top of it! 

Nachos came and we couldn't resist. They were so good! I really liked that the chips for the nachos were thicker than the one used for the chips and salsa. Means they won't get soggy in between conversations! Loved the chunks of avocado and the flavor on the chicken was so good! 

I HAD to try some tacos. So after dominating the nachos with my husband we ordered four tacos; he ordered one carne asada, one braised beef and I got one Baja fish, one chicken tinga. (So a bit different from last time we visited Joyride) 

I didn't taste my husbands because I am not feeling red meat so I am glad I had the option for chicken and fish! I did add a bit of salt because I always add salt to everything but both tacos were very good! 

I really enjoyed going back it might've been a mixture of no kids, not busy, and alcohol!  Whatever it was Joyride has redeemed itself! Although they offered to pay from my last review and it's been two years. I wouldn't want to change the outcome. If you enjoy it you should definitely pay for something that's worth it! 

I'd recommend for you to go on a less busy time and to make it a date night instead!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place's street corn. Amazing service and great food."}
{"text":"I love the street corn here. I usually just go here for the corn. Tacos are okay. The reason why I just gave 4 stars. The guy was super nice here! He felt the corn was too small so he gave me 2! Score!"}
{"text":"This is definitely \"Mexican\" food for the white people of Gilbert. I had the veggie burrito and +1 had some sort of seafood tacos. The veggie burrito was good, but a bit bland. The green whatever sauce it came with was also pretty bland. Chips and salsa were pretty dope though. Pro tip: ask for salsa to go with the burrito instead of the green stuff they give you."}
{"text":"Awesome environment. Stellar food. Amazing playlist. 

I enjoyed the Baja taco and grilled fish taco... Very tasty and great service."}
{"text":"I guess it's never too late to say thank you, and I want to give a big shout-out to Joyride.  Even though they were closing at 4:00 p.m. Christmas Eve, they let my group of 15 adults and kids come in at 3:00.  The seven young grandkids sat at a table near us, and the manager took the time to learn their names so she could ask each what they wanted to order. This made them feel special.  She even treated us and the kids to a free guacamole appetizer! 

The food was delicious, as always.  Good variety of well-stuffed tacos.  I made sure everyone ordered the Mexican corn (off the cob), and not one kernel was left.  Our server had a fun sense of humor and paid the right amount of attention to us.  So, thank you, Joyride, for making our Christmas Eve fun -- and saving me from having to cook for everyone!"}
{"text":"The tacos were very good today. Perfect weather to have a great happy hour. The salsa was great to spicy for my wife, more for me to enjoy. I had a chicken tinga,and a couple carne asada tacos. My wife had the veggie tacos that were perfect.Good place to come for taco Tuesday.And the real bonus was we were able to do some Christmas shopping while dinning. Bought some gift cards"}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place! 

What a great happy hour!  

I met a good friend there and we both had a spicy margarita...ok, we had more than one!  I had 3 tacos and cannot decide on my favorite...ok, the mole!  hahaha I'm really bad at making decisions! 

Considering celebrating my birthday here next month...that's how much I loved it!"}
{"text":"Food is great here. I love the tacos and the ceviche. Also just tried the orange cucumber salad. Amazing. The food gets them all the stars. But, man...your service needs some attention. I guess it's hit or miss with service here because I see a lot of great reviews, but the Sunday evening crew I had yesterday was rough. 

The restaurant was half full with the patio being full so it wasn't a packed house. Servers and food runners just seemed impatient and inconvenienced by a request. Also, if I order a handful of different tacos, I expect the food runner to point out what each one is. Hell, for all I know, I may have not received the ones I actually ordered. And don't just drop the food without observing whether we have utensils or not. I get it, you may have a lot going on, but I'm speaking from someone that works in live events and did the service industry gig during grad school - you have to give everyone their due. 

I'll certainly be back, though. It's not always like that and the food is always great. Four stars from me."}
{"text":"I had a business lunch here last week and it was great. I had their Shotgun Lunch Special - two tacos and tortilla soup for under $10. It was more than what I could eat so that was a great value. The flavors were quite good and I appreciate that a number of their offerings are gluten-free and well-marked in the menu.

The staff was impressive. I told them that I was meeting people and we needed to be able to talk, she selected a table that let us sit closer to each other. And when one of my dining companions knocked a glass bottle of hot sauce off the table and broke it, the staff was over in the flash and cleaned it up in under two minutes.

I really love that the owners. who have several restaurants in the area, bought a lot and turned it into extra parking."}
{"text":"Had to wait a longgggggg time to get seated. Then a long time to get menus and a long time to get our food. My husband's burrito was good but mine was just mediocre. The music was super loud and I left with ringing in my ears. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Went for $2 taco Tuesday! Great choice of tacos, really filling and complimented by a great pineapple mojito! Cute atmosphere, service wasn't the greatest, but would come back to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"What a great place!!  We went in Taco Tuesday for my parent anniversary and there was a bit of a wait, however the staff was more than accommodating.  When we sat the manger came over to ask if there was anything they could have done better as they seem to pride themselves in customer service. We ordered guacamole , multiple tacos, margaritas, quesadillas , churro and brownies- Both the food and drinks were great and the service outstanding. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Cinco de Mao lunch. 
Busy and on top of it! 
Had Nachos. Really great taste with \"blanco sauce\".  My friend, who does NOT eat Mexican food.... Enjoyed his combo plate.
Upbeat vibe! Everyone from hosts, bartenders, and bussers were friendly and attentive. The manager was working with the crew. 
I'm in the food business and don't leave reviews often. Looking around here, the experienced staff were engaged with each other (teamwork) and anticipating needs of guests! 
Must say, very happy with my visit!"}
{"text":"So I have been trying to try all the cool new food joints in downtown Gilbert. Today it was Joyride Taco house. It was a weekday, so less of a crowd, always a good thing. Our server \"Floyd\" seated us quickly. we told her this was our first time here and she told us about how everything is Fresh,  home made . To start they bring out this crazy great salsa, I was blown away by its unique flavor. It was with a hint of sweet, citrus, spice, chunky, which equalled a explosion of awesome flavors!!! We had the lunch special. We each picked three tacos with a free side. The crispy fish taco is insane! The grilled fish taco a close second. The braised beef is good, but the fish is my favorite. My wife too loved the crispy fish and really loved \"The standard\" chicken taco.The Tacos are not big, but three of them was enough. Me and my wife shared a bowl of Tortilla soup, fresh, and soooo good. We will be back for sure, got to try other things, but it will be hard not to order the fish tacos again. Thanks to our very nice and helpful server, she made our visit even nicer!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 7 and a set of twin infants. We sat on the patio. The manager and server were quick and very accommodating. Table service was fast on a Sunday night. The carnitas were amazing; the pork adobada was awful-- too salty and...gritty? It was strange. The server was generous in taking it off our bill. Roasted veggies has a spicy creamy sauce on them I didn't like, but I ate around it. I sampled the Orange cucumber salad, and it was refreshing. They make a decent Bloody Mary; based on feedback from the rest of the group, the margaritas and mojitos were a group favorite. 

The misters were turned on per our request, and the babes were happy and cool. 

Parking is godawful, but it's not easy to find it on Central on any given day."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Went for a late Saturday lunch and the house was rocking. Hostess said 20 minute wait, but with a nice large bar we were able to find two open seats right away and avoid the masses who were lingering. I really dug the decor, and there looked to be lots of outdoor patio space to enjoy too.
The house salsa was super flavorful and the chips were the wonderfully thin and crunchy type that I can't get enough of with my Mexican food. I ordered the Baja fish, Chicken Tinga and Cochinita Pibil tacos with the cucumber orange salad side. All of the tacos were great, but that simple, perfect salad was shear perfection. I want some now just thinking about it!
Couple of good draft beer choices and what appeared to be a pretty extensive bar. I plan a return sometime soon for a specialty coctele or two! 
Joyride, ya done good."}
{"text":"Good service, good atmosphere, good food and reasonable prices.  The salsa is really tasty and I'm loving the veggie enchiladas. The tacos are good, not awesome.  The kids love it and I'm excited to try more of the menu"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great food - we've tried every taco option there is! The manager is always extremely friendly and welcoming. Great serving staff. Awesome place for families - we have two very small children and are easily accommodated."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here a few nights ago on our vacation to Phoenix. The food was good, the service was average. We sat outside and space heaters kept turning off which left the patio rather cold. Maybe it's because we're from out of town, but the restaurant seemed unorganized and all over the place, and they appeared to be fully staffed. Overall, it was a completely average experience. I don't think I'd come back"}
{"text":"So where do I start... so it was my brother's bday. We were a group of 6 and the service was ridiculously slow. The place wasn't even full. The time it took to get your drink was like absurd. To make matters worst, they cut us off at 5 drinks?!! Are you serious? 5 drinks in and that's it? We've been here for like 5 hours. Anyway, this place it so not worth it. The food isn't that good. If you're smart you'd stay away."}
{"text":"parking is a mess...food...so so..they seem to think their salsa is the bomb..but the flavors just don't quite hit the spot. The concept is great and the atmosphere is good..
even the bar seating (which is extensive) is comfortable) Service could be much  improved...come on it took forever to get a bottle of beer....the burrito...carne asada..
not much flavor..meat was tough and the various other ingredients just didnt play well with each other...very dry...when I want a burrito grilled on one side..I will say so..
..overall I think they are trying to hard...."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the ambiance and location of JoyRide Tacos Hut was very disappointed with their street tacos. WAY overpriced for \"gourmet\" tacos and the flavor and taste is rather underwhelming. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Really nice place, great outdoor space and excellent service. Their ahi tuna tacos are above and beyond. Be sure to try their orchata, really good. My critique will be to be more consistent with the side dishes method of preparation. They never tasted/looked the same."}
{"text":"Rock-star treatment for a blue-collar, not-as-nicely-dressed-as-I-should-have-been guy on a fine Wednesday afternoon.  I had been hauling and delivering and installing and making a royal mess of myself before realizing I was hungry, later than lunch is served in many places. I stopped in about 3 looking for lunch, which they said they'd happily serve me, but the happy hour is insanely tempting....and so I bit!

Three tacos (veg/pork/I forget the 3rd) and a, um, sorry boss, pitcher of yummy craft beer. Very delicious food, tasty premium waves (the pitcher is $5 all day until 5pm, while a pint is $6; what are YOU going to do? ;), and the drinking water (and ice-perfect size/texture...I know, that sounds weird, but you sit there and drink water and chew the ice w/o realizing you have been doing this for 5 minutes!).  Really god job by Mr DeMarco & Company.

Can't wait to go back. Like tomorrow."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool, but the tacos aren't the greatest. They're good, but nothing to write home about; especially for the price. I got shrimp and fish tacos and paid more than what I'm typically used to paying. It was a cool place to experience, but I wouldn't be back unless the flavor improved."}
{"text":"Love love love love!! You have to try their Baja fish taco and the cucumber salad. Yum!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: It was Sunday afternoon. We had about 20 min. wait so they texted us when the table was ready (better than having to wait outside or carry a buzzer). There were 2 trans-gender bathrooms & 1 women's bathroom. The bar was pretty full with people drinking cocktails in the middle of the afternoon. There were 2 flat screen TVs hanging in the bar area, one showing golf & the other showing baseball. The sound level was pretty noisy due to the number of customers in the dining room. It was very bright due to the sun shining in through all the windows. There was outdoor seating & a fireplace for cooler weather.  
Food: Great chicken burritos if you like mushroom & mango. Finding a piece of chicken was like finding a needle in a haystack. 
The complimentary salsa on the table was too hot so we had to pay $2 for a small bowl of pico de gallo which arrived warm (much to my husband's chagrin). 
The complimentary chips were the best thing I had. They were thin & salty.
There was complimentary cold water on the table for us which was great since it was very hot outside.
The carne asada taco with cilantro & cabbage had a spicy sauce that made it inedible for me, after one bite I was drinking my water trying to rescue my tongue. I ended up having to give it to my husband who said it was great.
My daughters split a chicken burrito which we specified they only wanted chicken. However, it is either cooked in a spicy sauce or they added something spicy because one of my daughters couldn't eat it. 
Cheese was non-existent in any of our meals. 
Waitstaff: The waitstaff was attentive & happily explained the menu since we told them it was our first visit. 
Prices: $3.50 for a street taco served with a flour tortilla. $10.50 for a quesailla. $8.00 for a chicken burrito. They have taco Tuesday with $2 tacos & margaritas are $5 before 5pm.
Overall, I would say it is not a place to go if you don't enjoy spicy food."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and at the Central Phoenix location and was a little surprised how rude the staff were.

My friends and I went in Friday night for drinks and appetizers and asked to be seated outside. She took us to a far corner table off by ourselves on the front patio that was covered in dirt. We then asked to move inside and she shoved us in the very corner booth by the kitchen where we were almost hidden from the entire restaurant when there were plenty of other booths and tables open. 

Our actual server was very nice but it honestly took incredibly long to simply get a drink refill on our water, chips and salsa. They were not that busy, it just seemed due to the seating location we were so hidden and off by ourselves he kept forgetting about us. 

After we finished the food the plan was to hang out and order a few drinks until we decided where else to go. Another server came over immediatley and dropped the bill. He then came back three or four times to check and see if we had placed the cards in there yet. I dont get why servers do this. IT IS SO RUDE. We werent in a hurry, they werent busy at all, we werent bothering anyone but yet they made us feel like we were a complete burden by being there. Ordering $7.00 drinks x4 and food and minding our own business I wouldnt think to be a hassle of a table. 

Im only giving them two stars for the food because thats been on point every time I have been there. I used to work for this company when it was jointly owned with the folks from Chelseas Kitchen.. I remember first hand how seriously customer satisfaction was taken while employed with them and am sad to say, they are not carrying on that same mindset to this new concept."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly & attentive.  My tacos were great and we really enjoyed the atmosphere!  We will be coming back soon!  It is very rare to get such great service only a week after a new establishment opens."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday, Taco Thursday, Taco Saturday...it's a lifestyle, not a day of the week! And Joyride is the perfect place to live out your taco dreams, especially during their 2-6 pm weekday happy hours! $2 tacos and $5 margs - how could you go wrong? 

The Gilbert location was fun and trendy, and there was zero wait at 4:45 on a Thursday. We sat outside on the shaded patio, and it was gorgeous! Service was prompt and polite, and our tacos were delicious. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We tried this place tonight, on Gilbert Rd where there are many cool places to eat (Dierks Bentley's Whisky Row is across the street) and the tacos were amazing!  The tacos are a la carte so you can get different ones.  I had the a carne asada taco and a shrimp taco, soooo good!  The carne asada taco was so full of flavor!  Now, our server,  Tori, was a doll!  She was very helpful and had such a great personality!  If anything, we will return, just to see her...she was adorable!  I wish that more servers were like her.  I highly recommend trying this place.  The decor reminded me of the 70's, but it was done just right.  Even the music went with the vibe.  Tori proceeded to tell us of their drink special times where they have seven different flavors of margaritas for $5, as well as $5 pitchers of beer.  You can sit outside and watch the cars and people go by, sit inside, or on their back patio.  Again, ask for Tori's section, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"4.5 (but can't put that.) Why the 4.5 and not 5 you ask, well cilantro was slightly in my girlfriend's taco after she stated she didn't want it. Service awesome-check!

Food awesome-check. I got 'the beast' burrito and it was GREAT. She got the fish taco-alright. Not knocking her socks off but good enough to suit for a little snack.

So come in, give it a try. Cool atmosphere, good staff (as I see so far, very attentive) so worth a try.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere really makes the experience that much better. Not to mention the food is always delicious and the beer selection is great!"}
{"text":"So let's start with Margarita's.  My girlfriend may divorce me unless I figure out the recipe for the blood orange margarita.  I have one suggestion as a foodie, braised beef tacos.  It's like going to grandma's house in a taco shell.  If it was my house, I'd serve these with poblano mashed potatoes and a dollop of sour cream.  Joyride nailed this one!  #boom #braisedbeeftacos #tograndmashouseinatacoshell"}
{"text":"New in town and I heard great things about this place. Went here with the whole family and we had a nice time. Place was family friendly. My 6 year old daughter lived he complementary chips and salsa. The food was average, I had better, however our waitress was really good. She was attentive to our needs and the family had a good time."}
{"text":"Hostess great, seated in 15 min on a Saturday night for a group of 6 - not bad at all. Bar had some open space so we waited there.
Food: Great, Tacos were very very tasty.
Drinks: I was excited to try their margaritas and they were just OK, I was not wowed unfortunately.
Ambiance: Great, patio and open doors. Not too loud.
Service: Great as well, never felt rushed or anything. Our served seemed a bit stoned, but hey, he didn't eat my food nor mess up anything so all OK. 

I would have given it 5 star if:
Margaritas kicked a$$
Tacos were a bit cheaper"}
{"text":"Gotta give this place 5 stars for their Happy Hour! The street tacos are fantastic,and you get mini pitchers of beer.  They have some very interesting beers on tap,so the craft folks can find something they like here, but even those like me that want a simpler beer will be satisfied. I stuck to Negro Modelo while dining last week. 2 to 6 PM,and if I remember correctly I think Tuesday's happy hour is all day. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Great drinks. Great atmosphere.  They start you off with chips and salsa which I can't get enough of because it's all fresh.  I usually order the tacos and really like the chicken tinga, braised beef, crispy fish, and carnita. Carnitas is definitely my favorite and I think it's the most flavorful out of the bunch.  I've had a couple of other things off their menu as well, like one of the burritos and enchilada, and everything was good.  One thing I have to say is if you get the Mexican corn (which is also good) be prepared to have it on the cob, it's not in a cup, which is what I was expecting. I'm also big on mezcal so I always get the Naked and Famous, but ask them to make it extra smoky (i.e. with more mezcal) and it always tastes great. Atmosphere is nice and relaxed and we've always been able to find a bar seat or a table so you rarely have to wait (a huge plus) and service is fast."}
{"text":"Great outdoor dining!  My husband and I came here because I had a voucher for a free appetizer, which happened to include any app! We got Carne asada nachos ($15) and they were so delicious. There was no lack of toppings and they were extremely flavorful. 
We also ordered a chicken burrito ($10) which was huge, but didn't have sides or anything. 
The service was quick and very friendly. We never ran out of water.  The first round of chips and salsa is free!  
I wish the prices were a smidgen more reasonable, but overall we are for sure coming back."}
{"text":"This place is better than Blanco. The Beast is a must-try as well. Be sure to have it enchilada style!"}
{"text":"For starters, the place has a lovely atmosphere. We came in on a Saturday afternoon. They had the large roll up doors open, which allowed a nice breeze in, great way to enjoy a nice day. The service was quite slow. Friendly, but a bit inattentive. The complimentary chips were good, with salsa that actually had a nice kick to it. Now for the main foods...

I ordered the Fila salad. Very fresh ingredients and nice presentation. Salads are about $10 a pop, then an extra $3 to add meat. It was good, but nothing to rave about. For $13.50 I just wasn't that impressed. BF ordered the Beast burrito, chimi style, with shredded beef. It was surprisingly bland."}
{"text":"I have been to joyride twice, and both experiences were not very great. The first time, i got a variety of tacos and I was not impressed. They lacked flavor and were not as amazing as people talk them up to be. Not to mention, there was a hair in one of my tacos. After that experience, i didn't think I would go back, but last night I was searching for a place open past 10pm because I was starving! Joyride was open and my friend suggested their veggie bowl. So, I ordered their veggie bowl with added chicken to go, and I thought it was absolutely delicious! But, just an hour or less later, my stomach started cramping up. I woke up in the morning feeling extremely sick and for the rest of the day I was in bed. My stomach has been nauseous and crampy all day. Once again, a terrible experience with the food at joyride. The only reason I'd give Joyride a star is for their service. My server was very nice and took great care of me."}
{"text":"Love this place have the best nopales tacos(cactus) . My fav drinks with tekila and smashed jalpenos along with a floater of grand manier.  It gets pretty busy, but is worth  it! .  The chips and salsa are complementary of the house."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing tacos!! And that side dish of the cucumber and orange salad is to die for!!! Their ceviche is very good! Their agua frescas are so freshing!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this place is good. If you have not been here, come. They have very good carne asada, and their food is full of flavor. If you want authentic Mexican food, do not come here. This is a great blend of authentic and modern. 

This location had decent service, but it is laid backed and chill like the other location. I can never really understand this concept. I am not a fan of waiting for drinks to be refilled, or having to flag down waiters for service. 

All in all, we enjoy Joyride once or twice a year. Worth trying out."}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars 

Atmosphere is 5 stars 

Music playlist is 5 stars

Services ruined it all for me. This seems to be a trend with central Phx restaurants. Maybe it is a vibe I don't understand? We are all about relaxing, but I still expect my drinks to be filled in a timely manner. We got things done quicker by asking random servers that passed by, rather than our server doing it. 

Will try again and get the stars up hopefully."}
{"text":"This place was scrumptious! I cant wait to be back in gilbert so i can experience their super tasty food. The drinks were decent, our whole party of 5 ordered the fresh pressed juice (agua frescas). I ordered the cucumber mint which was different, and kinda dangerous in that I couldn't even taste the vodka that i ordered it with! I would love to try another flavor next visit. The chips were good and salsa was fresh. The food was great! My friend ordered the fish tacos, i ordered the veggie burrito (which was a tad salty, but still very good) and my husband ordered the beef burrito. The portions were VERY generous. We went during happy hour, so 2 drinks and 2 burritos (for my husband and i) came out to $24! Super affordable! Cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"pros: almond horchata was good, as was the strawberry agua fresca, nice atmosphere with indoor/outdoor seating. free chips/salsa, manager stopped by to check up, carne asada was the best of the 3 I tried.

cons: tacos were small, one very sloppy/greasy, didn't like the flavor of the adobado one, waitress seemed snobby"}
{"text":"The 5 stars isn't so much for the food, which is good, but moreso for the service.  I stopped in for an after work beer, after a real bitch of a day, and had Hayley as a server.  She could see that I was visibly drained ... which, let's face it, is the real purpose of work, and told me I needed to order Joyride's Mexican corn.  It'd cheer me right up.  Having brought out the beer and the corn, she asked if I was into football (this was right at the time NFL free agency started), and I told her \"no\", but had heard a lot about this Osweiler guy, to which she laughed, and told me it was kind of a big deal, and if sports guys weren't talking about him, they'd be talking about Colin Kaepernick.  She then started making fun of the Patriots in a fake Boston accent that had me laughing for 5 minutes.  

For a waif of a girl, she was pretty sports nerdy.

She then asked what I was doing tonight, and I told her probably just zoning out watching tv.  Having heard this, she asked if I was in to Game of Thrones.

I was like, uh, no.

Hayley then broke down the series and sent me home with a free desert telling me to watch it.

I don't think I've ever had that type of service before.

So, if you need a pick me up, stop in here.  They have a pretty great porch too!  Relaxing, and not super douche-y."}
{"text":"3 visits to Joyride Taco House, 3 awesome experiences... Upward Projects continues to amaze me with their successful restaurant concepts and Joyride is no exception.

Joyride has a lot in common with sister restaurant (and another one of my faves), Postino.  They both have a casual, fun vibe, attentive and friendly service, indoor and outdoor seating, and stellar food and drinks.

I've been to Joyride twice with my husband and once for a girls' dinner, and each time has been awesome.

I am a huge fan of their chips and salsa... note: the first basket is free and each refill after that is $2.  Pretty good deal, but they know how to hook you; the chips are addicting!  

Each time I've been there, I've ordered a different drink... a beer, a blood orange margarita, a cucumber serrano margarita, and my latest find and favorite of all is the cucumber mint agua fresca con booze!  I had it with tequila, but I bet it would also be good with vodka.

As for the food, it's all fresh and delicious, but some of my favorite menu items are:
*the guacamole - who goes for chips and tacos without guac?!
*the shrimp ceviche
*the garden variety burrito

Believe it or not, I haven't ordered the tacos, but I'm sure you can't go wrong with those either... and there are plenty of options!  It's also worth noting that there is a kids' menu (I will be bringing the kids next time), and that the kitchen doesn't mind if you custom order a bit, ie: \"no cheese\" or \"add chicken.\"  Gotta love that!

If you haven't been to Joyride yet, I suggest you go immediately, especially if you can get there before 5pm daily for happy hour when many of the drinks and pitchers of beer are only $5.  Enjoy the ride!"}
{"text":"My friends have been hyping this place up so I tried it today on a business lunch. I liked the atmosphere. The music and the open feel we nice, and the service was very good. Food came out fast as well. That's about where it ends. I had 3 different tacos, two of which I would probably never order again, with the third being just ok. The chips and salsa were not that good and the rice was average. I think if you wanna go somewhere uber-trendy and way over-pay for tacos that are not that good and are definitely not Mexican food, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great service friendly staff. One of my favorite taco places for taco Tuesday. Nothing beats $2 tacos and $5 margs!! Cheers"}
{"text":"Love the taco Tuesday specials! Friendly staff and somewhat of a quick time to get your food if you go early!"}
{"text":"Great food great service!! The crispy fish taco, hands down the best fish taco I've had to date!!! Also the cucumber mint with sapphire gin is amazing. If you are ever at the bar Kyle is your go to bartender!!!"}
{"text":"What a cool venue.  What appears to have been a Bob's Big Boy converted into Joyride.  Truly a unique indoor and outdoor experience.  Enter on the SW side under a canopy of mature trees and see the sliding panel doors wide open.  Very spacious footprint.  A few rounds of chips and salsa are included.  The service?  Rock solid.  Sat at the bar.  Bartender was mostly attentive.  I was rather impressed that all bartenders remained busy, wiping down the bar and bottles.  The bartenders worked as a team which is always nice. Here is why we are actually hovering around a 2-3, yes I want to rate this place a 2...The food?  The complimentary chips and salsa area served in a round tin.  The chips are fresh and served with the right amount of salt.  The salsa?  Flat bland.  :(  The Bandit Taco plate - served with fresh slices of avocado and yummy, fresh, tortillas.  Comes with beans per the menu.  However, you did not get to pick; served with black beans..All the proteins were bland, like the salsa.  With no additional salsas to add, tacos were a bust.  

Again - great service and location.  Food was not inspiring."}
{"text":"Decent food. Kinda pricey but it comes with the turf. Cool little place to hangout and enjoy the weather when the Phoenix sun permits it. There really is something magical about eating tacos and drinking margaritas with the breeze on your back and that's probably the only reason I come back."}
{"text":"I've been here enough times to say that this is a perfectly fine place to hang out. The service is great, the restaurant is actually very nicely designed, from what I've heard the cocktails are pretty delicious, and refills on chips are free. 

That said, I have never enjoyed the food. I've had a chimichanga, tamales, and a couple of different side items, all of which I felt either lacked flavor or were more money than they were worth. The cheese and chorizo side is good if you don't mind spending $9 on queso dip, but the beans, tamales, and burritos I've had have inspired a resounding \"meh\" in me.

Taking on the moniker of a taco house was an ambitious move in a city like Phoenix. If they called themselves \"Mod Living Room with Patio, Cocktails and Chips,\" I would find the branding more honest."}
{"text":"This place is a slam dunk. Fresh and delicious food with generous portion sizes. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options. Knowledgeable and attentive staff, cute decor and fun atmosphere. The food is very flavorful and they also have great drinks! What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Was actually pretty good. I like the flare and different flavor options and new ideas. The margaritas were amazing!! Only downfall is the place is really expensive. The margaritas were tiny too. Well the glass is huge but not much liquid in it! Overall good food but cant say Id visit often."}
{"text":"Loved the Happy Hour menu. The Crispy Fish and Pork Adobada tacos were tasty and the Cucumber-Serrano Margaritas were killer good. 
All in all, a great spot with great food, great service and a fun vibe!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my experience here because I was so looking forward to it from looking at reviews and pictures on Yelp. The menu looks amazing so I had high expectations. The service wasn't great, slow and sloppy. Although the drinks and food look amazing, the taste was terrible. Don't order the Watermelon Margarita! The veggie enchiladas looked perfect but the taste was just not good. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out the other night. We went with a large group to try out some Mexican food. 

The service was very good. The group was taken care of very well. Our glasses were always full and they came around a lot to check in on us. 

The food was also very good. I tried the carne asada, crispy fish, chicken Tiga, and Mexican rice. My favorite taco was the carne asada. The other two were good, but this one beat the others out. 

Some other people in our group tried the nachos (which were huge), chicken bowls, and burritos. I heard from them all that it was a pretty great place. 

Is it authentic Mexican food? Probably not. None the less, it was very good food. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"The ambience is very hip and the employees are all very customer service centric. The almond horchata was just the right amount of sweet and the blood orange margarita was perfect! The guacamole was fantastic, creamy with a nice kick! The chips were warm, which is always nice. The carne asada burrito was Devine! Best burrito I have ever tasted. Very rich and deep flavor and the tortilla was very fresh, perhaps made on site. The adobada and baja fish tacos were also very tasty. We finished the meal with the warm Churros and chocolate, which is heavenly! We will definitively be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place..... If you make it before 5pm your guaranteed a stool at the bar but after 5pm definitely not.  Joyride is like a joy ride.... The standard taco are my favorite, also the crispy fish. 

All of he bartenders have wonderful personalities. Everyone had a story to tell, which is good if your waiting on someone or just hanging out by yourself. 

The drinks are soooooo right!!!! The prickly pear...delicious!!! The pineapple mojito is the BOOM.... Three glasses later I still want more. 

This is a great place to meet friends and kick it...... Happy Taco Tuesday Y'all!"}
{"text":"Love it! I can't say one negative thing about this place. Delicious food, great menu selection, fantastic service, nice ambience, good prices and yummy Aguas frescas. I recommend the strawberry with vodka! You won't be disappointed. I could eat here every week and not get tired of it."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa in town. But that's just for starters. Love their tacos. Fresh guacamole, great salsa, attentive staff make for a great dining experience. If you can get there and sit outside, it's even better. Feeling the street vibe with the authentic modern Mexican cuisine is unique to this restaurant. Bring a group of friends, they won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fun spot but blaring music inside a small concrete space doesn't work well. That said they have a decent 70's - 90's mix running on the night I was there. 

The chips and salsa were very good. Crispy chips and spicy salsa. My wife doesn't like it hot and they gave her tomatillo which was also delicious. 

She got a fish taco plus two chicken tacos. She liked hers and thought they were solid. I got the taco platter (spicy chicken, carnitas and carne asada. The asada was basically charbroiled and in would have preferred the pork and chicken to be more unique meat ingredients versus stews. The beans and rice we both fine and avacado ripe. The blood orange margarita was the bomb so that helped everything! 

I would go back and try some more street tacos and maybe a burrito and definitely sample the other margaritas."}
{"text":"After having an abysmal experience at a neighboring bar, the bartender, Taylor, at Joyride quickly saved the day with his speedy and attentive service. I will definitely be back! 

P.S. 
Great Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"The service, food and ambiance was amazing. For the love of God, please get the Crispy Fish Taco!"}
{"text":"There was no Joy in Joy Ride unless you want to donate your money to them for bad food and expensive prices. It's very trendy and that's about it! We are regulars at Postinos and used to go to the Windsor on Central regularly. We were regulars for quality food and great service at those two places .  However I can't express the disappointment on Fathers day at Joyride. The the burritos and taco was cold and stuffed with rice rather than chicken or machaca. We were asked if we wanted red or green sauce unwillingly knowing that it cost $2 extra and it's not flavorable. We tried Barrio Cafe and was so good went 2 days in a row, or Los Dos Molinos both of them were flavorful and affordable authentic Mexican food. We will never return to Joyride!!"}
{"text":"Very yummy, but overpriced, and mediocre Mexican ride and beans. The one thing I love from here is the shrimp tacos! 
I think it's more of a fad place to go because it's downtown Gilbert! The restaurant is nice, and clean, but sometimes you feel passed up by the waitress/waiters because they're are so many people in there."}
{"text":"Well any place in PHX that serves mojitos wins points with me.  We ordered a range of tacos and they were ok..nothing spectacular.  We actually liked the appetizers better.   The ahi stack was my favorite part of the meal..if I go back I'll probably just get that an a salad."}
{"text":"Came here for some tacos after our usual hangout just next ops to the south didn't fill us up (well, with food. Booze, yes). Place was packed. This is a trendy hipster place with $4 street tacos and $9 margaritas light on liquor. I am a small female and I easily ate  3 tacos. Tacos came with a side at no charge. I ordered the orange cucumber salad which was obviously made the previous day. Soggy, definitely not fresh and I believe the orange slices were canned. Our bill was almost $70 and I felt like my husband and I had nothing special. I saw a roach inside as we were leaving. The beautiful huge tree out front and fun string lights would be my most compelling reasons to return."}
{"text":"First off, the food was very good and deserves four stars. The problem was the service. The server was constantly forgetting to bring us things we had asked so we had to ask the bussers as they passed by. We understood at first since he was taking care of a large party but after they left, he only had us and still was absent!  Having been a restaurant corporate trainer for servers and managed restaurants I tend to be a little more patient than most but this went beyond my patience. I will definitely give them another try since the food was good but hopefully they redeem themselves with their service."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken tinga taco and carne asada taco. The chicken one was super flavorful. I really liked it. 

The only thing that could have been better is their chips. They were airy and not very good. 

The waiter was super sweet. This is a cool place to hang out for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here once during lunch and once for dinner.  Dinner time it was pretty crowded with a little bit of a wait, but we were able to sit at the bar and eat there right away.  We got a few tacos which were unique and I love the little taco holders.  We ordered dessert and I don't remember what my friend got but it looked delicious but I had the churros and they were excellent. This might make a regular place to eat for me"}
{"text":"Met here for Smunch right about opening time.  Without even getting in to the food the feel of the place was great.  Spring was in the air and the doors were open to the patio with more seating out there.  Our service was great the whole time for a party of around 10.

We had a large enough group several items on the menu got tried.  I had the enchiladas and they let me have one of each.  They were both good.  Normally they serve it with both red and green sauce, next time I would ask for all red as I preferred it.  The salsas and guacamole were great.  The only thing lackluster to me was the beans.  Of those that had tacos it seemed like the fish came in last with shredded beef winning the day.  All of them were good, just in different degrees.

This is just a wonderful spot to gather on a spring day in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It was midweek date night and we had picked another place to originally go to, but then he stated he was in the mood for some tacos so we walked over to Joyride Tacos. For a Wednesday night it was busy, but not too overly busy and we were able to find seating at the bar right away.

After checking out the menu, I went with 2 tacos, the standard & the crispy fish.

The Standard had slow roasted chicken, avocado, slaw and aji amarillo. This was a great tasting taco, the chicken was tender and the taco was full of flavor. Then I tried the crispy fish taco which was a beer battered fish with slaw, cilantro, pico, guacamole and white sauce. This too was a really good taco, both had great flavors, and the taco shell was perfect, it wasn't too hard or too soft and didn't come apart when eating it.

I also learned on Taco Tuesdays they have some tacos for $2 from 2pm to close, um yes please!!! 

Joyride Tacos was a good last-minute choice, look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Joyride is a bad restaurant to go to because the music is far too loud. Also their margaritas are of very low quality, using only the cheapest possible ingredients. I don't know why they need a bartender because they serve what could be a store bought margarita mix. The cost of two margaritas and a diet pepsi was $22. Also, Joyride as no blender, so all they make is margaritas on the rocks. Why they would not have a blender is totally illogical. The waiter actually said, \"it we would be great if we had a blender.\" Joyride is the type of restaurant that you have a hard time believing is still in business. 

We were not able to stay to actually eat anything becuase the restaurant itself was so unpleasant to stay in. But the restaurant is clearly focused on style over substance."}
{"text":"The food is good and the $5 alcohol special is nice. The tacos are really solid, but pricey for how small they are."}
{"text":"My favorite amerimex taco shop in town.  The chopped salads leave you wanting more.  The handcrafted drinks with fresh ingredients are out of this world.  The decor is colorful and lively and has a true hipster feel.  Happy hour is fantastic, but the place is busy all the time.  This is one of my top 5 Gilbert restaurants.  I keep going back to work my way through the menu and have not had a bad dish yet.  Try it!"}
{"text":"I have to give 5 stars just for the tacos. They have the best tacos I have ever had (I have tried a lot). Every single one is good but my favorites are the chicken, braised beef and ahi tuna. Misters outside are a plus. They have valet and located in between 2 other good restaurants, postino and a pizza place (can't remember the name)."}
{"text":"What a cute place! The atmosphere was so colorful and fun and the staff was very friendly! This is a very lovely place that is great for date nights or just grabbing a drink! The only reason I can't give this business a 5 star rating is for a couple reasons. As they placed the complimentary chips and salsa on our table the chips seemed to be hard/stale which was surprising to everyone I was with. Although management did come and apologize which was very thoughtful he did inform us that there were no batches of chips that weren't stale, which we found super odd? How does that happen?"}
{"text":"This place gets crazy packed but I have to say the weight and the tacos and the quesadillas are totally worth it. They are so delicious it is out of this world. Definitely check it out on taco Tuesdays but expect to wait a little bit. All tacos are about 2 bucks. The service is great and too bad we never made it to the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck taco Happy Hour! $2 Tacos Paired with $5 Margaritas or pitchers. Can't beat it. My husband loves their Carne Asada Tacos. My favs include the chicken tinga and crispy fish. All of them are super fresh and flavorful! Huge patio and good sized bar. All the staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on Thursday. Weekends we never can find parking for any restaurant in Gilbert. We were immediately seated and greeted by our server.Chips and salsa were here before you knew it. I ordered a  chicken burrito in a bowl. My husband ordered 3 tacos and a salad. 2 of the tacos were happy hour price! Good size servings. My only complaint is we didn't have room for dessert. ."}
{"text":"Great tacos & great margaritas!!! Highly recommend & will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars for fixing their error. I'm highly allergic to avocado. I asked to ensure it was removed, but the kitchen put guacamole on my tacos. I let the waitress know (I always double check because of how bad my allergy is) and they sprang into action. They made me new tacos, took them off our bill, offered me dessert on the house, and gave me coupons for discounted tacos in the next visit. The food was very good and the atmosphere is very trendy."}
{"text":"Great food in a hip & fun place! Try a sampler of fish tacos and their creative specialty drinks for a great change to your boring dinners out."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and atmosphere is relaxed. The service sometimes leaves a little to be desired but overal GREAT experience. We will return."}
{"text":"We give all 5s. Our server tori and the manager on tonight Billy were AMAZING! Little mix up with happy hour advertisement. But Billy hooked us up anyways! The customer service was something that should be in every restaurant like it is at joyride! We will be back as long as the service doea not change!!!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience! Tacos were tasty, try the baja fish. The beast burrito was excellent and their carne asada had a ton of flavor. $5 pitchers never hurt anybody's feelings and the mos def dessert (vanilla pudding graham cracker, carmel, walnut miracle) was a solid finish. Friendly staff, enjoyable atmosphere, nice patio and really good music. Awesome visit, thank you Richard and Valerie, we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Really Cool Spot! A bit of a weight on a Friday night, but it cool that you can have drinks & apps on the patio. Drinks were good and strong. Chips and Salas really good too. Tacos are street style so small in size, large in flavor. If you r hungry, ap and maybe 3 tacos would be perfect."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere and service. Wish they hadn't changed their chips/salsa policy to one bowl per table...that kinda sucks. Otherwise food is good and happy hour menu is great!"}
{"text":"With most of my friends all tied up with family matters I felt today was the perfect day to try this place for a few of us without kids. I had heard they had a happy hour that extended to Sundays, and I was very pleased. $5 for a small pitcher of an ipa is fantastic. I ended up ordering a few tacos as well, the carne asada was ok pretty bland for my taste but the shrimp was great. The service overall was outstanding and the main reason I will be back. A young lady named Morgan took care of us and was very personable and provided a very warm experience. I will definitely be back to enjoy the happy hour and great service."}
{"text":"Starting off with the chips and salsa, I loved both. The atmosphere is cool as others have mentioned. I found zero problem with the service. It was attentive and sufficient. 

The drinks are the best thing. I had the Mexican Mule. 

I liked my tacos.  I had a short rib and the pork (called something else to be hip). 2 were enough but they were a bit overpriced for the size. The place is an overall great addition to Gilbert.

UPDATE: From this 1st visit I had some coupons for more tacos and a drink - all FREE. I went back expecting for there to be an up-sell and OK with it.  My friend and I ordered our drinks with alcohol, which should have been extra, I think. At the end, my friend and I asked for the bill but we were told the coupons had taken care of everything. We walked out paying NOTHING (except we left a generous tip for the waitress, of course). 

What a great way to do business! I'll be back to spend real money. No question."}
{"text":"The nachos are amazing. And just generally the food is very good. The staff can be a bit less than friendly and that's really the only thing that keeps me from going there more often. I suppose I've been there 5 times and not once had wait staff that was genuinely friendly or had any sort of humor/personality. Odd considering the groovy style of the place."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes to have our server check on us once, no water refills, ignored our table multiple times, and said nothing as she set our check down. Watched multiple tables around us get served, and checked on. Go to Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more. The food was just ok. We all liked the guacamole but the tacos were nothing special and the rice that came with it was gross. How can a taco house have bad rice? 
The location is great.
Our server was friendly but not attentive and we ended up waiting a LONG while for our bill. I'll just sum it up and say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere = nice
Greeter= superb
Service = horrible...never got a tea refill the whole hour we were there
Food= 2 blocks of fat on plate. They did replace with meat. 
Will I return?  Probably not"}
{"text":"Been there a couple times now and a great experience both times.  Cool atmosphere, though it seems like the outside part of the property could be set up in a more useful way (looks nice but not too many chairs or tables.)  We ate at the bar both times and service was exceptional.  They were friendly and very attentive but not overly hovering/checking in like some places do.  The first time there they had an accidental corn on the cob appetizer they had an extra of and the bartender asked us if we wanted it.  I thought that was nice, since most places would chuck an extra rather than give it out for free.  They also had a pretty decent beer special.  Can't remember exactly what it was but something like $5 small pitcher during HH, and that was for good beer (Kiltlifter) not the cheap stuff.  Tacos were delicious, I liked the standard fried fish the best (I ordered a combo of three types.)"}
{"text":"The food is great ! Carne asada and joyride margarita  the only reason we didn't give 5 stars was the wait time for the food to come out during lunch break but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Probably the SE valleys best spot for tacos and a beer. A great vibe and excellent food with great service. 

We went on a Sunday evening around 5:30 and it was packed but cleared up around 6:30
 
Family friendly and kid friendly too."}
{"text":"Pretty fun modern Mexican place with specials. 

Parking:  The location is near Postino, Federal Pizza, and Windsor, and parking can be a pain. There are plenty of lots, but these places can get busy. There's a lot across the street near Windsor if the lots near Joyride are full. 

Location: Just north of Central and Camelback - a quick walk from the light rail station at this location.

Specials: There are happy hour specials from 2-6pm with pretty good deals and $5 margaritas. 

Food:  The food options are good. The guac is always delicious. The happy hour tacos are only $2 but are made with a pre-made mix. I asked for no peppers, but the server said the mix is already made.  The chips/salsa are just OK.  The salad options look pretty interesting but haven't had one before.   I ordered the Mexican corn for something new - pretty tasty!

Service:  Usually good, though I've only been here twice. 

The crowd is similar to the other Upward Projects restaurant crowd.

Sign up for the Upward Projects coupons for a free app, though I'd use the coupon at Postino"}
{"text":"We had other dinner plans, but the husband wanted to detour here instead. I grudgingly agreed, and put on my best \"Sure, Honey!\" face. I was repaid for my spousal compromise by being served the best Mexican food I've had in a long time!

*Chips and salsa- Good quality chips, salsa had the perfect amount of heat. (At least for me.)
*Carne asada quesadilla- Great tortilla, a delicious cheese blend, and moist, flavorful carne asada. 
*I snagged some of my son's black beans. Loved the flavor!
*The downtown Gilbert ambience is always crackling with tons of restaurants, happy people etc.

Now I'm definitely plotting a return trip!"}
{"text":"Solid effort from Upscale Projects. Not \"authentic\" Mexican, per se, but really good takes on tacos, enchiladas and sides. Great craft beer menu, much like Federal Pizza next door. Pleasant & upbeat servers. A bit pricey for street tacos but $2 Taco Tuesday is the cure for that. We had the Standard, Pork Adobado, a couple of Crispy Fish and Carnitas tacos, as well as a chicken enchilada. Tacos are creative builds and flavorful. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special. If you're looking to treat yourself to a pricier taco meal I'd recommend shooting over to blanco instead. The food wasn't bad but not very memorable. The service was slow."}
{"text":"Great Mexican spot in Phoenix. Loved the complimentary chips and salsa that arrived piping hot as soon as I was seated. The salsa was amazing.

Great assortment of items on the menu, amd honestly, everything sounded delicious. I opted for the Beast in a bowl, which was Carne asada, beans, avocado, salsa and rice, along with a side order of veggies, which I was told was roasted tomatoes but when it got here, they were actually fried brussel sprouts. 

Loved the interior, the folks working behind the bar, and the food too of course.  Almost considered coming here the very next day for their $2 taco Tuesdays! Will have to wait for next time."}
{"text":"So if you have been gere, more than likely you have come back  ... but  next time sit in a booth or table .. bartenders have too much going on that they miss you until  15 minutes later.
Good beer deal before  5 pm. ... but sit at a table/booth and you'll get better  service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere, great food, great happy hour, and lovely service. Just wish they had not discontinued my favorite dish, the Cochinita sorta sandwich I think it was. With Mexican slaw. Tacos are excellent. And love the fresh waters."}
{"text":"Can't talk, stuffing face! Nachos are outrageous! This is my 5th \"ride\" and have yet to be disappointed. Service has always been top notch, soup excellent, burros rock and the tacos... ahhh, the tacos."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Food was awesome, the atmosphere was great. Service was busy but still kept me happy :) Free chips and salsa but we then bought a different kind, the habanero (YUM!!!!) and HOT! Will be back very soon!!!! Plus, awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"You need to try these tacos. They are unreal! They taste organic and home made! 

The atmosphere at the restaurant is super chill too. I'd recommend this place for hanging out with friends or for a business meeting. 

The staff is unreal too. They are all very happy and willing to help."}
{"text":"Well... The only joy here was when I was riding home putting this place in my rear view mirror.  Truly a letdown... the place was busy (it does have a great atmosphere).  My wife and I were excited to try the food out.  Started with Mexican street corn... unseasoned and out of season corn.  My wife and I each tried 3 different tacos (6 total).  There was not 1 out of the 6 that I would ever want to order again.  Two main themes... under seasoned or strange flavors and little hard burnt bits in almost everything.  The only thing that I thought was passable was the chips and salsa.  Although, after reading other reviews, the question has to be asked... what does this place have against seasoning their food?  And, who are these people who are recommending this place as having great food.  Again it it's a shame that with a great location presentation and atmosphere they could not produce a quality dish."}
{"text":"Number one happy hour spot in Gilbert, no contest!  There are quite a few drink choices on sale as well as tacos.  We loved the assortment of salsas available as well.  This is a great place to go on a spring day when they have the huge windows open."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night, when the wait is 20+ minutes. We sat at the bar, and we're immediately greeted with a friendly hello. The drinks came pronto. The Joyride margarita was yummy (and strong). The prickly pear margarita was a little too sweet. We were seated in 20 minutes, and once again received a friendly greeting and fast service. The tacos are amazing. The abodada taco was our favorite. Chandler and Tim both came to our table, just to check on things. The great service & yummy tacos makes this place an A+ in our book."}
{"text":"This restaurant group always gets it right.  From the decor, to the food, to the cocktails it's just perfection.  Check out their other concepts at The Windsor, Churn, Postino, and Federal Pizza- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came for taco tues.  If you want to get in and out within 2 hrs do not come to this resturant. There is no parking ever available for that area.  We waited an 1 1/2 for a table.  Server was slow.  Service was very slow.  We asked for a refill of tea and soda and it took a 1/2 hr to get.  We had to ask 3 times for hot salsa.  The server was not that busy and could of showed a little bit of customer service.  We waited an hour for $2 tacos.  They obviously need help in training their staff on customer service.  This was my 2nd time doing taco tues and will not be back.  Go somewhere else.  Just the parking stress is not worth this resturant."}
{"text":"This restaurant, like the ones next to it (Postino, Liberty Market, etc.), is super hip. The decor is very bright and California beach house-y. I came here with a few friends, and we had a great time. 

Free chips and salsa, and we got two refills while we were there. We also ordered some chicken quesadillas to share. The waiter brought us carne by mistake, but we started eating it anyway, figuring it wasn't a big deal. Then he came by with the chicken, apologizing and saying it was on the house, which was pretty awesome. 

The two orders of quesadillas plus the seemingly endless chips and salsa left me feeling pretty full, but I still managed to eat the two tacos I ordered. One friend ordered a burrito and another ordered the enchiladas. We all thought the food was good, and priced decently for the atmosphere you get."}
{"text":"Love this place! I went in when it wasn't as busy on a Thursday. Ordered a burrito per my server's recommendation and it was HUGE and very good. I'm quite surprised I finished it, actually. Also the margaritas were great. I gotta make it there on a Tuesday, however, to catch their $5 margaritas and $2 tacos although I've heard it's very packed and there would probably be a wait time. Also, the server (Daphne) was super charismatic and made eating here a pleasant experience. Will definitely make it here again."}
{"text":"Was a little turned off by the snobby hipster waiter serving us drinks while we were waiting an hour for a table but a friendly young lady helped,  and ultimately the wait staff and Food made up for the bad wait.  The drinks were refreshing and different,  we had a mix of quesadillas and guacamole appetizers,  both delicious and the fish and carne asada tacos were delicious and filling.  My next visit will be earlier to cash in on the happy hour specials, I will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great vibe!

Can't wait to get some more Short Rib Tacos and Orange Cucumber salad appetizer. It would be 5 stars but the service was attentive but slow and confused (I think they had to many staff people) but that I know will improve with time. I can't wait to try other dishes and drinks. The menu looks TASTY.  The decor was great and comfortable. 

It was hard to identify employees from customers since they don't have anything on to identify them as an employee.  

I can't wait for it to cool down and be able to sit outside.  Looks really nice out there."}
{"text":"Street tacos + hipster vibe = super popular place 
Did it live up to the hype? Weeelll, it was good but not great. The restaurant itself and the service partially make up for the food (more on that later). The decor and ambiance are fun. The wait staff was very nice and extremely prompt in their service: taking our orders, refilling drinks, bringing the check, etc. That's especially impressive as we went on Taco Tuesday when it's supposedly busier. We got there around 5 and were seated immediately. They were still seating immediately at 5:45 when we left. 

The music was too loud, though at least it wasn't terrible music. The main issue is that with the music that loud, you almost have to yell to be heard by your dinner companions, which makes the restaurant twice as loud. I will never understand why restaurants think you come to listen to their mundane background music. If it's a live band, okay. Otherwise, you obviously want to talk to (not shout at) whomever you're having dinner with. (Rant concluded.)

As for the food, they're small street tacos in thick, almost pita-thickness, flour tortillas. The Standard was the best of the four we tried. It was pretty good, but not amazing. The Carnitas was good once we divested it of all the fatty gristle, but it seems like they don't choose their meat for that particularly well. All-in-all, I've had better tacos for a cheaper price. Still, I was okay with paying $2 apiece for these, but I would not pay any more than that (so only going during happy hour or on Tuesdays). We also had the churros with chocolate dipping sauce--that was very good. Nice quality churros and creamy delicious chocolate. So a very nice dining experience (5 stars) + not bad food (3 stars) = 4 stars overall"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Simply the best Mexican food in midtown. Bartender knew how to make a great cocktail."}
{"text":"First off - their margaritas are on point. Secondly, who doesn't love bottomless chips and salsa. Other than astronomical wait times on Taco Tuesday's, usually the wait isn't too bad. They have a convenient text message based waiting list/app which is helpful. One Busser in particular is AMAZINGLY INCREDIBLE at always keeping my water full (I drink a lot of water). If you're part of the world that's okay paying more than $3 on a taco - you need to try their delicious creations!! Free side with 3 or more tacos too I believe- which is also a nice way to have a full meal. It looks cool, it is cool, and they take good care of you! 

Good drink prices for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I have not been to this restaurant however I am leaving a review for their crappy customer service. I am from CA and will be heading to AZ for a jiu jitsu tournament this weekend. We do go with our whole team and we work the tournament so there is a pretty big party of people. I emailed this business almost 2 WEEKS ago asking for a reservation. As Im sure you can tell by my stars they never returned my email so I called today and guess who is now all booked up and can not make another reservation. Now, I can come and wait probably 2 hours according to the manager I spoke with. To bad, we come here every year for the tournament guess a yearly 20-50 people party doesnt interest them. They're busy enough smh. Thankfully Mi Patio saved the day and who could go wrong with $1.99 margaritas all day everyday!!"}
{"text":"First impression looking for this restaurant wasn't that great - half of the lights on the sign were out. I'm glad we stayed to try it out though! The staff was friendly upon arrival, and we were sat immediately. The decorations were very modern and I noticed that the left wall could open up to include the patio as part of the restaurant, which was pretty cool. Seems to be a great spot for lunch especially during nice weather. The salsa was different and I remember it having a bit of spice to it, which I love. I only wish the portion size could have been bigger! Not that we left hungry. We ordered the nachos as an appetizer and almost filled up on that. They were very good and fresh. I'm not sure what it was, but the green salsa on top tied everything together for me although all of the ingredients had a lot of flavor. We also ordered a fish taco al a carte and the Bandit Taco platter. Both were very good, although nothing in particular is jumping to my memory. Overall, very good experience I will definitely be back to try the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"The salsa that came with the chips was too spicy so I asked if they have a milder salsa. The waitress said they have some pico that was milder a brought some out. However, there was a $2 charge for the pico and we weren't told.  They removed the pico charge upon my request. I wanted a taco salid but they didn't have one on the menu so I had nachos with added chicken. The chicken was spongy and didn't seem to be real chicken chunks. The cheese was a white sauce and not flavorful so the nachos were bland. The service was fine."}
{"text":"Went to Joyride for the first time with a couple of friends last Friday for happy hour and had a wonderful time. It is a unique and hidden gem nestled between Postino's and Federal Pizza. The food and service was amazing and I enjoyed all of the food and drink recommendations made by the servers. I definitely recommend the pineapple agua Fresca with vodka added, the chicken burrito, and the bottomless chips and salsa (the chips are a little salty, but can be easily washed down with a agua Fresca or another one of their tasty beverages!)

 All of the servers made us feel welcome, wanted, and appreciated. I plan on returning again soon for another happy hour with friends!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy margaritas. Oh my goodness, we spend $25 just for drinks ($5 each) hahaha. They don't skimp on alcohol or flavor in the drinks. The tacos are great, but seem a bit small, especially when they're full price ($3.50-$4.50). Although, the sides are huge and hearty! Your pocketbook will thank you if you come in when the tacos are $2 though. They really do have great service here, everyone was eager to help us. No one said \"this isn't my section/table/job\". I've been here before and I'm sure I'll come back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The food is outstanding! Everything my wife and I had was wonderful and full of flavor. The beast burrito is a true \"beast\" so bring your appetite for that one. Drinks are new and very good. Let them help you pick a good one. The atmosphere was great and they play some really good tunes. Of course you have to like old hair bands to dig the tunes. We will be back to this place again and again."}
{"text":"1 star because I can't put zero!! Not worth the price nor the experience. Staff is mostly rude and really don't want to be there, management on this place is practically non existent just by noticing how the staff behaves. The bartender we had was the worst, we ordered some drinks at the bar to celebrate my wife's birthday and he starts to ask questions, if we've been drinking previously. No, we where having a good time laughing and celebrating, he decides to just serve us juice and charge us for the alcohol! I don't know if he thought we were idiots, being rude and disrespectful was the tipping point. I'm surely never going back and I recommend everyone to stay away from that place. Thank you for ruining our night I hope it was worth it! A business that supports that kind of behavior, discriminating and judgmental against customers, they definitely don't deserve even one star."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday!! $2 tacos full of flavor! We ordered a Veggie, Carne Asada, Crispy Fish & Baja Fish - all awesome! Excellent service. Used app to check in & were seated quickly."}
{"text":"Went to Joy Ride today and was disappointed. The service was wonderful and attentive but the ceviche did not really have much shrimp and the tacos were light in filling. The ceviche had maybe 2 shrimp for 12.5 not a great value. However, the shrimp that we did try was seasoned well and tasted great. The carne asada taco again, great flavor little meat. I began to wonder today with the lunch specials that they offer are they skimping other places? Bummer... Joy ride is one of my favorites places to go. I love the funky atmosphere and food but it not really living up to my experiences there. I hope that in the future they get back to where they used to be fusing all aspects of dining: great atmosphere, great tasting food and providing a great to good value."}
{"text":"I am loving this place and am already excited to go back to try more!

It is right across the street from Postino's, which is one of our faves. The night we went here, we literally tossed a coin to see which restaurant we should go to, and Joyride won. I'm so glad we went because I was very pleasantly surprised as soon as I walked in the door. The decor, colors, lighting were all fabulously 1960's style, but strangely enough has a very clean modern feel to it as well.
We were seated in a booth which looked out on the welcoming patio with a fireplace.
I ordered one of the freshly infused waters and the enchiladas and the bf ordered the machaca burrito. After downing our delicious chips & salsa, our food came and the presentation was (almost) as delicious as it tasted.
I am an enchilada fiend and order them almost every time at a Mexican restaurant. I loved that half was drenched in mole sauce, the other half in verde salsa. I wasn't a huge fan of the verde sauce, I have to admit. It was a little too thick and peppery. 
My boyfriend's burrito came cut into two halves and was delicious!

We will be back for sure. Their happy hour and lunch specials look great."}
{"text":"Been to Joyride Tacos a few times and haven't been disappointed yet! They have deals on tacos during lunch so be sure to ask about them, realized after we had started ordering a couple different tacos and she mentioned that there was a lunch deal so we opted for that! Also has a great atmosphere to meet up and hang with friends!"}
{"text":"Recommended by friends, first experience wasn't great.  Will try again to compare.  Service was ok, messed up some orders.  Seemed to have a good atmosphere.  Hopefully we caught it on a bad night."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout for 8 people at 4:45pm on a Wednesday, well before the dinner rush. We were instructed to please give them a day's notice in the future for such a large order. I'll repeat... 8 people. We weren't feeding an army. It took almost 2 hours to get the food, and they didn't sort anything, because \"it takes too long.\" You had 2 hours... plenty of time to sort food. Not to mention... You're making tacos. It's not some delicacy that takes a long time to create. What would have happened if all 8 of us had come to the restaurant to dine in? Would we have been asked to come back tomorrow? Would they not have given each of us our own plate with our orders on it? It's not hard to put together an order for 8 people, I've done it. As a former restaurant manager, I would have had a nice talk with my staff for something like this. They must hate revenue, and not fully grasp the concept that big tickets are good for their bottom line (not that $175 should be considered a big ticket). Their food is good, but they should work on the service."}
{"text":"We visited here with a group of three and even though it was lunch time and busy we got sat quite quickly! The chips and salsa was very impressive however you do have to pay for the second round! The prices were a little high but for the amount of food on each plate you get your money's worth! I had two tacos and with the two orders chips and salsa I was more than full! My friends got the burritos and ended up having left overs for atleast a day or two! The food was about a 7 out of 10!"}
{"text":"I came here by myself on a Wednesday night because I had a gift card.  I forgot how much I like this place!  The tacos are really big for the price and all three were delicious- especially the standard which I expected to like the least but it was actually my favorite!  And they have free chips and salsa!  I find all these places that charge for chips and salsa are just lame.  For a side I had the cucumber Mandarin oranges salad which was light and delicious.  Combine the good food with a cool ambiance, fast service and a cold beer and you've got a winning combination."}
{"text":"This is a fun, colorful place for drinks or dinner. We've been here several times now and can say that the food is consistently great and the service is excellent. Try the blood orange margaritas!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight.  I love that they are open late, serve coke products,  have a fun atmosphere and decor and the service was great.  

Our server suggested the nachos as an appetizer... which was absolutely terrific.  For dinner,  we took his suggestion and ordered the taco sampler plate, which had rice ans beans with carne asada, carnitas and Chicken.  I have to say my favorite was the carnitas,  I will for sure order that or the carne adada next time.  

I also ordered the corn, omg this was delish.... something really worth ordering.  

We will for sure be visiting this place again,  a new favorite."}
{"text":"Joyride taco house ! first time going there earlier this morning when they opened at 11AM and I was so impressed with how busy it was right when they opened up that meant a good sign. Every single employee we're super friendly & made sure everything was good. I ordered the quesadilla, crispy fish taco & carne asada taco and let me tell you they were so DELICIOUS. Ever since I moved down here a year ago I couldn't find a good Mexican food place and well this was super good Mexican food! Salsa and chips for free we're spot on! love love love this place! Highly recommend and also the set up in the place is super relaxed and just a really hang out spot too as well"}
{"text":"Update: I'm not going to do an entire review, as I previously reviewed Joyride. Instead, I'm going to update it and review what I think is the more typical experience here. The last visit I had, we waited for way too long to get our receipt, and it really soured an otherwise pleasant visit. This time, the service was very attentive, and we all had a great time. The tacos were all quite tasty, just like the last time. The chicken burrito was excellent. The guacamole is tasty--with chunks, just like I like it.

The one item that I tried this time that was entirely new was the orange cucumber salad side. It was absolutely fantastic! It had a nice fresh taste to it, and it went great with the other flavors in the meal. Good stuff.

I'm glad that I gave this place another try.

Old review: Pretty tasty food, fun environment, really odd experience overall.

So this was my first trip to Joyride Taco House, and it was a rather odd experience, service-wise. I'll get to that after mentioning the food first.

The setting is pretty fun. It's right in the middle of Gilbert's \"main street\". The big side doors open for a nice open, airy experience. When the weather is nice, it's a perfect setting.

The chips and salsa came out first. These chips are better than most out there--a little thick, with some good flavor. And the salsa, though not particularly spicy, is really good stuff. My date told me that the guacamole is excellent--I'll have to try it another time.

We shared the chicken burrito and a couple of tacos--the pork adovada and the chicken. The burrito was excellent! There are a ton of items in that burrito, and the combination of all of them was really good. The sauce provided added some nice extra flavor as well. I must say that quantity-wise, this is a pretty small burrito. If I ordered this as my full meal, I'd probably have been a bit disappointed. Fortunately, I had 2 other tacos. The tacos were decent. The pork was disappointingly bland, though. I'm not sure what happened with it, but it just didn't do it for me. The chicken was really solid. I'll come back to try some of the other tacos.

So the odd part of the experience. We sat at the table for over 3 hours, and not a single person ever asked us if we wanted our check. Now, this normally would be grounds for a really low rating in my book, but I am considering the situation in its entirety. We were having a lot of fun talking, and that was likely apparent to others. Maybe they were just respecting our having a conversation. But still, not a single person asked us if we wanted our check, and at some point, they seemed to completely forget about us. We'd have left earlier if somebody had come and asked us, but because nobody did and we weren't in a rush, we just kept talking. When we finally had to leave, I walked up to the bar, because we couldn't find our server. A manager saw me and asked me if I wanted the check. So we got it and finally left.

Good food, good setting. And I'll give the service another chance in the future."}
{"text":"Love Joyride! Great atmosphere, great food, great service. This is a fun date-night kind of place or good to go with a small group as well. The fish tacos are delicious, their beet salad is exceptional as well. I wanted to love the tortilla soup but sadly was disappointed with that, but this place is a Taco House, and they do tacos well so that's alright with me! My husband loves their burritos, and their agua frescas are delicious. Get the strawberry one and add Malibu Rum...you won't be disappointed! :) Update: they took all their Ahi Tuna dishes off the menu (appetizers, tacos), which was my favorite thing to order there sometime last year. Haven't been back as frequently and hoping they bring those dishes back! They were awesome!"}
{"text":"We tried joy ride a few weeks ago during happy hour - the prices were great -  the atmosphere is great - we will be back -"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, and amazing service! Any place with free chips and salsa is a keeper in my book! I love street tacos and I plan on loving them from
Joyride more often!!! Mmm mmm delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I love the tacos at Joyride Taco House. They are fantastic. I've been here multiple times and we happened to pop in on a Tuesday. $2 tacos. Yummy. 
I didn't see hard shell tacos on the menu. If you don't have them please add them so I can come here more often and bring my kids. For now it is my yummy lunch place."}
{"text":"This is a cumulative review of about a dozen different experiences I've had at Joyride.

The food is fantastic. The bartenders are talented. The customer service and management is awesome. In one particular instance, I screwed up my own order by not realizing it had beans on it. Totally my fault. Not only did the manager replace it, he didn't charge me for it either. These guys understand customer service and how to present an experience.

I'd say my only criticism is not something I can really hold against them, they've very popular so there can be quite a wait sometimes during peak times. We try to visit at off-peak times. But again, I can't begrudge them for their own success, so I'll still give them five stars."}
{"text":"1st time here got in time for their taco happy hour. Must try! The tacos are packed with goodness and half the regular price! Get in before 6pm for it. The atmosphere is also fun and bright and they have a nice patio. Not only did we get tacos but we started the meal with nachos. For the future you may just want to order that as a meal. It is huge and packed to the gill with cheese, veggies and what ever protein you may want. 

I happily recommend checking this place out for great ambience and food!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The restaurant was nice and clean and the decor was really unique! The food was awesome, I had the crispy fish tacos and 1 veggie taco. The veggie wasn't my favorite to be honest but everything else about this place was on point!"}
{"text":"Can I give this place 0 stars?  I'm not normally a spiteful or upset person about poor service, but goddamn did this place really set the bar low.  Chips and salsa are great when they give it to you because your food is gonna take a minute and it's gonna taste so good.  Nope.  Neither.  Vegan?  Nope, nice try.  They gave my girlfriend a plate a vegetable slop and told us the rice was no longer vegan.  They really tried to make it right, and I commend them for doing that...but ultimately this place is a terrible mess and definitely not worth checking out with all the delicious choices in town.  Awful.  Just awful."}
{"text":"Lady who sat me at the bar for my take out placing was nice. Another lady swung by giving me a water and chips and salsa! I said oh, I'm ordering to go. She's like, I know. And I'm like, oh.

LoL okay. Chips and salsa are my favorite food so that was nice. The guy who took my order....I saw the face you made as you walked away.  -_-

Nachos: Asked chicken or carnitas, he suggested half and half.  Okay. Chicken was delicious, dug out the carnitas after two bites, didn't care for it. Suggestion, don't add the meat, doesn't need it. 

Mexican Corn: Do It!!!!

Mo's dessert: Saved for later and was okay. Mayhap better eaten right away...

FYI, to go order I got chips and salsa. If I had known that, I wouldn't have ordered the nachos. Ate these the next day, chips started to go stale but the salsa was better cold. I'm not a fan of the dark red salsa. But yum!!

Side note : the chips and salsa young lady was super nice while I waited. We bonded over yoga, recommended the Bikram Yoga Phoenix down the street. Welcome to Phoenix Alaska girl. :)"}
{"text":"Gave it two tries with a few months in between. You're all on your own.

FYI, the extra STAR is for great service.

Here's the latest:  I took the afternoon off. Darcie and I were strolling DT Gilbert and decided to stop in Joyride. My drink was refreshing. My wife, Darcie, beautiful company. The service was exceptional, no complaints there at all. The food however, lacking, dry and unappealing. This is a Style over Substance establishment. There's a market for that. If you like trendy over tasty this is your place. For me, I'm always surprised places like this survive more than a 12 or 18 months.

If you have seen my other reviews, you know I invest some time to represent the experience.

Joyride does not warrant that investment from me. Just not my place. Wish it was, but no."}
{"text":"Game changer.

Gilbert has long awaited a place as cool and classy as this. Extremely well crafted cocktails, imaginative desserts, and delicious food. Despite the stress of a brand new restaurant immediately flooded by 100's of customers, Joyride held up extremely well. 

Drinks were served in regular fashion. Mike, the bartender, and Chris, also a bartender, served Mazaltan Mules with short delay. What ever wait we had, the taste, texture, and payload of the drink more than made up for it. We also tried the Agua Fresca's.... yum. Fruity with a kick.

I am delighted. 

Lauren, the manager of Joyride, was on point without being in the face of her staff. She genuinely cares about her restaurant. I know sometimes new places get a bad rap here on yelp when they begin as they work out the bumps. I urge you to speak with her prior to giving anything less than a 4. She's pretty real. 

Thank you, Joyride. Thank you. I will be back... lots."}
{"text":"Let's go on a Joyride! There was a time that I tried to get on this ride for dinner, but there was an hour wait! I thought, \"Seriously? Is this ride worth it?\"

I came for lunch the other day and luckily, there was no wait (a big sigh of relief). The restaurant was so freaken cute! We were given complimentary chips - and the chips weren't too bad. I am a little picky on the types of chips I get at restaurants. 

The guacamole had sea salt on it - my preference is that they can do without it. You can order three tacos, and get a free side. However, I opted to get two tacos only - the shrimp and the carne asada tacos. They were yummy. 

Now I can see why this \"ride\" is a \"joyride\" - great trendy atmosphere, ambiance, vibe, and good food.

I would definitely ride this ride again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and some of the best service we've had in a while. The chilaquiles were perfect! The bartenders were accommodating and on point with our every request. Simply put, great job we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Tried out this restaurant the other night and it was amazing to be honest. My favorite food is tacos so im very picky when it comes to trying out new taco places. First of all it was great service, our waitress was very nice and welcoming. She was also very consistent and she recommended that I try the chicken tinga tacos so I ordered two of those and i also ordered 2 braised beef tacos and they were soo good! The food came out very fresh and the meat was nice and tender. Honestly, better than I expected! I will definitely be going back and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone craving delicious tacos! Btw the food isn't too pricey at all, but the drinks are!"}
{"text":"Returned here because the manager reached out to me. I can respect an establishment trying to make things right. 

Our second visit here was much better. We sat inside and it was less busy so maybe that had something to do with it. Tacos were good as they were before. I stayed away from the ceviche because no matter how you slice it that is still overpriced. The beer during happy hour was a good deal. $5 for 32oz. Service was acceptable, but still strange with 4 different people serving our party of 7. Because you have so many people serving you, no one really takes the time to offer some personality or really show some care. It's just a person taking your order and another person bringing your food."}
{"text":"I have to say I love the decor and the concept. Beyond that I wasn't impressed.

My friend and I stopped in for lunch. We sat at the bar and were the only ones there. The place seemed to be very understaffed as the bartender was running all over the restaurant. So, it took awhile to actually order our food. 

Our food was just okay. It wasn't anything that I would seek out again. The best part of my meal would be the shrimp taco. When we finished out meal we waited a good 30 minutes before I was able to flag someone down to get our check. I was a little surprised to get charged an extra $4 for a refill on chips and salsa (my friend had asked for a hotter salsa and more chips). I guess I've never been charged at a Mexican restaurant for chips and salsa.

It sounds like from the other reviews that Tuesdays may be worth stopping in, otherwise there are to many great Mexican restaurants in town to bother."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I first heard about Joyride Taco House, we decided that the next time we had a taste for fresh Mexican, we were making it our destination - which is what we did last night.

When we walked in, we were seated right away. Iced water, chips & salsa were brought to our table immediately. We had a server and then some!  Throughout the night, all of the servers helped each another!! Every server that walked by our table either filled our water glasses, offered to get us a drink, picked up dishes, asked if there was anything we needed, etc.  At the sake of sounding like a cheesy cliche, the place ran like a well-oiled machine - but a personable, outgoing, happy well-oiled machine! I've never experienced anything like it, I was almost dumbfounded, but very pleased.  The way the servers - from bar staff to kitchen staff to floor staff - worked together, had a positive effect on the atmosphere of the whole restaurant. I would go back for that alone. But we were hungry and were anxious to try the food as well! 

Next in my review: The decor!  Retro! Bright and clean with very comfy chairs. The bathrooms are spacious, private and spotlessly clean. I laughed and told my boyfriend about not wanting to come back out into the restaurant because the ambiance of the bathroom made me want to stay in there and meditate. haha  

Before looking at the menu, we ordered drinks. I had a Classic Margarita, and after tasting a couple beers, my boyfriend had a small pitcher of beer. Their Happy Hour prices made us happy.  

Now, the food! The food was excellent, but of course, we could only eat so much, so we'll have to come back until we've tried it all!  I had the Veggie & Goat Cheese Enchilada. It came covered half in a green salsa sauce and half in a brown (mole-type) sauce.  The fresh veggies inside the Enchilada were chopped into bite sized pieces, and tasted delicious. The brown sauce was very spicy/hot for my taste. A server offered some Crème fraîche to tone down the heat, which definitely helped. (I would suggest that the menu states that the brown sauce is hot OR that the server states the fact, offering the option for only the green sauce.)  I loved the Enchilada and next time will have it with just the green sauce. My boyfriend had beef tamales that came with rice and beans - and not a drop was left on his plate. Everything from the chips & salsa, to our entrés tasted fresh and delicious.

From our first visit/experience, we were very impressed and will come back  to try other items on the menu - and/or Happy Hour appetizers and drinks at the bar. They do have an outdoor patio with misters, which we would be willing to try on summer nights.  

Good job, Owner & Manger!  

I wanted to leave this part out of the main review. If there is ONE thing I would offer as a possible change, it would  be this:  The servers are allowed casual dress, which I like, and adds to the casual, relaxed atmosphere of the place. I would only suggest that there be something that stands the servers apart from the customers - such as all black shirts  OR Hawaiian shirts OR something similar for the men - and maybe all black  or black & white attire for the women?    It really doesn't take long to figure out who the servers are - they are the ones who are constantly on the move and taking care of every customer in the place.  Keeping a casual dress style for the servers with some kind of consistent theme is only a suggestion.  We love Joyride Taco House and we will be back!

{"text":"I love this place, we went yesterday and had tacos. They were great! We also liked the Happy hour specials! Going back again today with friends."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night, service was terrible and it wasn't even busy. I tried to order to a mango margarita and was told that they didn't have those on the menu anymore. What!? You have margaritas and mango syrup and you can't make a mango margarita? So I order a soda and it took 10 minutes to get that. I ordered the Carne Asada tacos and it was dry and there was more onion than beef in it. Needless to say won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place. But will miss the outdoor seating area. The margaritas and shrimp taco's are my favorite!! The cucumbers salad is so refreshing. The atmosphere is seriously cool."}
{"text":"If you leave this place and don't try their corn then you didn't get the full joyride experience! I can honestly come here just for the corn on the cob and be completely satisfied! In addition to that the margaritas are delicious no matter what flavor you get! Their happy hour is my favorite yet. Unfortunately, I'm just not a fan of the tacos but I would still keep coming back for the drinks!"}
{"text":"The tacos are 3.50 EACH, they are very very small like street tacos.. which cost 99 cents. The fish taco was very bland, the pork was tasty but its like having a bite of a taco. The service was ok but slow."}
{"text":"Tacos were quite tasty but the price is high for the tiny portions.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Best Taco Tuesday ever!  I tried three different tacos, the Standard, the Crispy Fish, and the Pork Abadobo.  All were great!  Some spicy, some with crunchy slaw, fresh avocado, and just the right balance of flavors.  Impressive beer list.  I had a Deshuttes Black Butte; paired nicely with the spicy tacos.  Service was outstanding; only waited about 10 minutes for a table for two.   Packed house.  Family friendly but great tunes playing as well.  Heated patios.  Loved it.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"These tacos are like the first time you eat pop rocks.... you can't believe the flavor packed into these tacos. 

I hate waiting and the bar can add a lot more stools for those waiting can sit and wait at the bar. 

5 stars because the food is AMAZINGLY GOOD and the margaritas are on point!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about the staff's and management's friendliness, hospitality and overall awesomeness. I came in today with a friend and not only were the food/drinks on point. Jeremy, the bartender, was super cool and chatted with us a bit but also gave us the silent service he saw we were enjoying while we chatted and talked over food and drinks. He did a perfect job and made our visit very enjoyable.  Tacos and cucumber margaritas were amazing!"}
{"text":"If you love Postinos, Federal and Windsor you with LOVE LOVE this place.  On our way to Postino's for lunch on Saturday we saw this huge crowd at a new place across the street and decided to try it.  Everything was delicious, especially the blood orange margarita and the service was great.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"So I had high expectations because I'm such a fan of Postinos, and I probably hyped it up too much in my mind...

Cute, stylish decor, as expected. We opted to sit on the patio (unfortunately) because it was an hour wait for an inside table. It wasn't too bad because they have misters.

We were served water and chips and salsa right away. Thank god because I was starving! I really liked the salsa. Not a big fan of the chips though. Too thick for my taste.

I got the cucumber mint aqua fresca and OMG...it was SO good! It sucked it down so fast! Our dining companions got the pineapple and said it was too sweet.

And since it was our first time at the taco house, we got tacos. The carne asada, baja fish, shrimp, and fried fish. They were all so so good! Carne asada was so flavorful and the meat was really tender. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of shrimp.  I was disappointed that there was such a small amount of fish in the fish tacos, but they were delicious. I was really pleased with the food. In fact, I usually take pics but we dove right in and they were gone before I got a chance!

Where they lose 2 stars for me is that I feel it is overpriced and I received lackluster service. Which is weird because I don't think Postinos is overpriced. But really, $4 for ONE small taco? Come on! That's ridiculous.  Also, the service was, meh. Not friendly, indifferent really. It wasn't rude but it wasn't the great service I usually experience at Postinos, so I thought that was bizarre."}
{"text":"This place was good! Chips and salsa never bore me. Don't expect to get the authentic Mexican tacos from here. But the flavors were tasty, great combinations. Would definitely go back on a Tuesday. $2 tacos. One happy camper! :)"}
{"text":"Can we bring back traditional service please?!! This place had the potential to be a very nice experience but the service was terrible. They have decided to not assign a specific server to your table but rather have all staff chip in to order, clear tables, bring out food, like they do in Chinese restaurants, with disastrous results! Plates of grilled corn, soup, burritos kept coming to our table, no one knew who had what plate and being the large table we were, you can only imagine the havoc with constant unnecessary interruptions. It seemed like none of the tables were numbered as is usually the business model in most restaurants to help staff know which table to bring food to. It was amusing at first but awful, add to that I looked at my bill and was shocked to find out my regular priced margarita, at about an ice filled tumbler's worth cost 9 dollars each! Even paying for the bill was a tedious, the lady did not know who had what and had to go back and do the splitting all over again as we sat there for about 20 minutes just waiting to leave. The manager then came out after our bidding and apologized, and gave us a bunch of vouchers. Get it together people!"}
{"text":"Met up with my fellow Lyft drivers last night, 8/27/14. 
Probably close to 30 in our party. The staff didn't have any issues with a group this big. They were very attentive, cool, and quick with the orders.

Server recommended the nachos, they were awesome!!

The best part was the music. I don't know if they're using Pandora or Slacker but it was bad ass!

From what I heard we'll be having our meetings there weekly :-)"}
{"text":"Love coming here! The staff here is super friendly. They gave me free churros and chocolate for my birthday."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place.  I love their margaritas and that they can serve beer in a small pitcher.  Tacos are good but I hate when the tortillas are cold.  I've had the adobada, carne asada, carnitas, both fish tacos and the brisket... all good IMO, except when the tortillas are cold . But I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love everything Upwards Projects (Postino, Churn, Windsor, Federal Pizza) does, and Joyride is no different.

Over 3,000 square feet of space, patios in the front and back, garage doors on each side, colorful leather seats, eclectic art, and a hint of Baja created an overall relaxed destination for enjoying a modern twist on Mexican.  The music ranged from \"Eleanor Rigby\" by The Beatles to \"Little Red Corvette\" by Prince, which I loved.

We started with Aqua Frescas at the bar.  Almond Horchata spiked with Amaretto liqueur (nutty, sweet, hints of cinnamon, perfect) and a Cucumber Mint with vodka.  It was pulpy, sweet, and divine.  All of their juices are squeezed fresh daily and include pineapple, citrus, and strawberry.  A spike legend on the menu gives you recommendations on best spirits to combine with each. Non alcoholic is $3.5, with spirit $8 ($5 during HH).

As with any traditional Mexican restaurant, we received salsa and chips.  The fire roasted salsa and chips are complimentary, but other salsas are available for $2 or 3 for $5.  These are the tomatillo, guajillo pepita, pico gringo, chile de Arbol, and charred habanero.  The salsas were described as either \"kinda hot\" or \"melt your face\".

The tacos came on \"made to order\" corn tortillas served family style.  The presentation of the tacos was fantastic!  We tried the carne asada, the crispy as well as grilled fish, chicken tinga, and carnitas ranging from $3.50-4.50.

There were also four types of burritos such as \"The Beast\" with carne asada, Anasazi beans, avocado, fire roasted salads and pico gringo.

I enjoyed the Chicken Burrito with rotisserie chicken, avocado, pico gringo, and a white and creamy Aji Amarillo.  This also came with a garden variety mix of Cremini mushrooms, peppers, corn, and squash, which I skipped.

Overall, menu is fairly simple and straightforward, with some modern twists here and there."}
{"text":"Excellent service and even better food! If you're in the old town Gilbert area, you have to give this place a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Joy ride never disappoints! Great atmosphere, phenomenal food, and great drinks! On Saturdays they are in happy hour during the lunch hour, and the five dollar frescas are a must (the cucumber mint is my favorite!) The service is always friendly and fast, and the waiting area is a beautiful patio. We all got the tacos and loved them! Highly recommend the crispy fish :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a cool and unique atmosphere in a city full of Mexican restaurants. They have s great waiting area for when there is a rush, and provide chips and salsa for you while you wait. Drinks are pricey but FANTASTIC I got the cucumber mint fresca and it was amazing. My fiancé got the strawberry fresca and he liked his as well. I would stick to ordering the tacos on the menu, the standard and crunchy fish were our groups favorites. Best appetizer is the guacamole, it's handmade and very tasty! I wasn't a huge fan of the salsa they give with the chips, but you can order a different kind for 2 dollars so it's not too bad. Service is usually very friendly and very low key which is nice. The valet parking truly is complementary which is nice in a city where parking sucks. We're more likely to visit the gilbert location since we are in the east valley but if we lived closer we would come back frequently for sure!"}
{"text":"We were really let down when we came here. Went to celebrate a birthday this past Friday night, took 15 minutes to get waters and an additional 20 minutes for a margarita. The music was so loud I couldn't hear the person next to me. The food was average but took way too long for even a Friday night. Drinks were not refilled unless we flagged someone down. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Great taco shop!  Good food, drinks, and sides with excellent service. Set in the heart of downtown Gilbert, Joyride is a great take on street tacos.

We started with the free chips and salsa (second order only $2) and some ceviche. The size of the salsa and ceviche was small and wasn't enough for two people.

Ordered three different tacos and a side of cucumber orange salad.  All tacos were good and the salad was excellent.  We ordered the fish taco, but they were out of it. Guess I should have went down the street if I wanted fish tacos.

The drinks are probably Joyride's best menu choice. We had the Cucumber Mint Agua Fresca.  Definitely our best decision.

With all the wonderful choices in downtown Gilbert Joyride is a good eatery, better drinkery, with five star service.

Stop by if you're into chips, salsa, street tacos, and delicious drinks."}
{"text":"We eat and drink here at least once a week. 

Excellent margaritas - STRONG. 

Go on Taco Tuesday so you can get the STRONG margaritas for $5!

Veggie taco is a game changer. 

Mexican street corn is out of this world and the queso reminds me of Texas - where the best queso is found. 

Oh, and did I mention that the service is fantastic. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was seriously amazing! 

My friend and I went after work for Happy Hour and because we remembered their tacos at the Devoured festival. Our server Taryn was also super sweet and friendly, and answered all of our questions. I ended up getting the crispy fish taco, which turned out to be the best taco I've ever eaten! Also, because we got there before 4pm, we got to take part in their lunch special, (2 tacos and a small bowl of soup or salad for $10)!

I also got a $5 Mexican 75 cocktail and it was so good, I didn't even realize I'd had the whole thing in less than 5 minutes! 

Definitely added to my list of favorite places, and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's fun and fresh and appealing in every way.  This restaurant group is the best. Love love the tacos here and the beachy 70's California feel of this place and awesome service. Easy to share a meal with your spouse or friends because you can literally decide how much to get- how many tacos, what sides, etc."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch or afternoon cocktail and apps.  Food is outstanding, drinks were also quite nice.  HH til 5pm every day, means $5 cocktails, pitchers of beer and glasses of wine.  Local/seasonal beers featured on draft.  Interesting 'aquas frescas' cocktails can be ordered virgin, as well.  Love the building/setup.  Great patio to while away the weekend afternoon.  Glad it moved in, I'll be here frequently."}
{"text":"Neat atmosphere. Food?  Basically overpriced Chipotle. NO JOKE.  We were never served chips and salsa like everyone around us.  Ordered a Beast burrito bowl, wife ordered 3 tacos. There is nothing that separates the taste or style from Chipotle except the mustaches and hipster pants. First and last time here sadly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fun and vibrant...reminded us of Austin.  The tacos were a bit bland, but the margaritas were great!  Not sure if we would go back for the food, but the drinks and atmosphere were great!"}
{"text":"5 stars! (and I don't give that out often). First off, it's wonderful that this place has its own parking lot and doesn't charge valet. Makes it very convenient. My husband and I came here on Valentines for a date around 8 pm and got right in! The service was great from start to finish--very attentive, friendly folk. They give you free chips and salsa! I ordered 3 tacos: carnitas, carne asada, and crispy fish. I don't know which was the carne asada vs the carnitas.  They were both good, but one of them tasted like char grill - which is cool if you're into that flavor. I loooved the crispy fish taco and would get 3 of those next time instead lol. It had this really good sauce on it and fresh tasting cilantro and cabbage. It wasn't super fish, and I loved the crunch it had. My husband got a burrito that was so massive he took some home as leftovers. He loved it! My favorite part about Joyride, though, is the ambiance. It's sooo cool and retro and there are a lot of eclectic features to look around at! There's a fire place outside so I can imagine the patio scene will be LIT when the weather warms up! I'm totally craving another one of those crispy fish tacos right now and can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Cool ambience and good food. There were a couple issues with our order, but the server fixed them. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. I love the fact they have organic milk for the kids meal!!! I recommend the nachos and the braised beef. Choose black beans over pinto (normally I prefer pinto) and the fresh fish wasn't my favorite, fishy flavor."}
{"text":"Normally I love So Cal for fish tacos! Today they were very unprepared for the lunch crowd!!  Never have I waited so long for service! Someone simply stopping by our dirty table, introducing themselves and letting us know it would be a few minutes was obviously too much to ask for. We walked out and walked across the street to Joyride Taco House where we were greeted with a smile, and impeccable service even though they have a packed house as well."}
{"text":"I been to this  place couple of times now and I'm hook. Food is very good.  I enjoy happy hour on taco Tuesdays.  I recommend carnita tacos and roasted corn along with bloody orange margarita."}
{"text":"Holy cow!  I had the veggie chimichanga..... it was incredible.  The rest of the group I went with orders a variety of tacos.  Every single thing I tried was really good.  The service was a little on the slow side, but that is probably because the place was packed."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour they have. 5 for 5 special which means 5 dollar drinks till 5pm ., Everyday ..,,( Need I say more )"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my wife on our way to a 4th of July party. The entrance is kind of hard to find from the parking lot. But then again, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer. This place is much bigger than the one in Gilbert and from the looks of it much hipper too. The place has somewhat of a 70's discotheque feel to it but without the stale cigarette/alcohol smell. My wife had a strawberry agua fresca which was awesome. They bring chips and a roasted salsa to the table which is awesome. I ordered the chicken fila salad which was amazing. It's kale with jicama and crunchy green beans. Sounds weird but just do it and you won't be disappointed. My wife had the chicken tinga that was very good as well. Make sure you ask them for the green salsa. It really makes your plate. They have a patio outside that looks like it'd be awesome to sit in when the weather is nice. At the end of the day, the service was great which always goes a long way for me."}
{"text":"A-Mazing. Tasty house Marg, delicious pineapple mojito. The appetizer quesadilla with peppers and onions was great with the homemade guac. Dip the edges in their version of queso (we got sans chorizo). Enchilada red sauce is ridiculously good. The whole meal was excellent. Manager and staff were all super friendly. A+ all around."}
{"text":"The vibe is on point, however I wish I could say the same about the food. Very pricey for what you get. Food taste was fine, but I rather go somewhere else and eat. Not the best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Hip atmosphere, hip employees, hip music, hip location, mediocre food at Rockefeller prices.  Meh."}
{"text":"I walked in expecting amazing tasting authentic tacos but left with a stomach full of overpriced unauthentic tacos. The tacos were cold and not very tasty. However, the food and salsa was very fresh which was the only plus. I definitely wouldn't recommend this spot if you're looking for authentic tacos. However, if you're okay with a new, \"hip,\" modern twist on Mexican food then you'll enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I came 2 nights in a row while in Gilbert. I would give it more than 5 stars if i could! All food is made fresh on premises, you can tell!  Great service, great atmosphere, great prices, but most amazing food! The sweet mexican corn was my favorite.  You can also tell tortillas are homemade =)"}
{"text":"This place is really nice it has beautiful outside dinning and the food is pretty good especially if you're hungry on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Favorite little place to eat in downtown Gilbert (as of right now!). I haven't tried all the restaurants but we love the tacos and burritos here! The chips and salsa are complimentary and the margaritas are great! They also do $2 taco Tuesdays! Yum!"}
{"text":"Hipster atmosphere with tacos! Colorful, vivid environment! They have a taco Tuesday special which is inviting! No one particular item was my favorite, but there're options for everyone."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were good but small.  I cannot for the life of me figure out why these uppity taco places think they can charge $5 for a taco the size of my palm."}
{"text":"For a first time customer I was a little surprised and disappointed with my group of 6. We came at the beginning of happy hour (3PM) and sat on the patio. We ordered multiple appetizers, dessert, and multiple rounds of drinks. Our first round took 10 minutes and once the server saw us looking around she told us the bartender was short handed so drinks would be out soon. During our visit we had 4 different servers, one of them told us their name, and the others proceeded to help when they could. Once we received our tabs they were out of order and not correct. 

-I asked the server why we were continuing to get different people, she said we came at an awkward time so everyone will be taking care of us. I am not sure if that was an appropriate answer. 
-There was no visible manager on staff checking on tables.
-The server laid our checks down before we were even done, one of the girls said are you trying to make us leave? The server replied with no I'm just giving you your checks, sorry. (When do you drop checks if we still have half of a beer?) 

I do not plan on coming back any time soon due to the poor customer service and unfriendly staff. But thank you for good quality food and a great menu. Also, maybe consider getting beer that is allergy friendly."}
{"text":"surprised that their carne asada stood out to me. their carnitas was also good but asada took the show. has that charbroiled taste but tender and not too salty. went on taco tuesday and $2 a taco was soo cheap for the quality. nothing extra here, just simple done right ! will most def be back. service was prompt and please get the rumchata, ask for an extra shot though :)"}
{"text":"This is a staple for restaurants in Gilbert. A wonderful place to eat at if you are looking for a drink or just good food. I love the crispy fish tacos here and the salsa is amazing! I would rate this place 5 stars on a good day but sometimes the food can be a bit inconsistent."}
{"text":"I had the bandit plate, the corn tortilla's were tasteless and way too thick. The meat was ok, the rice was white and boring and the black bean barley had any cheese on them. They are the worst tacos I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"They recently changed their chips and salsa serving. They used to be bottomless. Now, if you want a refill, they charge you for it, which they politely explain to all customers when they bring them out. 

We still only come here for Taco Tuesday and/or Happy hour. It's always good to get fish tacos and a marg for pretty cheap; can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming atmosphere and attentive staff! I sat at the bar and they have very good specials! Not just happy hour but also 11-5 specials! Wish I lived in town so I could take advantage of the $5 pitchers of beer! Big Daddy IPA may just be a top 5 favorite!

11-5 special: 2 tacos and side for $9.75! Got the shrimp and standard taco. Shrimp didn't really have too much taste but the standard was amazing! Also tried the soup which was fantastic!!

Great spot to hang out. Will definitely be stopping by here again!"}
{"text":"Our second time at Joyride Taco and definitely not our last. Their food is very fresh, tacos are amazing! We ordered 3 tacos each, side of guacamole and we each had 3 margaritas.  Chips and salsa were also good and fresh. My only complaint would be that the Margaritas tasted a little watered down other than that everything else was wonderful! Highly recommend and would definitely return again with family and friends."}
{"text":"I went here with some girlfriends for a girls night out and our service was impeccable.  The menu is pretty small and I am a very picky eater, so I did have a bit of a hard time choosing something (which is why I am only giving it 3 stars), but I ended up with a cheese quesadilla and it was very good.  All in all it was a nice place with great service."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Hot looking customers. Great atmosphere.The staff went out if their way to please, I even got the phone number of our server... score!"}
{"text":"Visited Joyride on a Friday night for date night. Was immediately impressed by the decor and vibe. Seconds after being seated we were brought iced waters and chips with salsa. The chips and salsa were great, the salsa had just the right amount of spice and was very fresh. 

We were soon greeted by our server Justin, he was awesome. Made great drink recommendations including the pineapple mojito which I decided to go with, it was delicious! So refreshing! My fiancé went with the horchata with captain morgan, another suggestion from Justin and he was not disappointed.

For our meal we decided to get an array of tacos. We literally loved every one we tried. Out favorites included the ahi tuna, crispy fish and shrimp. They really all were great tho. 

Lastly, we ended the meal with the churros. They come with a chocolate dipping sauce however our server recommended getting the caramel sauce as well, good thing we did, the caramel was delicious. 

Long story short we will definitely be back and hope to see Justin again! Joyride was definitely a two thumbs up from us!!"}
{"text":"Great place to check off you're list in the Gilbert area. It can get quite busy with a 30-45min wait at times. So plan accordingly. I think the food is a TAD bit over priced as far as the quantity you get. Service and ambience is what this place is known for I think. I'm one of those super tall guys that can eat a lot. They don't have a crazy entre that fills me up completely. I go for what they have to offer though: The Beast Burrito. The 1st batch of Chips and Salsa are complimentary (they used to be all free though :/)"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday afternoon. 
Located in downtown are. Able to find street parking. 
Only about 2 other patrons. We were greeted and seated promptly.
They have a really good happy hour with $2 tacos and $5 margaritas and spiked agua frescas. Good selection of menu items. More of a tex-mex feel/taste. 
Blood orange margarita had a nice refreshing sweetness with just a bit of tang. Pretty strong. I was also offered to try the new citrus agua frescas which was great without alcohol but ah-mazing with Hangar citron vodka, cant go wrong with a $5 cocktail!
Fish Taco was crispy with fresh crisp veggies and garlicky white sauce in a fresh flour tortilla.
Carne asada was very tender and juicy, great fresh corn tortilla.
Black beans were great and a large portion for a side.
Although staff was very friendly, we had long wait periods waiting for food and additional drinks. There were very few patrons in the restaurant. We probably would have stayed for another round of drinks if service was more prompt."}
{"text":"expect terrible service, but amazing food. i honestly think they overwhelm the servers with too big of sections. i come back and back again for the cheese y mas, (which can be modified with no meat for vegetarians)! the crispy fish taco and the shrimp taco are my significant other's fa"}
{"text":"Wow.  What a great experience.  The four of us shared a dozen street tacos and every one was fantastic.  The fish were my favorite but I'd order any one off of the menu again.  The guacamole, salsa, and chips are top rate and you couldn't ask for a cuter location.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Tacos and Margaritas were great! But the staff that assisted us yet friendly seemed very unhappy as if they did not want to be there also didn't checkup on us often and took quite a while to get our drinks and simple stuff like silverware and chips& salsa."}
{"text":"I come here all the time . It's one of my favorite places. The decor is lovely and the music is always good. The food is delish but can be pricey. Happy hour is from 2-6 and I highly recommend going at that time. The nachos are amazing. The service at the bar can be hit or miss. They are always busy and they can tend to be inattentive."}
{"text":"Lol......well it hit 100 degrees and all the snowbirds are gone. So now i can go out to eat!! 
Good service.....water refills were on point 
Tacos were tastey along with great tasting free chips and salsa.
Had the beast burrito.......it was ok......refried beans in it....really?? 
For me ...,refried beans are the opposite of fresh mexican .

Made it out with a 25.00 bill for two, tip included.......by drinking water.
Alcohol has become a ridiculous waste of money and their beer , wine and drinks come at a premium. But....they do have happy hour prices.

If your going to eat and drink...expect  15.00- 20.00 + bucks a person .
Its the ultimate hipster hangout so expect music and hip people wearing hip clothing
To be buzzing around."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for almost 2 years. Keeps going downhill on service. They now charge for chips and salsa. Sort of seems like a hipster spot as of recent. The taco Tuesday and 2pm specials seem to always change depending on what server you have. Think this is our last time coming here which sucks cause it was our lunch spot for a while. Referring to the Gilbert location. The last 6 visits have gotten worse and worse in service. There's a taco shop across the street we're going to try. 

Just gave this place another try. Worse service than last time. No refills. Only offered one margarita then given the check. Food was decent at best. Asked to speak to a manager and he came over, looked about 16 years old and didn't seem to care that we had bad service the first time, tried it again, had even worse service. He said he'll try to do better and that was it. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Well...my review is 100% based on service, as my husband and I did not order food just drinks, however Gabriel was so welcoming and made us want to come back for dinner. We frequently stroll downtown Gilbert,  but we usually visit Postinos or other restaurant's in The area. We had our dog with us today and we were looking for a dog friendly place to stop and have a drink or two. So glad we stoped here the service was far beyond excellent. We will definitely return. Every single staff member made us feel like we were part of the FAM! GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"Decent street tacos on taco tuesday for $2 each. Corn tortillas are made fresh and pretty soft considering they are corn. Crispy fish taco was the best, carnitas and steak 2nd best. Nice space, indoor / outdoor."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. Downtown Gilbert has really needed a place that can make a good cocktail. The Mazaltan Mule and Pineapple Mojito are especially delicious. The food has been excellent. Wonderful tacos filled with very fresh fish or tender meat. The Rotisserie chicken is a very nice take on a classic American dinner. The staff is one of the shining points of this restaurant. All the bartenders are more than happy to serve up exotic libations with a smile.  joyride is a very welcome addition to downtown."}
{"text":"Son and I met my wife for lunch, so glad we chose Joyride! GREAT service and fantastic food, not much else to say. Wife and I tried burritos, one chicken and one \"Beast\" (carne asada). The boy had a Baja Fish taco and a \"Standard\" taco (chicken and a bunch of other good stuff!) Everything fresh and tasty! Overall fantastic experience, go there!"}
{"text":"Update: I'm now a full grown adult who has discovered Taco Tuesdays. You can get any taco (off a shortened list of their tacos) for $2, and their margaritas are $5. So now I complain less about their steep prices, because, hello, Taco Tuesday is where it's at and YAY! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Good tacos. Good margaritas. The horchata with amaretto is yummy. Get the Mexican street corn. Bomb."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks.  Great atmosphere.  The best chilaquiles I have found in the area!  The street tacos and fish taco are very good, too."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my sister and wanted to try this place out. We went at lunch time on a Saturday and the wait was short. We were seated outside which was nice because it wasn't too hot. We ordered fish tacos, shrimp tacos, a side of rice, and chilaquiles (with egg whites instead of sunny side up eggs). The food was delicious and was freshly made. The tortillas were homemade which I liked. The food was reasonably priced and the portions were a good size. I will definitely be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Ah this place is so good! We came on Saturday and they had happy hour till 5 which was awesome. I tried the spicy margarita.. I think it was cucumber/habanero? or maybe it was poblano.. cant keep those peppers straight. But any who, it was delish! I also got the three taco plate.. one shrimp, one carne asada, and a fish taco. SO GOOD! Will definitely be back :-)"}
{"text":"Cute, trendy new place. The food was so-so. The nachos were good and plentiful but the tacos were flavorless. There was a lot of ice in the drinks making the bill more expensive than it should be. The service was so-so - in fact it was slow and not so great at all. But it's really, really cute. I love the environment and would go there again for the nachos."}
{"text":"A good place to eat and drink. Love the decor and the vibe. The tacos are pretty tasty and the drinks are all on happy hour price before 5!"}
{"text":"Awesome location. They have a great establishment up and running. Ahi taco was very good. Staff was very helpful especially Troy."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and services, they were so friendly, the food was so delicious and tasty. Now i am writing i was wandering I wanted tacos again. 
I recommend this restaurant you won't be upset:)"}
{"text":"A great atmosphere and delicious food. My husband said he had the best burrito he has ever had and everyone else in our party got tacos and were quite pleased. Happy hour is a great deal with $5 margaritas that are strong. Would go back often if we lived there!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a chimi style burrito with some carne  It was bomb. Ever just want to get some tacos for the night, this a pretty good place."}
{"text":"I had been hearing great things about this place for quite some time. I checked it out on Yelp and the place looked promising. My husband and I had been longing for a date night for quite some time. We came here at around 4:30 on a Saturday. It was quite busy. Good sign? Not really. I'm quite confused as to why so many people gave it good reviews. We ordered the $10 cheese y mas appetizer. And it felt like dipping a chip into a nacho cheese gordita (sans the pita) from Taco Bell. Wtf??? Tacos are lackluster to say the least. Over priced and underdeveloped. I ordered 1 chicken tinga, 1 pork adobo, 1 braised beef. I couldn't distinguish the difference between the pork and beef tacos. Bland. Service was really slow and most of the staff seemed annoyed or in foul moods. I'll take my chances and stick to the taco food trucks. Cheaper and more flavorful. I suggest people check out La Santisima for a better version of trendier Mexican \"street tacos\". Won't be returning for sure."}
{"text":"The food and service are very good.  If the prices were about half of what they charge, I would give it 4 or 5 stars.  But, street tacos just shouldn't cost this much.  Last time there I had the chicken mole plate.  It was way too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get tacos in Phoenix. I would highly recommend trying the carne asada taco, the crispy fish taco and the street corn. Very decently priced, especially when you hit happy hour. I recommend this place frequently! Some items are a little pricey though, $8 for guac? Really"}
{"text":"I really love the experience at Joyride! The atmosphere is very fun, the decor is colorful and trendy, and there is a lot of patio seating! I'm a huge fan of their drinks, especially those on the $5 happy hour menu, and their tacos are pretty delicious too!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite happy hour location in Gilbert - you can't beat the specials. $5 pitchers of beer, $5 Margaritas, $5 Agua Frescas (before 5pm). Plus, they have taco tuesdays. The place gets busy for sure, but the staff has been great every time I've been in. 

The outdoor patio is spacious (and dog friendly!)."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Saturday night.  We had a large party and they were able to accommodate us quite quickly.  Everyone said their meal was delicious!  I had the ceviche which barely had any avocado in it.  The server was nice enough to get me a little extra.  My only complaint was that the drinks were overpriced.  9.75 for a margarita and 9 for a 5 oz glass of wine.  Those kind of prices you need to be using top shelf liquor and 9 oz wine pours."}
{"text":"I don't think that Joyrides aim to be authentic Mexican tacos and I don't mean that in a bad way. I just like to think of them as fancy tacos. Fancy because they put other stuff on their tacos that I wouldn't put on my tacos if I was making them or getting them from the taco truck outside of Charlie's gay bar. 

Nevertheless Joyride's tacos ARE good. I had the crispy fish tacos and I thought they were delicious and I definitely will going back again (but only on taco Tuesday). I ordered 3 crispy fish tacos, an alright prickly pair margarita, my bf got 5 carne asada tacos, and we got the Better than Betty dessert for $32. 

Our waitress was okay. It was really busy so maybe that's why I didn't like her service. There two other employees (one who I think was a manager) that stopped by and asked how our meal was and if we needed anything in a more genuine way than our waitress did."}
{"text":"This is our 1st time here. Wer family of 5. Everything is good , tacos r so good. N services is 5 star no doubt, but only thing i have complained is d price of Shrimp Ceviche is xpensive for that lil bowl itself. Oh well not gonna order that again for sure."}
{"text":"These tacos were delicious! Definitely check out taco Tuesday! Joyride does not disappoint on flavor."}
{"text":"We went to Joyride with some friends for Happy Hour on a Sunday afternoon.  Upward Projects does it again with this amazing place.  The layout and decor is done perfectly with no expense spared.  It is a fun joyful atmosphere that is lively by not too loud.  
Our waiter was very friendly and outgoing as he suggested drinks to our group.  I had the strawberry Aguas Freshcas with rum and my husband had the Mazatlan Mule.  We also shared the Better than Betty's chocolate dessert which was the perfect way to end Happy Hour.  I am sure we will be back for Happy Hour and maybe try out some more of the food next time too."}
{"text":"The food is not bad.  The place is very loud and it is hard to hold a conversation while eating.  The staff seems to me is pretentious, like they are doing you a favor by tending on you (or it could have been the person that waited on us).  I might go back to it in a few months..."}
{"text":"Fun place!!  Great atmosphere and being downtown Gilbert makes it a great location!  Warning though - you will most likely have quite a wait!"}
{"text":"After all the hype, Taco Tuesday was a let down primarily due to the service. They have the same happy hour every day of the week from 2pm - 6pm; special $2 taco selections and $5 drinks. 

We arrived just after 5 pm and were told a 30 minute wait (it was busy). We were told that the patio seating would move faster, so we opted for that and were sat within 10 minutes...YAY!

It took a while for our server to take our initial order; we ordered both our drinks and tacos at that time. Sadly after about 15 minutes, we still didn't have drinks yet our food was arriving. Halfway through our meal our drinks FINALLY arrived. 

We wanted to order another round of drinks, yet we couldn't flag anyone down from the staff. Guess that was our queue to leave.

While I understand that flies outside on a patio can't be avoided, not bussing a table is something they can easily do to keep them at bay. We ended up waiting 25 minutes after we were done eating/drinking before our final bill arrived...all the while shooing flies away from our table as our plates were never cleared. We finally moved the plates to an empty table that freed up next to us.  At one time we counted 12 flies sitting on one of our bowls. GROSS!

While the food was average, the service from ordering to drink delivery and clean-up was disappointing. The portions were average for the $2 price point, but I would be disappointed if I were to pay full price for the amount of meat that was on each item."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Joyride after working a booth at the Gilbert Art Walk.  Awesome food but staff was just wonderful.  I think we met everyone.  there was a minor (very minor) issue and everyone went so far out of their way to make up, it was very generous.  Our drinks were never empty
and again the food was just awesome.  Thank you all so much for helping us artist wind down and celebrate a successful day!"}
{"text":"Definitely not Gnarly, but it was ok. I like that we were able to get flour instead of corn tortillas. The one taco that was excellent was the crispy fish, but I wasn't crazy about the way too salty carne asada and chicken. The braised beef was supposed to be amazing according to our server but we were underwhelmed. Perhaps we are just jaded? After having the best tacos on the planet in Telluride Colorado I just don't know that anything can compare, darn it they have ruined it for us! 
I will say that joy ride has cool atmosphere and great music going for it. The tables are sorta close together so eavesdropping was a lot of fun! Hehe."}
{"text":"This has been my girlfriend and I choice for date night for a few weeks now. We've always had great service and the food has always been exceptional. It's just all around a great place to be. It's a very chill environment with awesome food and great people, Clint the manager there has always made sure we're taken care of. The Carne asada is amazing and has been our cravings ever since we first tried it. The drinks are a bit pricey but very much worth it. We have yet had a negative experience and we've been on busy and slow nights and never got anything less than great service and great food. I'm glad to have found this place you guys are great and I plan on being there for years to come!"}
{"text":"Not the best place to take your family . We sat there for a while without help. We were sat at a tall Bar top table with our 3 kids, one of which was sleeping 2 year old. We sat for over 10 minutes with no drinks, chips and salsa came quickly though.  We waited so long, so we ordered our food with our drinks. Our food came out before we even got the drinks we ordered.  We couldn't leave fast enough. So unimpressed with this downtown central Phoenix eatery."}
{"text":"My experience here was nothing special. Let's start with the good.

Pros
-Amazing atmosphere 
-Great Margaritas 
-Great Location
-Outdoor seating
-Fresh air inside as well
-Awesome tacos
-Amazing Happy Hour specials 

Cons
-Poor Service by some

Upon arriving, my girlfriend and I were warmly welcomed and sat promptly during what seemed to be a busy time.  They host sat us in a wonderful spot in the restaurant and was very kind. 

A young lady who was walking around filling water and occasional light busing table came by to fill our water glasses during this process she spilled more than an acceptable amount of water on our table and walked looked at us and walked away without speaking, apologizing and/or wiping up the spilled water. Them seemed odd as I'm sure I am not the only person who enjoys eating at a dry table.  None the less I waited to see if she was coming back to clean up and noticed that she wasn't  I went ahead and unrolled my silverware and cleaned up the table myself.  

Our waiter arrived and and kindly took our drink order, he was a nice gentleman and returned shortly after with drinks in hand.  Before the waiter left I noticed a hair in my marg and made him aware.  He was great and apologizing and returning promptly with a new one. My girlfriend had the blood orange marg which was amazing.  I had the Joyride which I also that was great, so good that I ordered a second round. We were both very satisfied with our drinks.

We each order our Tacos, I had the Standard, The Chicken Tinga and the Crispy Fish which our server recommended.  I must say all of the tacos were amazing! Great choices and a great recommendation on behalf of the waiter. 

While eating the same young lady who was refilling water stopped by and filled our water again, this time not spilling on our table but instead as she walked away spilling on the floor right next to me causing water to splash on my leg.  At this point I am laughing out of disbelief of her carelessness and poor demeanor as she works.  She has yet to smile and/or speak.  Luckily this was our last experience with this individual. 

When the check came I was surprised to see our bill for 3 margs, and 5 tacos was so cheap. 

Working in the service industry I know tips are a way of showing your appreciation for great service.  I refused to allow the hair in my marg and the careless water lady affect our service good service and left around a 30% tip after factoring in the discount given due to happy hour.  I wish I could remember his name so I could shout him out and let him know I appreciate his service.  

Hopefully he along with the hostess will rub off on the others in the restaurant.  Just because you aren't designated to serving others doesn't mean you are excused from working with a smile on your face and putting effort into your work.

I am in no rush to comeback..."}
{"text":"My go to place for a quick date. Service is awesome which is important on a date. Always there to add extra energy to conversations and help take away some of that first date awkwardness.  Tacos are ok but environment and energy is awesome. No downside."}
{"text":"Great patio. Cute cute restaurant all the way around.. great staff. Fish tacos are so good. Guacamole and salsa, lots of flavor. The drinks are perfection. Pineapple mojito... so good."}
{"text":"I love Joyride too much for my own good. My friend always raved about this place so I finally gave in. We came here on a friday around 9 pm and were immediately seated outside. We got the guacamole and three different tacos, which were all amazing. Our server was really nice and the music was great. I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"This taco shop is located in downtown Gilbert. My husband and I decided to give it a try. We stopped right at lunch time and it was moderately busy. We were greeted right away, when the host asked us where we wanted to sit, we asked for a booth inside, but he took us to a table outside, under a tree that was shedding. Normally, on a warm day in AZ you welcome sitting in the shade, but not this time. 
We asked to be moved inside, and we found a booth. Our waitress was by a short time later for our drink orders. The menu is pretty basic, salads, soups, tacos, burritos, sides....I feel the prices are high for what this place is. I feel that 4.50 for one small shrimp taco is high, but that's just my opinion. I ordered the shrimp tacos, 2 of them. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. 
The tacos were average. Nothing spectacular. There were 3 big pieces of shrimp, lettuce, tomato and pico de gallo. 
The decor is yuppie, trendy and upscale. The service was okay. Our waitress was friendly, and attentive."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and the food is really good.  The one star is all about the service. I met a few friends here last night and we sat on the patio.  Drinks and chips were brought out immediately.  We placed our food order and then our server quickly walked away. All of our drinks were empty along with a few of our water glasses. Once we received our food we again had to track down our server to get another round of drinks, including water. After we finished our meal our dirty plates, along with empty chips bowls sat for another good 30 minutes never being picked up until we asked. They have very good margaritas here and all of us would have enjoyed another one....to no avail.  Became more of a job to try to get our servers attention than it was worth."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Drinks are refreshing.  My wife loves their pineapple mojitos and the mazatlan mules are tasty. 

The tacos are pricy (about $4) for a tiny taco but they are good. The crispy fish taco is the best fish taco I've had in az. I also had the braised beef tacos which were good as well. 

Definitely worth going back"}
{"text":"Round two...the last time I'll ever go to Joyride. 

We opted to sit outside (indoor seating was a 40 minute wait). There was still an annoying pigeon that walked around our table. The waiters seemed to forget about my party and we almost had to go inside to ask to place our others. The waiter didn't know what Tacos were and weren't on happy hour--on Taco Tuesday. The food again left much to be desired. One of my taco tortillas was split thus spilling out all the fillings. 

Tried to keep an open, positive mind about this place but I won't be back. I don't know if I'm crazy but just don't understand the hype around this place. I've brought three friends with me during my visits and they all shared the same negative experience."}
{"text":"Very cute place and accommodated our group of eight well. The tacos are ok...they all have the same toppings so nothing too unique-tasting. The house-made agua frescas are good, as are the margaritas."}
{"text":"Place was slammed. Service was good but the tacos came out cold and the carne asada was burned. Decent place for drinks in trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ask for Adrian! She is feisty and fun!

I did my favorite test of a Restaraunt.

The blind order! 

Adrian selected my meal fearlessly.
She was not allowed to ask me any questions, just put in her choice.
Only a well trained server with great management and terrific chef can deliver on this challenge!

Better to show you than tell you what was delivered. See the attached picture.

Great outdoor/indoor mex venue.  Young vibe. 

Food is unique and worth trying!

Service is paced and fun.  Juice beverages are on trend and fuzzy!

A perfect Arizona evening dinner."}
{"text":"Tacos were awesome had the standard and the fish tacos. Make sure you try the Mexican street corn!  Our server Tony was wonderful and on point.  Great afternoon happy hour."}
{"text":"I cant believe i am saying this but I will never go here again.  I had such high hopes for this place with postinos being my wife and I's favorite restaurant but man they did not get it right here.  For those of you that are thinking about going here I want to list out some pros and cons so that you don't make the same mistake I did.  

Pros 
There is a great hipster trendy atmosphere and they do the same type of happy hour as postinos so if you are there before 5 the drink prices are pretty good.  Similar to postinos they do the candle light at night which some I always think had a great ambiance.  I think this is preference though as I did see in another post that the lighting was poor.

Cons
Service was incredibly slow it took us two and a half hours from being seated to paying the bill.  There was several times we even had to get up and go find someone to place orders or get the bill.  The tacos were small street style tacos and decent but not big enough to be 4 dollars a taco.  The enchiladas were also not very good at all.  The mixed drinks were 9 dollars a drink which is about on par for most places but they hardly gave you anything in them.  They served them in rocks glass (small to begin with) an had them filled to the top with ice.  We actually finished our entire drink before it melted and then when the ice melted it filled the cup up with 2/3 water.  

I am glad to see more stuff going into downtown Gilbert and I hope these issues get fixed so that maybe at some point I will end up liking them as much as I do there sister restaurant postinos but for now I don't intend to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"New to Arizona and wanted to check out Taco Tuesday. Well It is a great place to check out. Lots of energy and great food. I enjoyed it so much that I go even when it's not Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Started with the guacamole last night, which was delightful. Lots of flavor and crunchy texture from the onions and cilantro. Ordered a strawberry fresca and it delighted my taste buds. I didn't even feel bad drinking it because it is just pure yummy juice....no artificial colors or flavors...just strawberry goodness over ice! 
For my entree, I ordered a salad. I can't remember the name now, but I did take a photo to add to my review of how perfect it looked when it arrived. It tasted as good as it looked. I added chicken to it, which was too seasoned for my taste, but the rest of the salad was killer. So many unique flavors combining together that each bite tasted better than the last. The dressing came on the side and I didn't even use it! That should tell you how natural packed the salad was with flavor. This will be my go to salad for sure. I'll update my review next time with the name of it. (Yelper fail) 
The manager came over to check on us multiple times and was so eager to make sure our experience was on point. One of the most involved, and active upper management people I have come across in all my years of dining out. He really made us feel like we were old friends of his, eating at his personal restaurant. Lots of pride in what he does, and what his restaurant serves. HE is what set my review over the top and puts Joyride at a solid 5. I will also figure out the managers name and update this review with that as well. Clearly I was in some sort of food heaven/coma that gave me amnesia of the specifics of my review. Non the less- go here if you want CLEAN modern Mexican food."}
{"text":"We love coming here for dinner.  Always enjoyable.  The music is a little loud inside, so we try to sit outside instead.  The food is well priced and so far never a bad meal.  Try to arrive before 5pm for \"before 5\" prices."}
{"text":"We've been to Joyride twice. The first time, just my husband and I, was mediocre. We went as a large family get together a few weekends ago and the food was great. The carne asada tacos were very, very good. The Mexican corn was great. Spicy, I had to eat corn chips along with it, but great."}
{"text":"I am not sure why I kept subjecting myself to the absolutely horrible service over and over here but last night was my final straw. I did enjoy joyrides food and drinks but the service is downright awful. I have come all times of the day so I know it's not just during their busy times. Waited close to 45 minutes just to place an order. Wanted some more chips and salsa because at this point we've been waiting so long to place the order we're pretty famished, they tell us that'll be an additional two dollars; okay fine whatever, although I find it a little ridiculous that six people dining together get one bowl of chips and salsa to share and then they want to charge $2 for more. Well they never came anyways. Food finally comes and they never check in, refill drinks, etc. this has not been a one time thing, this seems to be the experience every.single.time despite if they're busy or not. I'm done going here and won't ever be back."}
{"text":"I will always love this place. It is hard to find a good veggie taco, believe it or not. The veggie tacos at joyride are amazing! They also have a fantastic drink selection and their margaritas are to die for! 
The only downside is this place is always busy! Sometimes the wait is 35-40 minutes for 2 people. I try and sneak in the bar as much as possible to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Joy for Joyride! I'm obsessed with the food, especially the \"standard\" taco, which is really sort of a misnomer because there is nothing basic about it.  It's flavorful and divine! Nothing here is greasy or overdone-- the food is fresh and light but very, very tasty.  I also love the carnitas taco, and the cheese dip appetizer is to die for.  It's topped with fresh jalapenos, other peppers, and tomatoes/ onions.  Soooooo yummy.  

The atmosphere is casual, fun, and very social.  I also love that it's a Mexican joint but they play great indie tunes.  No mariachi! My only complaint about the layout is the seating in the lounge patio where you wait for your table.  There are these little poof seats that put your arse right at the same height as the table and they're uncomfortable.  Yes, this is a very picky little thing but I'm trying to keep myself honest and not just give an all-glowing review.

If you love fresh and light Mexican food, give Joyride a try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food & drinks! I'm not sure which taco was my favorite. Perhaps the Chicken Tinga. Or maybe the Standard. Or maybe the Veggie. Oh, and don't get me started on the salsa..."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the atmosphere in this place!  It's got a super funky retro vibe with vintage decor and what seemed like it could have been the James Brown Pandora station.  We only had drinks at the bar but the cucumber cocktail was perfectly balanced, refreshing and slightly spicy- a must have!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am sick of places that try to fancy up Mexican food, I usually end up wishing I would have just gone to a taco shop.  I will definitely go there on my next trip to Phoenix and I will at least try the food so I can give it a fair assessment."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've come... the first time I've actually been able to get in. Now I see why there was a 1/2 hour wait. The tacos are awesome. I like the Carnitas and the fish"}
{"text":"Up until last night I would have easily given Joyride 4 stars, however, after last nights dinner service (or lack thereof) I had to drop them down to 3 stars. Its unfortunate, because their food is absolutely delicious. My fiance and I have eaten at Joyride 3 times within the last month and the only thing that has stayed the same is the quality and taste of their food. The service seems to be very hit and miss. Our first experience was fantastic. Our waitress was kind and attentive. Our second visit was at the bar. The service was good, nothing outstanding like our first visit, but not bad. And then there was last night..... Talk about a catastrophe. Our waitress had little to no idea what she was doing. Multiple times throughout the night we were sure that we had been forgotten about. Our waitress took our dinner and drink order after we had been sitting ready and waiting to order  for over 15 minutes, it then took another 10 minutes to get our teas, and then she completely disappeared until it was time to pay. She never came back to check on us. When she presented us with the check, it was incorrect, so she had to go back and try it again. It took her another 15 minutes to come back with the correct check. Our dirty dishes and empty chip trays were never cleared off of the table, everything just sat there stacking up. The manager passed by our table several times, looked straight at us sitting there waiting with dirty dishes all around, and just kept walking.... 
Again, the food is wonderful. We absolutely love the shrimp, braised beef, carne asada tacos, and chicken nachos but wow the service keeps going downhill with each visit. If the service continues to follow this same pattern I am terrified to see what it would be like if we decide to go back...."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, great food & fun atmosphere. Tuesday's are taco Tuesday- happy hour all day! That means $2 tacos and great drink prices!! Located in downtown Gilbert right next to a ton of free parking. The only downside is very loud 80s music blasting throughout making it a little difficult to have a conversation.  Otherwise a great place to have an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Nice outside area. Service was friendly. Very expensive for what it was. And for all the random things, the food really didn't have much flavor. Not impressed with the \"tree hugger\" menu. We had just moved here and ended up at this place by mistake. (Couldn't find so cal fish tacos). It's a great yuppy hip health food place, but not family friendly looking for REAL tacos."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The environment is very welcoming and comfortable. $2 tacos & $5 margs at happy hour... Can't beat that. They surprisingly really good tacos for $2. Defiantly recommend the carnitas tacos. The guac is nothing special but the tacos make up for it. Oh yeah... The salas, is GREAT! I'll be back"}
{"text":"I am shocked that this place has such good reviews. One thing must be made clear, this is not authentic Mexican food, not even close. It is super hipster and I think that Joyride has made the hipster trend the priority of this place and not the food.

When we walked in there was no hostess, and we had to flag a waitress down just to get our seat. It  took them forever to take our order and the waitress was extremely unprofessional. She tried to memorize our order but could not, and we ended up having to repeat it several times. The food took so long to come out and it was cold by the time it came out. I had a baja, a chicken, and carne asada taco. Filibertos is better than these tacos.  And they were $2 each, but there are much better street tacos running up to $1.89 all around! The 11 cents were a steep price to pay for bad service and bad food. Also, in the middle of our meal we requested limes (Yes, the tacos do not come with them), and it took them a god ten minutes to bring them out. To be fair, I did not expect them to remember to bring them to us.

The food here is garbage, as is the service, the restaurant is severely understaffed, and while the restaurant is cute, the music was playing so loudly I could not physically hold a conversation with a friend. I cannot think of a single reason to come back here. Honestly speaking, taco bell has better tacos than Joyride. It's clearly catering to hipsters that care more about the aesthetic of the food than the flavor."}
{"text":"Okay they are so nice here. I came to use my free dessert coupon for my birthday and I received complimentary chips and salsa after I was seated. I ordered the brownie dessert and it was pretty darn good! Very rich: homemade brownie topped with dulce de leche ice cream, goat milk caramel and walnuts. I wish I would've taken the rest to go but I had to rush back to work. I would definitely come back and try food from their menu, their tacos sounded yummy and they had a few vegetarian options which is nice. I liked that it wasn't super busy when I went, which was during peak lunch hour."}
{"text":"They have a great lunch special- 2 tacos & either a generous portion of soup or salad. The crispy fish and the shrimp tacos are very yummy!"}
{"text":"Went here on a tip and was thoroughly impressed. 

When we arrived we were told of 2 available seats at the front of the bar which we gladly accepted. The atmosphere was very social and lively, a little loud but perfect for a Friday night. After ordering our drinks and looking over the menu, our server/barkeep informed us of the special they were serving. Slow roasted pork shoulder on a bed of sweet polenta, garnished with what tasted like pickled jalapeños and some sort of adobo sauce and cilantro. What ever it was it tasted like heaven, with huge complex flavors. The pork melted in your mouth, it was unreal. 

The staff was very nice and even engaged us in light conversation which just added to the laid back ambience. When we finished eating we were approached by the manager and asked what we thought about the special. I relayed my enthusiasm and he said it was really nice to get positive feedback on non-menued dishes and would be serving more 1-offs in the future.

Overall a fantastic experience. We will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"Them Tacos though and the Mexican street corn. wow had a great first visit here so came back three times the following week. the locations is great and the atmosphere is young and fresh. Get all the Tacos. try them all seriously and then come back for the ones you loved the most."}
{"text":"I have yet to meet an Upwards Project establishment that I didn't like!  

The decor is awesome. Hip and comfortable. The outside patio chairs look uncomfortable but are. The chairs inside look comfy too.  The patio has misters- and you don't get soaked!!   

The menu is simple. Tacos, burritos, sides, desserts, and a nice drink menu. As any good restaurant should, they brought out complimentary chips and salsa. Very tasty!  Chips were nice and crispy!  I had the chicken burrito.  My only complaint was the menu did not specify mushrooms were in it. It only mentioned a garden variety mix. Luckily they were huge chunks so easy to remove!  I also had the Mexican corn. If you like cheese, you'll love this.  Cheese was all I could taste. $5 for a piece of corn was a bit much, so between that and the fact the food does not come with a side (no rice or beans?).  This is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  The food was excellent though.  We also shared dessert. The Mo's Definitely was good, and I can't wait to go back and try the others. 

The drinks were great too!  I had the Mexican Mule. Nice for a warm summer day out on the patio. My friend had a blood orange margarita, that was good too!

Finally, I have to comment on the service. We went on opening day (6/4) and I expected slow, quirky service. Nope!  Other than the fact our server thought the corn came with 2 cobs, which he quickly corrected himself on, he knew the menu, made great recommendations, had out stuff out to us fast and brought exactly what we ordered. All of the staff there were very friendly, smiling, always checking up on us and refilling water. You'd never know they just opened, no opening day kinks that I could see.

This is a great addition to the area, I can't wait to go back and taste more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This place fails in terms of flavor. I ordered the tacos and was not impressed at all by their flavor or price. You pay for the atmosphere here. It is a very hip place and probably makes for great instagram photos, but if you are looking for serious food this is not the place. I tried 6 different taco flavors and all were weak. I give it 2 stars for the atmosphere. Went once and will probably never return."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and great tacos! Never a bad visit- staff always attentive and great team work! Margaritas are on point and good selection of beer! Usually end up here once or twice a month for some chips and dip - drink and tacos!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The standard taco is the best! My husband also really likes the crunchy fish taco."}
{"text":"The reason why I am giving only 3 stars is first of all, because every time I go there, we never know who our server is. Throughout our lunch, we have maybe 4 to 5 different persons checking on us, which leads to repeated questions. The second reason is because of the prices, they are a little overpriced, must be because it is Downtown Gilbert, $4.5 for a taco is a bit too much. 
However, the atmosphere and the decoration is very nice, really modern and lots of colors. They have a nice little patio. If you go for lunch, ask about their lunch special, $9.75 for 2 tacos and a side (or half a salad)!"}
{"text":"After having walked past Joyride so many times and wanting to stop in, I was really hoping to love it.  Unfortunately, they fell a bit short.  We ordered various street tacos and they were okay but not really memorable.  Our daughter ordered cheese enchiladas and the cheese inside was completely burnt.  She really couldn't eat them.  The margaritas were pretty good and for a good price at happy hour.  With so many options now in DT Gilbert, I'm not sure if I'd return; however, you should give them a try if you're in the mood for tacos and margaritas.  The service was great and the atmosphere is really inviting."}
{"text":"Five star all the way! Great staff! Very good food! The only thing missing is the beach! Will be back! With the rest of the family. Seems to be a local favorite! I'm sure you'll be able to find something you'll like, and if you don't ask and they probably could accommodate."}
{"text":"This place has some delicious tacos and a great happy hour deal with 5 dollar pitchers of beer and 5 dollar margs till like 5 o'clock. Crispy fish and carne asada tacos are my go to, with a side of joy rice. Have had a couple of the apps and a few different tastes of some of the mains and they have all been very good. I feel like this place is a bargain if you go during the happy hour times. Service this past visit was excellent with the server/food runner realizing a possible food allergy before the food was served."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've indulged at Joyride. The staff was fab. I think we had at least 4 people check in on us.

Drinks were yummy. I had the cucumber tequila sort of spicy margarita. My friend had the pineapple mojito. Both were fun and tasty.

The battered tacos are great, with big piece of fish and proper accutramontes. I've also had their veggie tacos and was pleasantly  pleased. For the meat eaters, the braised beef was scrumptious. The kiddos enjoyed quesadillas, chicken tacos, and beans with rice. They have a kids menu that isn't listed, just ask for the kids selections. And the aqua frescas were yummilicious."}
{"text":"Please bring back your yummy cocktails like the Key Largo and Naked n Famous! These were our favorites!"}
{"text":"This place was really, really good and I'm already excited to go back. We started off with chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and the salsa had the perfect amount of spice to it. For dinner I got the standard taco and baja fish taco. Both were amazing and I found myself wishing I had ordered a third. The corn tortillas were nice and thick and all the ingredients were really fresh and had such a nice flavor. I also loved the vibe in this place. The music selection was awesome - Beastie Boys was playing when we arrived and Cypress Hill was playing when we left. The service was great and everyone was really friendly. This was truly the perfect dining experience!"}
{"text":"Joyride was more like a 10 car pile up. No flavor. Meh!"}
{"text":"This is a great break from strip mall life! Excellent tacos, superb margaritas and a great playlist to eat to, (although a little loud). I was there for work and ate twice and once across at their pizza joint! Excellent job!"}
{"text":"Restaurants have 3 things they need to ensure in order to be successful: 

First is good food.  That's the most important obviously.  Even if you hate everything else about a place you may come back if the food is good.  The food at Joyride is good.  Everything that came our way was presented well, tasted great, and was ample in portions.

Second is to make sure you have a good time and are taken care of.  Primarily, this requires good servers and providing value for your money.  The service here was a delight.  We actually got forgotten about and not served for 10 minutes but the waitress was so friendly and enjoyable that it was easy to forgive.  Regarding the value, the daily happy hour until 5 on drinks makes it hard to complain about.  

The last thing you need, to me, to be successful as a restaurant is \"it.\"  You know \"it\" when you see it.  Joyride has \"it.\"  The atmosphere is enjoyable, the layout of the tables is comfortable, the patio is delightful, the colors are fun...everything just works.  

This was my first time at Joyride and I'm itching to go back already.  A great place."}
{"text":"It was okay. I had high hopes since the other restaurants there from the same owner are well established. 

I also prefer authentic mexican food, this is more new gourmet mexican, wasn't bad just not my preference. I did only get a burrito which was mighty fine in its own right.

Would i come back? Yes. Do i crave it? No"}
{"text":"Delicious taco shop with margaritas to match. I also love their guacamole. Great atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"One of our \"go to\" places for a good quick meal...or even a longer one with friends.   Great food, great service, laid back eclectic crowd."}
{"text":"Joyride is one of many restaurants that I love down in this area! 

My husband and I like to try new places and especially mexican restaurants. For one, their margaritas are to die for and two, it's great atmosphere and an awesome looking place. 

We sat outside on their open patio and enjoyed some really good queso dip and a burrito.

There taco Tuesdays and happy hours are awesome as well! 

Worth giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Fun Taco Tuesday place. The tacos are a must try. The patio is is nice. Inside is cramped."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in downtown Gilbert! Happy hour is the best, $2 tacos and $5 margaritas! The food is phenomenal and high quality. The only thing stopping me from giving a 5 star review is the service has been a little slow from time to time, but usually only when they are super busy. When it's not packed, the service staff is all friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Super cool ambiance, pretty friendly service, unfortunately the food was bland, cold and unappetizing.   I got the Baja fish taco and crispy fish taco. Both could be described pretty easily... Bad."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly with water, chips, and salsa to follow. Salsa was very good and chips were ok. I had the Beast Burrito in a bowl with the tortilla on the side and it was very good. Wife had the fish taco and carne  asada taco with a half salad. All very good with excellent service."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the food!!!  
Tons of healthy choices!  So fresh and delicious!!!!

Awesome staff!   Very attentive, friendly and on top if it!!!

Going back and taking every friend I have!!!"}
{"text":"The absolute best food ever!!!   The drinks are the bomb!  Pineapple Mojito is my favorite!!!!  LOVE this place!!!  The patio is a great place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"where do I start...came here due to a recommendation from a co-worker who's local. The place is great, whether you are coming here on a date, with friends, or in my case, alone (because you're on a work trip and others are too lame to drive more than a block for dinner). It's such a cute place and open setting so very welcoming. In doors or outdoors, no matter where you sit, you'll love it.

Sat at the bar and at the recommendation of the bartender, had one of their agua frescas (citrus) with tequila which was very refreshing and delicious. Ordered 3 tacos (braised beef, fried fish and chicken tinga) which comes w a choice of a side. No other comment except FKN DELICIOUS (the tacos that is)! 

I then ordered a spicy cucumber drink which was pretty fantastic. I love that their drinks are refreshing and not heavy just because their alcoholic. 

Only disappointment was the rice which didn't seem to be cooked enough but not a big enough deal that would keep me from coming back to this place! I WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had to wait for an hour to get into a restaurant on a Tuesday before.  This place takes Taco Tuesday VERY seriously, and I understand why: THEIR FOOD IS INCREDIBLE!  I have had tacos from many places, but this place definitely stands out.  

After being seated, we gave our drink orders and I was pleased by the variety of margarita options, such as Blood Orange, Tropicale, Prickly Pear, Strawberry Hibiscus and Pineapple Mojito.  There wasn't a flavor I didn't enjoy, though some were definitely sweeter than others and they weren't the strongest I've had.  

Now, these tacos... carnita, fish, chicken... every taco I had was full of so much flavor and so enjoyable.  Do you want quality tacos?  Come to this place.  On Taco Tuesday, they're $2 all day and night and the margaritas are $5 all day and night.  

If you're in the area, don't question it.  Just go.  Explore some local stores while you wait."}
{"text":"Aghhhh... I really hate to give this a 3 star review. I wanted to love Joyride. My friends love Joyride. I love all the other restaurants in the Postinos family. I had a lukewarm experience with Joyride.

We went with a large group of friends. Started out with cocktails and chips and salsa. I had an aqua fresca with gin. It was good but light on the gin. Salsa was boring.

We then ordered our food and another round of drinks. I ordered the veggie burrito and a beer. My husband ordered tacos with a side of beans. My veggie burrito was just okay. It wasn't bad but I have had much tastier. I was excited about the \"white magic\" sauce that came in it but it seemed non-existent. I doused a lot of hot sauce on my burrito. My husband liked his tacos a lot. We both thought the beans were very bland. My beer? Well, it took 40 minutes to come out. 

I have a hard time with the value at Joyride. Mexican food should not be this expensive... if it is then it should be very special. I wasn't feeling it. I love the atmosphere, servers were nice. They comped the beer they almost forgot. I am willing to give Joyride another try."}
{"text":"Salsa... Very flavorful, not the overly roasted or hot ( which I actually prefer) but oh so good.
And the chips complimented the saIsa perfectly.
We split our lunch options and actually went with two of the servers recommendations.
Adobada Pork Tacos -they were good in their own way but pale compared to the Crispy Fish Tacos.
Crispy Fish Taco - all kinds of flavor happening here.  No need for salsa or any other topping. Not the slightest bit fishy either.  
Beast Burrito, chili style with green sauce
High Roller, Blood Orange Margarita

Oh heck, it was all so good.
The atmosphere is neat.
The place is busy.
The server was knowledgeable.
Good food and tasty drinks.
And I understand a sister company to Postino?

It's a go."}
{"text":"always so busy - but amazing food. I love the décor and the service has always been great. This was a great restaurant to add to downtown gilbert."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. I have never had an issue with service or the food. I typically come on Taco Tuesday so the wait can be a little crazy, but it's always worth it."}
{"text":"This is my first time here... I absolutely love tacos. By far the best ones I've had yet:) and we can't forget our awesome server Tim! Thanks for the GREAT service!!"}
{"text":"Really great tacos! If it is your first time, they give you a free appetizer. The guacamole was phenomenal. I've heard that their taco Tuesday deal is great as well. This restaurant is in a great location on central & the inside of the building is so cool!"}
{"text":"Love their revamped happy hour with appetizers for five dollars. Their queso y mas dip is awesome as are their spiked aqua fresca's.  Not a fan of their actual food items past the app menu."}
{"text":"Took my Daughter-in-law out for lunch, we both had passed this place and were curious about it. Stopped in. Will for sure go back. Food was great, we tried a few different tacos. We were unable to try and fru-fru drinks as we had an appointment to go to after, but saw quite a few come out of the bar.  

We sat outside, a very nice patio behind the building, helps you not hear the street traffic. They have a section w/ real grass, we saw a few customers w/ dogs show up. that was ok as the dogs were kept on leashes. 

We ordered 2 tacos each to start. received the chips and salsa... and couldn't stop eating them!! we finished the basket before our tacos came, and they brought another one. we ate them too. Our tacos arrived. based on the price, I felt they were a bit small, but they were very good. Fresh ingredients, that's for sure.

We both ordered two more tacos (and more chips and salsa) and enjoyed them.

Our server was friendly, a bit busy as it seemed he may have been the only one and the place was packed. But not a problem, it was a nice relaxing time. 

However, as we sat outside and the sun moved, we went from in the shade to in the full sun. they need a few more umbrellas, as the 3 they had were being used by those on the grass. speaking of those on the grass, a group of about 10 showed up and sat in the lawn chairs on the grass, enjoying each others company and a few drinks. Nice idea!  

Didn't go inside, so can't review on that. For sure we will go back. When we stood up to leave, the manager came over and asked us how it was. We told him great, as it was, and that we wish we had ordered 3 tacos to start off instead of 2. he suggested that if we like a certain type of taco, and are very hungry, order the burrito, it's much larger, and costs less than 3 tacos. will try that next time."}
{"text":"What a pleasure this place was.  Felt like I was on vacation waiting to step out to a sandy beach.    And the food is genuine.   Really fresh yummy.    The drinks very tasty and flavorful.  We ate at the bar and let me tell you we had the
Most fun in a long time.   Very friendly setting the servers who are behind the bar you can tell like being there.   Gives you a sense of I'm glad I came to eat tacos at joyride.  We liked it so much we would have no problem taking out of town guests here.   This one is a winner.  So it's all in a name they say and joyride lives up to it."}
{"text":"Joyride is wonderful! The atmosphere is terrific, the indoor/outdoor blend of seating is great during the cooler months of the year as well. They are dog friendly, which is great. 

Like the other Upward Concepts along Central, wait times and parking can be killer on certain nights of the week and certain times, so be aware.

The food is wonderful, fresh and quick with gluten free and vegetarian options throughout the menu. In comparison to traditional Mexican food places in the area, the prices are a bit higher.

The guacamole is a must. So fresh. I've personally had the veggie tacos and the Fila Salad, both of which are amazing. I think you get more for your money with the Fila Salad (pictured). Their homemade agua frescas are to die for! Especially if you opt to spike them!"}
{"text":"Here's the 4-1-1:  The atmosphere is hip, good music, nice wait staff, cool decor. The food is meh. I had the Mexican street corn and crispy fish tacos. The corn comes on the cob with this cheesy butter mixture that is good when you start but way too much a few bites in, can you say water please? The fish tacos were something I can get at any restaurant - good, but not great. We also got the churros con chocolate that were not cooked all the way through, blech. The salsa was VERY good and the chips tasted homemade - think thicker corn tortilla style chips with lots of salt, yum!

So there it is....I went for lunch BTW so I didn't have the amazing drinks everyone on here raves about, but I don't think I'll be back for food. Maybe some chips and salsa and a marg."}
{"text":"Solid!   Great cocktails, great service for our large group of 7, good food and good atmosphere!

We had a blast!"}
{"text":"We loved Joyride for several reasons.  First, the service was prompt and attentive.  There seemed to be more people waiting on our table than most restaurants.  The attitude of everyone working there was great.  We were greeted by all employees with a smile and everyone said good bye.  This is a reflection of outstanding training and management.

The food was fantastic.  Our party of seven each ordered something different.  Explanations and recommendations by the server were appreciated.  The food arrived promptly and was fresh, hot, and tasty.

The next time we visit Phoenix, this restaurant will be on our list of places to eat.  Kuddos, Joyride!!  :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and quality!  We visit a few times a week typically at bar.  Bar is always clean and garnishes are fresh.  Decor is fun and crew is friendly!  Bathrooms are detailed and always stocked.  Great variety on menu and staff is attentive to customized requests for drinks and food.  We will continue to come back.  Ask for the \"Chris Bowl\", three shrimp and and three carne asada tacos, no tortillas...add a Mexican street corn off the cobb...perfection!  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"OMG! what a great and incredible experience! The Tuesday Tacos were just incredible! i had way more tacos then i thought i would. the Carnitas taco were done to perfection both in spice and in taste all in all was a great combination. The fish taco, was good, and decent, but seemed to be missing something. ( I could not put my finger on what). the Pork adobe was a bit too spicy. I love spicy but not when it deprives me from tasting the rest of the food. and the margarita my oh my.  I am usually a classic margarita chick, but i read so many reviews about The Cucumber/Serrano margarita, that i just had to try it. I am so glad I did! delicious, tasty, spicy and super refreshing. absolutely loved the atmosphere as well. the Patio seating has a nice fire pit  to stay warm, and the whole ambiance is totally local. When you walk in, you get the feeling of being in a locals spot. very friendly from the person seated next to you to the person serving you. This local joint, has my support."}
{"text":"I love  $2 taco Tuesday!  I want to give more stars, but honestly, every time I'm here, I've had to yell to speak to the people at my table. The music is SO loud! ! Also, the waiter never resumed my water!"}
{"text":"AMAZING service, beautiful decor, and the tacos were the best I've had in Phx. Or ever possibly. We came on a Tuesday, $2 tacos and $5 margaritas! Def will be back and with more ppl! Usually you can tell if a place will have good tacos depending on the taste of the salsa and the salsa was a solid 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"Ahi tacos are incredible. All the fish is fresh never frozen. The staff is super friendly and the music doesn't suck (usually). Today I made a minor (solicited) complaint about a taco and the staff went WAY out of their way to make me happy. The chef himself brought me a  new taco, they knocked it off my bill anyway and even gave me a free drink. I always sit at the bar, so I can't comment on the wait staff but the place looks like they only hire attractive tattooed people. No complaints here. Drinks appear to be strong too... Still typing."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this taco spot by a relative and most recently went there for my birthday get together with a large group! The tacos are amazing the chips salsa and Guacamole are killer and they have an incredible outdoor seating area under two massive Ficus Trees!! We will be back !!"}
{"text":"I was a little reluctant to try this place since I prefer authentic Mexican tacos. I was surprised on how tasty these tacos were. For an Americanized Mexican restaurant, this place is really delicious for tacos! We had the carne asada, carnitas, fried fish, and the grilled fish taco. YUM! And for margaritas, the Cucumber Serrano was exceptional! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. .good location. .nice food.
Slightly pricey though. 
The icing on the cake is the drinks which are awesome. They have the right mix and content of alcohol which is usually missing in most of the joints."}
{"text":"The service at the bar was horrible, my boyfriend and I stood there for about 15 minutes without anyone saying we will be with you in a moment, then we saw them pour about 5 beers all with a bunch of foam in them. Once we sat down at the table service was a lot better, the margaritas were really good, the tacos were just alright. I had the tamales, which were delicious."}
{"text":"Good place for inexpensive casual food and drinks. The bar has a great selection of beer and liquor and the staff is very friendly. The food is cheap and good quality."}
{"text":"Met friends for happy hour and loved it.  All the street tacos were awesome and they have a great variety.  Service was very good, and it is dog friendly.  I'd go back there in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We've only gone here for Taco Tuesdays, but despite the long wait, the food more than makes up for it! It's a nice hip joint with even better food. The service can be crappy but then again so will the next restaurant on a busy night."}
{"text":"Delicious food, wonderful wait staff, great ambiance. You have to get the corn. Oh. My. Yum."}
{"text":"SO good! I loved the carnitas tacos and my prickly pear margarita! Super friendly staff and speedy service. It's a win!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, loved the patio. Service was a little in the relaxed side and the charger for extra chips and salsa which are the only reasons this place didn't get 5 stars. By the way if you want to try a healthy side get the market fresh veggies . Tonight was Brussel sprouts and they were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Joyride for my first time, had excellent tacos and the Mexican street corn there is to die for! Amazing happy hour, they also do give you free chips and salsa... will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place from a friend who shared the great happy hour deals with me. We visited just recently for a couple of pitchers. $5 for a pitcher of craft beer is an amazing deal! We enjoyed the service and the atmosphere. I can't wait to head back!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at Joyride with my girlfriends this weekend! They accommodated a large party and everything was delicious - I had chips/guac, a carnitas taco, and the baja fish taco (my fav). Everyone loved their Moscow Mules (and variations) but I couldn't resist ordering the horchata YUM. Our server was great and the manager Dan is extremely friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Get beyond the super high hipster factor and treat yourself to Joyride. The food is varied and delicious, the prices are just right. Full of flavor, my carne asada and chicken street tacos were awesome- loaded with meat and veggies. The \"white magic\" sauce was super tasty too. There's a great kids menu to order from if you bring the family. There's plenty of seating, even for larger groups- and the decor is as you'd expect from Upward Projects (Postino, Windsor, Federal Pizza). The staff is great, they seem to play more of a \"zoned\" game wherein many servers will cover each other's tables to ensure the customer is being treated right. Don't worry about empty drink glasses or missing food, that didn't happen for us at Joyride. The place was busy, don't let a small wait time scare you away. There's competition at the other end of Gilbert road (So Cal Fish Taco Company) but I'd have to give Joyride the 5th star when comparing. If you're craving good mexican food (tacos, burritos, ensaladas, etc.) do yourself a favor and head over to Joyride. Sign up for their email list and you'll get offers for free food, etc. We didn't order drinks but they offer a full bar and plety of room to huddle around it and enjoy your cervezas or margaritas."}
{"text":"I loved it! I couldn't make up my mind and asked the server to surprise me. He brought me nachos and they we the best I have ever had! The drinks were also made great."}
{"text":"My best friend and I recently went here a couple of weeks ago. It was the absolute most amazing tacos I've ever had. I might be over selling a tad bit, BUT this definitely a place you want to try out, their tacos are seriously great tasting. I'd love to come back soon and try out the burrito next, my friend said their burrito was amazing. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of it. Please check out this place, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for their $5 house margaritas.  On ice my first one went down quick and did not really feel it but did start to feel a kick halfway through my second one.  So they passed my margarita test. 

Crispy and fresh chips and very savory salsa were offered and they are really really.good.  

Then not being so hungry i ordered just the fish taco, no rice or beens.  Satisfying and tasty.  

The bar was pleasant and not crowded at the time and the bartenders were very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Chase and the girl with the septum piercing were awesome. Love this place for the great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure is dining at Joyride. We decided to take a bike ride into town for dinner. Love the open air restaurant. We chose 3 different types of tacos. The standard, the beef and the shrimp. The shrimp was my favorite the other were delicious. For desert we had the el Domingo. A unique dessert!! It was great. To top off our evening when we got to out bikes there was a coupon thanking us for riding in and we now can go back for 3 free tacos. What a great perk!! It was worth the 6 miles we rode and the extra perk made our night even better."}
{"text":"Great place! I bring friends, colleagues, and family here all the time. Tony one of the bartenders is cool as hell, and goes out of his way to ensure we are comfortable every time we visit. 
Keep in mind it gets busy!"}
{"text":"Great food, not so great service. However the food was good enough that I'm willing to put up with the lack of service to eat the food. I got the chicken burrito and it was excellent. It's not traditional rice beans cheese, it had mushrooms, and some other veggies and it was EXCELLENT. The chips and salsa waa decent. The service was the worst part, we didn't know who our server was or who even worked there. Everyone was wearing street clothes, just like all the customers. Seldom came around, had to ask to take our order, had to ask to pay the bill, had to ask for just about everything, there was no checking in or proactive service."}
{"text":"THE BANDIT TACO PLATTER was the choice for dinner, all three tacos where very good but my favorite was the Carnitas tacos. Also had the pineapple mojito which was very good!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with great tacos. Awesome service by Natalie.We tried the standard taco and couldn't have been happier with the unique and delicious taste."}
{"text":"My husband and I held our wedding rehearsal dinner here for 20 people, and we were beyond pleased with the booking experience, customer service, quality of food and overall experience. The food and drinks are delicious and the service is top-notch. Prices are very fair for the quality of food. The atmosphere is fun and festive. We ate on the back patio - it was perfect.  We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"A really great taco place! I went here with my family a week or two ago. The atmosphere is nice and casual, but it's still okay to wear a cute dress or a nice shirt.

They have good happy hour deals! My family mostly ordered from this because we wanted to try the tacos. We weren't let down! I got the standard (signature?) taco which was delicious! Be prepared for a little bit of a messy meal though. Don't wear your best outfit in case you drop, drip, or spill. 

My only complaint (if you can even call it that!) is that the waiters/waitresses all wear regular nice clothes, so if you have questions, you must memorize the face. You might mistake a twenty something for one of the workers! But otherwise very good service and very good fresh food! A fun place to try with your friends or family."}
{"text":"Great Tacos and Happy Hour! The staff were all nice, I will be definitely coming back here for their margaritas and tacos!"}
{"text":"Food is very good! I Love trying new things every time I come in. The tacos are delicious - I've tried the braised beef and the chicken tinga both very good and spicy, and the guac is a MUST have! The cocktails are refreshing, especially the agua frescas. 

The restaurant has a fun retro vibe and a fabulous patio area to enjoy these rare cool evenings.

I have been very impressed with service, especially management. The manager is so personable and came to check in on our large group from the hospital and thanked us for coming in...just really thoughtful and for that I am adding a star to this 4 star place and giving them 5."}
{"text":"Our first visit. Great place.  I had the tacos and they were excellent.  Love the fresh made and thick corn tortillas. The fillings were awesome as well.  I had chicken, carnitas and pork adobada... all flavored very well with creative extras like radishes and cilantro and Mexican slaw. My wife had the chicken burrito bowl. Huge serving of scrumptious and creative flavors. The squash and chicken were perfectly cooked. Service was top notch, as we had four different people stop by to help, bring food, refills, etc.

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. Not bad, but I wasn't amazed either. 

I ordered three tacos and they came with a choice of a free side dish. I opted for the black beans. The beans were delicious. 

The carnitas was my favorite taco. Good pork flavor and the avocado slice complimented it well.

The crispy fish taco was alright. The fish itself was good, I just would have preferred it with a corn tortilla, and the condiments on it didn't really do anything for me. 

The carne asada was my least favorite. The meat was bland. It didn't taste like it was marinated or anything. 

The complimentary salsa that came with the chips was tasty but the chips themselves were too salty for my taste. 

They were pretty crowded and busy, but service was ok. The restaurant has a nice open layout and they do play decent music, but I was annoyed by flies during my meal. I sat inside but they had all the doors open since the weather was nice and I had to keep shooing them away from my food. Kind of annoying. 

Overall this place wasn't bad, but I wasn't blown away by the food either. I don't think I'd go back on my own, but if someone invited me to go there with them, I wouldn't decline."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. The Standard taco was meh but all other tacos are worth coming back. Oh yeah, the blood orange margarita alone is worth coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place. They keep it simple and that totally works. Great selection of tacos and the  Blood orange marg with salt is most excellent!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant in a great location. My wife and I love sitting outside by the fireplace between the two big trees. The food is amazing, I highly recommend the beast burrito. They have pitchers of beer for only $5 during happy hour, along with other drinks. Will come back here over and over!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their orange cucumber salad, it was super refreshing! I also got the pork adobada and the chicken tinga tacos! Overall, I'd definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"We come here for Taco Tuesday's all the time.  Their tacos are great and if you get there before 5 PM, you can get a pitcher of beer for $5.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love fish tacos and I must say they make the best crispy fish taco. When I want Mexican food I want to taste that authentic in it and OMG that carne asada both me and my brother said it was the best tender meat spicy and sweet so good. I highly recommend the Mexican slaw and the crispy fish taco yum! I will be going back soon to take other friends and to have a hard drink ;) Thanks for the joyride!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing Cisco had great energy and table presence. The cevice was fresh the kids meal was amazing and our meal perfect. I recommend joyride 100%"}
{"text":"I've always wondered why the empty space next to Postinos East wasn't occupied by something and now finally I got my wish.  From the \"Owners\" of Postinos,  the Upwards Project, have rolled out another concept restaurant/bar.  This time its a taco shop. I love everything from the UP especially Postinos and I love Mexican food so I was very excited for this new place.  How can go wrong right?  

The Good
-You can expect the attentative service you've expected from Postinos with LOTS of servers always checking up on you.  And of course all the servers are attractive and easy on the eyes.  
-The décor is always interesting, a mix between modern, with southwest, but more Texas southwest as opposed to Mexican southwest.  But never the less its also easy on the eyes. 
-The food is FRESSSSH and taste like everything is made from scratch.  After eating a few tacos you don't get that greasy, heavy, guilty feeling as you would elsewhere.  It seems like every item on the menu was created individually with its own recipe and taste.  No 2 tacos taste the same so you'll definitely have to try them all out.
-The seafood is def the highlight of the place.  Esp the scallop.  Scallop ceviche is good and the scallop taco is fab.  The fish tacos are great too, especially the battered crispy one.
-Ok so I lied, the drinks are the highlight of the place.  They have a good sized list of specialty drinks that they created themselves.  But not so long that its intimidating (that's what she said).  I like that its just not a Mexican restaurant and their only drinks are margaritas. They have a really good variety and they all taste good.  The drinks would be the only reason to come back
-They have a nice chill \"patio\"/outdoor that you can go and just hangout and drink on

The Bad
-Although every taco has it individual taste, that doesn't mean each taste is good. there are some taste and combinations that really just make you wonder.  Esp the chicken tacos.  
-although the seafood tacos are great, the regular meat is just ok.  I've been all around AZ eating all types of Mexican food and i'd like to consider myself an expert of tasting tasty tacos and Joyride's non-seafood tacos are deff a lackluster.  They just don't have the same taste, the flavor, the 'OOOOOMMMPH\" as others. The carne asada, the chicken, and the pork (carnitas)
-They have 6 different salsas, however only one of them is hot/spicy.  However the Spicy gradient is steep, we're talking tomato sauce to \"melt your face off\".  But no in betweens
-The music is def like that of a bar.  American 80s,90s and some contemp rock.  Isnt this a taco shop, atleast some Mexican music, you can even do Spanish rock. 
-The ambiance is LOUD, like El Hefe loud but with more hipsters and less Dbags. If you want to have a quiet conversation, def sit outside or go next door to postinos

The Ugly
-Everything here is expensive. $4 is the average price of ONE taco. Yes one taco.  The scallop is MKT price so you don't know what it is.  Although they are big and thoughtfully made. $4 is much. 
-They charge extra for salsa.  EXTRA FOR SALSA WHAT?  most Mexican places have a Salsa bar that you can choose from for FREE.  Its $2 for a small bowl of salsa.  

Pros:
-Great seafood tacos
-GREAT drinks specialties
-great atmosphere

Con
-very Americanize that its barely Mexican
-EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE. $4 per taco, $2 for salsa, $12 for ceviche
-loud and borderline El Hefe like....(shudders)

I would def come here to grab drinks and chill out on the patio but that's about it..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Far drive from where I live but it's worth it! Tacos are amazing, chips and salsa are delicious and the staff is always beyond helpful and attentive. One of our favorite stops for some yummy food! The drinks are also good."}
{"text":"Service is brutal!! Although friendly and seem helpful we sat on patio Tuesday Nov  25 for late lunch and it was 20-30 minutes before our bar drink arrived, water glasses empty and or waiting for straw or ice cubes. Over an hour and a half passed and I had to flag down a guy to see about ordering !!

God took forever and waitress was nowhere to be found.

When I was sat on patio I saw five other tables
Sat at the same time!! No help to patio waitress
To get water, drinks or orders .  I had a waiter come up to our table three times asking if the food in his hand was ours and each time we said no but wished as our waitress had not been to our table to take order!!!

Every table on patio had to demand check as the waitress was no where to be found to deliver it! ( u have cameras !! Watch them!!)

Upward project has a lovely concept of
Pooling tips
And everyone taking
Care of the table/ customer but what happens way too much is
The one waiter thinks the other waiter has it!

Bar service at Windsor is
Five
Stars and patio only at central - key players make experience awesome and what what I have grown to know over the last five + years"}
{"text":"One of the first Fox restaurants we visited when we came to the area. It never disappoints. You can always expect there to be a little bit of a wait, however, nothing that some visits to the bartender can't help with.  You can't go wrong with any of the tacos and definitely ask for the mango habanero salsa on the side for your chips. The Mexican street corn is the bomb and the service is too!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place and saw their Gilbert location get featured on the news one morning, so decided to finally give them a try.  I went in on a Tuesday, and sat through a 35 minute wait time, so to me this was a good sign this place will be good or they were giving away Free tacos for Taco Tuesday, either way it was good.  I was not disappointed the tacos were great!, fresh ingredients, very well seasoned and marinated meats. 

I really like that they put their own twist on each taco and add the right toppings, seasonings, to make it that much better. When you don't even need to add the hot sauce you know is good stuff!  Plus the service was great, I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried out this place for dinner tonight. Plenty of onsite parking and cool retro decor! The hostess was super funny and our wait staff were awesome and attentive! We tried the chips & salsa (first basket is free), guacamole was amazing and the elote was super yummy. My roommate and I both agreed that we like the appetizers more than our actual tacos. Though they weren't bad, they weren't mind blowing. I will say that they had tons of toppings which was nice. Wasn't too impressed by the side of rice as well. This seems like a good place for drinks and i really enjoyed the ambiance, not sure if I would come back for tacos."}
{"text":"I need to go back to Joyride. We went there when I wasn't feeling the best and I still enjoyed the hell out of my carne asada tacos (what I could get down, I was disappointed I couldn't eat more). The area is ideal if you're out and about in Downtown Gilbert. It is super close to the galleries and other attractions in the area. Watch yourself on the salsas. We asked for the hottest one they had and they charged for it. Granted the menu says that but we had just sat down and hadn't gotten to the menu. It wasn't worth the extra money. A sample first would have been nice."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by someone at work so I thought for sure it would be good, but I wasn't all that impressed. The atmosphere and décor is just trying way too hard to be retro and hipster. Im pretty sure you have to have an arm sleeve or at least 4 visible tattoos and 2 facial piercings to work there, but the service was over all pretty good. Drinks were refilled very quickly and the food was brought out promptly. Although, my boyfriend and I came in on an early sunday afternoon and were sat next to a huge group of loud women getting drunk which seemed like a poor choice considering the place wasn't half full. Even the way too loud music couldnt drown out the ladies having a good ol time. The food itself was good, just not anything more than that. We got the tuna for an app and it tasted like it wasn't very good quality. The enchilada wasn't that impressive either. Not sure if we will give this place a second chance, despite hearing good things about it from coworkers."}
{"text":"My favorite west coast dinner destination.  This place instantly makes you happy.  Get a margarita and a taco or two and you are set.  Relax inside or out.  Taco Tuesday is absolutely the best.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best street taco of my life! $2 taco Tuesday & I would have paid $5 each it was so good! Amazing margaritas & the best staff! Ambiance is amazing ..... Can't say enough good things about this place! Must eat here if in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My first time here, we showed up with a group of 12 people on a Saturday night and almost got laughed out of the place but all with a great sense of humor. They set up a place for us outside, which was mighty kind of them, and we had a wonderful evening.
I hate to give a review based on one evening and I definitely plan to come back soon and really experience the place.
From a \"first look\" perspective-the food is fresh and interesting-loved the complimentary smoky salsa-I had bites of several kinds of tacos and enjoyed all of them. The Blood Orange Margarita is tasty but like others have commented-it's a wee bit of drink for the price. 
I get the concept and I love it-fabulous ambience-fresh ingredients-unusual flavor profiles, clearly not Rubios-this is a destination place. But, that being said, Arizonians are used to great Mexican that doesn't bust the wallet. 
I'll be back for a second look!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY tried Joyride Taco House last Taco Tuesday! For such a cute & trendy place I was expecting decent tacos... What did I get? Ah-mazing tacos! The wait was long, but it did go by pretty fast. Probably because the service was speedy and how long could it take to whip up a few tacos?! I appreciated this, along with their awesome staff. 

I ordered 3 tacos off of the Taco Tuesday menu. Each delicious in their own way, but my fav had to be the \"Chicken Tinga\" taco. The \"Standard\" and \"Carne Asada\" were both good too! But that white magic they put on the Chicken Tinga was as good as they made it sound. Can't wait to come back soon for another Taco Tuesday, or Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Being from the east coast I was hoping to get some really good authentic Mexican food. I'm not sure I found that here,  but what I did find was fabulous. Great retro styling and a lively atmosphere make for a comfortable setting. I had time on both of my visits to try a couple different  Aguas Frescas my favorite was pineapple with tequila.  Highlights were, the pork taco and tortilla soup. Both were amazing!  The cucumber salad gets an honorable mention as well. The could have been a little better, was the Baja fish taco. It was a bit boring in taste. If I'm ever back in Phoenix I will be stopping back for a great time."}
{"text":"A comfortable, trendy place to sit at with friends and have a great good conversation with good food and good drinks. The perfect place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I usually go for happy hour. The pineapple mojito or the traditional marg is my favorite. Cant beat $2 tacos. Chips and salsa are great as well..although it is kind of silly that they started charging for a refill on that! :)"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is an amazing deal! I absolutely loved the decor, food, and drinks. Service was quick and good. I do feel the regular prices are a bit high though."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, great environment with tons of energy, excellent mixology & very good service"}
{"text":"The food, the staff and the decor deserve 5 stars no question. On busy nights you might want to make a reservation. 
I've been at this location a few times and every single time it is on point."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS  PLACE! Found them originally at the Scottsdale Taco Festival, but we love coming here for that friendly Central Phoenix vibe and the food is amazing. Short rib tacos are always juicy and they never disappoint. (I wasn't a huge fan of the fish.) I always get the watermelon margarita! It's so fresh! They also do house made horchata with almond milk, add a little rum and it's 10x better. Also, their house made cucumber mint juice is great with gin!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I missed out on JoyRide the past years it's been open but went last night and was so impressed.  The beast burrito chimichanga style was amazing.  Joyride's carne asada is the best carne asada I've had and I've had a lot of carne asada"}
{"text":"This place takes taco Tuesday very seriously!!! 1 hour wait time for $2 tacos. 

I didn't love the tacos but margs were good for 5 bucks each!! I tried the joy ride, blood orange, and prickly pear. Blood orange took the crown for me! 

Staff was great & I hope to try it another time without the wait and the regular menu."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to hang out with a group of friends during happy hour, great vibes and great service. Food lacked a little in flavor, everything was in dire need of lemon and the prices were not worth it for the food. For a drink or a quick eat on a Tuesday it's a great place but for some good Mexican food there are better places."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and the food was great, thanks to the Yelper recommendations! Mexican street corn is fantastic, I loved the vegetarian pinto beans, and the crispy fish tacos are awesome! My friend and I split an appetizer, 4 tacos, and a side of pinto beans. It came out to about $12. Worth a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Joyride was recommended to us by a friend. The wife and I went there last week and I haven't been able to stop thinking and talking about it. The Staff is awesome! Chris is a great manager! he was very helpful and talked to us for awhile. The food is AMAZING! Best Tacos I have had in a LONG time. Tortillas are amazing and the meat is insane! I am getting hungry just talking about it. Fish Tacos are insane with the white magic sauce! I highly recommend this place for day drinking with the rollup doors and awesome décor! For sure try the Almond Horchata with a spike of Vodka! I am going back again this week for sure! It is my new found Addiction!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour drinks on Tuesday cool atmosphere. Sat at the bar and was immediately greeted and got our drinks and food quickly."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Central Phoenix! The first time I came in I mentioned i was new to town so the manager sent over an order of nachos on the house. I have since been back MANY times and have had an awesome experience so far. For tacos my faves are the baja fish, crispy fish, but the best is the standard. The chicken burrito is surprising with an amazing blend of flavors and the sidewalk chilaquiles are amazing. Great margaritas, not super strong but only $5 on happy hour. Taco Tuesdays are great for cheap tacos. Joyride uses group service so the wait staff is attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun, I have enjoyed very different experiences from the bar, to the main restaurant, to the patio. A MUST for anyone looking for small bites and great drinks."}
{"text":"I love Joyride Taco House! I work about a block away, and my boyfriend and I live about five miles from the restaurant. We come here at least once a week. The food is always spectacular, there's a great happy hour, the atmosphere is upbeat, and the staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"So this place got 3 stars because they do have great food but I was very disappointed with some of the wait staff. When we first got there you had to literally flag down the waitress . She wouldn't come check on us and we had to keep flagging her down. Luckily her shift ended and we got an awesome waitress and great cute waiters. I hope to go back again and have better service. Btw the nachos are amazing! Love the carne asada taco. The original margarita (with better liquor)on the rocks is good too but way overpriced $11!  I think way too much for how little you get but its pretty strong so that's a plus I guess lol chips n salsa is pretty good too  sign up for their email thingy you'll receive a free appetizer and luckily for me the nachos are considered a appetizer. Whoohoo! Luv freebies"}
{"text":"I came with my wife and baby at 230 and ordered 3 tacos and it came with a side I never got the happy hour menu and I really wish the waiter informed that it was happy hour before I ordered. Besides that my server was really busy and I could tell. But the food was amazing 5 stars. That happy hour menu is one of the best I've ever seen. The atmosphere is fun and trendy kind of had that 80's cool vibe."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since they opened up a while ago. Several of my friends have been now several times and I finally got to go check it out. I am a fan. It is a great place to go with friends and have a nice conversation and meal. The tacos are quite pricey (hence the four stars) but they are tasty as well. There is also the street corn that my buddy got when we went there. He likes corn and he said it was pretty good. Overall, I would go back again, but only with friends. At least for me this locale is not somewhere I would go by myself due to the pricy-ness for Mexican food. Honestly, it's more of an American-Mexican fusion type of food place. Authentic Mexican foodies beware! Americanized ethnic foodies go here!"}
{"text":"Came in around 11am on a Sunday.... Awesome tacos and Mexican Street Corn. Great happy hour, daily from open to 5pm!!!! Can't beat $5 pitchers. Fast, excellent service and delicious food. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"I like this place despite the fact that most of my friends told me never to go here. However, I like it mainly for the atmosphere and cute decor. I went here for lunch last weekend expecting mediocrity and was pleasantly surprised, but mostly by the atmosphere and decor. The food is mediocre. There are definitely better Mexican and/or Southwestern food spots in Phoenix, but the patio and location are great. Service was just okay, but that is to be expected from most places in Phoenix these days anyway. Our server was nice, but looked as if she was on her way to the YMCA to workout. Not a deal breaker, but she definitely did not dress the way I would have  expected for the decor. It just did not match and that was the first thing that I noticed. She wasn't overly friendly nor was she standoffish. She was just okay, and I got the feeling that is the standard for this restaurant. I know that this place is a part of a grouping of restaurants owned by the same people  and this is definitely one of my favorites of their pursuits. Their cocktail list was really good, and, again, the ambiance was good. Would I come back? Yes. But, probably not for a while and not until I scoured Phoenix for a better alternative. Yet, it is close to my house so they will have my business again solely because of proximity and the fact that is was average relative to other spots close to me."}
{"text":"Went to Joyride hoping for a casual taco and a good marg. The restaurant was packed and super noisey. The food was very mediocre. I ordered the beast burritto which sounded tasty on the menu- carne asada, beans, avacado, and two types of salsa.  What they delivered to my table was not so appealing. It was a burrito consisting of 99.9% dry, unflavorful meat, hardly any salsa, beans, or avacado. I ordered a margarita which was very ordinary. The biggest reason I am rating the restaurant so low is because of the rediculously loud music blaring in the restaurant. The place was packed and noisey to begin with and then add the crazy loud music and it made the place almost unbearable. The decor and renovation were done very well. Unfortunately the medicore food and horrible atmosphere will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, but I would not have if it weren't happy hour. The tacos were a little over half the usual price and that seemed just about right for their quality. The full price would have completely out of the question. 

The decor is really fun and funky. It's like a hipster paradise in there. There are all kinds of cute seating areas, inside and out, and I think it would be really fun place to have a beer  or 12 with friends. 

I'll be back, if I'm ever in Phoenix again, but only during happy hour."}
{"text":"Just a tad pricey. They are stingy with their guac. The tacos Are quite small as well... But great food."}
{"text":"Slow service and food was below average. Not impressed at all. Super long wait. Ordered tacos and just wasn't good. Parking sucked too."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming one of my favorite joints in downtown Gilbert! Joyride has great food with a great vibe. Trio of tacos is a fantastic deal with diner's choice of ten different tacos. My favorite three are shrimp, fish, and braised beef and, since the side dish comes with, the back beans. I suggest eating at the bar. The bartenders make it a fun experience with their service and making sure the right games are on. In the booth, it's perfect for get togethers! Side note - the old school early 90's hip hop that happened to be playing was the cherry on top. On a final note, to the owner of Joyride, your manager is absolutely fantastic. He is epitome of the Joyride customer experience and his staff follows his lead. My server accidentally forgot my dish and he made sure to come by, apologize, thank me for my understanding and ask what dessert he could bring the table to make up for it. The pudding. The answer is always, \"The pudding.\""}
{"text":"Wowzers! This place's food is Rock&Roll in your mouth. Great service and great ambiance. The food is obviously prepared with fresh ingredients and you can tell. The meats they use in their tacos are slow cooked to perfection with love. Small portions on the street tacos and higher then expected price point but satisfied nonetheless. 

My only mark down comes from when we requested some cucumber slices instead of chips for the salsa. The cucumbers they delivered had mold on them. They were very apologetic; however, it should have been noticed (appeared the cucumbers came from the bar not the kitchen). Not to take anything away from their chips as they were really good and salsa outstanding."}
{"text":"We live in Awhatukee but take the drive to Gilbert for this amazing place! What a unique and fun place to go relax in or outside. The vibe is cool and contemporary.

The food is excellent and has a vast array of choices, The street tacos are out of bounds. The Mexican corn is unlike anything I have had. 

We have had Cisco 3 times and he is nothing short of a superstar he can do a hundred things at one time and very attentive.

This last weekend not only did we eat there for lunch we brought back a newcomer and friend the next day .

This place is a GEM"}
{"text":"Side note: I NEVER come to this part of Gilbert (don't live close by), but there's a cute few blocks of restaurants & I'd definitely venture out here again to try some other places. End aside...

I met a friend here for HH and really like it! It was on a Tuesday which meant \"Taco Tuesday (all tacos are $2 each).\" I had a crispy fish taco, that was good. The breading was crispy & the slaw that was on it was crisp as well. I also had a carne asada taco. The meat was a little dry, but it was still very good. We also had chips & salsa, and honestly all of this would have been a good meal. The tacos are pretty decently sized. 

However, since it was HH I ordered a quesadilla as well (intending to split it) and it was HUGE. It was thick, full of a ton of cheese, and was yummy. During HH Joyride does certain apps for $4 (the quesadilla was one of these) & $6. I saw a lot of people were ordering nachos & the platter they were served looked HUGE! 

I ordered a couple margs as well. I started w/a prickly pear even though I generally don't like flavored margaritas. Honestly, it was a bit sweet but still good. I also got a regular marg. It didn't stand out it in any way, but it was still good. 

The service at Joyride was good, as well. I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's just ok. The salsa is really good I have to say. I'm Mexican and picky about salsa. The rest of the menu is pretty gringo so if you're not picky about Mexican flavors then go ahead and enjoy it. It's not for me though. The service is pretty bad if you're dining alone I've noticed."}
{"text":"Whether it is a burrito, taco or nachos everything served at Joyride is delicious and is made with the highest quality ingredients. Did I mention it is at an affordable price as well? It's been a 5 star experience all three times I've been here."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the happy hour is great too. The place has a hip atmosphere and there is plenty of outside seating. The service is always spot on and quick."}
{"text":"Such great hospitality! The managers were awesome and threw in a free appetizer just fit if being our first time and the wait was fairly long! The queso dip was awesome! We are definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Such yummy food! Got the guacamole, pork and fish tacos and the caramel/pecan pudding dessert. All SO yummy and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and the wait was an hour on taco Tuesday around 8pm.. let me just say I would wait another hour for these delicious tacos!! So much flavor and so fresh! The warm chips with salsa were also amazing. I will be back!! Would have given 5 stars but our server didn't seem to like their job."}
{"text":"Alright, this place has an amazing bar with some awesome drinks. Food wise, not so great. I don't know if the chefs are of Hispanic decent but if they are then idk what kitchen they were raised in, if they aren't then they have no business making this food. Very flavorless. Growing up in a Mexican kitchen and enjoying the hipster scene I wanted to like this but just didn't happen. Amazing service and friendly staff. Will come back for the bar!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco spot on a Tuesday. The food is delicious and the drinks are strong. My friends and I have never had bad service and we keep coming back every week!"}
{"text":"This place is just OK. Atmosphere is great, food is average. Better tacos across the street."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I decided to grab a table on the bright and cheery front patio, filled with sunshine yellow chairs.  We immediately appreciated the fact that they saved the two substantial trees that helped to block the noise from Central Avenue.

Now down to business.  We were greeted by our server, who quickly brought our beverages, crunchy chips and salsa for starters.  

For lunch I ordered the \"Lunch Special\" which was a choice of 2 tacos (served on made-to-order corn tortillas) and choice of soup or small salad for around $10.  I chose the Shrimp Taco (with grilled shrimp, Mexican slaw and pico gringo), the Carnitas Taco (shredded pork, tomatillo salsa, cilantro & onion) and the Rhythmic Beet Salad (mixed greens, beets, papaya, avocado, goat cheese, toasted pepitas, cilantro & scallions in a honey champagne vinaigrette(recommended by our server).   

Everything was DELICIOUS!  And although I had plenty of food, I found myself wishing that I could order more just to try the great-looking combinations.  Every taco has slightly different ingredients. Not just a change in the protein, like most traditional Mexican restaurants. They also don't come with the heavy grease and mountains of grated cheddar cheese that you'll find on the majority of valley tacos. Each item was light, fresh and yummy!  

The service was prompt, friendly and courteous too!

I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu.  I'll be sure to take my camera for pictures too."}
{"text":"I give this place four stars for the happy hour prices.  I'd probably give it 3.5 if I had to pay full price. 

Went in on Monday around 4:30. Decently busy, but the three of us were able to get a table immediately outside. Nice patio area with a little bit of shade and well-placed misters. 

We all decided to get tacos ($2/piece at HR) and margaritas ($5 @ HR).  

We split an appetizer of guacamole which was very, very good. A small portion for $8, but we were saving on the tacos, so we decided to go for it. Definitely try it.  

I decided to go with three veggie tacos and a cucumber-serrano margarita.  My boyfriend had the same tacos and my friend had the braised beef, crispy fish, and baja fish (latter two not happy hour tacos, FYI).  I thought my tacos were pretty good, but lacked some depth of flavor.  My friend really enjoyed all three and even compared the crispy fish taco to some tacos she's had in Mexico! Not bad.  Presentation of all the tacos was spot-on. 

The margarita I ordered was a perfect sweetness and very refreshing. It came rimmed with chili powder and salt and a hefty slice of cucumber inside with small pieces of serrano. It wasn't spicy at all and I would've liked a little more heat, but it was definitely the best marg. at the table! The other two margaritas my friends ordered were unpleasantly sweet.  Those were the blood orange and the passion fruit margaritas. I'd skip those unless you're into adult fruit juice. 

My dinner-mates also got two sides (normally $1 with a purchase of 3 tacos). Even though my boyfriend's tacos were all happy hour options, she still gave him the $1 deal (you're not supposed to do that...She was very friendly). They also got the cucumber orange salad, which was lacking a bit in flavor. There needed to be a better cucumber-to-orange ratio (it was about 95% cukes); the other side ordered was the black beans. Those, on the other hand, were AMAZING. 

 
Staff is all very friendly and fun! Check this place out."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite taco place in the whole valley. Still has great flavor but they have dropped the quality of their Carne Asada. Last tacos I got chewed like bubblegum. No joke. Last three trips. They need to switch back to their old meat supplier, or  whatever they were doing different."}
{"text":"A very cute and vibrant spot! Loved the patio seating, and a fun place to go for a quick date night, or meeting with some girlfriends. 

The tacos are very good, but small so if you're a big eater you might want to get a little extra. 

It can get busy quick (especially at night), so make sure to come a little ahead of time to grab some parking and put your name down on the list. 

Have fun!"}
{"text":"Now you may not know me personally, but I can personally vouch for myself as a taco - Tuesday connoisseur. This is one of my favorite spots for Taco Tuesday. 

$2 tacos, $5 margs, some salsa on the side, and a happy Tuesday to all, and to all a good night. 

HERE'S THE DOWNSIDE - everyone knows how good this taco Tuesday is, so you will likely wait for a table! Do not fear -- their happy hour is eerily similar to their taco Tuesday specials, so if you can get here for happy hour any other day, you should plan your entire life around this. 

Enough about their specials, on to the food. The tacos are street-taco style, so a little smaller and great for sampling lots of different ones. I usually prefer flour tortillas, but the corn tortillas here are not bad. With that being said, I'm going to guide you towards the one taco that is on a flour tortilla anyway which is the Crispy Fish taco. The white magic sauce (I know it sounds a little fishy) is PERFECT on this taco. Definitely don't leave without ordering the Standard, since it got it's name for a reason. 

MARGS ON MARGS. 
I would suggest either getting the Joyride or the Prickly pear, but that is only because those are the two that I have tried and LOVED both. I think you'll be pretty happy with any of the choices. I have also tried the Agua Frescas (cucumber mint) and it really is quite refreshing.

They have a patio that is dog friendly (yay!) with heaters and a fireplace when its chilly outside. It does get pretty loud inside, so I try to stay outside. 

My only issue with this place -- service can be hit or miss. I have had some amazing, attentive servers who have brought my dog water, recommended new food, and have just been truly on-point and others that seem to forget that they are working and hang out near the bar the entire time. BUT of all the servers, I have never had a reason not to come back."}
{"text":"Joyride has the absolute best mini tacos. Their corn - out of this world. I love eating here! The staff is always excellent and quick- even on busy Friday nights!"}
{"text":"Love this place - the decor is awesome and the tacos are fantastic. I loved the grilled Mahi taco with the habanero salsa. Their chips and salsa are delicious, and they have Negra Modelo on tap. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Solid tacos.
Good salsa.
Nice guac.
Great atmosphere. 

PS: Try the shrimp and Asada tacos."}
{"text":"I tried this place with a friend while out to lunch today. The menu had many innovative dishes, they have taken your typical Mexican dish and spruced it up a bit. My friend ordered an enchilada plate that she raved about and I ordered a chicken taco and a cucumber and orange salad. I had never thought to combine those two but it was very refreshing. I will be going back."}
{"text":"My first review of joyride was 2 stars due to the poor quality of food. However, John the owner went out of his way to make up for this. I tried it again and had a much better experience! This time I tried a burrito in bowl form and it was good. The meat was very fatty but good flavor. You have to pay for chips and salsa after the first basket which is kind of annoying. The margarita was pretty good too. I gave joyride more stars this time around because of the atmosphere, the customer service, and how quickly you are seated."}
{"text":"I visited joyride for thr first time and i was blown away. The chicken tinga tacos were amazing and kate the bar tender provided such great service. I will definitely be making this one of my regular places."}
{"text":"Ugh I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. My girlfriend and I have driven passed this place a few times and since she loves Mexican food and it was our anniversary, we decided to give it a try. Initial impression of the place was good, great music, nice atmosphere, we walked in with smiles. After a 5ish minute wait we were seated and received our complementary chips and salsa. Chips were good, salsa was meh. This is where the experience went downhill. To make it short, horrible horrible service, we probably read the entire menu 5 times before anyone showed up. Anyway, on to the food, we both ordered carne asada tacos and carnitas tacos. Let me say, I enjoyed the pork tacos, good flavor, nice and juicy, very good. The carne asada on the other hand tasted like I was eating a burnt charcoal piece of meat. Once our mediocre meal was complete, we decided to take a nap since we had plenty of time before our server checked up on us. After giving us our bill twice (really?) we finally paid and left. Ugh this location is close and we had high hopes but alas another restaurant bites the dust."}
{"text":"Food: food was great! Great variety. Vegetarian burrito is so unique and delicious. They toast up one of the sides of the burrito so it gives it a contrasting texture to the softer veggie filling. The tomatio salsa on the side they provide is a must try. It really compliments the flavors of the various veggies in the burrito. 
The taco platter is not disappointing. The different meats all have different flavors: carnitas, carne asada and spicy chicken. It also comes with cabbage, avo, rice and beans. The taco tortillas have a stone toasted aroma. 
Def recommend the platter if you are indecisive about what taco to chose. 

Environment: the decor is so nice, modern with splashes of bright colors. Theme kind of in the 70s. Unique! 

Parking: self, plenty. 

Service: our main server seemed a little pushy when we were ordering, asked twice if we were done. When we were mid meal and enjoying our company, she interrupted and asked if we were ready for the check and if we wanted boxes. It made us very uncomfortable. We were at late dinner at 9pm, the place was not packed and they don't close till 11 so we were confused to as why she was so pushy. 

Overall: the food was great! I really enjoyed it. Service was really off and odd. It prevented a full 5. I may come back but on a slow time with weird service I can't imagine what prime time or what taco Tuesday is like."}
{"text":"Love this place!  from the food to the drinks to the service, this place is great in every way.  We have taken friends and family from out of town and everyone seems to always enjoy the experience.  Highly recommend.  Kid friendly too."}
{"text":"Joyride is one of many restaurants that I love down in this area! 

My husband and I like to try new places and this place grabbed our attention. For one, we like Mexican food and a great atmosphere and we got both with This place. 

We sat outside on their open patio and enjoyed some really good appetizers and a meal.

There taco Tuesdays and happy hours are awesome as well! 

Worth giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I love the margaritas buuuut the service confuses me a little because like 4 different people kept coming to me asking to take my order and eventually they got some food confused and it was just really overwhelming. Also the menu is really small and way overpriced for the quality and portion size."}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos!! Fun and casual environment! I eat here regularly and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Met a friend there for an early dinner.  It is decorated beautifully.  The light fixtures are fabulous.  My friend was running late but they sat me on the patio anyway.  The server did seem a little irked that my other party was tardy.  She kept coming by a bit too frequently to ask...So I ordered 2 citrus agua frescas that were very refreshing and not too sweet.  Then feeling bad that I hadn't really ordered anything yet, I ordered some guac and chips.  It was perfectly fine guacamole....not the greatest I've had, but there are some unusually good guacamoles in this town.  There was jicama in it, which was interesting.  When friend arrived, we ordered the grilled corn or eliote with cotija cheese and paprika and a sauce called White Magic.  I think it's an amped up mayonnaise.  The corn was excellent.  Had a real grilled, slightly charred taste that I love about it.  I had a trio of tacos, one shrimp, one pibil, one braised beef.   They are the small street tacos which have become so popular.   With a trio of tacos you get a free side.  I asked the server what the beans were spiced with and she said in a kind of spaced out voice, \"I don't know....salt?\"  That made us laugh.  My friend ordered a carne asada torta and was quite pleased with it and I had the shrimp taco left to take home.  The shrimp were fresh and cooked well, the braised beef taco was awesome and the pibil was just fine.  And those beans?  Meh...I think the sever was right about the spice being salt.  The only real problem with Joyride is one wants to sit on the patio but the chairs are the most uncomfortable things I have EVER sat on in a restaurant.  I kept looking longingly  inside to see the comfy chairs those diners were sitting on.  It was a long dinner and my butt still hurt the next morning.  They are cute yellow metal things though.  But perhaps Joyride should rethink the function following form thing and invest in something a bit less torturous.  I will just know to always sit inside in the future.  They open the whole side of the restaurant so you can get tables close to the edge of the patio and have the al fresco experience.  All in all, a solid meal.  Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot in Downtown Gilbert. During happy hour (2-6pm), there is a good selection of fish tacos and $5 margaritas. 

I've had three types of tacos: The Standard, Carnitas, and Fish. The fish was by far the best; it was crispy and the fish was cooked perfectly. The Standard and Carnitas tacos are decent, but not memorable. I pleasantly surprised at how strong the blood orange margarita as for $5, I expected a watered down one. The churros and chocolate are good as well. Not exactly authentic, but a good spot nonetheless. 

Only real complaint was that they were skimpy with the salsa and guacamole."}
{"text":"You have to check out Joyride. What a blast. Gilbert has needed an awesome new hang out and Craig Demarco has done it again. Sit at the bar and you will not be disappointed. IF you are lucky enough to have Chris(tall and bearded) as your bartender, you will have the best service in town. The fish tacos are great and the nachos are probably the best item on the menu to share. 

One again upward projects has provided an awesome restaurant and I can't say enough GREAT things about this place and it's staff."}
{"text":"$2 dollar tacos every day and not just on taco Tuesday's along with $5 dollar margarita's awesome happy hour seating available every day but Tuesday's are slammed busy..."}
{"text":"Loved the carne asada and fish tacos. The cucumber serrano margarita is the best. We did have to wait a while to be seated but it was all worth it."}
{"text":"I like Joyride, but please understand you must manage your expectations. This is not the place to get authentic Mexican food for cheap. I mean, C'mon, this is Gilbert. You should go to Carolina's in Central Phoenix if you want a delicious tostada for pennies. You go to Joyride for the hip atmosphere, the funky decor, and the spiked agua frescas. 

That being said, I love their Mix Tape salad (to which I like to add carne asada), and their almond horchata. The chips and salsa are good too, but I would pass on the Mexican corn. I think $5 for an ear of corn (no matter how much you dress it up) is ridiculous. I tried it, and it was okay."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is great the garden variety burrito is so good. The way the bar is set up is so nice . It's a really cool spot to sit and hang. And they have the best specials!!!! 5 till 5 and taco Tuesday!!!! What more you need"}
{"text":"Joyride is a really cool place! I recommend going on Taco Tuesday, for they have specails! It is a laid back open atmosphere, kind of on the hipster side, friendly attentive staff and a decent size menu. I recommend their carne asada tacos, guac and chips and if you are not in the mood for tacos, their enchiladas are pretty tasty. AZ is finally having some awesome weather, go sit out on the patio and have some good food!"}
{"text":"The best Carne Asado ever!!  Wow, just wanted a pile of it!  Love the atmosphere and vibe there...will definitely be back. Also, the most incredible service by all the bartenders as we sat at the bar."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy!
Enjoyed every bite of the chips & salsa they bring to the table, the guac, the quesadilla with peppers & onions...delicious and I can't wait to go back!

Ps, the service was great, friendly & quick (in a good way!)."}
{"text":"great food and drinks! almond horchata is delicious and good beer."}
{"text":"Can you say OMFG on here? This place is amazing. The food. I don't think I've had a better taco anywhere! And the guacamole was out of this world! The service was outstanding. And an amazing atmosphere! Already craving it again! My only suggestion...please please please build one in Goodyear!  We will be back no doubt!"}
{"text":"Amazing street tacos! Even better is their happy hour and taco Tuesday prices on them!"}
{"text":"Had heard good things and ended up being pretty disappointed. 

Got 3 different tacos all of them were cold when they were served - like they had been sitting waiting to be brought to the table.

Crispy fish - best of the 3, would have been a good taco if it wasn't cold

Chicken tinga - cold, gross tortilla, decent flavor 

Carne Asada - awful. Cold, gross tortilla, bland tasting and the steak was poor quality.

The chips and salsa - chips were heated nicely and salsa was very flavorful.

Service was prompt and friendly.

Overall, Joyride has a great ambience and nice patio with open air feel. Just don't come here to eat!"}
{"text":"Love. This. Place. $5 pitchers of craft beer and awesome tacos keeps me coming back couple times a week. Shout out to the staff, especially Jeremy that always make me feel welcome. It's connected to the federal (which haven't been to yet) and The Windsor and Postino. High marks all around!"}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars for cool ambiance and  eing very Photo worthy. The street that it's on is great for walking around as well. The food was good, but not at all authentic or filling, and overpriced. I left hungry after sharing a platter of tacos with 2 others and spent 2-3x what id expect at an authentic mexican taco spot."}
{"text":"Imagine that Jonathan Adler decided to make a taco shop in Phoenix, Arizona, and you've got this place. There isn't enough parking for even the lunch crowd, and I got there a little after noon on a Friday. They were already on a wait list for tables, but I was dining solo and easily got a spot at the bar. I loved the geometric turquoise wallpaper and giant gold lamps, but wondered if the tacos would be as excellent as the interior design. I opted for the lunch special and got a glass of lemonade because I was working that afternoon (although looking back, I should have made it a margarita!). The lemonade was fresh squeezed and refreshing, and a cool breeze came through the open restaurant as I waited for my food, which made me feel like I was on vacation... although coming to the southwest from the northeast in February is a vacation even if I had to work the whole time! 

The server at the bar - a curly dark haired skater-looking girl with backwards hat, was extremely friendly. I heard her recommend the quinoa salad as a side to the women next to me, and I am so glad I was eavesdropping! I got the salad as well as two tacos - The Standard and a carnitas taco. Everything was ridiculously good with juicy tender meat and slices of avocado on top. I don't think I left a crumb on the plate. It was a perfect, quick, and economic lunch, coming it at just over $10! Plus, chips and salsa come for free. I highly recommend this spot to locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"I write this while holding back my vomit. I came in with a huge party on a family vacation. I ordered a blood orange margarita and a carne asada burrito bowl.

They \"forgot\" to put my drink order in, so 20 minutes later (after everyone finished theirs) mine finally came. 

The burrito bowl was inedible. I couldn't stomach it. My boyfriend thinks he's gonna box it and eat it later, but I truly wouldn't even feed that to my dog. Shocked that people choose to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, most places will charge you 9 bucks for a drink and it will taste awful, that is not the case here at joy ride, the drinks are amazing and the staff is amazing. The food here is to die for and I will be telling all of my friends about this place I love it."}
{"text":"Trendy taco place in the heart of Gilbert downtown. We went there on Fri night at 8pm and had to wait 50mins before we got the table. While we waited we sipped on their margaritas and horchatas. I loved the cucumber Serrano pepper margarita, I was made just perfect for my taste. Almond horchata was too cinnamony though. The highlight of the food was their Mexican street corn. Fantabulous !!! Tacos were good but nothing extraordinary. Crispy fish taco and chicken Tinga were the best amongst the ones we tried. Must go place for their Mexican street corn and margaritas I would say."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while and it was absolutely delicious!! Loved their salsa  and guacamole was soon good.  I ordered three tacos shrimp,  crispy fish and Carne asada and they were incredible! I loved their tortillas also! Service was great and I also ordered  a side cucumber orange salad that was amazing and the churros for dessert  with cajeta  are a must!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick bite before heading to another spot and we stumbled upon their $2 Taco Tuesday.  Although you cannot select any taco from the menu the choices provided are quite good.  I had 3 tacos the Standard which was my favorite, the pork was okay and the carne was typical, no surprises.  I have to say that the Prickly Pear margarita was the absolute best!!!!!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness 4/5
Happiness - 4/5

First, the staff is remarkably friendly. They checked up on us constantly throughout the meal and all had a good sense of humor. 

My son devoured his kids' quesadilla and enjoyed getting a fake tattoo. I had a brisket burrito bowl and while I could have used a little more meat, it was absolutely tasty. My wife had three tacos and, while I usually think chicken tacos are usually boring, both types packed in flavor.  The salsa was flavorful and added a nice kick of heat at the end. The only issue I had were that the tortillas, taco shells, and chips were a bit bland (thus, I was glad I ordered the burrito in a bowl). I'd also skip out on the fish taco - a little overcooked and you can get better and cheaper ones from other places. But these are very small critiques as the meals overall were uniformly delicious. 

Tuesday seems like a great day to come - $2/taco and happy hour drink prices. They also have a curated mescal list, which I definitely want to try. I'll be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Round 2 this time for dinner. Realizing all these local Gilbert restaurants do not take reservations is a huge turn off for us. 6:30, and it was a 45 minute wait for a party of 2 and honestly the managing of the table space is ridiculous...sitting 2 people in a huge booth for easily 6. Badly designed, bad seating management.

The food as I had reviewed before was really good, service was excellent. The $8 Citrus Vodka was so weak (not worth the calories). The basic margaritas were excellent. We had the Guacamole and Chips, 3 Taco platter with a side, and The Beast burritos w/no sauce.

If we came again for dinner I would either advice eating earlier (then I feel like an early bird \"snow bird\") or coming late late."}
{"text":"I like it. The ambiance and decor are awesome. The drinks are great and different, I like picking the different soda flavours and pairing with an alcohol. The food is good, I think I need to try more things to get a better impression. The tamales I had were over steamed was soggy on the end but dry everywhere else. Need to try the tacos."}
{"text":"Great place that fits right in with downtown Gilbert. 

First off, I love the feel of the building. Makes you feel your in California next to the beach.  The place is very clean with a modern/hipster feel.   That have a decent beer selection and their personal pitchers is the way to go!! Hands down. You tell me personal and beer pitcher in the same sentence and I'm sold. You had me at hello!! 

Now for the tacos!! Some say they are small and they can be a bit pricey, but these pack a lot of flavor and and order of 3 will more then get the job done.  I love how they let you mix n match. I love the chicken, barbacoa, and the steak. Can't go wrong. 

But for all the love of tacos do not skimp on the sides. The Mexican corn is out of this world delicious and the black beans are legit!!  

I came more often when I lived in the area, but still try and find time to find my way back as often as I can."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is very tasty, the prices are quite moderate, the staff is upbeat and attentive. When the glass wall is open to the patio, it doesn't get any lovelier. Suggestion: The street corn is amazing. Have them take it off the cobb. Much easier to eat and it's incredible."}
{"text":"Best. Place. Ever! Definitely my favorite place in town for tacos. The atmosphere is really cool, everyone is really nice, they have an amazing happy hour ($5 pitchers and margaritas) that runs often, and the best Mexican street corn I've ever had. Actually, all of their food is the epitome of perfection!"}
{"text":"Great place for taco tuesday if you can come after 2pm.  Also $5 pitchers until 5pm. Music is way too loud almost feels like you're at a concert."}
{"text":"Had a very nice evening here and the food and service was excellent. They even introduced me to Victory IPA which is now a staple!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and plan on going back again!  My first visit was almost a year ago. It was a Friday night and really busy. My friend and I were given a 45 min -hour wait but we were lucky that some people left the bar so we ate there. The tacos and drinks were great and I kept telling myself I have to come back!
I visited again a couple days ago for a work gathering. We were there during happy hour which they have $2 tacos as part of their special. I tried the Carne Asada, the Standard and Chicken Tinga tacos. We also shared the street corn, guacamole, and the churros with chocolate on the side. The carne asada, street corn and guacamole was lacking flavor but rest of the food was good. Service was good. They didn't look to busy and we had about 4 people serving our table of 8 so it was confusing to figure out who was our server. The atmosphere was fun and inviting. I am curious to try out some more food so I plan on going back and I'll take some pictures for ya! =)"}
{"text":"Tried Joyride for a late night taco dinner. The atmosphere was very hip and trendy, fun and inviting. We almost felt like we were back in San Diego! The wait was a bit long but we found out it was worth the wait. The staff was very friendly as well. They have delicious chips and salsa, we couldn't stop eating them! My boyfriend ordered three of the beer battered fish tacos and I ordered three tacos as well, beer battered fish, Carnitas, and chicken. For our side dishes my boyfriend had black beans and I had the orange and cucumber salad. I thought the Carnitas and fish tacos were fantastic although I didn't care for the chicken. My boyfriend said the black beans were fine and my salad was okay. I put a little salt and pepper on it to make it less bland, maybe more than two mini oranges? We did feel the prices were a little high for tacos. However, because the tacos and chips and salsa were so tasty we would absolutely recommend this place, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious! We've tried the gilbert location when they first opened and liked it, so we knew it would be good. We came here with another couple to have some drinks and tacos. And boy did we have those drinks and tacos! Lol $58 dollars later, full of tacos and with a tipsy boyfriend it was time to head out. We tried the carnitas, shrimp, carne asada, and crispy fish tacos. All of them were seriously good. My malibu and pineapple drink wasn't something I'd order again...it tasted like I was drinking flowers, it was odd. But my man drank that along with his two long island iced teas which he said was different but still good. Fyi, in the 5 years we've been together I've never seen this man order anything but a good quality beer, so that was strange! After some hilarious and raunchy wonderings of what \"white magic\" was (remember, tipsy people) we learned it was a delicious lime aioli-baja type sauce. MmmmmMm. Also their chips and salsa are sooooo good! We basically all filled up on that before dinner. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that their sides are very disappointing, nothing special about them at all and everything is a bit pricey here. We'd definitely be back. This is a perfect place for yummy food while you're having some drinks with great friends."}
{"text":"Super cute decor and the tacos are pretty tasty. Service is great. The mexican street corn wasn't my favorite. I love everything from the Upward Projects group but unfortunately, this isn't my favorite spot for tacos."}
{"text":"I parked a few blocks away because they have no parking lot. Walking over in an alley behind, a dude stopped and hollered at me for walking on his road. (There was no sidewalk or other way to walk to this joint)  I was seated in a booth with no lighting. A dark place with nice sunlight coming in the open double doors a few feet away. Perhaps one little light for mood, if not to allow a businessman the ability to read some documents over lunch.  The lunch special was hidden and off the menu. I knew it was 10 bucks and was the reason why I gave this place a chance.  Ordered two tacos and some kind of salad that looked like something served   at a Star Wars restaurant/bar in the movie.  The fish taco was ice cold. The shredded beef in the other taco was lukewarm at best, but tasty. 

Forget the sauce for the chips. It is too hot!!! And nothing else to replace it. So I munched on the chips, which was the only item I loved, being a corn husker from Iowa. The soda came and walla, a broken chipped and sharp edge glass contained it. Was watered down D. Pepper. Sent that back and no replacement came until I was almost done eating the chilled tacos.  Got one free due to the screw up.

Finally, watch that strange salad on the special. The peas are petrified and \"rocks\". I am not kidding, I almost chipped a tooth until I wised up to sort them out of the salad. Insane to put those in any food that you charge money for.  The servers, were overdoing the nicey thing. Except one who walked by and said \"You could have downed a Margarita by now\"  Hey Joyride Taco, I don't drink so can you please keep your stupid flyby comments to yourself?

Oh, BTW, there were only millennials in there for lunch. Except one dude that was older that looked like a former hippy.  The grunge head banging music was maxed out most of the time I was there and making me wish I had went to Joe's across the street where seniors are welcomed. If  you are older than 35, don't go here!!!"}
{"text":"Clearly a popular taco/bar spot - it was busy! You can use the No Wait app to get in line before arrival.  Cool interior, large garage doors open to outdoor seating, bar area inside. I like the atmosphere created by dim lighting, but it was too dark to read the menu - had to break out the phone flashlight to read it.  Good menu - my party was pleased with everything ordered. I had two tacos - carnitas and crispy fish. Enjoyed both but favored the crispy fish.   The carnitas was a richer, heavier flavor. Crispy fish was lighter and fresher in spite of the fried fish. Also enjoyed by others at my table - chips n' salsa, beast burrito (chimi style), orange cucumber salad, bandit taco platter (favorite on the platter was the black beans and carnitas), Mexican street corn (another favorite). Will definitely be back my next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"I've been to Joyride a few times now and Upward has done it again. They have built a little Monopoly in my hood and I couldn't be happier. Both times I have been here I rode my bike, they have ample bike parking and a big patio.

The bar is gorgeous with the stained glass vases and the concept of the restaurant is very laid back and open. I have a feeling I will be spending a lot of time here when I can pull myself away from the Windsor. 

I also love that they honor the Upward tradition of $5 till $5 on pitchers and wine. 

The tacos are street style and with so many street style tacos shop these days it is hard to find something phenomenal on the menu. That being said though everything I tried was very good. The carne, the nachos and the salsa will all keep me coming back for more. 

I'd love to see them do brunch!"}
{"text":"This is one of our regular stops. Whoever designed this little cluster of restaurants did it right. Besides the great food the place looks awesome and just has a good vibe. We have tried damn near the entire menue and hevent been disappointed yet. By far the best waiting staff around. You will not be ignored."}
{"text":"Could I give 5 stars? Maybe, but as I refine my yelping, I've become more selective on doling them out, which is not fair because earlier in my yelp experience I gave them out like a drunk sailor on shore leave.  So factor that in. 

I will say we had an awesome experience at Joyride and I will go back.  The service was excellent from the front desk on.  A sweet hostess, super cool waitress and a gentleman who I believe was the manager all attended to our group with the type of genuine sweetness I find lacking in most of these concept driven Hipster employed venues.  This paved the way for an excellent night as it put us in the mood to enjoy the food and atmosphere.  

We loved the space, and really loved the music which made it hard not to tap toes too (and with speakers in restroom's we joked that we might have had an after party dance club in there). 

The food was serviceable, braised tacos were out favorite and nothing was bad per se, but really it was the overall experience we enjoyed and the food hit the spot.  

My only negative was that I rarely eat sweets, so we got churro's and i'm spoiled being from LA where I can get them so soft and fluffy and flaky and delicious, these seemed like carboard by contrast."}
{"text":"I love love this place!!! The $2 tacos are the bomb and the $5 margaritas always taste so fresh!! Oh and the mexican street corn...soooo good!    If you ever get a chance to go on \"Taco Tuesday\" I'd advise you go early, otherwise your liable to wait an hour or more!! 

The only negative about this place is their parking! It's hard to find a spot if you go after 3pm any day.."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, drinks (minus the one made incorrectly, promptly replaced) were fabulous. Wait staff was atrocious. It was a busy Saturday night and our water was not refilled once, we would've ordered more drinks had anyone stopped by our table or asked. After sitting staring at dirty dishes and empty glasses for 45 mins, watching both our waiter & waitress walk by without acknowledging us or so much as making eye contact, we flagged one of them down to ask for our check. I expect attentive, pleasant service and was completely underwhelmed."}
{"text":"If you want slow service, sit at the bar. It will be really fun... you can watch them laugh and text their friends instead of provide good service. Food is mediocre, could use more seasoning."}
{"text":"I had six... Yes six fantastic tacos here. Top three are as follows... Crispy fish, carne asada, and carnitas. All six of them were damn good though. I could and would eat here every night if I had a lot of money and didn't live in Chicago."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant with high hopes--everything else in downtown Gilbert has been good so we expected the same. We showed up and waited for 15 minutes and realized nobody else was waiting. I asked for our status in line and we had been deleted. I wasn't too concerned, they added us back to the list and sat us quickly.

Once we got a table the fun began. We sat for another 15 minutes waiting for someone to come to the table (for context, it was a Thursday not Fri-Sat). I eventually had to wave someone down to get help. We finally got our orders taken, a few beers, shrimp ceviche, some burritos and tacos. First came the ceviche and complementary chips with salsa--before the beers--and it tasted like they took frozen cocktail shrimp and tossed it with marinara; the chips and salsa weren't too bad. I think we got our beers halfway through eating our appetizers however we didn't receive any other help until we were essentially beer-less, chips and shrimp consumed. We were sitting there twiddling our thumbs for another solid 10-20 minutes. 

Finally, our entrees arrived. This is where they get the stars because everything else was awful. I had the beast burrito which was good and someone with me had the chicken tacos that they also enjoyed. But, of course, we had to wait another 10-20 minutes for someone to come ask for more drinks/check/assistance. We sat there patiently with empty plates till I finally had to wave someone down, AGAIN.

In total, I believe our waiter came to our table a total of 2 times over an hour +, everyone else would come by and drop off our stuff without making eye contact or saying a word--maybe they could sense my frustration.

It seems like everyone who works in there is a young teenager which most likely contributes to their awful service--just not enough experience. If I was rating based on food alone it would have been a 3.5-4 but we just couldn't get over how awful the service was."}
{"text":"They have Really good salsa but I was not a fan of their tacos. The environment is good, looks great for happy hours."}
{"text":"Update.... They no longer carry the ahi stack or the ahi. :-((( this one was of the top three meals I've had in Phoenix (native) and I am bummed. I've never had anything else there because I couldn't abandon that dish. They cut the menu in about half ;(. The service was still great and so was the prickly pea margarita, but my salad was horrible. I couldn't eat more than a few bites because I was gagging. It had those crunchy peas they have in certain trail mixes that might appeal to some but to me it was like dirt. The weird dry mushy pinto beans at the bottom didn't help. I will come back for drinks and nachos but the ahi made this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Just writing this review is making me hungry. First, the ambiance is awesome. The decor is fun and trendy and they play great music. It is a fantastic place to just relax and grab a bite with friends. The staff are all friendly and the customer service is great. They're quick to refill your drinks and if anything is wrong with your order (only happened to us once, forgot the enchilada sauce on a burrito) they are quick to fix it. 

We ordered a taco trio (carne asada, chicken tinga, & Baja fish) they were all fantastic but the carne asada was by far the favorite. The bomb black beans that came with the tacos were amazing! Seriously, for something as simple as black beans they were so tasty. My husband got The Beast burrito enchilada style with red and green sauce. That was delicious too. The Pork Adobado Torta was absolutely amazing! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The toasted bread was perfect with the saucy meat and the side salad that came with it was a perfect light complement to the heaviness of the sandwich. 

All in all, an awesome place, can't say enough great things about it! Can't wait to go back and try something new. If the trend continues, I'm sure whatever I pick from the menu next will be stellar."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to a 4 star.  I ordered two carne asada tacos and one standard taco which is their slow roasted chicken. I normally don't like carne asada tacos because the meat is usually chewy but I loved theirs! Great quality beef & tender and the seasoning is delicious! After trying the standard once again to see if I liked it this time, I did not. It was cold and the meat is pulled. If the chicken was grilled and more seasoning I think I would have liked it better. Beans and rice are very good and I really liked the guacamole. Their fire roasted salsa is too spicy for my liking. The service was a lot better than last time although it was still a little slow. I'm glad I gave this place another chance!  I will definitely be back for the carne asada tacos and guacamole."}
{"text":"Happy hour is definitely my time to go for cheap bites and refreshing drinks. Joyride always has one lively 2pm-close happy hour on taco Tuesday. The interior of this place is my favorite. It's trendy and fun with relaxing indoor and outdoor seating. We reserved our table on OpenTable, there was about a 15 min wait until we were seated inside. 

We quickly ordered drinks and tacos off the happy hour menu. I got a Strawberry-Hibiscus margarita. I'd say it was an okay drink, I didn't get any hibiscus flavor only a subtle strawberry note. It also wasn't as cold as I'd like it to be, I only drank about half of it. Next were the tacos! I dug into a crispy fish taco, The Standard, and a cranita. All their tacos come on a made in house corn tortilla. I'd say they're more okay than anything real special. There isn't any wow flavors from the masa. The taco fillings themselves weren't bad but also nothing to write home about. I wish the guac had some more flavor and surprises to it. The crispy batter on the fish was my favorite out of the three. We also got rice and beans. The beans were also pretty standard. Although I can't say the same for the rice. It had a strange after taste that I was not a fan of. We had our waitress take it back, she was very sweet and accommodating.

All in all an okay eating experience. I love how trendy and lively it is here. In terms of the tacos there's better options in Tempe/Phoenix. I'd only come back if friends wanted to drop by."}
{"text":"Food is incredible, friendly service hit or miss but doesn't really matter because tacos are amazing. Live down the street, would come here at least once a week most likely twice. Go for dinner last night and out of nowhere now they charge for chips and salsa refills? Yeah I'll be taking my money to a restaurant that doesn't charge for that. If you were going to charge for refills you should have started out that way, instead of deciding down the road. Bad move."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now - Tuesdays are great values with $2 tacos all day and excellent happy hours.  Food, drinks and service are great.  Staff is very friendly and they keep an eye on everything plus keep the place clean even when extremely busy. We always have fun here and it doesn't bust your wallet."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have written a review on Yelp.  I own several businesses in the service industry and am highly critical of them.    Joyride is wonderful, their food, their personal service, everything that I have experienced.  A special shout out to Clint their manager I believe for making my experience one to remember."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place was so bomb. First off, everyone needs to get the almond horchata. I don't trust a person who tries the joyride horchata and doesn't like it. The tacos are unbelievably tasty. Literally, doesn't matter which one you get. Orgasm in your mouth. Make sure you get the habanero salsa also if you are a spicy fan. It does spicy salsa justice, and then some. Can't wait to come down and get more tacos!!"}
{"text":"I had plans to go with a friend to Joyride last night.  Yesterday afternoon, I read a review of Joyride in the Phoenix New Times, and it was less than enthusiastic.  It basically said that the atmosphere was cool, but the food was all pretty bland.  Unfortunately, I have to say that I agree with the reviewer. 

I arrived around 6:45 on a Wednesday, and there was a 30 minute wait.  My friend and I sat at the bar, and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  We were seated at a great table that was kind of half inside and half on the patio.  The weather was perfect last night, so I definitely enjoyed that.  We started off with chips and guac.  I read one Yelp review from yesterday that raved about the chips and guac, and, I honestly have no idea why.  The chips were very bland, as was the guac.  I LOVE good chips and guac, so I was disappointed.  I wasn't crazy about the salsa either, which I also thought was bland.  Although the New Times review specifically had talked about the fish taco being soggy and fishy, I tried it anyway b/c my friend had ordered them at the Gilbert location and said they were the best fish tacos ever.  Well, there must be some disconnect between the two locations, because this fish taco was nothing to write home about.  It wasn't soggy, but it was definitely on the fishy side compared to other fried fish tacos I've had, and the white sauce that they put on it was basically flavorless.  I also had a carne asada taco, which our waitress said was her favorite.  It was pretty good, but nothing special...definitely better than the fish, though.  Finally, I had a side of the street corn.  I am very picky when it comes to Mexican street corn, and this wasn't great.  I don't know what it was, but it almost tasted like mayonnaise.  Usually I love the creamy sauce that comes on street corn in restaurants, but I wasn't feeling it at Joyride.

I would really like to give Joyride 2.5 stars, but I can't, so I'm rounding up for great service, cool atmosphere, and for the fact that none of the food was awful.  I don't think I'll go back, though.  Yes, it's a cool atmosphere, but, if I'm going to have to wait half an hour on a Wednesday, I want great food as well.  Plus, it was so crowded that my friend and I almost had to yell at each other.  I ordered pretty much all the same things at Gallo Blanco last month and was blown away, so I think I'll head there instead next time I'm craving tacos and street corn."}
{"text":"We enjoy the experience of eating at Joy Ride; the vibe and decorations are amazing! However, it's a little pricey and the food always seemed rushed even though the wait for a seat and your food is quite long. When we go we always set aside all night because we know we'll be waiting a long time, but it's to be expected in such a trendy area! We LOVE downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Great food! But not worth the HORRIBLE SERVICE! Took about 15 mins for drinks that included a dr pepper. The server said the bartender is working hard... On my dr pepper?? Asked for more chips and salsa 3 times. Never got them. Food came out fast though. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Awesome location and perfect vibe. Decor is awesome but the food and drinks are to die for. Spent a wonderful afternoon eating the incredible food and some great specialty drinks. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great vibes, delicious tacos and yummy drinks. They have happy hour starting at 2p & I will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the hippie sublime cool vibe. The service was friendly but slow. Weekends expect to wait but you can stop by postino for a drink and they Text you when your seat is ready. Tacos and salads are good and unique. Service for food was slow but it was also a Friday."}
{"text":"Was eating chips and salsa and bit into a thin 3 inch wire! The waitress just said sorry and brought new salsa. No comp was given for anything and spent 50 dollars on two people. For the amount you shouldn't be finding metal in your food."}
{"text":"We came in and the only seating inside was the bar so we opted to sit there. Jay was our server and he was outstanding however we couldn't help but watch the other employees. We noticed a server named Jackie shorting customers on their well paid drinks. She was dumping a good portion out and then adding more ice to compensate and reusing mixing cups. We also noticed that she would have drinks dripping off her hands then putting her hands in the ice bin. As we sat watching the people next to us got to listen in on how a certain employee would talk to her and made things awkward. Joyride in the past has been phenomenal but, this experience has been the worst for us. I would hate to be the person who paid 9-10$ for a margarita and got shorted."}
{"text":"A bit of a wait most nights but an outstanding place to eat. Only thing I'd wish they would change is for the margaritas to have a frozen option, But don't worry they're still delicious"}
{"text":"If you like sea food this is your thing! I got shrimp with fries, I would go back for it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Carne Asada taco and the shrimp taco. Shrimp taco did not have much flavor in it. The carne asada taco was delicious! Prickly pear margarita is very sweet and syrupy, but good! Could not drink more than 1. Great spot and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Joyride is delicious and fun. A bit overpriced, but the lunch specials are great. I enjoy the two taco and salad special. Keep in mind their happy hour ends at 5"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Joyride Taco for a while now so took the opportunity to have lunch there.  Bottom line, definitely go for drinks if you're in the area but skip the food.

Joyride and all the other restaurants in downtown Gilbert aren't easy to get to.  Traffic in the area is congested and parking is hard to find... unless you park a block west of everything and the walk from that parking lot is full of dirt/mud/holes/barriers to hurdle.

The place was about 1/4 full at 1pm on a weekday.  Service was great except for the person who dealt with us most - our waitress.  We waited ten minutes before our drink order was taken, water was never refilled and she left our bill when we weren't even done ordering.  Much of our service was done by other people, though, and they were better than great and phenomenally professional (except for their hiring ability, apparently).

They brought free chips and salsa, and the salsa was really good.  I'm still not sure about the chips because they seemed house made but were thick like store bought.  The drinks were downright amazing, great beer selection the the cocktails were perfectly balanced and just this side of too strong.  Yes.  I thought the liquor prices were very good for the quality.

My biggest memory of Joyride was the food, which was so boring.  Everything lacked flavor.  The pork tacos were juicy but had no flavor even with a squeeze of lime, and their tortillas were too soft and just fell apart upon pick-up.  They desperately needed something like cotija or a flavorful crema...salt, even.  The pinto beans were a joke.  No flavor again - they actually tasted just like the Ranch Style Beans my mom used to serve from the black can.  I saw some green flecks that looked like jalapeno but the taste was not there.  This bland food might pass in Chicago but not here.  blecch"}
{"text":"Ohai.  Tacos are good but expensive and so are the fresca.  Try to make it to happy hour(no food just drinks) Use coupons when able. Kthxbai"}
{"text":"I haven't had the pleasure of visiting the Gilbert location, so I came in with high expectations based solely on my stellar experiences at the other Uptown restaurants. Today was the hard open, and I must say, I'm pretty impressed. I love how the staff rotates between Windsor, Parlor, Postino's, and now here. Upon arrival, we were greeted with fresh tortilla chips and deliciously spicy fire roasted salsa, and served our beers shortly thereafter. We opted for the ceviche appetizer to start, and damn! I'm a ceviche addict, and theirs rivals Hula's in awesomeness. Fresh shrimp, tomato, avocado, cucumber, onion, the obligatory lime juice, and... jicama. Jicama! Quite a satisfying crunch. For our entree, my accomplice and I split the El Capitan torta- a fresh toasted bun with carne asada, salsa, avocado, and shredded lettuce. The torta COULD be piled a little higher, based on the size of the bun, but the flavors were stellar, fresh, and just plain freaking delicious! We closed the meal out with fresh churros with chocolate dipping sauce, but I was much too full too eat more than half of one!
Rest assured, Joyride is now on our roster of neighborhood restaurants to bicycle to. I'm in love!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Went on taco Tuesday. Happy hour prices. Had the carnitas and it was ok. Carne asada - bomb! Crispy fish out of this world and the Standard was soooo good. 

Need to visit if you're close"}
{"text":"Went on Tuesday for my favorite.. TACO TUESDAY! Have been many times and has been pretty status quo. 
This past Tuesday we sat out on the patio. Mogan was kind of out of it. 
Took our drink orders and someone did show up with chips/salsa. 
Then someone came with 3 waters!! Excellent. 
2 of us eating and one of us wanting tacos. 
My friend ordered the tacos and we were just chillin. 
Boom here comes the tacos.... no margaritas. 
Ugh.. I hate that.  Why would anyone want to eat before cocktails. 
No apology. Nothing.
Then... drinks come and she shows up with her replacement. Felt bad for him.  We asked for more drinks... and mentioned that drinks came 
after food before.  He too apologized. 
We asked for the check.... she didn't say much but did in fact bring the bill. 
No thank you.... no nothing. 
She was not with it. That I know."}
{"text":"To start off it was an hour and 30 minute wait. Many people were being seated before us which was a bit weird.. and an hour and 30 minutes was a really long time.. We became the only ones waiting while there were many tables open. After the host left and a new one came we got a text right away that our table was ready? Hmm.
We were sat and the place was almost empty.
I ordered 4 tacos-
The standard -4/5 The best out of the bunch.
Carne Asada- 3/5 it was good but so much fat on it..
2 Pork Adobada- 1/5 had a really nasty after taste..
Chips and salsa- 5/5 too bad the second round is $2 bit much for chips and salsa..

The food took a ridiculous amount of time, again another hour and 15 minutes for our food on top of already waiting an hour and 30minutes. We ordered quickly too, being that we waited so long we had already looked at the menu and ordered our drinks the same time as our food. The waitress said she took our drinks off for the wait, which is kinda funny because we ordered water.. that makes sense? Not. Thanks for taking off our drinks that werent even on the tab to being with.. 
I know much better and cheaper taco places than this. Not only that but i wasnt even full after leaving. I ended up eating at home, and to be honest i wont be back. Looks cool and everything but i would recommend not wasting your money, and trust me you will be wasting a lot of it here."}
{"text":"Joyride was like dying and going to taco heaven! 

Tried their braised beef and carne asada tacos and they were amazing!! I love that you get a side if you order three tacos. I also tried their watermelon margarita which also was pretty tasty. 

The ambiance was nice. Candle at the table was a nice touch. Very modern feel to it. 

Server was super friendly and helpful in the ordering process for us first time goers. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place while in Phoenix for work....WOWZA! What a gem! The street corn was melt in your mouth kernels of heaven and the Cucumber Serrano Margarita was a little bit of heat with a little bit of sweet....out of this world! Hoping to have a kiddo at ASU next year so I'll have an excuse to stop by and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and like it says above \"I'm a fan!\" My favorite is the fish tacos and carnitas. They have all been excellent however. I did have a burrito once and while it was good, I would stick to the tacos in the future. The chocolate and churros are also a yummy good treat! They have great happy hour specials on drinks and tacos. Love the atmosphere in this place, fun retro vibe. Service is a little slow sometimes but nothing horrible."}
{"text":"What a great combination of great food and service!  It was an unexpectedly busy Sunday, 8/16, night yet the manager handled it like a pro.  As is was my birthday my Father had come in earlier in the day asking to reserve a table and the manager said 'no need, we will have plenty of space tonight'.  Whoops...Yet the Sunday night manager rectified everything quickly and with a smile.  The food was delicious, and this is the second time I have been here and they are 2 for 2.  I have no doubt they will be 3 for 3 after my next visit for some of those nachos and a beast burrito....also Victory IPA on tap, nice work."}
{"text":"I'm FINALLY writing a review for this place! 

I come here often as shown by my check-ins....so often to where some of the employees wave when I walk in; embarrassing, I know. 

My favorite day to come is Tuesday! Why?! Because of TACO TUESDAYYYYYY!! Taco Tuesday means that you get delicious melt in your mouth $2.00 tacos (try the crispy fish) aaaaand $5.00 margaritas! Now, I personally dislike margaritas or anything that contains tequila, except for the ones here! I love the margs here, especially the raspberry-ancho. You can't taste the tequila, but that devil will sneak up on ya after your 2nd drink. But why stop at 2, right?! 

I also love their lunch special! 2 tacos and 1/2 for $9.95?! Count me in. All their salads are pretty delicious so I can't choose just one!

The staff is really nice and friendly and The prices are good. What else do ya want?! Stop reading and go get yourself tacos."}
{"text":"Their tacos seem more experimental than a good humble taco. Their guacamole is pretty bland too. I would come back for drinks only because they are pretty good. Overall it's a beautiful restaurant and its a nice hang out spot with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and the choices for someone on diet restrictions is terrible. Normally I can adjust something to fit what i am looking for. I ordered chicken burrito but placed in a bowl and asked if I could have lettuce and no rice to make more of a salad. All the salads had grains and I am trying to stay low-carb.  I even mentioned this to the waitress and there was not problem.  My meal came very little lettuce a lot of corn and very little chicken.  I ate the chicken out of the bowl and when the waitress came back and saw my bowl pushed away instead of asking it there was a problem or anything she just asked if I was done. The taste of the food was nothing to right home about chicken well just chicken.  I can say overall experience was not good."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé ate here for the first time today and the food was delicious. I had a blood orange margarita for my drink which was very yummy. We both decided to do the 3 tacos and a side of our choosing. I got a carne asada, the standard and a shrimp taco with a side of black beans. The fiancé got a carne asada, carnitas and a baja fish taco with pinto beans as a side. The weather was nice out so we sat on the outside patio while enjoying our visit here. We will definitely be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"What a great experience from the sweet hostess (didn't catch her name) that greeted us to the awesome and very attentive server (Joseph). My mom and I came here on a Taco Tuesday where they have $2 tacos and $5 margaritas.  I had the Blood Orange Margarita and my mother had the Prickly Pear (both were delicious).  We both ordered the vegetarian and the beer-battered fish tacos which were very flavorful and PACKED with perfectly balanced ingredients.  I would recommend this place to ANYONE and EVERYONE."}
{"text":"I love Joyride Taco House!  The service is always friendly and attentive.  The decor is fun and contemporary.  Best of all, the food is consistently delicious.  I love the roasted veggies, the Mexican street corn, all the amazing tacos (especially the two kinds of fish tacos), the tamales, the burritos and black beans.  And, oh my, the hot homemade churro's served with slightly spicy warm chocolate sauce for dipping!  Joyride is our go-to place for special events.  There can be a long wait (wish they had call ahead!) and it can be somewhat noisy inside.  But this restaurant is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place for tacos in Gilbert! 

Located in the heart of downtown Gilbert, Joyride Taco's does not disappoint! First off, if you're going at a busy time, you're gonna have to wait, but it's all good cause they serve awesome margaritas while you wait for your table! I got myself this pomegranate margarita and my wife got a mojito! Both drinks were awesome and they hit the spot! While I think we waited for around 45 minutes, the drinks made it enjoyable and made it feel like I waited for 5 minutes while I had a nice convo with the wife. 

We got seated outside since it was a nice day outside and the server was really nice. We said it was our first time and she went over the menu with us, told us what were HER favorites, and overall was very welcoming. 

Since it was Happy Hour, we got some fish tacos along with some al pastor tacos and they were awesome! The chips and salsa were amazing too and they conveniently refilled our basket like 3 times when I didn't ask! Such a nice experience!"}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite taco house in Phoenix. Great atmosphere, great service and best of all - GREAT tacos! My wife loves the \"Beast Burrito\". We're lucky to have this place around the block from our house! The only complaint I have is the limited parking. They get very busy and on Friday nights and weekends. On busy nights, you have to valet or park across the street. Not that big of a deal, but I just can't see valeting my car for tacos... Weekdays aren't as busy. Enjoy! This is a place not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Great food - cool/funky location and ambience! We brought our two kids there (6 year old and 16 month old) for lunch and had a great time."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Amazing food and great employees! Jeremy and Carn are absolutely amazing! Couldn't ask for better people here. The whole staff takes great care of us! By far my favorite place to come to! Stop in and ask for Jeremy or Carn and they will take great care of you! Oh and the brothers are awesome too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant along with all the other Upward Project Restaurants is one I probably will not even go to.
First of all when you call you get the options to press 1 for the location, and press 2 to make a reservation and to talk to someone awesome.  I assume that nobody makes a reservation as there is nobody awesome to talk to.  All you hear when you choose it is complete silence without anyone ever answering.
I have tried time after time but the same thing all the time.  It is the same for Windsor, Postinos, and  Federal Pizza.
Will never find out how the food and service is at each of them. :)"}
{"text":"Big fan! Best part about this place is the happy hour on the patio. My family and I have been several times. Even if there is a long wait just grab a spot on the patio, its comfy and great views. Their Margaritas are so good, and on happy hour I think they are only like $5. 

Their queso is excellent, love the carne asada quesadilla, and their hot salsa is HOT!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with some friends today. We were seated quickly, and things only got better from there. Our waitress, Marla, was the best server I've ever had! They kept the chips and salsa and drinks freshly stocked at all times, and were really timely with our food order. I ordered the Beast burrito with the carne adovada and it was amazing!!! When we were ready to leave Marla got us all fresh drinks to go. The food was awesome, the service was great - I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Trendy, fun, yet laid back atmosphere. Once the weather cools a bit the patio will be a nice place to kick back and chill out. The food is full of flavor. If you like spice, they have it. If you like sweet, they have that too. My FAV drunk is the mint cucumber with vodka. The almond horchatta(sp?) Is awesome as well! I think they have about five or so Salas to try, I tried all the spicey ones; amazing! So far in my two visits I've had the fish taco, scallop taco, and carne asada taco.....yummy! All of them. If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll see how picky I am. If it's not healthy, I won't eat it. I have diet restrictions; celiac, and dairy. They were super cool with accommodating my diet. The bartenders and servers are top notch. I have to ask what's in everything....they all seem to know the ingredients like the back of their hand. Cool place, esp for Gilbert! Check it out..."}
{"text":"Love this place, gave them 4 stars when they opened, bumping them up to 5 now.. The aqua frescas are not the best (kinda watery) but the tacos are LEGIT!!! so good, yum!!"}
{"text":"I'm not about calling people out by name, so I am not going to include our waiter's in this review.

We went here for a birthday party, and it was the first time we had ever been. We're vegan, so my husband politely asked about what we could eat on the menu. Our waiter said only the rice and cucumber salad. That didn't seem right, because they seemed to have a few vegetarian tacos/apps that could be made vegan (aka, no cheese or sauce). So, we asked again and got an extremely agitated and rude response. We don't expect to be able to eat everywhere, and would not have chosen this place personally. However, we were there for a party and were just curious.

So, the rest of the night the waiter would continue to ask the rest of our party (about 12 other people) what they wanted, but would never stop next to us. Not even for drinks. We weren't rude, and were just curious about a new place. We ended up sticking with the tomatillo rice and fire roasted salsa....which were pretty decent. The chips are great! Sadly, with the customer service we experienced, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim...which just so happen to be taco Tuesday and it was PACKED, my son & I ended up waiting 20/25 mins for a table but after eating here I definitely would have waited double that.

We ordered a trio of tacos that included carne asada, chicken, fish and pork and all of them were excellent. The standout tacos were the carne and fish

I also ordered the street corn (equally excellent) and a margarita..tacos are $2 each and margaritas are $5. Definitely make this place your Tuesday evening stop"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and I had a great experience.  I order three tacos and the fried brussel sprouts.  I had a carne asada, the standard (chicken), and a shrimp taco.  They were all delicious.  The brussel sprouts were really good and came with a hollandaise.

The restaurant is like an old restaurant modern fitted for their style.  I liked it.  It's in a great location, too.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok I visited this place twice on my 2 day vaca in Arizona, didn't even want to check other Mexican places. Sorry. Their tacos are to die for. Perfect mix of flavors and the size is decent. They serve free chips and salsa with your order. 
I was not so amazed with margaritas, so sweet! But with a small modification it was just fine. 
Great happy hour!
Love the decor."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my taco experience here. A couple of friends and I rolled in for happy hour (weekdays 2-5 Pm) where certain tacos are just 2$ and margaritas are 5$. I had the chicken tinga, carne asada, and fish. The fish was the best by far but the carne asada was pretty good too. The customer service was also great here!! This place definitely had the nicest servers.  Also loved the location--downtown Gilbert.!! There's also an awesome parking lot right in the back so you don't have to worry about parallel parking. Get some tacos and then head down the street for some icecream!"}
{"text":"The fish taco was delish.  Carne asada was a bit dry.  I thought the cucumber fresca would be really refreshing but it tasted like a cleanse juice, which did not bring back good memories.  The horchata was way too sweet.  The environment was a cool 70's vibe.  All in all it was okay."}
{"text":"This place is hip and the food is awesome! The battered and fried fish tacos are the best I have ever had. These are no regular fish tacos though, they are high end and will cost you. I especially like that this restaurant has agua fresca alcoholic free type beverages for those who don't partake in bar offerings. I have tried the carne asada, grilled fish, chicken tinga tacos as well, but the best are the deep fried fish ones. Order up 3 with some rice and beans and get ready for fish taco heaven."}
{"text":"Very annoyed at the service. You don't have one specific waiter or waitress and at one point someone took my soda to be refilled. Well they never brought it back. I asked multiple severs to return my drink but went without almost my entire dinner, and they still charged me for it! Not to mention the tacos are overpriced. The food is pretty good but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and haven't got to visit any local restaurants in the downtown Gilbert area until Saturday 10/10. We came across this location as we were in the mood for some Mexican food. 
Fairly busy at about 3:30 in the afternoon which made it seem to us, like it was a pretty popular hang out for the locals. I'd say the atmosphere is like a retro, chic, cool contemporary concept throughout this restaurant. From the style & theme/ to the menu they offer, it's different ( in a really good way).
Our server was Breezy, With an adorable flower head band & all: She was pleasant, fun and informative. 
We first thought there wasn't much to the menu, that was until we tried the food- WOW!!
Happy Hour was going on-so all draft beers by the pitcher were $5 each! Sweet!
Complementary chips & salsa made a quick appearance at our table!
I ordered the Nacho's as my \" main meal\" ( no meat) but they do offer chicken or steak at an additional charge). I replaced the avocado & sub'd it for guacamole (extra fee). Crispy fried flour tortillas lightly salted & topped with delicious fixings that included a creamy lime aioli- Amazing!
We also ordered a burrito called \"the beast\" and they give the option to deep fry it: \"chimichanga style! \"Yes please!! It was killer!\"
\"Lastly\"; three tacos that come out on a silver slotted taco rack. Many varieties of meats to choose from. Ordered the braised beef, baja fish & tinga chicken. ALL were incredible! Accompanied by an orange cucumber salad that is extremely unique!
A MEMORABLE Dessert: called the \"Better than Bettie's, Mexican chocolate brownie plus Cajeta (a creamy warm caramel sauce)  w/ Dulce De Leche ice cream- Deliciously Devine!  
Presentation of ALL our meals was not only eye appealing, but the taste \"tummy tantalizing\"!! LOL. 
Service  by the staff was above & beyond. Not only was our waitress good we were always followed up by Jacy: professional & very well informed of product & store knowledge. Bartender was involved by making an appearance @ our table to deliver a pitcher to us!
Way to go guys, place is super edgy, fun & fabulous!
We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for good tacos and margaritas. But the last time we were in we got amazing service from a young server named John. We got stuck in the crazy traffic that is the 60 and got there 5 minutes before happy hour ended. He made sure that we got our order in before it ended but assured us in case we needed a few extra minutes he would get our order in at happy hour prices. Definitely tipped him on what the regular price bill would have been and then some. Great work kind sir"}
{"text":"Over priced tacos. Did not enjoy this place at all. From the food, environment, pricing, all bad. Didn't try their drinks but it looks like that's what they are known for. So if you just wanna drink then I guess this is the place to go. If you're wanting good food at a decent price, then look somewhere else. Sorry Joyride Taco House."}
{"text":"The best first experience at a new restaurant since moving to AZ! The patio was gorgeous and inviting with a nice fire.  We highly recommend sitting outside. Our Crispy Fish tacos were delicious and the guacamole was on pointe. My husband doesn't even like avocado or guacamole and he loved it. The service, presentation combined with the fact that multiple servers stopped by our table to help us rounded out the experience. The best part though was our server, Hunter. He was lively, attentive, and engaging even educated us on the on tap beer choices. We will be back for the tacos and for the great service."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, tried the blood orange cocktail first... Way too syrupy. Tasted fake. Not a fan. Ordered the Ahi tostada for appetizer, and weren't pleased either. The pineapple on it tasted like it was fresh from a can. Dessert-like sweetness. Not very good. We actually decided to head to another place for our entree. Quite disappointed, because we're all big fans of postino and Windsor. Won't be back here anytime soon. On the upside, the service and atmosphere were great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, modern aesthetic, killer guac, great food! Service was receptive without being overbearing, Kat was friendly and bubbly! Margarita was refreshing but a tad on the sweet side. Nothing negative to say, great spot for happy hour"}
{"text":"Thought overall it was an expensive meal for Mexican and have had better for sure.  The margaritas overall are average, but expensive at $9 a piece.  Better off with the pitchers of beer as those are cheaper.  Ordered the rockfish ceviche for an appetizer, which was nice and fresh tasting.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant before where chips and salsa were not free of charge.  Not at this place and would not pay extra for salsa.  Got the Beast burrito, which the meat was flavored well, but with no typical sides was kind of disappointing.  Too much hype for a new restaurant.  Think you are just paying for the ambience.  In my book, Mexican should not be an expensive experience.

By the way, I like how Yelp filtered this review even though it is real.  I've had this happen before when writing negative reviews for places.  No doubt I ate there yesterday at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"What a great dinner! First, let me start with the salsa and chips, which is the first thing they bring you. Nice heat, little sweetness and acidity. Really some good salsa. Actually, I was a little bummed I didn't try it before getting appetizers since I would have tried some of the others.

For apps we had the shrimp ceviche and mas queso. LOVED the ceviche. It was so stinking good. Little jicama in there with a pico type mix. The queso was good. I'm not a huge cheese fan but my husband really liked it. 

Entrees, I had 3 tacos from the happy hour menu. Totally suggest doing that since they are $2 each. Ordered the traditional, pork adoba and carne asada. There was a mix up and I got the fish instead of the traditional but that was fine with me since I was debating that one. Fish and carne were fantastic. Adoba wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was okay but not near as good as the other two. Husband had a burrito with eggs and beef in it. Name escapes me but he really like it.

Over all, awesome meal. Best of all, whole thing cost us $33. Can't really beat a nice meal out for that price."}
{"text":"Five stars for atmosphere, five stars for the food and five stars for the service. The tacos are great and you can't go wrong with any choice you make. I really enjoy and recommend the orange cucumber salad; definitely a hidden gem on the menu. For dessert, go for the churros you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for taco Tuesday - very busy place but the food and service was excellent"}
{"text":"Good! Tacos were a nice new type of flavor I haven't had before. Cool and interesting decor. Recommend!"}
{"text":"We enjoy Joyride Taco House frequently. There's a fun vibe, perfect Margaritas and great food. At our family lunch today, our grandson had food restrictions due to medical reasons. Our server Mark continuously made sure the food was acceptable, while also taking great care of the rest of us. Mark put a huge smile on our grandson's face when he brought him yummy Churros for dessert!  Matthew, the manager, and Mark for no reason other than kindness, gave us a generous discount on our total bill. We've always been fans of Joyride, however today this great restaurant filled us with pure \"JOY\"!"}
{"text":"Good food, a little pricey. It's always PACKED and honestly the food is not worth a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"- Great salsas.  The medium salsa had great flavor.  The habanero salsa was more than just heat and had a nice smokey flavor
- The chicken tinga tacos were excellent
- The grilled baja fish tacos were pretty bland.  Reminded me of overcooked farmed salmon
- The ceviche was pretty bland.  Just not a lot there
- I liked the open space
- Solid service"}
{"text":"I have absolutely loved this place in the past. The food before was always consistent and delicious. My last 2 visits have been very disappointing in both taste and service. Service I can forgive but taste I cannot. On the food today: ceviche was bland and lacked flavor. It was almost dry. There was not enough actual juices to consider this a ceviche.
Other items we ordered were just too salty! Guacamole, salsas, the standard chicken taco was all too salty. I left feeling like I just visited a salt lick. I don't know what is going on with this place but there needs to be some serious quality control. I don't think I will come to this place again for awhile. 

I love the atmosphere, drinks and fun menu but the food is way off par and it's sad. Please make the food the way it was when this place first opened and  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Joyride is my new favorite restaurant. 

I am absolutely in love with the food, decor and their TACOS! My absolute favorite is the crispy fish taco. 

We went in on my birthday and ordered an appetizer, tacos and a few sides. The tacos came out but the appetizer didn't come out until we were done eating our meal. I told the waiter how late the appetizer was, and the manager came right over and took care of the whole meal! Not at all what we were expecting but so wonderful and kind on my birthday.

Joyride is absolutely wonderful from the customer service to the great food! I love this place and go back as much as I can."}
{"text":"Their tacos are really good but expensive so try to catch happy hour or during lunch and you can get 2 tacos and a salad for $10. The salads are unique and refreshing, and I love how they put a good amount of avocado on almost everything ! :)"}
{"text":"Buckle up because you're in for a truly joyful ride. This restaurant is the whole package. Starting from the first glance, you'll love the fun decor and oversized booths. The service is not just attentive (my water glass was never less than half full) but they are friendly and people you'd want to hang out with- my friends invited our server Ivy to our next taco night. 

The food will not let you down either. The guacamole is incredible. I enjoyed the crispy fish tacos loaded with guacamole and their magic sauce. The braised beef were melt in your mouth deliciousness. My friends topped off their beast burritos in no time, but I would stick to their tacos. While they might not be authentic street tacos, they are fresh, tasty and will fill you UP. 

They have great taco Tuesday deals with 2 dollar tacos. They also have everyday 5 dollar drinks before 5!"}
{"text":"The tacos are tiny, but they get you full really fast, excellent service and very nice staff, Taylor was our waitress she was very nice and helpful, she was explaining the menu, and was very excited to serve us."}
{"text":"Joyride is overpriced Mexican food, and doesn't even have as much flavor as many of their less expensive competitors in the east valley. Tacos the size of my wife's palm should not be $4.50 each, especially considering the unimpressive flavors (of the shrimp and crispy fish). The \"Mexican coleslaw\" tasted like regular coleslaw and was a dripping wet addition to a lackluster taco. The lunch special ordered was $9.75 for two tiny tacos, and a bowl of soup. Chips and salsa are complimentary but I felt the salsa was overwhelmed by onions. 

The tortilla soup was good, I do admit, and is the only thing I'd go back for. The service at lunch was attentive and they have an extensive bar menu, so I believe the target audience is for hipsters having a night out, rather than those looking for a delicious and filling meal."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch, she lives in Arcadia and I'm in Glendale, so we usually end up in Central Phoenix since it's about the same trip for both of us. Upon pulling into the parking lot I was already impressed, because unlike most places in the area, Joyride seems to remember that people do, in fact,  drive cars, and have a decent size parking lot with spots you can actually get into. I drive a Honda Civic and have had trouble squeezing into spots places around here before. 

I work in the central phoenix area, and so I've noticed a few of the restaurants in the area are...well, let's not sugarcoat it they're overrun with judgemental hipsters who give you the side eye if you don't appear to be as hip as them. Never once in Joyride did I get a douchey hipster vibe from the staff. The guy who sat us and there were I believe two people who waited on us were super nice, very warm and friendly,  and made sure we had everything we needed.

And now we get to the best part. THE FOOD. I love food. I'm a fat kid at heart. I also love tacos. They asked us if we wanted to start with the queso dip and I was like, um yes please you can do no wrong when it comes to things with cheese. I was skeptical of it at first because I'm not a huge fan of super spicy stuff and it had jalapeños on top but once I dug in I was sold. It did have a nice kick to it but it wasn't hot just for hots sake. It was a flavor hot. We both got the three taco deal where you buy three tacos and get a side. I got black beans and she got the orange cucumber salad. Both amazing. The Carne Asada taco was pretty much the best thing I'd put in my mouth all day. The fish taco was a close second. The carnitas was also delicious but by this point I was too full to enjoy it properly but it was so good I ate it anyway. 

Price wise it's decent. You're obviously going to pay more here than you would at like taco bell or something but for the queso dip, three tacos & sides, and a Corona each it was like $44. I feel that's a fair price for the quality grub you get. 

So yeah. Go there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the food, the atmosphere, the drinks! Taco Tuesday is great it is pretty busy but the environment is lively and engaging. Although I can't seem to give them a full five stars because of the service we had while everyone else was so fun and nice the bartender was just unhappy and when I asked about two different drinks he seemed so annoyed I could ask such a question but as the night went on he warmed up and was more helpful so overall it was great and I will go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks. I have gave it 4 stars BECAUSE it is overpriced. On Tuesday's the Tacos are $2 which is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went over to enjoy HH with my friend. They had a decently sized HH menu so we were excited to try it out. On weekdays, HH lasts from 2pm-6pm, and the menu features $5 margaritas, $5 pitchers of Dos Equis or Negro Modelo, $2 tacos, and a few other items.

Joyride Tacos is a cute little spot that seems reminiscent of a beach bar. We went at an odd hour, and they were still pretty busy which seemed promising. There was room at the bar so we sat right away, and we were promptly served with waters and some chips with salsa. The salsa was light and very acidic with a very slight kick. 

The server brought over small plates, but the bottom one had crusted food (maybe guacamole based on the color) on it, but he promptly took it back as soon as he noticed. We got the prickly pear margarita and the bloody orange margarita, crispy fish tacos, pork adobada tacos, carne asada tacos, ceviche, and some beer. The pitchers of beer for $5 were smaller pitchers (the same size as they serve at Postino's HH). I don't like sweet drinks much, so the margarita was a bit sweet for me. Also, being from New Mexico, I was not very impressed with the prickly pear margarita nor the pork adovada; the margarita was nothing that memorable but not bad. It was strong at least, which is always good. My friend only said her bloody orange margarita was a lot sweeter than my margarita.

The food overall was a little bit bland. I personally like my food less salty, so if you are like me, it may be a nice change of pace from other restaurants in that sense. However, I know that under seasoned food is not looked upon kindly in restaurants. My friend liked the carne asada taco best as it did have some nice smokey notes, but again, it was under seasoned. The tacos were also a decent size (bigger than I thought they would be. I had expected more traditional sized tacos). The crispy fish tacos were probably my favorite, only because of how crisp they were, but they were also the least flavorful. The pork adovada and the carne asada were both dry.

They were pretty busy, but it did kind of suck that they forgot our order for more beer twice (two different servers too). Another server usually found us, fortunately, but it was a tad bit annoying to keep being told to hold on, while we waited. 

Overall, I think it is a decent HH spot, but definitely not my favorite. I would rank this maybe a 3.5 or 4 star experience. Not sure if I will really return as there are so many good restaurants in the area. Maybe if I am in the area and want some beer and California-style tacos (though I prefer authentic tacos)? Not the worst, but not anywhere near the best."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The nachos were delicious but the chicken was rubbery. Other than that, great flavors!"}
{"text":"Braised beef taco and fried fish taco!! 

The restaurant opened recently and I think it's gonna be one of the new trendy places to go to this year. It was very busy when 4 of us went and waited about a half hour on a Friday night. It was our first time there and the ceviche really stood out so we tried to order that but the server said they sold the last one, but recommended the tuna stack. It was good, and makes me curious what the ceviche would be like. 

So, they have this deal in the menu, when you order three tacos, you get a side for free. I chose the braised beef, the fried fish taco, and the chicken taco with a lime aioli sauce and the rice on the side. I didn't like the chicken at all, but the braised beef was juicy and succulent and yum!! My friend also states the grilled fish taco was great too! But he didn't like the carne asada, it was too sweet, he said. He also ordered pinto beans as his side but the server said the last one sold out too, so he settled for black beans 

The servers were all really busy but still very Attentitive. I took off a star because of the food that wasn't available and because when a different server brought out our food, they only brought 8 tacos and I said we ordered nine and we had to straighten it out with the original server first before they brought out the last taco. Just a tiny hiccup in an otherwise seamless night. 

They also have unique drink choices. They have these juices from freshly squeezed fruits which can be served with alcohol. I tried the cucumber mint with gin and it was very refreshing!"}
{"text":"Loved it! My boyfriend and I went out for dinner late, came across this place cause another one was closed. Best accident ever! Not only is the food amazing, the service was great! Very relaxed environment! Highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Amazing food & great service. The happy hour is totally worth it. They are always so friendly with our kids and usually remember us."}
{"text":"I've been back three or four times since my first review of Joyride. I'd like to say it is just as good each time . . . but you know, I think it gets better and better! Oh, the blood orange margarita and guacamole lived up to their usual reputations, but I swear every entree I try is better than the last one I had. Today it was crispie fish tacos (2) & a vegetable taco, with a side of orange cucumber salad. OMGoodness it was so good. Service was even better than usual (and it is always good!)! Christian, supurb bartender, waited on us.  Thanks, Christian, for making our Sunday lunch so enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I expected to have a better experience. I ordered an Almond Orchata, there was no almonds in my orchata, there were pecans that's to start the second con is that it was loaded in cinnamon and I mean loaded, I love cinnamon but this was exagerated amount in my drink, it was hard to drink it. I ordered the chipotle chicken tamales, hmmm they weren't seasoned as I would expect, actually I did not find the chipotle in my chicken and the third comment is that we ordered the hot habanero salsa and it was not hot at all :( . The service was a little slow but I understand it was a crowded friday night, if the waitress would be a little more friendly I wouldn't mind that detail.

The place is nice to go out, the food not so good to my mexican palate, the drinks I would give them a second chance, perhaps."}
{"text":"I'm well aware this place is popular and probably doesn't need a review.  That said, I finally got a chance to stop in while visiting family (my last visit was so busy that I ended up across the street at The Windsor -- which I also enjoyed) because apparently my cousin has lived down the street for like 15 years.  I've just never been to his house before.

Anyway, long story short, food and margaritas were pretty good, atmosphere was fun, and I imagine if I lived in Phoenix, I'd spend many an evening here.  What I really wanted to showcase though was the customer service.

I was just a lone person eating at the bar at late lunchtime during the week, and they were still fairly crowded.  I was mildly annoyed at the time my entree took, but also happily busy on my phone to pass the time while enjoying a margarita, and their chips and salsa kept me from grumbling.  Turns out, they were more irritated than me, and apologized profusely for taking so long and ended up taking care of part of the bill.  

On top of that, at the beginning, I'd gotten an iced tea, because well, it's what you do with Mexican food when you grew up in AZ, and then switched to margaritas.  They offered early on to give me another iced tea to go when I left, which I took them up on.  Unfortunately, two margaritas later and halfway to my car across the street... realized I'd never waited for the tea to come back after paying my bill (this time my bad).  I ran back in, and the hostess was already  just outside the door with iced tea in hand.

So yeah, the food and booze options and what looks like a fun place got me in, as well as a rec. from a friend who loves him some Taco Tuesday, but the service will get me back anytime."}
{"text":"We stopped in after having lunch at Postino (next door) for a margarita. We have heard plenty from friends and our waitress and had to check it out. We walked in, ran into a couple friends and joined a table on the patio. We were then greated by the hostess, who \"greeted\" us with a \"so you guys just seat yourself then? I guess I will get you some menus\". She then came back warning us that \"next time you would be in big trouble for this\". Safe to say we abandoned ship and walked out. We returned to Postino and all is well. Welcomed with open arms and a drink prepared.
Sidenote: the manager came over to not only apologize for the insensitive hostess but also to offer free tacos for the terrible experience. She deserves the 2 stars. The hostess however, deserves the zero star review. She was rude and being someone that works a 100% costumer service position, she would be let go considering how we were treated. She isn't doing you any favors. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with my girlfriends.  We waited approximately 20 minutes for a table but not bad compared to everywhere else around there which were quoting an hour or more wait!! We were seated outside and the ambiance was so relaxing.  We ordered nachos, one of the burritos, guacamole, and each ordered a taco!! The food was absolutely delicious!! Good food with good people made for a great night!! Will definitely return in the future :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  My go-to when I have guests in town.  I have been with my girlfriends friends, on dates with my boyfriend and out with groups and every time it never disappoints.  Their pineapple mojitos are delicious.  The Ensalada Fila is my favorite salad."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, excellent tacos and guacamole, trendy fun atmosphere!  My husband loved his burrito.  Blood orange margarita is my favorite!   We have been here half a dozen times and every time it's been stellar!  If you order tacos in a group they bring them all out together which can be complicated.  Great place if you have kids!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Kids loved taco tuesday experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent service Lori server took an excellent care of us, knew her menu and recommended phenomenal items. If you haven't been here definitely try it it's worth it. :)))))five star."}
{"text":"Stop in at Joyride during happy hour to enjoy a lively atmosphere and delicious street tacos. Pick one or three, they have a whole side of their menu dedicated to their well-know flavors. I went for the carne asada taco that was topped with a delicious red salsa and for my second choice I ordered the pulled chicken with a white creamy sauce that has a kick, mmm so good! Their homemade thick flour tortillas envelope the meat so well; I mean, you really can't go wrong for half-off street tacos during the middle of the day. Indulge yourself! They also bring you out homemade warm chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I couldn't stop saying how good my food was during my meal! I enjoyed my chimichanga, my margarita and was in love with the lamps! Our waiter even treated us to Mexican corn... although I don't like corn, I ate some because it was so thoughtful! We need a Joyride in LA!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! What a great place!!! You walk in and are instantly in a great mood - the atmosphere is one of the best feelings in Phoenix! We always get the chicken nachos (WOW! The white sauce is a special treat), then we get the chicken burrito with extra chicken and two-four fish tacos!!! The breading is incredible on the fish tacos! We will be back - with lots of friends next time!"}
{"text":"I have never had a negative experience here really. I have sent back one plate I think since coming here. I come to Joyride at least once a week and always get the 3 tacos with a free side and always have some nachos. Having some churro's with a dark chocolate dipping sauce is also delicious at the end of the meal. 
It's a very chill, relaxed place to hangout and have lunch or dinner. Every so often I will go in by myself and sit at the bar, have some tacos and just enjoy watching some TV. The staff is always super friendly and the food is extremely consistent."}
{"text":"This was definitely worth stoppin in Phoenix for! ordered the Street Corn (perfect), guacamole (fresh and tasty), and a whole mess of tacos. If i could only order one again, it would definitely be the braised beef."}
{"text":"Firstly, we had excellent service. The servers were so on top of everything. We enjoyed the different types of margaritas they offer. Mine was Serrano chili with cucumber and it was very good. More of a drink to slowly enjoy. The server was knowledgeable about the drinks and was spot-on about the heat levels and recommendations. The only issue we had was the really tiny table. It felt like we couldn't move at all. When the menu was moved on the table, the really light weight plastic water cup tipped right over and embarrassingly spilled water and ice all over. Ugh. I hope they get different cups. The staff helped us immediately, however. 

They do play great music and overall enjoyed our time."}
{"text":"Looking forward to a return visit. We all tried the blood orange margarita's and they were very good. Looking forward to trying the pineapple mojito on my next visit. I loved the chicken, corn and poblano tamale. I wish the rice was more of a mexican rice but the grilled vegetables with the dish were very tasty. My husband is still talking about the street corn. All in all we had a great meal. When the weather is nice the outdoor seating would be great. It was a little loud inside but too hot to enjoy the outside space."}
{"text":"Ok, I am not a drinker and this place has an enormous bar in the middle, but the food was outstanding! We did the fish tacos and whether fried or grilled they were both outstanding. Loved the cucumber and orange salad with pumpkin seeds, and the guac was superior to most. They brought is some comp frescos because the waitress had missed us, and all three flavors were amazing. My fav the cucumber mint. Great vibe and decor and when he service started it was he best. Oh yeah, did I mention the roasted salsa - Wow!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at this restaurant. I went to the Gilbert location with some girlfriends. The atmosphere was really cool, good happy hour, and the menu looked interesting. There was chips and salsa ( which was good and surprisingly spicy) waiting for me thankfully because I was starving. The guacamole appetizer was good (kind of hard to screw up guacamole). My friend got some beans as an appetizer, they were basically \"crunchy\" and inedible. The server was so nice and cute about it, she took them and didn't charge us, but she handled it very gracefully and it wasn't awkward, which is usually the case in that situation. I got a Bloody Mary, which was just ok, a little overly salty. My friends loved their margaritas though. I got a salad which was delicious, the girls got tacos and were so impressed (so many options!). Dessert was also a hit, which was some banana pudding Carmel pecan thing in a jar, yum! I will definitely be going back, for $2 taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and TUES nights they have the deal for I believe, $2 tacos? Its been a few weeks since I've been.  BUT it is CROWDED on that night of course so be advised.  Good to great service both times I visited, fair prices even on non promo days.  My only critiques are, the prickly pear marg is GROSS I'm sorry it is just nasty, and I have no idea why refried black beans are a thing here.  When I ordered the black beans, I was not told they were refried and mushed to death.  They were too salty or....SOMETHING I'm not sure what I tasted but NO don't do it.  Black beans are best with salt, citrus, and left whole.  No need to be overly fancy.  GREAT tacos though, good salsa, pretty decent guac although its the one thing on the menu that is overpriced for the portion you get."}
{"text":"Been living here in Phoenix since this past May. Since then, I have been to 100+ bars and restaurants. Joyride was by far the best first impression. Service was top notch and immediately noticeable. The waitstaff is a cohesive team, I had three separate people attend to me. It's refreshing when I did not have to wait for 'my' waitress, anyone there is capable to service you. The citrus aqua Fresca with gin was so so good; pleasantly surprised. The tacos were also delicious, the crispy fish had a great crust to it. Will definitely come back for a date night or when friends are in town, or for taco Tuesday, or when I need a break from a 5 hour Netflix binge on a Sunday."}
{"text":"I love Joyride. Cold Mexican Beer, and good tacos. Service is always great at the bar. I always want to go there...my wife...not so much.

Why?

They charge for chips after the first bowl. Tacos and Mexican food is a traction in AZ. You charge for chips and salsa. It's a rule. If I'm eating and drinking, there are a million places in Phoenix who will be happy to make sure I have some chips and salsa without haggling me over a couple of bucks. It's more the principal than the price.

Also, the cheapest Chardonnay is $10 a glass. Unless this is some punishment for mixing wine with tacos...which I understand...I don't get why they charge fine dinning prices for wine. 

All-in-all...I still like this place. But, in AZ, the margin for error in Mexican food is super thin; and Joyride commits some unforced errors."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! We were first timers today and we were very pleased with the food. I had a carne asada, pork, and chicken taco and I am stuffed, SO GOOD. I recommend it to anyone!! Go on taco Tuesday or during happy hour when the tacos are cheaper!!"}
{"text":"The bartop is hella beautiful and recognizable too. A shout out to Stephen & Loni Kfoury of CA Butcher Block. The majestic mahogany is outstanding. Your best one yet, that I have seen. 

Onward to the decor. What stands out is the wall art. The old car steering wheels are pretty cool tho I don't believe I saw a wielded chrome chain one, a must, but the 12 volt headlamps were awesome. I haven't seen old car lamps used since The Limelight, a nightclub in LA. I have always thought about car lamps as an accent lightning. Well done.

Joyride is part of the Federal Pizza, Postino, Windsor, Churn owners that are branching into Mexican food. Tonight I started with a Victoria Beer $2.5 for a shorty. A Vienna Lager style beer brewed in Mexico City. A very drinkable, kinda lite beer. Next came chips and a green salsa. 

My entree was veggie enchiladas with goat cheese, corn and green chili, salsa verde and guajillo sauce $9. Absolutely superb. I finished off with a lime, salt and a shot of Tequila Ocho Resposado $11.5. An excellent after dinner drink.

Looking forward to Joyride2 in my hood. Thank you James for the outstanding service and looking forward to the \"Chefs Suprise\" at the 2. Great job everybody!

BTW, love the Pandora Radio."}
{"text":"The decor stands out, like the over sized glass vases behind the bar, large Art Deco globular lights and majestic mahogany used in our round table is outstanding. The bench seat, means we get to sit close. I love that. Well done.

Joyride is part of the Federal Pizza, Postino, Windsor, Churn owners that are branching into Mexican food. 

Tonight I started with a Green Flash Summer Saison bomber, $12. Brewed in California, a 4.5% true to style, Saison. French farmers would serve their workers this style, hence the low alcohol level. I love the unfiltered, rustic nature, damn good! My babes got a margarita $9

Next came chips and a green salsa. I enjoy these like I haven't eaten in days, so good. Our entree was the roasted chicken burrito. Absolutely superb."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Monday and the service was awful. Took forever to get our order in, the waitresses were in no hurry, almost walking around in a daze instead of bringing water to customers and turning tables. It's a lunch hour, not a happy hour and the crowd was clearly people on a lunch break that needed to get back to the office. 
I ordered he chicken burrito, edible sure, but I wouldn't order it again. 
It took a full 30 minutes after we were done eating to actually be paid and out the door. Had to ask for the check twice, waitress disappeared after she took it, and we eventually just got up and waited by the bar (we were in a regular dining booth) to finally get our cards handed back to us. 
They had free chips and salsa but that was about all I liked about this place."}
{"text":"Really good! Shrimp tacos are great but really pricey... Highly recommend going during happy hour. Other wise your paying a lot for a little bit of food.

UPDATING MY REVIEW:

We have gone back a couple of times since this review and me and my husband really enjoy sitting up at the bar, watching a game and munching on that delicious bowl of chips and salsa.  The staff is super friendly and is starting to become one of our favorites downtown. But still we try to only go at happy hour, otherwise its really pricey."}
{"text":"While the dessert was fabulous, the service was not what I would've expected from such a nice restaurant... One of our waiters brought us the wrong drinks, the other one came back only once out of the 2 hours we were there, and a third waiter filled my glass with water and pored it all over our table and kept going. Three stars for the food and zero stars for the rude service..."}
{"text":"Decent taco restaurant with fun margaritas and nachos as a starter. Little slow on the service, our starter came out before our drinks and they forgot one of my tacos. Food is delicious though!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the friendliest place. Won't ever be back. I had green veggie leaf in my drink and the bartender said it's just cilantro. I was sitting at the bar not having Mexican food. I obviously made the bartender upset when I ask for a new drink. When we sat at bar it was obvious that I wasn't welcomed. I NEVER NEVER use the race card but this was undeniable!!! Bad bad bad!!!"}
{"text":"Freebie salsa was fruity and spicy - habanero? Tasty! Was talked into the Beast burrito, fried and smothered in a cheese sauce - definitely won't make THAT better myself! Tacos pricey at 3-4.50 each, but good.  Service awesome, cool, hipster staff and crowd,  not pretentious. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I come here at least once every two weeks & everything from the chips to the drinks are spectacular! My favorite drinks are the  Pineapple Mojito or Key Largo. Both are refreshing. The beast burrito with no sauce, chimichanga style is my absolute favorite along with the Mexican Street Corn! Definite place to try if you're in Old Town Gilbert."}
{"text":"The S.O. And I came here a couple of weeks ago. We are new to the Phoenix area, and wanted to go somewhere that would kick off our dining experiences well. I had the garden variety burrito, and she the garden variety tacos. It was quite tasty, however the mushrooms were a bit too large for my taste...and I'm not entirely sure I enjoy mushrooms at all in my burritos. The atmosphere was definitely right though. They have a beautiful outdoor seating area with a nice fire place. Veggie options were a bit slim, so not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in downtown Gilbert.  I love the inside outside feel. You can't beat the taco Tuesday deal!! Go for the Tomatillo (green) hot sauce.  It's a little less spicy."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials. I am still not over my margarita, I tried the mango mandarin and it was probably the best margarita I have ever had. Tried the cheese y mas and it was great! Loved the salsa too! Tacos were $2 on the happy hour menu, we sampled everything plus the braised beef. Everything was on point and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"There is nothing not to love about this place.  Great food, drinks, atmosphere and staff.  The prickly pear margarita is exceptional."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, definitely my go to place for happy hour, I tried almost all the Margarita drinks they offer for happy hour and they were all good. My favorite is the Watermelon Margarita. Also, the tacos are so good, I have tried almost all of them as well and the ones I've tries so far are so good. Definitely, coming back to try everything else."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and the food was great. We have been waiting for Gilbert to get some good Mexican food, and this place seems to have it. The chips and salsa was good, the service was good as well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I was disappointed after the first sip of the \"almond horchata\". The atmosphere is trendy and cool, but the food is a tad over priced and isn't worth the hype. My drink was literally hard to swallow- it was very powdery and chalky. Totally not worth the $8! I ordered the crispy fish taco which had no flavor, the braised beef taco was flavorful but the cochinita pibil made me give this rating an extra star. It was delicious! Also the salsa is very fresh and had the perfect amount of heat. The tacos are small so I feel like paying almost $4 for one is a rip off! I'm glad that I tried it but probably won't be going back. The fresh salsa and cochinita pibil tacos really are the reason for the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Every Tuesday I come to Joyride and not just for the amazing $2 taco price but because they have the best customer service, best atmosphere, and hands down the best tacos.  Every time I come Tori the hostess greets us in the nicest way and she literally memorized us within two visits and now it's become our weekly (must go) taco Tuesday tradition!  All of their staff have Beautiful personalities and every experience I've had was just perfect! Also they have the most respectful and kind manager in the world Nick he always goes table to table to check on all the guests. He visits our table every time my group and I come in! Whether you're bring your family or your friends this is one taco place you have to try"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews I wasn't sure I wanted to visit this place until it settled down a bit.  That gave way to \"what the hell, let's give it a shot.\"  Girlfriend and I did the drive out to Gilbert, walked in, and grabbed a couple seats at the bar since there was a long wait for a table.  We both tend to grade places like this based on their fish and/or carnitas tacos.  I'm an equal opportunity omnivore (the scale tells me this), so my requirements are little less strict, but she's the ultimate snob when it comes to fish and carnitas tacos.  After getting drinks, chips, and salsa, we ordered crispy fish tacos.  They arrive, we dig in, and after a few bites she said they're some of the best she has had.  That's very high praise from someone who will knock off points for anything that isn't \"right.\" 

After finishing the fish tacos, we ordered an assortment of salsa and while the charred habanero salsa is listed as \"melt your face\" hot, it's not quite there but more than hot enough to make you work up a sweat.  Maybe that's just a warning for tourists. :)  The habanero, tomatillo, and chile de arbol salsas were all very good.  Next up:  carnitas tacos.  Like the fish tacos, they were exceptional.  A little drippy, but that's far better than some of the dried out excuses for carnitas you'd find at lesser taco joints.  

Sure, you can get the same (in name only) food at a taco shop down the road for half the price, but you also get half the quality.  The prices aren't out of line for what you get.  

We're probably going back tomorrow to try other menu items now that we have a baseline.  Yeah, it's that good."}
{"text":"This place service is awful.The food is spicy with everything, it does not have any food items for diabetes or for heart.Food was 
awful"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. I love all the upward project restaurants. They have five dollar happy hour pitchers of beer and wonderful appetizer specials"}
{"text":"Not real Mexican food, it's hipster Mexican food! But with that being said it's delicious and their margaritas are delightful. P.S. I'm not a vegetarian but I always get the veggie taco because they are what dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Last time I was there (a few weeks ago), a random female server delivered our pitcher and one cold glass...even though there were 2 adults at the table. She wasn't our server - I think her name was Kim or something. She dropped the stuff & ran. Had she even stopped for 3 seconds to ask if we needed anything else, she could have gotten the second cold glass that was supposed to come with our beverage order. I approached the bar to get said glass and spoke with a guy that looked managerial and let him know. A male bartender was standing behind the \"manager\" the whole time we spoke and within seconds of returning to my table, he flagged down \"Kim\" to tell her what I had said. He was even kind enough to point at our table so she knew exactly who we were. Awesome. 

Food was good, as usual. Rude service & poor attitude have turned me off to this place for a while."}
{"text":"Mediocre food & slow service. I used to speak so highly of Upward Projects & now they are as bad as Fox Concepts. Shame Shame!!"}
{"text":"Of course this place opens when I move back to California. Where was this place during the four years I lived here?! Where to start. . . 
AMBVIANCE- 5 stars. Comfy booths. Great vibes. Fun place to come with your friends. 
FOOD- 5 stars. The menu is super fun. It is full of delicious drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. They have a large selection of juices including cucumber and horchata. I was in love with my almond and cinnamon horchata. You can't go wrong with their guacamole. Their tacos were awesome. I personally loved the shrimp taco best. 
PRICES- 5 starts. Prices range around $3/taco. Amazing deal!
Overall, I love this place and will return every chance I get."}
{"text":"Place is beautiful inside and out. Food is mediocre at best. I might have returned for the atmosphere if it not for the supposed owners and management. I was having lunch on the patio and had SEVERAL screaming kids climbing a tree RIGHT next to my table throwing rocks and screaming. When I notified management I was informed those were the owners kids and he couldn't do anything about it. He bought my meal instead. I said thanks but that's not what I want. I want to relax and enjoy my mediocre food in peace. I am completely turned off that the supposed owners would let their children disturb their customers dining experience. And even more turned off that the problem wasn't fixed. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious all around !!!! Chips, tacos, Gauc. Everything came out great. Highly recommended. 2 dolla selected  tacos on  Tuesday's! Go to taco spot."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for an early dinner on Father's Day and were glad we did!  Loved the casual vibe and I'm sure when they open up the windows (too hot in June so they were closed) it's an even more perfect atmosphere for tacos and margs.  Speaking of margs I'm not a huge fan but I had a sip of my wife's blood orange marg and it was ridiculously good.  The street corn was right up there with the best I've had and we loved the braised beef taco (we also shared the crispy fish and the standard which were good but the beef was by far our fav).    

Can't wait to go back for taco tuesday!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, pleasant service. Everyone pitches in to make sure customers are hydrated & fed (warm chips/salsa). We ordered a standard taco (slow roasted chicken), carnitas (pork) taco, fish taco, and the braised beef taco along with black beans. All of which were quite yummy. I also tried their Cucumber- Serrano margarita - refreshing with a kick of heat - loved it! Overall a nice experience. Check it out :)"}
{"text":"I had heard about Joyride from a Local at a recent Yelp event I attended. I'd asked where could I get some pretty good mexican and a decent Margarita and she said I had to come to Joyride so here I was. Visited with 3 others and we opted to wait for our table at the bar. We were immediately greeted with smiles and Chips/Salsa. Of course I started with a Margarita and opted for the Prickly Pear as I'd never had it before. My friends opted for a Prickly Pear as well and the Blood Orange Margarita. I'll start by saying they were pretty strong (YES!) and the flavors were lovely but I did not notice a huge difference in flavor between the prickly pear and blood orange however. Time flew by and we were escorted to our table only to be greeted by our lovely waitress \"Kait\" please note this is the correct spelling as she did write it down for me. Kait, was lovely for so many reasons. First she has a fantastic demeanor/attitude and was able to not only answer all our questions about the food but also made other suggestions I may not have considered. Like the best melted cheese over my veggie burrito, HELLO, that was THE BEST mind you, officially the best burrito I've ever had, wow. Moving along, she made A LOT of suggestions as well about cool places to visit or eat in the area as I'm new to AZ, how helpful was that? I thought she was fantastic as did our entire group. Among the things we ate which were all absolutely fantastic: Veggie burrito (get it with the cheese sauce on top you'll thank me later), Fish tacos, and a few other tacos I can't remember due to margarita #2 LOL, Carne asada burrito & Quesadillas. I so wanted dessert but unfortunately I ate way too many chips/salsa, 2 margaritas, half quesadillia and almost my entire burrito (they are LARGE). This only means 1 thing of course: A) I will have to go back and check out their desserts and of course ask for Kait. Oh and Tuesdays they have $5 margaritas and $2 tacos! I hear it gets pretty busy. I honestly don't mind paying full price. I loved Joyride's vibe, employees, food, decor, margaritas, etc. Totally going back with friends/family."}
{"text":"Yum! Came with a bunch of friends for Taco Tuesday. As others have stated, the prices are awesome--$2 tacos and $5 margaritas (there is a lot of ice though), with unlimited chips and salsa.

I tried the carne asada, pork adobada, and chicken tinga. My favorite surprisingly was the chicken tinga--the chicken was super tender and I loved the toppings. The tacos are a bit on the smaller side--my guy friends had to order 5 or 6.

The only thing I disliked was the guacamole--DO NOT GET IT. What a ripoff. $8 for a tiny tiny bowl :( 

Otherwise, a great place for tacos! Also the atmosphere is super funky and fun."}
{"text":"We gave this place a second chance and had lunch last Friday. I tried the chicken tamale, which you think it would have shredded chicken. Unfortunately, I only saw poblano, corn and one small piece of chicken. Even if there was chicken, the tamale was just okay. I liked the side grill veggies more than the tamale."}
{"text":"I'm normally a huge fan of JoyRide. Great tacos and outstanding margs. However...Yesterday my niece and I were in around mid afternoon for happy hour. Sitting at the bar we got our margaritas, got our tacos, and all is well. After our tacos arrived, our bartender essentially checked out. Didn't ask how our food was. Our glasses sat empty for 15 minutes (not an exaggeration) and we sat with empty taco plates in front of us as well. Had he asked, we both would of ordered another drink. Instead we decided to leave. Wanted to pay our check. But the blonde haired bartender was more concerned about putting his tips in Aloha than making sure his guests are taken care of. So I had to flag down a hostess to help us get a check. Now I would like to blame the bartender for this, but this clearly is managements fault. It's evident this employee was either not trained properly or management's service expectations are minimal at best."}
{"text":"Shoutout to Manager Miriam for being SO thoughtful.. she overheard i was a vegetarian and catered to my needs without me even asking! Also the hostess Olivia was very friendly sweet and made me love this restaurant before i even sat down! It was my first time here and i will 100% be coming back :) 10/10!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the amount of fish given in my $4.50 \"fish taco\"... I'd much rather stick to Two Hippies after this experience. My boyfriend's had a pretty decent amount of meat but he was only impressed with \"The standard\". Shrimp taco had some good taste to it and had a solid three shrimp."}
{"text":"Omg. So fire. Fire x10. 

Their Taco Tuesday is amazing and always worth the wait. You can always count on some litty tacos, fammmm. I'm also addicted to Fanta and every time I'm in, the quick server never leaves me hanging. Fanta flows like mothafckin wine in this joint. 

Tacos, Fanta and a good time. What else do you freaking need? FIRE."}
{"text":"What is not to Rant & Rave about this place? You have got to try it! So last night the Lady and I decided to try this place. We tried to make the Happy Hour but just missed it by about 20 minutes (FYI, HH is all day until 5pm). Not so bummed b/c the prices were reasonable especially when you factor the OUTSTANDING service and the fresh ingredients. Made to Order corn tortillas for your tacos! It won't get any fresher unless you grind the corn at your table. We had the fish tacos...unbelievable! We usually rate a place by their nachos but already have a new Fav place. Its a mix of people who dine in there retro-ish looking place, low music (which is nice for conversation). Can't wait to go back and try other items like their nachos, aqua fresca and melt your face salsa! See you there"}
{"text":"The ball & chain and I stopped by for the first time last week. The place has a nice set up and everything looks very nice inside. That's probably the best thing I can say. The waitress took about 15 minutes to take our order and then when she did she left for another 5 because she didn't have a pen. And the restaurant was only 3/4 full. We ordered some queso appetizer and it was decent but you get better stuff at Taco Bell. And the food portions are ridiculous. I'm a math nerd so I figured it out. The tacos are $4 each (yes $4 each, I know wtf, right!!) and being a big guy (I'm a toned 6'3 225 lbs beast) I can finish these tacos in 3 bites which comes out to $1.33 per bite. That's pathetic and you don't get full unless you order like 6 tacos if you are a big dude my size. The taste was less than good. I don't know why they get so many good reviews. The place is not good at all. Maybe it's because I have actually tried Mexican tacos in Mexico that I know what tacos should taste like. The service is pretty bad too. From the waitress to the bus boys. I guess they think they are better than what they are, but guess what? Get real because you work at a restaurant and you are not better than anyone. We are all the same and bus boys should not think they are better than you. Ok sorry my rant is over! Don't come here!!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service. I've been here many times and the food is always great. The tomatillo salsa is yummy and the chips are thick and crispy.

The service is hit and miss. Most of the time the service is very slow. I'd come more often if the service improved...

Update:
I'm downgrading my review to 2 stars because of the service. I've had horrible inattentive service on my last 3 visits. Bartenders, hosts and servers have all gone downhill. Last night our dirty dishes sat at our table for 20 min with nobody coming by to clean them up. The salsa is now $1 for an extra bowl? WTF? I hate being charged for trivial things like this so just add it to you food costs. Its like being charged for water on an airplane. After ordering the salsa I never received it. I never received the guac I ordered. Long wait times at the bar with no acknowledgement. I understand being busy, but acknowledge the customer and tell them it'll be a few minutes before we can serve you. 

The food is 3 stars, but if the service doesn't pick up I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing veggie tacos! Salsa is also delicious! The guac is a must try as well! Beautiful atmosphere and wonderful, kind staff. You must visit here if you are anywhere near Gilbert."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour that ended at 6??? The place was cute, had good music. I had an blood orange margarita and a prickly pear margarita... They both tasted the same, super sweet, nothing special. I was charged 12.00 each for them during happy hour because I requested Casa Noble tequila which may or may or have been used, which the waitress advise me of the up charge. The way the menu is set up, I thought it was the price of margarita.  I also ordered two tacos- carne asada and the chicken and nothing special, both a little salty. I guess they think that's what peeps want then they are drinking."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times and always labeled it as one of our \"favorites,\" however after tonight it was rather embarrassing taking our family here.

To start, it was our dad's retirement and there was a group of 9 of us. We had reservations and they sat us on time which was great, however the service goes down from there. We waited over 20 minutes for our server to come back once he took all the drink orders and we were missing margaritas. When we mentioned it it took maybe 10 min or so for the missing one to come to the table. No one came by to refill our ice tea or lemonade either. And it was impossible even ordering another beverage once ours ran out because we barely saw our server. I like how everyone works as a team, clearing plates/serving the food but it was just a complete mess. Two of the orders were messed up, the \"Christmas\" enchilada style came as a burrito and then the bowl came as a burrito. When we told the server, they brought us the side of the enchilada sauce? Like didn't offer to warm it up or melt the cheese on the enchilada like we ordered but just literally brought a bowl of sauce. We never got the bowl fixed, just picked it out of the tortilla because we didn't want to have to wait on that... again. We spent over $180 and just the fact we had to hunt people down for everything i.e. to go boxes, weren't offered drink refills, can we order another drink, this order is wrong and so on it was just an embarrassment that we wanted to come here to bad and this is what they had to show. The retiree did like his fish tacos tho, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, delicious tacos, even better salads. This place is a regular weekend chill spot for me and the wife. Fast and attentive staff makes for an enjoyable experience. I go to this location about twice a month, they never disappoint, and are consistent."}
{"text":"Love!!!!! Amazing spot for Taco Tuesday. Tried a chicken and carne taco and both were delicious and only $2!!!!! Also had some Mexican corn and was wowed! That ish was bomb! 
Long wait at joyride but try to find a seat at the bar and avoid the hour wait!"}
{"text":"They quoted a wait time of 1 hour. We waited patiently for 1 1/2 and there were still 8 people ahead of us! Their hostesses can't estimate wait time for anything!! They weren't even concerned or apologetic about it. I told them we were going to go elsewhere so she could remove our name, and all she said was \"OK\". VERY DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"It's amazing hear. Always busy and there is a reason why. The tacos are perfect, the drinks are amazing, and I love the chips and salsa. If your just a party of 2 sometimes you can get into the bar fairly quickly."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place as I've been wanting to go for quite some time.  I went as I was passing through one day. It was a nice day but I wanted to sit inside as it was a bit windy outside. I asked to be seated away from the open side door but it was still very windy (no big deal though, it is Arizona)... I sat at the bar and the waitress/bartender was very friendly and helpful.  I decided to go with the grilled fish tacos and kale salad.  I was disappointed as the fish was very dry! I probably should have sent them back but I was running late for an appointment and didn't have time.  I would give them another try as the place has a fun atmosphere and I loved the salsa which to me is a food group! Just a little disappointing.."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic food!  Delicious cucumber margarita!  Outdoor seating is part sun and part shade. Inside seating is modern retro with good music."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  The portions weren't huge but the food was tasty and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Not your awesome down the street hole in the wall kinda food, but way better than a chain sit down Mexican food place. The meat tastes great, the salsas are delicious and the drinks satisfy for sure. 
The atmosphere is relaxed, the decor is modern retro and the staff is friendly. As a periodic visitor to the Phoenix area, I have both recommended and been a repeat customer to Joyride. As a Southern Californian, I can say the food definitely exceeds any south western America standard for non taco shop Mexican food. 
A part of a larger concept created by Upward Projects, Joyride Taco House is an enjoyable experience as well as a great place to eat. If you're not stuffed from eating and drinking it all in at Joyride, just cross the street and go to fellow Upward Projects property Churn for dessert!"}
{"text":"Best tacos and margaritas!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! This place is our go to place for date night!! Service is always on point and atmosphere is awesome!!"}
{"text":"This is a very fun place.  We sat at the bar and were served immediately.   This is Americanized version of Mexican food that uses fresh ingredients and crafty presentations.  The restaurant design is modern and hip.  Our salad and burrito were delicious.   Cool hangout or date spot."}
{"text":"Creative food and drinks, welcoming and fun vibe. Party of 7 left full and happy. Service was inconsistent at times (2 entrees had a huge delay) but they apologized and discounted the check without us even asking. Crispy fish taco was top 5 anywhere for me."}
{"text":"Loved it! I brought my dad here for a Father's Day lunch. The service was terrific! They had just opened a few weeks ago. The cocktails and Aqua Frescas were    unique and so delicious. I was told that they come in early to prepare the drink mixes from scratch. I tried three tacos; the fish was my favorite. The chicken was a bit spicy, the pork was ok. I will definitely return and will be bringing my friends!"}
{"text":"Ok service and food. Happy hour is Monday-Friday from 2pm-6pm and the deals are good, but other places sell tastier tacos for less i.e. Los Taquitos. Waiter was very slow and forgot my drink a couple of times. Starter chips and salsa are free and tasty. Mexican corn was good as were the nachos. Carne asada and crispy fish tacos were average. Patio seating is pet friendly."}
{"text":"Went back for lunch with friends. The service was much better. Still a bit slow but they were very busy. The food still great! They really did a great job making my experience much better this time around! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed. First time here about a month ago and I was underwhelmed across the board. We were seated immediately on the patio and water and chips/salsa appeared quickly but everything after that was missed. Took a long time to be greeted by a server and even longer to get our appetizer-shrimp ceviche. App included full size pieces of shrimp that should have been diced up. Tables that arrived after we did received their food first. I ordered the machaca burrito served enchilada style with red sauce. My boyfriend got The Beast burrito. When The Beast is smaller than a Chipotle burrito and contains less meat, the name should probably be changed. I tried both & wasn't impressed with either. Everything was just okay. Which would have made this a three star review except for one problem. They never cleared any plates or glasses. Every time they would bring us a fresh drink or the next \"course\" they would leave the former dishes on the table. It was a small table so we were running out of room. We asked one of the many servers (they work as a \"team\" -a concept I still don't understand because it doesn't seem to work, at any restaurant, and the tip likely gets split but what if one person is excellent and another on the team is terrible?) to clear the table, he said he would \"be right back\"...he never came back. Walked past us a few times but clearly had forgotten our request. They still weren't cleared when we paid the check! There must have been 10 used dishes on the table when we left. I don't plan on returning to Joyride. Too many other great restaurants nearby, Windsor and St. Francis among them!"}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown gilbert.

I always sit outside. 

I like their burritos. 

Great chips and salsa and they keep them coming which is how it should be."}
{"text":"I really love the tacos here. They have great combinations and are reasonably priced. My only critique is the service. It almost feels a bit unorganized like there are different servers for each part of the process...one person brings you water, another brings you chips, eventually someone takes your order, then someone else brings your food, and so on. The last few times I've been here, there were 5 different servers at the table but no one communicated with each other (I had to ask for water from three people before someone else brought me water). With that said, I do like it here and the food is great so I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar... Super slow had to practically do jumping jacks to get service  sitting at the bar really??.. Food way over priced for what it is and was really bad.. carne asada ??wtf horrible. Cheap beer is the only good thing that's if you can get a drink  from the snooty want to be server/ bartenders... I know what ppl have been saying in the Gilbert community and its obvious there is no way this is a four star joint... Fake reviews forsure buyer beware."}
{"text":"I can understand why some people would be turned off by this place. I've always enjoyed it though. Parking is a little tricky at times but I think Upward Projects has done a great job adding more parking for all their restaurants at this intersection. Sometimes the wait can be a bit long but they have seating outside and they will grab your drink order and bring you chips and salsa while you wait. The service has always been friendly and super accommodating even though you may not have an individual server. 

We ordered veggie tacos on this visit which were solidly delicious. Being a vegetarian I appreciate the servers warning that the black beans were not vegetarian. I also ordered a margarita (can't remember which one right now) but it was very good. In the past I've had their agua frescas, loved those too. 

I like the decor and layout of this place. It's a solid restaurant and one I would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate Cinco De Mayo with some friends and family and we all loved it!

Location & Aesthetics - located on the corner N. Central Ave & W. Colter St and not difficult to miss with its great signage.
There are lots of available parking in the rear of the restaurant and on W. Colter St.  The parking on W. Colter St is probably by chance as we were lucky to arrive just in time when two vehicles were pulling out.  If you can't find a spot on W. Colter St, you're sure to find something in the rear where there's lots of parking.
The interior decor is beautifully decorated with lots of space and enough seating for any sized party.  Lots of comfortable outdoor seating -- couches, tables, and chairs with cool misters.  If you have to wait, like we did, you aren't even ignored outside as you are immediately provided with a complimentary basket of chips and salsa, and your drink orders are taken.  I find that to be absolutely cool because you can sit and enjoy your company, enjoy the atmosphere, the music while waiting for a table to become available.  Wait times weren't bad either as we were told about 30-45 minutes (it was Friday evening and Cinco De Mayo too), and that timing was pretty close.  Be sure to keep an eye on your phone as they will message you to let you know that your table is ready!

Menus - when you're sitting outside and waiting, there are available menus everywhere so you can familiarize yourself with what you will be ordering once you're seated inside plus you could familiarize yourself with the drinks portion of the menu as well.  The menu wasn't extensive and every easy to read and understand, and spanned about a page on both sides.  The same applied to the drinks menu as well.  Waitstaff was happy to answer any questions we had on either menus.

Service - very prompt and attentive.  Immediately as we sat outside, and even inside, our table had a complimentary basket of salsa and dip, and we were asked if we wanted to order from the drinks menu (outside) and the same inside.  Drinks were brought to our tables quickly including the food.  Waitstaff frequently visited us -- when outside and inside to assess our needs.  Staff could not have been more pleasant to deal with as they always showed up friendly, courteous, and with big smile.

Food - I had the tacos -- pork adobada (guajillo chili braised pork, cabbage, cilantro, radish + onion), carne asada (certified angus beef, fire-roasted salsa, cabbage, cilantro + onion), and the shrimp (grilled shrimp, Mexican slaw + pico gringo).  All tacos were prepared wonderfully -- very tasty, warm, flavorful, and even the corn tortillas they were served in was fresh.  Definitely cannot complain about the food!
The complimentary basket of chips and salsa -- dip was mild and not runny, and the chips were fresh and crispy!
For dessert we all shared in the churros con chocolate -- churros were, not too hot, but warn enough to start eating immediately, freshly prepared with cinnamon and spices.  The chocolate was supposed to be spiced we didn't taste it.
For drinks, I had the Blood Orange margarita (Tequila + Triple Sec + House Blood Orange Sour + Hibiscus Syrup) and really loved it.  Wasn't overpowering but very smooth!  I could've drunk several of those throughout the night! 

Definitely recommend this place and would visit here again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Phew, it's pricey. $3.50 for a mini taco. Atmosphere is good,  staff is. .. hipster. Chips were a bit stale and my drink was not the best. It cost my husband and I $50 for the 3 mini tacos,  nachos and a drink a piece. The have a really good outdoor area and is great for the young professional but if you go the to eat and not socialize, best to go someplace out."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Sunday. Sat at the bar and received chips and salsa immediately. The salsa was really good, spicy the way I like it. I ordered 1 chicken taco, 1 carne asada and 1 grilled fish taco. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos. We received tacos, like taco bell fast, I was impressed. All 3 of my tacos tasted good. But as previous reviews mentioned, the carne asada is a little dry not sure why. My friends shrimp tacos looked awesome. I wish I would've ordered one. He said they were good and he would order them again. The staff was really friendly and the restaurant has a great vibe and feel. I love the patios. I will be back."}
{"text":"White washed tacos & Mexican corn. Very bland. The crispy fish wasn't crispy and all of their tacos had no real flavor.
The horchata was legit."}
{"text":"We are slightly obsessed with Upward Projects so last year we took a road trip out to Gilbert to check out their newest concept: Joyride Tacos. You can imagine how excited we were when we heard they were opening a location here in Central Phoenix, just a couple of miles from our home. By opening weekend the staff seems to already have the routine down. We were quickly greeted when we walked in the door, and received excellent service throughout the night. 

Drinks were good, but our favorites of the evening were the chips and salsa (one of the key elements for any Mexican restaurant), and the chicken enchiladas! I don't think I could say enough good things about the enchiladas. Excellent!!  We had another stop planned for the evening so we skipped dessert, but we will definitely be trying it on a future trip. 

Our one complaint would have to be our table. We were unfortunate enough to be sat at one of three small tables for two. The tables are in a row and all right next to each other. We felt cramped and a little like we were joining our neighbors dinner party. All the other tables in the restaurant looked great though, next time we will make sure we aren't sat there."}
{"text":"They have a really awsomeness atmosphere and their employees are very friendly. The tacos yumi as well. I orderd two fried fish tacos and one Baja Taco.  The baja  in point. The fried fish had no meat just fried batter they  overcompensate by loading the tacos with guac and cabbage for their lack of meet. Very  disappointed I will not go back and eat their food for the price of a charge. I would still get drinks their."}
{"text":"Fell in love with JoyRide in Gilbert where my gf lives so thought to check this one out since I reside in Phx. Why do I always get a Pepsi when I order a Dr. Pepper? 3 times in a row.. Smh. Carne Asada tacos taist different then Gilbert JoyRide, why?"}
{"text":"Love this place ... A friend introduced me and it is now my GO TO place.  Yummy and great drinks"}
{"text":"I've gone here maybe 3 times and each time was great. I love their taco selection. The battered fish one is my favorite. I love their agua frescas as well! They are a must have! Spike the horchata one if you want an adult beverage! Service has always been on point. One time I went where there was a long wait and employees came around asking us if we wanted waters or appetizers while waiting. That's a great business for you!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot. It's fancy but doesn't lose the authentic Mexican food you crave. Servers are great and the vibe is fun.

I'd definitely try the cheese quesadilla and the Beast Burrito might be the best burrito around, just sayin."}
{"text":"I love this place, it never disappoints! Perfect place to take the family or get together with friends! Yummy food!"}
{"text":"It's good - just not craveable. The prices are a bit high for \"street tacos\". They do have great drinks and an wonderful environment. People seem to like to come here - and I wonder if it's because postino's next door is too busy..."}
{"text":"The queso was really good! And the margaritas where huge. This place gets really busy, but we were able to find a bar seat pretty quickly. They have awesome taco Tuesday specials!"}
{"text":"So glad that there is a great urban vibe with great food coming to the east valley.  This type of eating is a first of its kind, and if you love tacos and want to eat at one of THE COOLEST(meaning reddest, most hip, not referring to temperatures) places in the valley, then stop here. 


Oh. The tacos are amazing as well. I can't remember what the waitress said, but I think it's owned by some famous chef. 

Speaking of waitresses. You'll have multiple ones. They all just stop at your table and make sure you're taken care of. Awesome concept."}
{"text":"Over 1000 reviews and a solid 4 stars. I have to agree. 

I was not terribly hungry, but I've wanted to try this place for a while and we were in the neighborhood -- so, I *apparently* dragged my less-than-excited family over the threshold here to give it a shot. 

The provided chips were cooked well and had both nice texture and flavor. The accompanying salsa was good as well. Always a good sign. 

I started with an almond horchata, which was good, but is served with ... chopped pecans (??) in it. Okay... it was more of a garnish than anything, but I had to double-check the menu to make sure I hadn't read it wrong.  I did not get mine \"spiked,\" but they do offer their aguas frescas with booze in them if you're into that. I think something neutral like vodka would be OK in horchata... or maybe rum(?), but anything else would either get lost in the horchata or lose the horchata completely. My opinion, though.

One of the kids ordered the black beans on the side, which I was able to try and I agree that they are very tasty (\"da bomb\" ? Maybe. They'd be more likely to get that from me if they mixed the beans with some nice chunky pico de gallo right before serving them). Still the black beans get a thumbs-up: good flavor and texture. 

I ordered two tacos from the list: Crispy Fish and Chicken Tinga. I liked the chicken one a lot, but found the fish one to be just OK. The fish was just a little dry and kind of bland. I would try the grilled fish next time. I also ate the guacamole that came with the quesadillas that the others ordered. It was tasty, although I like mine a little chunkier. Again, personal preference, not holding that against them. 

One of the boys had three carne asada tacos and, wow, did he put them away fast! This is the kid who is frequently \"not hungry\" when we go for Mexican food, so it was a little surprising. It was less so once I'd had a chance to try the carne asada in my wife's quesadilla. This meat was cooked very well and had that flame-touched, fatty, beefy taste and juicy texture that makes meat-eaters so happy. Apparently, that worked for him.

I found the service to be very good and the food arrived quickly. Our server, Miranda, kept our drinks topped off, handled the payment quickly, and thanked us for coming in.

This was a Sunday night, and the place was pretty full inside. The patio still had some seats, and there was no wait. I don't know what the crowd looks like on a weeknight -- or during taco Tuesday -- but it might get crazy... if you can find parking!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Exceeded my expectations! I had 3 tacos and wish I would have tried the fish taco but figured the 3 would have been plenty. Plus going on $2 Taco Tuesday night even topped my first visit here!  I also tried some of the nachos that my friend ordered and it was very yummy, as well as the 3 tacos that I ordered. The chips and salsa were also great! The waitress was very welcoming and the service was above and beyond! At the end of our meal my friends and I were debating getting dessert, and the waitress paid for our dessert since it was our first time there, how awesome! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I really wish the food wasn't so good so that I never had to come back here to endure the terrible service that comes with eating here. The chicken tinga and carne asada are bomb.com.co.uk and do yourself a favor and get a side of the white magic, you'll want to smother it on EVERYTHING. The bandit taco platter is also a win if you're feeling froggy. Cheese y Mas - excellent starter. As for the service, when I order an appetizer there's a 50/50 chance that it will actually come out before the entrees. Most of the servers are really short with you, not much warmth there. There are maybe 2 servers I've had there that have actually been great, I'm sad I can't remember their names to shout them out vs. the rest of the ones that don't even acknowledge you when you say thank you for something. If the service matched the deliciousness of the food, it would be an easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"always tried to make it here for happy hour, cause it makes my taste buds real HAPPY. always enjoyed their fish and carne asada tacos. parking is always tricky but if you get here early enough, no sweat. enjoyed eating out at their patio, especially when it's not toasty hot."}
{"text":"Bomb Guac, Tacos, Margaritas!! Went for Happy Hour, stayed well after. Shawn was cool af, the kid w/the 'stache was too, Love this place!! Definitely coming back and bringing family and friends!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I figured it was some taco shack, but it's actually a sit down restaurant with a great lunch crowd.

The street tacos were amazing - especially the fish tacos. 

The service was on another level too - I never had an empty drink, and often times they gave me 2 iced teas. 

I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch. Great atmosphere, very busy. We sat at the bar and were greeted promptly and given chips and salsa.

I ordered the shrimp and crispy fish tacos. Hubby tried the carnitas tacos. My shrimp taco was very disappointing. Out of the 3 shrimp two had pieces of shell on them and one was burned to a crisp. I asked the bartender if it was customary to leave the shells on the shrimp. He said yes. I said are you  sure and I showed him the tail of one of the shrimp. He  took it to his manager who said that they would replace the taco. The next one was cooked correctly. Overall the food is pretty average nothing special. They do have happy hour price drinks until 5 PM so that was a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Don't buy into to the hype! Everything we tried was bad. I did the 3 tacos with a free side. I tried the carne asada, crispy fish, and carnitas taco with a side of pinto beans. My wife had the Beast burrito. The crispy fish was over cooked. The fish was dry and the batter coating was about 2 seconds shy of being burnt. The carne asada was not edible. It was literally nothing but 2 strips of fat and gristle. The carnitas taco was actually braised beef because they brought the wrong one. That was the only decent taco, however.  My wife had the same issue with fat and gristle in her burrito but she did have some edible pieces of meat in there.  The burrito was very wet and soggy, not appealing attributes of a burrito. Not only was the food bad, the tacos were very small for the price. You can go to almost any other restaurant and get a taco twice the size and twice the flavor for half the cost.  There was a comment card left with the bill so my wife filled it out and listed a few of the points listed above.  As we were leaving, my wife stopped by the restroom and I waited outside.  The manager then came out of the restaurant and confronted me with an almost hostile manner said, \"so you didn't like the food, huh?\"  I explained many of the reasons.  He made excuses and gave me 2 coupons for 3 free tacos each. I already tried half their taco menu and was not impressed with any of them so I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Even coming here for a few years and the food is very delicious. My issue is that all of a sudden, you are getting nickeled and dimed on salsa. They give u a small little bowl to share among my husband and I and if you want another, it's an extra buck on top of the two entrees we order every time we come in. We always get a margarita and ice teas as well. They want to charge extra for taking our ice teas to go too. As customers for a long period of time, who spend good money here, why act so cheap all a sudden. They never done this before. It's just tacky and poor taste to do that in a restaurant. Won't be coming back for some time and if we do, I'll be asking for the manager the next time one of these waitresses tells me, \"it will be an extra dollar for salsa.\""}
{"text":"Exceptional service along with exceptional tacos what more is there to think about ?  I've been living in Gilbert for 2 months and I haven't found good tacos yet until I came across joyride on Tuesday I'm glad I did. The service was excellent and the tacos were really good the carne asada is the actual real Mexican flap meat there so delicious"}
{"text":"Just got home and read some of the reviews for Joyride! I agreed with most of them! There were great things about the food and some not so great things. I absolutely loved the chicken burrito!!! It was so tasty and the tortilla was perfect...crispy but soft!  The white sauce with it was wonderful!! The black beans were bland and did not impress at all.  I also got the tortilla soup but it had a funny taste to it. Not sure about that. 
I did enjoy my house margarita though! 
The service was great, but we were asked if everything was ok by 3 different people and if we liked out food by two of the staff (a little much).
The ambiance and decor was beautiful. 
I guess I wasn't impressed enough to rush back there, but I could go back (maybe)."}
{"text":"Really great taco spot in a mid century modern setting. The food here is always good and we have been happy with the service as well. Been here a few times and anticipate going back often now That we live down the road!"}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos, great service, and dog friendly! And $2 taco tuesday!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I finally made it to Joyride last week!!  The patio is awesome!!!  The restaurant has a unique vibe that draws you in and makes you smile!  The food is pretty good.  We're not talking gourmet here - its simple eating, but the flavors are good and its definitely worth checking out.  The Mexican Street Corn is AWESOME!!  This is definitely one of my new weekend spots for some daytime fun!!"}
{"text":"Rushed over here yesterday on a Taco Tuesday because I thought the Happy Hour was only until 5 (it wasn't, it's until 6) but since it was Taco Tuesday the specials run all night! Happily we ordered, and I sunk into the awesome colorful, retro decor, complete with vinyl seating and large golden orbs for lighting. I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere and the clientele was mostly young professionals and friends looking to unwind after work.
Now, take note, the Happy Hour menu drives a crazy bargain AND is delectable: $2 tacos, $5 margaritas, and $5 pitcher of beers. Pitchers people!
We ordered the Carnitas, the Fish, the Standard, and the Pork tacos. Unashamedly, we ordered about 10 tacos between us because they were so delicious and addictive. The tacos weren't too small, but they weren't super large either, and my personal favorite was the Fish (crispy not soggy like some other places), and the Standard (flowing with awesome sauce with every bite). My husband's favorites were the opposite, the Carnitas and the Pork, so we were both very satisfied.
The drinks were delicious, too. The Pineapple Mojito was divine - it tasted like they put cane sugar in the drink, and I have no idea if they actually did, but the fact that they could make it taste that way was impressive. The Blood Orange margarita was also tasty, and on the large side, but I enjoyed the Pineapple Mojito better. 
Our total bill came out to around $35, which is why I am so glad we moved up the street and will be returning on Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Very good street tacos. However they cut back on the complimentary chips and salsas :("}
{"text":"Absolutely the best casual upscale Mexican food in Phoenix.  Best service, best drinks, best food, best atmosphere, best everything.  I've been here ten times, never had a bad anything."}
{"text":"Jack Black may be known for the \"Get That Corn Outta My Face!\" meme, where he slaps two ears on a stick from Esqualito's hands.  It was probably because Hector scored the offending vegetable from America's Taco Shop, which has an embarrassingly bad rendition of this barrio sensation.

I shall be known as the \"Get That Corn Inta My Face!\" guy, after ordering elote from the Joyride app offering.  I am the Albexican, and know good corn Mexican.  Yeah that rhymed, I do it all the timed!

Another win for the vegetarians comes in the Garden Variety Burrito, enchilada style... sawed in half, with competing red and green sauces covering each dismemberment.  Snicker's could never satisfy like this

Lil tip... when you order, say, a... pineapple auga fresca... drink it quickly.  If you let it sit, the ice will melt, and you'll end up with a watered down agua fresca... and your heart will be sad.

Finally, and potentially the most important aspect (depending on if you're actively on laxatives or not)... the bathroom scene.  Let's taco bout it.

There's three doors.  Choose wisely, don't doddle.

1. Guys & Gals (The most spacious of the three.  Like driving a Chevrolet Cordova)
2. Gals & Guys (This is the middle child... we'll call it Jan Brady)
3. Gals  (VERY CRAMPED... because gals get cramps?  I dunno...)"}
{"text":"Here with my son.  Enjoyed the food while dining on their patio. Great place here in Gilbert ' s Heritage District.  Busy place even at 4:00 on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and outdoor seating. I was able to bring my friends dog here and have a fun and relaxed time. This obviously isn't an authentic Mexican place but still great tasting!"}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAY. The tacos were mouth watering! I ordered two tacos for a late lunch the fish taco and the carne asada. $2 a taco during happy hour or Taco Tuesday. The tacos are small, but they have lots of flavor. GREAT food!"}
{"text":"Seating was fast and easy on a Thursday night. The restaurant pretty full. The salsa was out of this world! The service has been excellent. Very attentive without being intrusive. The wait staff was knowledgeable and directed me to a Non Cilantro meal (thank you Jesus). 

The ambience is very original. Funky modern we will call it. The music was at a perfect volume. My companion and I were able to have a conversation without screaming and saying what every other word. 

The pinto beans are refried. They don't state this on the menu.

Chilaques looks delicious! My companion said it was in every sense of the word.

I had the Carne Asada taco. Very very good. 

They serve a really refreshing beverage called a Agua Frescas . Now we're talking!!! 

To sum it up delicious  and stuffed!!!!

Thank you good folks at Joyride!!!"}
{"text":"I ate at this location and the one in Gilbert while on a business trip to Phoenix. Both times were home runs! Service is spot on, ambiance is excellent (don't let the word hipster scare you!), and the food is fantastic. Our server at this location was Trevor and he was so great... helpful and personable! I would eat here every time I'm back in Phoenix! Get the brownie sundae... it will change your life!!"}
{"text":"What a JoY!
We went at 8:15 on a Friday night so of course it was packed.  We were quoted a 45 minute wait which is normal in Phoenix.
The bar is huge with plenty of seats and easy to get a drink.  However, even better is the patio on the north side of the building, that is separate from the dining patio, and perfect for waiting.  There is plenty of seating, a few table, and a server dedicated to making sure you never are thirsty!  We found 3 seats right away, and they brought us a basket of fresh chips and salsa and waters to start while we looked over all the drinks.  Within minutes we all had margaritas in our hands and we were happy.  Very smart move Joyride.  The 45 minutes flew by because we could converse and drink and munch on chips the whole time.  
We were greeted with the same friendliness when we were seated at our table in the dining room.  Again, waters and fresh chips and salsa right away.  Our drinks from earlier were effortlessly transferred to our dining bill, so there was no urgent need to close out with one server before being sat at our table.  
We changed up our drinks inside and were impressed by each one we had.  All of the nectars and juices are house made which makes the drinks very fresh.  No bottled mixers or syrupy concoctions.  The house margarita was perfect.  Not sweet or overly tart.  Just refreshing.  The Blood Orange Margarita was a little sweeter but also delicious.  The Key Largo was something else.  Very pina colada-esque but better.  Whatever they used to rim the glass made the drink.  Everyone was impressed.  
The food was very well done.  We stared with street corn, which was flavored well, but will probably be even better when corn is actually in season.  It just didn't have the sweet and juiciness that you get from corn on the cob in late summer.  Our friend had the tortilla soup with chicken which she said was fantastic and perfectly spiced.
We all had tacos of course, although I was very tempted by the chilequilles.  Next time, maybe for lunch!  My favorite were the shrimp tacos.  Huge shrimp, great flavor, and NOT breaded!  The baja fish tacos were fantastic as well.  Finally a place that does grilled fish tacos well in Phoenix.  The braised beef taco was tender and juicy as well.  The tortillas are homemade and amazing and much larger than your typical street taco.
Here is the one complaint I had about the food.  The side dishes were not up to par.  We had the pinto beans and the rice.  Both were pretty forgettable.  I am very surprised by this because Windsor, also an Upward Project restaurant, is known for their sides.  (hello Joe's church potatoes and mac n' cheese).  So next time we will try some other sides in hope of finding something better.  The sides are included when ordering 3 tacos, otherwise you really don't need them after all the chips and tacos!
We usually skip desert because we are rarely impressed by restaurant deserts, and I for one would rather have another basket of chips and salsa.  I am a salt guy, not a sweets guy.  BUT, Better Than Betty's was one of the best desserts I have had at a restaurant in a really long time.  It was perfect to share by the way, even by 3 people.  The brownie was incredible...chewy inside and slightly crusty outside and just the slightest hint of spice that made it less Betty Crocker and more Nacho Libre!  Then there was a layer of caramel that was divine.  It had to be homemade.  And a huge scoop of dulce de leche ice cream that was definitely homemade.  As soon as we tasted it we knew they must have made it across the street at Churn.  If you have been there you know what I am talking about.  That smooth creamy homemade ice cream that is so dangerous because it is walking distance from my house.  Perfect.  Oh, and the candied pecans were a bonus.  They almost had a caramel corn flavor to them.  Anyways, the combination of flavors left us all speechless.  
So if I had to make a recommendation for diners, it would be cocktails, 2 tacos each (which is very hard to narrow down from your choices) skip the sides, and dessert is a must!
The place looks great and I can't wait for spring when they open up all the sliding windows and doors.  
We have tried Taco Guild as well (see my review) and Joyride is 10x better and way more fun.
I forgot to mention the service.  Everyone was so friendly and fun.  The servers inside at our table, and outside on the patio, were very helpful with recommendations and explanations.  We were never without drinks or chips and salsa or water.  Super attentive and just a great, laid back, easy vibe that is normal from these 4 neighborhood restaurants on this corner.  That is why we love them and keep coming back!  (it helps they are all walking distance too!)"}
{"text":"I love Joyride! Most things I've had are full of flavor, in a simple / understated way. The Fresca's are a must! My fav is the citrus, a super tart / slightly sweet refreshing beverage. Nachos are on point as well! The Mexican Street corn (although looks amazing) isn't that fab."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, Vibe, Staff, Music - Thumbs up.   Fresca's refreshing.  I like this place, just not a big fan of the food...  one of our crew from both evening visits stated \"Great vibe, till you get the food\".   Your taste may be entirely different.  Regardless I'll likely be back...

Let me tell you how to have a good time here all the way around...  Start at the bar and wait to get a booth inside near the bar (especially in winter).  Enjoy the free chips/salsa.  Stick to the standard Taco's - they are pretty good.  Don't have expectations for the sides.  The people at Upward Projects I think have a lot going right at this place.

Winter notice:  The outside patio surrounds the seating with door entries at several points.  This past visit we were seated next to a door to the main patio - it was being opened over and over with the cold winter air coming in.  After the door was propped open a couple times I told them I would let them in when needed (and the parties around us thanked me - they were feeling the cold too).

I think I might rate this a 4 during another season :)."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Love the decor and the staff. 
Patio was great and the food was really fresh and flavorful. The tortillas here are awesome! I also had the cucumber mint aqua fresca which was really refreshing - perfect for a hot day!"}
{"text":"Waited to review until all the freshness had worn off. Great experience - except for parking.. but this whole area is horrific for parking. Awesome, cocktails had the Moscow mule ala Joyride -- yummy... ... really great and unique food."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and never been really impressed.  It's hipster Mexican food.  Still Mexican food.  The tacos aren't any better than anywhere else.  I wasn't blown away.  The guacamole is pretty good but nothing to brag about.  Unless you go before 5pm, everything is overpriced.  Also, the service does not meet Upward Projects' standards.  They're not very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here after work for happy hour- don't think they have that many specials but they so give a free shot with the order of a pint. Place is packed but we waited around 15 min and got seated- not bad.

I got the blood orange margarita- pretty sweet- first one was good but it got old after the second one. They have a variety of beers as well. 

I recommend getting the guac and chips as well as picking tacos off the taco menu. Fresh and yummy. The other dishes like the quesadilla tasted good in the beginning but then my stomach really didn't feel well afterwards. Could be a fluke but be warned....

Service is pretty friendly- place kind of thins out after dinner time."}
{"text":"Cute decor and delicious food. The tacos are small street tacos so if you come really hungry, it can get a little pricey. I've tried all of the tacos, except for the ones with seafood, and all of them were very tasty. There is a good selection of beer and other alcoholic beverages. I really like all of the watermelon drink concoctions they have, but everything I've tried is delicous. I enjoy coming here for drinks and smaller meals. I like to come during week days on sort of off hours when its not as crowded."}
{"text":"I've always loved Joyride Tacos, so imagine my excitement when I was scouring the town for caterers for my wedding and found out they will do larger partiers like weddings. Natalie from Upward Projects (the parent company) was amazing from the first time I contacted her. She is incredibly professional and responded to me very quickly. After looking at really expensive quotes for what looked like average food, their quote was the icing on the cake - the cost was so reasonable. No wedding price gouging. Natalie worked with my wedding planner to get all the final details coordinated. Everything was set up so well for the wedding. We had a guacamole/salsa bar for the cocktail hour and a taco buffet for dinner. My guests raved about the food. It was delicious! Natalie and the servers were so incredibly friendly and efficient. I couldn't have asked for more."}
{"text":"Wonderful tacos. Both times I have been there the service has been slow. However, the tacos are amazing. I love the margaritas and the decor!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  Stop by here for a late lunch to dine here during their \"happy hour\" which includes $5 margaritas and $2 tacos!   
We started off with guacamole, it was unique with roasted corn, cojito cheese and tomatillos.   The crispy fish taco was flavorful and delivered exactly as it was described.  The braised beef taco was also bold in flavor, however the meat was much more chewy that it should have been.  The drinks were amazing and you can't go wrong with the happy hour price.  

The only downfall to Joyride is the service.  You don't have one waitress the entire time, so drinks may or may not be refilled and it might take a while for them to \"check\" on your table to see if you need anything or even take your order. 

Feeding 3, which includes 3 adult beverages and an appetizer for $38 made this place a little sweeter - you can't beat the happy hour prices at Joyride Taco House.   As long as you don't mind the service being inconsistent."}
{"text":"Great tacos at a great price!  It was extremely busy during lunch but there is always room at the bar.  The service was fantastic.  Chips and salsa included with the meal is a sign of a true Mexican restaurant.  Loved it."}
{"text":"JoyRide For Taco Tuesday- I would recommend this place for Taco Tuesday as pricing is good otherwise expensive Tacos. Love the location and atmosphere.

Food; Fish Taco was so good, next time go back will
Only get the crunchy fish tacos so good. Carne Asada taco was not my cup of tea, the meat looks like it marinated in a think type marinade. The guacamole is actually one of the bests in town, definitely get the Guacamole. 

Service; Our Server was so nice and knew what she was doing. She never let up sit with empty drinks or chips. 

Food; 3 Stars
Service and Atmosphere 5 Stars
So gave he place 4 Stars"}
{"text":"Delicious variety of tacos! They have various Margaritas mixes available! Taco Tuesday worthy! Great vibes, love the decor. Comfy patio seating (for a not so hot day). It does get super packed on Taco Tuesday's last time I think it was a 30-45 min wait but it's THAT good! Service is consistent."}
{"text":"Met a good friend here for lunch today. Really outstanding service! Chips were light & served with a nice tomatillo salsa. I ordered three tacos: the Standard (chicken, guac & a mild aji amarillo), the Crispy Fish (beer-battered fish & slaw), and the Shrimp. So.Good! With three tacos, you get a side, and we both got the Orange-Cucumber salad -- cukes sliced on the diagonal with pepitas. The food enhanced the company, which is always nice. And the restaurant provided a great vantage point to watch a very fast dust storm move in! Will be back."}
{"text":"I like this type of place exists in east valley suburbia.  But I wasn't impressed, especially being an Upward concept.  This was my first time visiting.  Food was good, overpriced for the demographic  and offerings in my option, but a nice selection of options no less.  The service on the other hand, terrible.  We had to continually ask for drinks until we took matters into our own hands and went to the bar directly.  This shouldn't be the case when you're seated in the dining area.  Waiter didn't follow up when the food arrived, and a side of salsa that was requested when the order went in, took asking 4 times!  

I will drive the extra mile to visit other Upward concepts, but wouldn't patron this place again based on the service experience, or really, lack there of."}
{"text":"5-17-17.  I have been wanting to try this place as I have heard good things.  First the atmosphere is nice, a very trendy retro vibe.  The large bar in the middle of the room looked like a fun place to sit if you were by yourself or with one friend.  It was a Saturday night about 5:30 so the place was crowded.  We were told we had to wait 20 minutes and found a place to sit outside while we waited.  A waitress came around and asked all of us who were waiting if we wanted to order drinks.  She did not offer any drink menus so I didn't know about the extensive margarita selection this place has.  I ordered the regular house margarita which was freshly made with real lime juice.  I really liked it.  We were seated after about a 20 minute wait on the outside patio.  This area is kept cool with misters so it was enjoyable for people watching. Our waiter was very pleasant and brought hot chips and salsa out right away.  I ordered the crispy fish taco, carne asada taco and a side of rice.  The tacos come in a little metal taco holder so they stay up and the filling doesn't fall out.  The rice came on a separate little plate.  The crispy fish taco I ordered was just OK,  it was not hot and it wasn't really crisp either.  It was like the fish was cooked a while ago and held under a hot light. I have had better elsewhere.  The carne asada taco had nice flavoring and had crispy pieces like you would get from your backyard barbeque.  These tacos were small street tacos.  The rice was typical mexican rice.  Nothing special here.  Overall my opinion is the margarita was great and the food OK but I didn't feel the atmosphere and food made the price worth it for me to want to come back.  I don't live near here so I don't think this is a place I will repeat to."}
{"text":"Tacos are great. Street corn is great. Waiting a ridiculous amount of time while watching the waitstaff (understaffed) slowly saunter through the restaurant. Horrible. Paying for chip refills. Horrible. Still waiting......."}
{"text":"Blood orange margarita is amazing! The tacos were good except no one at our table liked the shrimp taco. I can't wait to try this place again! Great salsa and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here on my birthday which was in January. Aquarius baby.   I loved the tacos very delicious, my fave was the braised beef taco.  What was the best about thing about this  place? it was the atmosphere and it's open and spacious no matter where you are seated. It feels very San Diego for a Gilbert resto.  Very fun and would like to return for happy hour and more tacos please!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and hip, and the margaritas are so bomb! We tried four different types and they were so good. They have a really good happy hour and really nice servers."}
{"text":"On first arriving, I was really confused by the parking situation.. I was informed by the valet guys that I was not supposed to enter off of Central?!? and that I could not park myself even though the lot was empty...? 
My party was seated right away. The place is so dimly lit that the two older folks I had with me complained they couldn't see. Haha, old people. I could see fine, but it was a hair too dark and one measly table candle didn't help much. The salsa that came out with the chips was smoky chipotle and not good to me, instead of offering to bring me a replacement when I asked about other options, the waitress suggested that I buy other types of salsa :( rude. I did and I wasn't impressed with those either. 
I had The Standard tacos, they were very good. One person in my group got the carne asada tacos and mouth fulls of fat, I guess the chef didn't trim it close enough. They excluded his meal from the bill :)
The hipster staff was indistinguishable from the patrons, they also weren't the friendliest servers I've had either. 
The atmosphere was fun though, and a nice contrast to the neighboring restaurants. I think this place would make a better bar than restaurant.
I am a local, and if I'm looking for great tacos, I'm not going here, there are lots of other places in town with way better mexican food. I would come here again for drinks and atmosphere, and maybe a taco to offset the alcohol ;)"}
{"text":"I came across Joyride about a month ago and had it bookmarked with intentions to try very,very soon. Then i saw it in the New Time, \"Best of 2013\" and made it mandatory to get out here pronto! I was sucked in light a moth to a light as soon as we sat down. The atmosphere is so inviting and comfortable..like hanging out in a friends cool backyard.

Started off with a cup or tortilla soup and Cheese y mas ( warm melted cheesy goodness), both of which were spot on.

Me and my lover boy shared the fried fish taco & braised beef taco and he went all in for The Beast burrito and i went for the cochinita pibil torta. Let me tell you something, Im not usually a totra kinda girl but I switched it up yesterday & Im glad i did because the damn torta rocked my taste buds. We both had leftovers but devoured the rest as a late night snack. 

Oh yeah, please do try the daily freshly made aguas frescas. 
Recommendation: Cucumber Mint spiked with tequila. ( Hey, i felt somewhat healthy while drinking it)"}
{"text":"Upward has sure did it again. Great concept,  love the high top chairs. Love the whole vibe to this place. :) 

Chip and salsa??!!? Yuppppp. Keeep them coming this wayyy. Hehe
Great selection of hot tea :)
I enjoyed my garden burrito. OMG! The mushroom though.  Idk what they marinate it with. It was so soft yet chewy and so tasteful. 
The customer service was okay. I had to ask three different ppl for water and napkins. :/ bur other that,  I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Chicken tinga tacos rock and the Nachos rock. If you enjoy a ace with a vibe that makes you feel welcome no matter who you are. Fancy even though it's got an awesome taco stand energy. This place is like no other delicious food, world class staff, beer selection for real beer drinkers, love for the masses"}
{"text":"Simply put the food here is awful. Way too salty, expensive, and a tourist trap. The tacos were just shy of $4 each...that is outrageous for an extremely pedestrian taco that is neither good nor authentic. I didn't care for the rice or beans either. This is more of a happy hour/drink friendly place. YMMV."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best tacos and tamales we've ever eaten anywhere. Adding to that, the service and atmosphere of this restaurant were both exceptional!"}
{"text":"The pazole soup and black bean side was pretty salty just to be warned. Other then that it was great. I had the ensalada which was awesome but the guacamole was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Hannah, for singlehandedly rescuing my opinion of this place. Job really well done!

I've always liked the food here. Any entree cooked well. Well proportioned. Fair pricing. Properly cooked. 

I've always had good experiences with the different servers here. I'm impressed that so many of them seem able to recognize returning customers with ease. I'm also impressed that all of the servers and runners seem to pitch in and help one another.

In addition to Hannah, there are 3-4 male servers (one looks like a biker and 2 seem to always wear shirts that match each other), are really good humans.

I am over the Taco Tuesday madness. I get it for 20-somethings and maybe even 30-somethings that the idea of gathering with friends to pound a zillion tacos and wash them down with mighty tasty $5 margs made to order might be fun. Those days are done for me. I don't need to wait 60+ minutes to be seated via a text message system that doesn't always work just to be packed in like sardines and be treated to front-row rock concert level music noise. Depending upon what you order, their \"normal\" menu prices for items other than tacos makes the tab roughly the same.

So, for me, it's any night other than Tuesday night and I'll be very happy here.

Oh, and the brownie dessert? Heck to the Yes! The only way they make dessert any better is to use the ice cream from Churn. Same owner so I don't get why they don't do this."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service are fun and friendly. Ceviche is awesome. Nachos didn't hit the spot - I was missing cheese. But highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time last Tuesday. Ordered the make your own taco trio (can't remember the actual name) with the three meats on the side. Rice and beans. It was good and enough for my friend and I to share. We enjoyed their decor and happy hour prices. The bartenders weren't overly friendly but we still had a good time and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Good food and good drinks! The place had a great atmosphere and great service. I loved the pork tacos!"}
{"text":"Came in later for drinks and dessert. 10pm-ish. They prepared my fiancé's whiskey perfectly.  I had the horchata w/o alcohol.  Good horchata!

I tried the churros. They were excellent!  Not greasy at all!  Someone knows how to fry!  They had a perfect amount of cinnamon and sugar. The chocolate dipping sauce was good  I think I would have preferred a vanilla cream custard to dip them in though. 

Great vibe, good music.  Felt like I was in another town. I love the atmosphere there."}
{"text":"It's surprisingly hard to find a GOOD taco place in AZ. I'm so particular about them. But these were absolutely amazing and not insanely overpriced. And they have THE BEST salsas!!! I had gotten all of them.. because once again.. I'm so particular lol.. And each one was sooo delicious-- you can taste the freshness.
Keep  it up =) I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service was excellent, stopped by about 40 min prior to closing and no one ever made you feel rushed. The reason for this review is the cucumber orange salad! It was delicious, I know it's considered a side but it was amazing. I was meeting up with friends and wanted something light it exceeded my expectations. The veggie taco was quite delightful as well."}
{"text":"Last week we thought we would give Joyride Taco another try,  after all we really liked the food and drinks.  WOW what a difference!!  The food is still great, and the service has had a major upgrade.  We noticed the waiters concentrated on the guests, and other staff had been added to do cleanup, etc."}
{"text":"If you know me well, you know that I absolutely LOVE tacos (I mean...who doesn't?!) Joyride satisfies every facet of my love for tacos by serving up a variety of delicious gourmet tacos.

I ended up at Joyride by the recommendation of my mom and we decided to go as a family for my birthday. I thoroughly enjoyed my birthday experience. First, of all the staff was so friendly and accommodating. We had multiple servers come through to make sure we had everything we needed throughout the night. 

I started the night off by ordering their Prickly Pear Margherita. It was pink and sweet with the right amount of tequila and adorned with a cute little umbrella. My boyfriend got the Pineapple Mojito which was equally tasty! Next I ordered the Mexican Street Corn appetizer. It comes on the cob with a knife to shed the kernels on your own. It was so creamy and the kernels burst with savory paprika flavor. I'm not quite sure what is in their sauce on the corn that they deem\"white magic\" but it could possibly be pixie dust filled with rainbows that make your eyes sparkle once digested. 

For the main entree, I ordered the three tacos that come with your choice of a side. I went with the Carne Asada, Braised Beef, and Crispy Fish with a side of the Bomb Black Beans (great name, I love some alliteration). They all had multitudes of flavor, making each taco unique. However, my favorite was the Braised Beef. It has avocado which is always important but those gastrique onions really make the taco pop; they complemented the seasoned Braised Beef perfectly. The Bomb Black Beans speak for themselves with their name! 

My boyfriend also did the 3 tacos, my dad got a burrito, and my mom has two tacos. All plates were completely cleared by the end of the meal. At the end, because it was my birthday, they brought out their Better than Betty's dessert on the house (so nice!!). I love a brownie with some ice cream and carmel sauce!! YUM. 

The restaurant aesthetics are wonderful, great vibe, modern fun decor, and plenty of seating. Reservations are never a bad idea on the weekend as it gets very busy. Valet Parking is complimentary but it's always nice to leave a tip! Otherwise, the parking situation can be tough! I will be heading back soon to try more tacos!!"}

{"text":"Let me start by saying, I would have rated Joyride a 4, but for one significant fact--the mixed drinks are a poor value. Nine dollars for a small glass that is filled with 75% ice just doesn't cut it. To top it off, they arrive with short straws (Disney made the 2nd and 3rd stories of Main Street buildings progressively smaller so you would think they were taller) which causes your drink to disappear even faster. When we ordered a third house Margarita and requested less ice, the bartender limited the ice but simply poured the drink shorter. I guess they have to pay for the exquisite decorations and furnishings somehow! 

Joyride is cut in the new mold of restaurants intended for both seeing and being seen. Where the value of the meal you pay for is significantly in the theater of the atmosphere. Something you can't take home with you. That said, there's a lot of theater here, and it is very well done. Everything exudes quality. From the chairs, comfy and styled, to the decorations. Not a stone appears to have been unturned to create and resurrect images, colors and shapes evocative of childhood memories residing in the deepest recesses of baby boomer brains. It is outstanding. And the food is a decent value as well. 

I had the carne asada burrito and my wife had the chicken tamale. Both very good and ample. the chips are great and the service attentive. In fact, I would say that the staff was a cut above the (low) average set by Fox Concept restaurants. Everyone from the greeter/hostess to the waitstaff and manager were solicitous and genuine (well as genuine as they have time to be). These are real people with a mission and vision instilled by the owners...not bimbos and bimbettes schooled in the fine art of maximizing (restaurant) revenue, minimizing expense and maximizing tip income. 

So, Joyride delivers more than most theater restaurants: good value in food (both cost and quality), great surroundings (visually and in terms of comfort) but you pay for it in the cocktails. I suppose an alternate strategy would be to rely on beer. Or, if you don't drink beer, have one cocktail at home before coming over (but who wants to make a margarita at home, especially on a Friday night after work)...I have never found homemade ones to be that great. Joyride does offer a taller glass for an additional two dollars. Which I suppose has the amount of alcohol that the $9 one should have.

Also, as an earlier review warned, avoid the double trio of two person tables sandwiched together at either end of the lovely round booths. You will feel uncomfortable and untethered as the wait-staff traverses these thoroughfares (a feng-shui moment).

Even though you do end up paying more...you don't feel quite as cheated as at the other \"theme\" restaurants."}
{"text":"Food tastes great. You don't get alot of food for the price.I took my family there it was nice.  We went during the summer.  My son enjoyed the outside misters."}
{"text":"Our tacos were cold, the fish tacos came with just one tiny fish piece, and no lime or hot sauce offered. The guacamole saved the day, it was great. One thing that was strange was that the sides came out on the flat appetizer dishes like they ran out of side dishes. I guess I just expected a better fish taco. 
With so many options next door, tough to come back."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing lunch with my girls. Joy Ride had all the windows open and had a killer breeze going through the restaurant. The decor was super fun and our Server seriously was the best! Cory made sure we were happy and had our drinks and very descriptive in all the menu.  I ordered the Machaca bowl and it was delish. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"K and I visited this place a long time ago,  a couple weeks after they opened. We sat at the bar and let's just say, did not have the best experience. Tonight I met S, one of my AOB buds. He drove down from Scottsdale for his BDay and Joyride was his choice. 
We got sat right away only because a table opened up. The place was otherwise full. Our server was Midori. She was awesome. She was attentive but not intrusive.
Joyride is of course a member of the Upward Project family. Postino, Churn, The Windsor and Federal Pizza. This doesn't guarantee Joyride will be good but it does give it a head start. The menu consists of Appetizers, soups & salads, Taco's 11 ways, Burritos 4 ways, Chilaquiles and Enchiladas. Margaritas, beer & wine, Aguas Frescas plus various Tequilas. 
S and I started with a couple of margaritas. ($9 ea) S got the Prickly Pear and I got the Blood Orange. My Blood Orange margarita, made with Tequila, Triple Sec, Blood Orange sour and Hibiscus syrup was really tasty. The blood orange flavor stood out but was not overwhelming.
S ordered The Beast Burrito ($10). It was filled with Carne Asada, Pinto Beans, Avocado and salsa. S enjoyed his burrito and said it was quite good.
I ordered the Garden Variety Burrito ($8 + $2 for Red & Green sauce). This was seriously the best veggie burrito I have ever had. This thing was stuffed with Butternut and Chayote Squash, Spinach, Mushroom, Avocado, Corn, Queso, Tomatillo salsa, White Magic and Pico gringo. I could taste everything inside the tortilla. All the flavors mingled perfectly with each other. Now, I did order this with the red and green sauce. This was a recommendation from Midori. She was spot on. The sauce elevated this burrito to another level. Winner winner veggie burrito dinner.
I did find a couple things that were no bueno. Their website says Happy Hour ends at 5pm. Midori said it ended at 6. It was after 6 so it didn't really matter either way but one of them was wrong. Hopefully it's the website because ending Happy Hour at 5pm would be a joke. Another thing that was not the best was the acoustics of the dining room. Why would the Upward Project design an interior that basically causes ALL the sounds to bounce around making it very hard to hear anything. Not impressed with that but the rest of the design is great.
I would also like to add that the music that was playing was great. Dion and the Belmonts and The Beastie Boys to name a couple.
Great margarita, great food, great server, fair prices, great background music, lousy acoustics. 4 Stars"}
{"text":"This place is adorable; great decor, great vibe. I like the outdoor seating area. But I think it's over-priced. My friend and I ordered tacos and guacamole. IMO the flavor just wasn't there. I hate to say it, but Barrio Queen is just up the street and it's bursting with flavor!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!  my kids took me there for my 45 birthday and they sat us in a booth with so many flies the manager had to come over with BUG SPRAY and spray the window.!! The pesticide was so strong they had to move us to other booth she had just sprayed. There were dead flies everywhere. Needless to say when our food came we had to fight the flies for it. The dessert was horrible, the drinks were garbage and they wouldn't offer to take it back. Not a good bday!!!!"}
{"text":"Upward project has done it again.
We went to Joyride Sunday,early afternoon and had a great experience. Greeted by a friendly young lady, taken to a table,brought us a high chair for our 15month old daughter.
 Right away our server, Lori, came over quickly with chips and absolutely delicious salsa. I had been to another new taco restaurant the night before, but the salsa at joyride is far, far more flavorful.  We order right away, nachos, recommended by Lori. My husband loved them! 
I order carne asada torta it was absolutely perfect. My husband got chicken tacos. Very good.

Lori also told us that Joyride has a kids plate. Perfect!  A another helpful young lady brought over a adorable kid friendly plate with two chicken tacos, fruit and I order a side of bomb black beans, which my daughter loved!

Great service, everyone who works there was very  friendly and seemed eager to please there customers. 
I can't wait for our next  visit back to Joyride."}
{"text":"I love Upward Projects, but unfortunately, I was not wowed by this place. My friends and I came here for margaritas and tacos on a sunny Saturday afternoon. The guacamole was delicious, but the portion was so small compared to the high price tag. I ordered the crispy fish tacos and the fish was dry dry dry. I think they over fried it because it was really tough. I also ordered a side of the street corn. That was very delicious, but the corn was not cook throughout. 
I will give it one more chance before nixing it. I do however love their $5 drinks before 5pm. :)"}
{"text":"Thanks you Upward Projects...you make it so hard to go back to work after hanging out at your cool and hip Mexican joint. I feel like I'm on a Mexican vacation when I visit here and all I need is a sombrero and a cabana boy. I love getting away from work and coming back here for lunch. Great decor and amazing patio to enjoy when the weather is perfect. Now let's talk about the tacos... Lots of a great variety to choose from. My favorite are the crispy fish and the braised beef street tacos. Can't go wrong with anything you order here. The salsa also has a great kick to it.
Make it your next lunch stop or hot spot... It will leave you and you belly happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and vibe of Joyride on Gilbert Road. My husband and I were starving and worked quite late Thursday evening - we were so excited that Joyride was open till 11pm! 

The service was excellent! I felt like we were getting checked on non-stop! As we were starving, we ordered an appetizer and three tacos each with a side of habanero salsa: carnitas quesadilla, shrimp tacos, crispy fish tacos, a braised beef and a carne aside taco.

The carnitas quesadilla was absolutely delicious. It was very greasy, which made us a little uneasy at first, but after your first bite the rest is history. We destroyed the quesadilla and couldn't stop talking about it after. We even said it was our favorite, beyond the tacos!

The tacos were pretty good but definitely had some opportunities. The crispy fish had great flavor but the fish in both my taco and my husbands were the size of a golf ball. It was disappointing that the best taco was so tiny. The shrimp tacos were opposite, a good portion of shrimp (also very tasty). The braised beef and carne asada were also both good but not as flavorful as the fish and shrimp. 

In the end, the quesadilla with a little bit of guac and habanero salsa is still blowing our minds."}
{"text":"My food was reasonably good and they did a decent job keeping up with our large party - I may just be getting too old for places this dark and loud.  If you are out for, say, girls night out, etc, this may be a better fit for you than it was for me.  I did like the variety of tacos offered and loved their cheese dip, but could not hear the person seated across the table from me, so that was a challenge."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my bf. We were craving tacos and he found this place through yelp cause we wanted to eat nearby. The weather was nice so we ate outside! I had Carne asada, shrimp, and crispy fish with Spanish rice on the side. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh! So much flavor and I was satisfied with every bite. Their house salsa and chips were good for starters.. My bf had braised beef, shrimp, and crispy fish tacos as well with grilled veggies which he enjoyed very much. All we could say is MMMM! Service was great and they were all friendly. Thanks for the great experience on our first time being here. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE Joyride after hearing all the hype. Did I LOVE it? No. Did I like it? Yes... 

The decor and atmosphere is fun and trendy. The chairs and booths were all comfy. HUGE bar area which I thought was great. 

Service was really good. We had two different ladies waiting on us. They were both friendly and attentive. 

Drinks and food were okay. I got the blood orange margarita. At first sip I was like \"Wow this is great!\" After a few more, it started to get SO sweet. I could barely finish it. I ordered the crispy fish, shrimp and ahi tacos. The crispy fish was actually really good but the other two were rather bland. The ahi was dry. I got black beans as a side and they were also very bland (I added some salt myself.). 

They give you complimentary chips and salsa in the beginning but it's a fire roasted salsa. If you want any other kind besides fire roasted you have to pay. 

Also, I wish they had a couple tvs at the bar area. We wanted to meet up with some friends to watch the USA soccer game and would have stayed here, but ended up going to a different restaurant to watch it since Joyride didn't have any tvs.

I will probably return to give this place another chance and maybe try some different things. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars but the food just didn't knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Friday night and I was very impressed. The staff was attentive and we were well taken care of. The food was amazing and very fresh. This will definitely be our new neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"We actually really liked this place. The one thing I will say is that it is *always* packed, so prepare for a wait pretty much no matter what. That being said, the service here is absolutely *on point!* The food is pretty good... Not outstanding, but certainly not bad. Drinks are great and reasonably priced. Fun atmosphere. We have been back twice now, and the service/quality of food seems to be very consistent. Great place for day drinks. :)"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Yummy thin chips with salsa. Agua frescas con booze por favor. Would go again with friends."}
{"text":"Not only did they decide to raise their prices they now charge for chips and salsa after the first basket and when ordering 3 tacos you don't get the side for free anymore, extra $1 for the side.  Subpar sevice on top of it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice lunch here with friends when I was in Gilbert on a recent weekend. We just walked up. No reservations. We waited just a short time (maybe 5 mins) for our table out on the patio for 9 to be set up. Service from the hostess to our server and the countless others that either brought our orders or refilled our drinks was friendly. They have a lot of young college-aged staff and I thought their customer service was excellent.

chips and salsa on the table as soon as you sit down... I went with a pineapple agua fresca. it was refreshing. kinda perfect on a warm day. 

I ordered the 3 taco combo. I went with pork adobada, crispy fish and braised beef. The pork adobada was deliciously guajillo simmered pork served with cabbage, radishes & onions. no cilantro for me in any of these orders. it was a real good taco especially with all the handmade tortillas. the crispy fish taco was excellent, it was a white fish beer battered & fried and served with guacamole, slaw in a white flour tortilla. yumm. the braised beef was served with avocado, cabbage, radish and onions. it was also very tasty. i was happy with all that i had ordered. my order came with a side and i went with the tomato rice but i found it to be a bit lacking in flavor. that was the only downer. everything else was great. 

we celebrated my nephew's 15th birthday at joy ride and we ordered him a caramel brownie. i didnt have any but it looked great. im sure it was as delicious as advertised... i look forward to eating here next time i'm in town."}
{"text":"Sat at bar. Would have liked better service, but nothing could have made up for the below average tacos that were delivered with quite the wait. Fish, chicken and beef tacos. Fish was almost inedible (not sure which Chinese fish farm they pull from), chicken was cold/rancid and beef was possibly mediocre. More alcohol couldn't even help this place. No idea how it is so busy!!!!"}
{"text":"The family decided to have dinner at Joyride Taco House on a Sunday evening.  We arrived at about 6:00pm, and we were promptly seated indoors.  Since there were only a few available tables when we arrived, we didn't end up having the best seating.  Our table was cramped for four people, and we were tucked away in a corner without much of a view   Overall, the restaurant is somewhat cozy inside with a modern decor and a bit of a hipster vibe.  There are also a few outdoor dining areas, but on this day with temperatures exceeding 110, there wasn't anyone sitting outside.  Overall ambiance - 3/5.

In terms of the food, we had the complementary chips and salsa as an appetizer.  Then I ordered 3 tacos - the Crispy Fish, Chicken Tinga, and the Carne Asado along with the Mexican veggies for the side.  The tacos were excellent with the Crispy Fish being my favorite followed by the Carne Asado, and the Chicken Tinga was a distant third.  The veggies were excellent and consisted of roasted corn and peppers with some added greens.  Overall food - 4.5/5.

Paige was our server and she really took care of our table.  She had a very warm personality and took the time to answer our questions.  She checked-in on us at appropriate intervals and made sure water and ice was refilled without having to be asked to do so.  Overall service - 4.5/5.

We enjoyed our dining experience at JTH, and we would be interested in dining here again.  Next time I'd like to try Happy Hour or Taco Tuesdays where most varieties of tacos on sale for $2 each as well as drink specials.  This is a good deal that can't be missed."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed! Great service!!! I came with two young children and the waitress Adrian laughed with them and made us feel welcome! The food... Omg... the best part is you CAN order three different tacos if you want!Order them all to try!! I also tried the Pineapple mojito and watermelon margarita. Both were on point!! I would TOTALLY come here again!!"}
{"text":"Came here with two of my coworkers for lunch today. We got there a few minutes after they opened so the wait time wasn't bad at all! Near the end it did get rather busy so I suggest the earlier the better. Our waitress was great! Very nice and informative, even convinced us to try to margaritas! I got the coconut margaritas and my other coworker got a prickly pear. Mine was nice and smooth great taste! The prickly pear was a bit too sweet for my liking but still really good. We both agreed that they were not strong at all. We usually feel a bit fuzzy after one Margarita and these didn't do that to us. Still really good though. 
Food came out rather fast. Again this might be because we got there pretty early before the rush. Everything looked great. I got 3 of their street tacos. One standard, one Carne Asada, and one pork. They all had amazing taste to them. Can't really decided which one I liked more. The waitress did forgot my salsa but it wasn't a big deal because honestly, the tacos didn't need it at all. 
The ambiance is nice and casual. I would love to see this place at night. Has to be so pretty! It is a bit more on the trendier hipster side of things but it fits well all together. Will definitely consider coming back again. Maybe next time at night! Oh and postinos is right next door! Score!"}
{"text":"I love The Beast burrito so much that I rarely stray from it but couldn't resist going for the lunch special which is choice of 2tacos and half size soup or salad for under $10. 

The patio is perfect for an alfreso lunch on a sunny afternoon."}
{"text":"First time there last week and it was amazing!! Ordered 3 tacos and the guac. BEST guacamole in town!! Definitely recommend and will go back. Service was great and manager Richard kept making sure we had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Very creative and nice atmosphere. Then place uses color in a trendy fashion. The food here is very delicious and it will be worth it. I had their carne asada tacos and we're just top notch. Also had some
Enchiladas. Definitely a great place for tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos were very overpriced for what they were. Waitress could not have cared less we were there. Smelled. Boo."}
{"text":"Joyride is a little bit of a mixed bag. When we arrived for happy hour the place was hopping. We were seated outside (without them asking if that was alright first, but it was alright...). When asked if it was still happy hour, the hostess replied 'is it before 5?' a little snarky.... but ok. The service overall was slow and somewhat inattentive, but they were busy so they have an excuse at least. The food and drinks, on the other hand, were very tasty. We ordered drinks, I asked what was better between the horchata with alcohol or the blood orange margarita.....well, they were out of the horchata, so marg it was. The marg was large, tasty, and at only 5$ on happy hour, I was a happy camper. The husband had the pineapple aguas frescas... this was less delicious. It just tasted like pineapple juice and alcohol... not bad, but not wonderful.  The salsa was just subtly spicy and full of flavor. The husband and I shared 3 tacos - fried fish, chicken tinga, and the pork. I would say the best was the fish, very light and crispy, followed by the pork, and then the chicken (which was fine, but was supposed to be spicy and wasn't really). Because we ordered 3 tacos, we got a side. Our server wasn't sure if they were out of rice (early in the afternoon?), but they did have it. It was fine, pretty standard rice, but the green salsa that was served on top was very tasty. The food was very filling and it was affordable, so I will most likely visit again!"}
{"text":"My first time to Joyride today and Morgan was our server. She was attentive, friendly, and made great suggestions. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I went there for Taco Tuesday. I met a friend. We ate great food, had a great margarita and made it home by 7:00!"}
{"text":"You can't go to a taco place and not try the tacos right!? 

My friend told me about this place and wanted to try it out. When you first sit down you get complementary chips and salsa. It was nothing special. It was a bit spicy for my taste. I ordered the carne asada tacos and the crispy fish taco. I wasn't too fond of the carne asada tacos. It was a bit dry and bland and I felt like it needed sauce or sour cream or something with it. The crispy fish tacos were really good though. Beer battered fish AND guacamole got me! lol. I washed everything down with the strawberry Agua Fresca. It was delicious! It has vodka, gin and rum in it. I'd like to try their \"spiked\" horchata next time I come. For dessert we ordered the churros con chocolate which was quite yummy. =)

The customer service was really good. We were always taken care of and the staff is very knowledgeable of their menu. 

The only negative for me was there was no sign on the restaurant! I drove up and down the street for like 15 minutes and I couldn't find it. I had to call my friend to find out where it was. The only sign they have is on the door. Which is definitely not noticeable at night time. I know they are a new establishment but I felt like a huge sign should've been the first thing to take care of. I never would've found it at all. 

All in all, I really liked their drinks and will probably come back during happy hour to try the rest of their drink menu. =)"}
{"text":"Service was great food and drinks would have been awesome If I didn't  have 3 incidents of finding hair in my food and drink."}
{"text":"AMAZING. I had a great experience at Joyride. As a proud member of the Arcadia community, I rarely venture out of my bubble, but I'm glad we made the trek all the way out to Gilbert. The little downtown area where Joyride is located is adorable and obviously a hotspot on the weekends. My boyfriend and I came in early on Saturday night, around 5pm, and the place was already packed. The hostesses were very accommodating and showed us over to the bar where we waited for only about 5 minutes before we were shown to our table. Our server Dan was awesome! Super friendly, knowledgeable and helpful in making our dinner decisions. We had carne asada nachos-FREAKING BOMB-the ahi stack-refreshing and very tasty-Mexican street corn-DELISH-and an assortment of tacos, all of which were fantastic-my fave was the shrimp. And here's a helpful tip, if you join their \"eposse\" they send awesome coupons, our appetizers were completely free! It's safe to say I highly recommend this place and that I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and had horrible service each time. First time, we waited 45 minutes before a server came to our table to get our drink order. We had to get up and flag someone down. Then of course after that, we had multiple servers coming up asking if we had been helped yet... I think it's because they pool tips and don't have table sections... They all are either redundant or no where to be found.

Second time I went it was one of the strangest experiences I've ever had... Ever.  We were asked THREE times by multiple servers if we had a safe way to get home,but instead of them asking it that way, they gave us long dance-around-the-issue schpeels about the community and how they want to keep it safe. We told em we were light railing home and lived down the street.... they were obviously worried about us drinking and driving. Even after that, thy still failed to being us our last round... Without actually telling us they were cutting us off. We each had three drinks and dinner and had been there for three hours. Then we had to get up and ask for the bill TWICE because no one ever came back to our table after three of them had bomboarded us with questions at separate times."}
{"text":"After and 1.5 hour wait we got seated under a shedding tree. We ordered a burrito and a couple of tacos as well as guacamole. Guacamole was a little different than typical but very tasty. Enjoyed the chunks of avocado. My husband ate half his burrito and complained there was too much rice. That being said if was very tasty rice. Little light on the chicken. I had the Baja taco and a chicken one, both very tasty.  I would come back to the Joyride Taco House. I would not bring my son though as he would need to order too many items to feel satisfied.  Fun restaurant with great food!"}
{"text":"I just left Joyride taco house and could not be more pleased with the food and exceptional service. I frequent Upward Project Restaurants and the service tonight was better than I could ever expect or have had! Justin was our server and he took great care of us! The chips and drinks were never short and the tacos we ordered were out of this world! I loved the carnitas, pork and shrimp tacos with the Asian slaw. The food was cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend Joyride to anyone interested in great tacos, awesome drinks and incredible service! To make your experience even more 5 star ask for Justin for your server!"}
{"text":"Get the Cheese Y Mas and chips. A little pricey but totally worth it! Tacos are pretty great too!"}
{"text":"Really good food! Not an ordinary mexican go-to place. The Beast Burrito was tasty! Also was a quick service. :)"}
{"text":"Joyride never disappoints! I always get The Standard tacos, but I've had pretty much everything here and it's all delicious. You could order anything on the menu and end up a happy camper.

The atmosphere is super chill and bright. It's definitely a tight squeeze, but I've never felt claustrophobic or squished. It's like a cozy little family in there! The patio/outdoor eating area is beautiful during the winter months and is a great hot spot during Happy Hour.

Pro tip - I (obviously) recommend The Standard. Plus, if you buy 3 tacos, you get a free side-dish, which I love. Their Blood Orange Mule is pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"I had the pork tamales and they were pretty good. The meat was nice and moist and flavorful. The aqua fresca's were excellent as well. My wife had the horchata with a splash of amaretto added and it was tasty. I tried both of their margaritas, the blood orange and the house and they were very good. My wife had the enchilata's and she enjoyed them.

My only complaint to this place is the drink prices of their speciality drinks. When it's not happy hour they are $10 each. If you like to have a few drinks, it would be best to visit here during happy hour which offers some great prices for drinks along with food. We will be back and plan on trying their happy hour food/drinks next.

Forgot to mention, we were able to get seated right away, service was excellent and food came out really fast. We were in and out within an hour."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's are excellent! 
Food and service both great.  
Very casual, yet trendy. Winner."}
{"text":"This taco house is located in downtown Gilbert. We stopped here for lunch while shopping in town. We were greeted immediately. The seating host asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside. I said we wanted an inside booth. We were seated outside under a tree. The waitress brought chips and salsa. While getting our drinks debris kept dropping out of the tree above us. I asked if we could go inside and we did. I ordered a burrito, \"The Beast\". This is a burrito made with carne asada, pinto beans, avocado, Pico de Gallo. and cheese wrapped up in a flour tortilla. I wasn't impressed with this Americanized burrito. It lacked flavor and was rather dry. I can't give this place more than a 2 star when Filaberto's has a better burrito for half the price."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place. The service was super slow and took quite a while to get our food and it wasn't that busy. 

I had the carne asada, Baja and crispy fish taco. The crispy fish taco was actually pretty good, but the other two just didn't taste good at all. They pretty much lacked flavor and had no substance. The tortilla was also pretty bland. I can't really recommend coming here if your a big taco fan."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place; I love the other restaurants in this conglomerate. Let's start with the good: the deco is great as well as the atmosphere. The service is excellent. Salsa and chips tasty. Draft beer selection pretty good.
The not so good: Mexican street corn- boiled not grilled. Mexican rice- too soft and bland. All tacos we had - shrimp, standard and chicken also bland. I'm not sure if it's the lack of salt, spice or if it's the flavor of the soft taco. Something wasn't right. We will probably try this place once more but if the food is not more flavorful- that will be the end."}
{"text":"The tacos are great, particularly the crispy fish and carne asada

The buritos are ok, I don't care for a lot of rice in them, and these have a lot

Service was ok.  Server was nice and knowledgeable, but food took long to arrive.  

I would go back but only for the tacos."}
{"text":"The house margarita was great. Not too sweet. The salsa was nice. Spicy enough. Guacamole was fresh but not exactly Barrio Cafe awesome.  The food was pretty good. I'm sure they'll keep tweeking it.  I had the cochinita pibil taco which was a little bland. The service and the vibe are terrific. Lots of energy and everyone having a great time."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Had 3 tacos and some hot mess-thing with eggs on top which was pretty awesome.  Service was even better!  Only not giving 5 stars since I didn't have anything that I think will absolutely compel me to go back.  That being said, I would go there again and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Found them on Yelp and saw their amazing deal for $2 dollar tacos! Got welcomed before we even walked in and just had a great vibe from all the staff! Amazing food, staff that love their job, now that's what I'm talking about. Everything was done right, very satisfied!"}
{"text":"We came here after watching a play at the Hale theater. First we started off with margaritas and I ordered the Blood Orange....omg it was tasty. They don't short you on the tequila either. I ordered the standard taco, carne adobada and the shrimp tacos. I have to say they were all amazing but my favorite was the carne adobada! I would definitely return. Very nice outdoor seating too!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays is where it's at.  $2 for most tacos here after 2pm on Tuesdays (and $5 margaritas!).  I've moved out of Arizona but come back once or twice a year to visit the family.  It's really incredible how downtown Gilbert has expanded and modernized to accommodate so many new businesses.  People actually come here to eat now :o.  It's also awesome to see that the space that Postino and Joyride is in is now finally home to a successful business.

Joyride has delicious Tex-Mex style tacos (my favs so far are the carne asada and the standard), and great service.  The staff is always friendly, and the space is nice and open.  I love how the setup lets you simultaneously eat, watch TV, and take in all that downtown Gilbert has to offer."}
{"text":"Phenomenal drinks, $5 margaritas on Tuesdays all night & until 6pm every other day. My favorite taco was the crispy fish taco, super fresh. Great atmosphere and wait staff."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST fish tacos! The service is Phenomenal and the atmosphere is super cute! The happy hour is great too, with $2 tacos and $5 margaritas you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after eyeing it for months! I loved the drinks and the tacos are pretty good. We ordered carne asada,fish and shrimp tacos and my friend got the tamales plate that came with beans on the side and some veggies. The tacos were good a little pricey but other than that good! My friend said the beans were kind of bland and the veggies didn't really go with the plate but she enjoyed her tamales. So over all this place is good the drinks are awesome and the vibe is trendy and chill. I'll be going again for round 2 going to give it another try!"}
{"text":"First time visit today...wow, that was fricken' awesome!
I figured it would be busy @1pm on a Sat....holiday weekend and all. It was but they have quite alot of seating in/out. The staff was friendly and I saw lots of hustle going on. I had the fish & standard tacos. These are street sized so 3 is a meal and for $1 you can get a side. I didn't do that because I joind the Eposse and received a free appetizer! I had the guacamole which was fresh and tasty with alittle jalapeno kick, excellent.
My tacos we also excellent with fresh ingredients and big flavor. If you find yourself in need of a taco fix I recommend Joyride."}
{"text":"Went to Joyride tonight with my wife.  Both of us needed a fix for churros with chocolate.  We were hoping for something similar to what we had in Madrid near Plaza Mayor and Calle Toledo about a year ago.  It was nowhere near that.  We still say what we had in Madrid was more to our liking.

The churros at Joyride in Gilbert were too sugary, and therefore too sweet
The churros were missing the cinnamon...only tasted the sugar
The chocolate was too sweet.

On our drive back home to Mesa, my wife and I discussed this, and said that what we had for churros at Joyride was nothing like like Madrid.  Perhaps if we want churros like what we had in Madrid, we shall have to return to Madrid."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly staff.  We had the crispy fish tacos and  sweet  corn.  Could not have been better.  We will be back for happy hour.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always love coming to this place. Fun, hip place to come for lunch or dinner and drinks. All of the tacos are amazing and the sidewalk surfer is delicious too! My favorite drinks are the pineapple mojito and blood orange margarita, but watch out it's stiff! First round of chips and salsa is free and they have awesome happy hour and taco Tuesday deals!"}
{"text":"Joyride is so darn good! I have to start it that way, because lets face it, its true!

I always get a Key Largo to drink (this is my favorite drink anytime I go to Joyride). Its so yummy and delicious that you cant just have one. 

Ive had the Crispy fish, carne asada, shrimp & chicken tinga tacos. Now I am the type of person that doesn't need a fancy taco, basically because there are a lot of things I cannot eat because of my stomach. So that being said, I ordered the above tacos with no cabbage, no mexican slaw & no white magic. Trust me, they didn't even need it. These tacos are would be good with just the meat and tortilla, must be those corn tortillas.

Joy rice with tomatillo salsa & the bomb black beans are also good. But, do yourself a favor and order the orange cucumber salad, trust me you will love it!

If you have been to Joyride and did not get dessert, YOU NEED TO GO BACK and order Mo's Definitely

Oh and I cant forget, the service is always outstanding!"}
{"text":"You can get drinks on the lawn while you wait for your table at this family friendly location.  If you ask really nicely they might serve you appetizers there too if you just want a snack and some drinks.  The wait gets to be pretty long on Fridays and Saturdays, so you want to make a reservation if possible.  We had done happy hour before coming here so we ended up not being hungry enough to get any food - I'll have to try that next time.  I love the color scheme here - bright and happy.  Casual to casual-dressy - perfect for jeans and a cute top or a sun dress.  A bit hipster too.

Our drinks were good - I don't remember the name of the one I had but it had lots of cucumber and was delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Such a great interior and patio!  Absolutely loved the spicy cucumber margarita, a wonderful welcome to Phoenix experience.  Service was great and so attentive.  Had great at is and guacamole.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I am so excited that this place joined the neighborhood. When we stepped foot in, I was immediately wowed by the décor....it is just gorgeous and visually pleasing. The staff were very friendly, even when we were standing around one of the many entrances not sure where the hostess stand was. No joke, there are like 4 ways you can enter from the outside. 

I ordered a house margarita (not a fan) and the chilaquiles. The dish was very good....definitely a fan! The chips, guac, and salsa were good. Since I did not like my margarita, I switched with my husband who had the blood orange rita. Way better. 

The food took a really long time to come but it was a nice surprise when the manager or owner came to the table to apologize without any mention from us. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and everything that came with it!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Chips and salsa are delicious. The open patio feels like vacation... Lots of fun! I tried three different tacos and can't decide which is my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm pretty critical of \"taco\" places mainly because I'm Mexican but I'm going to be straight up honest with this joint. It's definitely hyped up. 

The service: it was ok. They are nice but definitely don't check in as much, it seems like they had 3 servers for the whole place while they were busy. We waited 6 minutes or so just until we were able to ask for more sauce. 

The price: One word- overpriced lol. Maybe I'm too Mexican for this but 3.75-4.50 for a taco is a rip off. Only worth it to come during a happy hour special. 

The food: the food is pretty good not going to lie. Definitely a twist to what tacos are actually like, but the food tasted good. I ordered the shrimp, crispy fish, & pork adobado as well as a prickly pear margarita. Different but good."}
{"text":"I had the fish, carnitas, and carne asada tacos. The carne asada tacos were the best, although they didn't taste anything what I expected. They were kind of sweet. What really makes the tacos are the homemade tortillas which are fresh and perfect.
Chips were cold and not good at all."}
{"text":"We come here far to often.  With that said the service is always good and food and drinks are great!  But until they bring the coconut Margarita back i can not in good faith issue a 4 star rating.  Spoke with the waitress tonight and I'm not the only one who feels this way."}
{"text":"We came for a last minute birthday party. Staff went out of their way to accommodate a party of 12 with no reservations. The manager is fabulous and the staff is great. 

Food and atmosphere consistently great. Always my top 5."}
{"text":"Not your typical, overpriced downtown restaurant! Great tacos that are not even similar to others! I hate soft tacos and wasn't going to eat there for that reason, but they were fabulous! Love the chips and salsa! Sat outside and watched the nightlife. Very enjoyable place on the weekend at night!"}
{"text":"I am coming back here. Went with a friend who is a huge fan of Mexican foods of all kinds. We were both impressed with the food and service. The guac was great, the almond horchata was a pleasantly refreshing surprise, and the Garden Variety burrito was the best veggie burrito I have ever had. My friend was happy with her street tacos as well. The service at the Gilbert location was wonderful as well. We were immediately brought chips, salsa, and water, and our server was pleasant and very accommodating. Her recommendations were spot on."}
{"text":"This location is just as tasty and enjoyable as the Gilbert location. Love their drinks and food! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. The atmosphere is perfect. It is nice, but not stuffy, and very relaxed comfortable place. I was most impressed with how kid friendly they were. Our kids food came on kid friendly plates - nice hard plastic red ones. I have never seen this before at restaurant. The kids food was also very good. Sometimes when you order kid menu items, you can tell they are frozen, or no effort is put into it. Not here. They made their kid food with the same quality as the adult food. This is the part that impressed me most. Our adult food was also amazing. We will be returning customers."}
{"text":"Truly, as god as it gets. Their margaritas as beautiful and delicious. They aren't shy with the good stuff either. I've been here twice and both times have been a good experience. Their tacos are good and their salads are fresh and creative. Look, the tacos aren't the best that I've ever had in my entire life. They certainly aren't earth-shattering, but what is is their service.

The value they place upon their customer service is really beyond anything else and what keeps me wanting to come back. Their servers and management are friendly and take the time to talk to you in a very genuine way, not in the creepy Dutch Brothers I have to fulfill my relatability and person next door persona quota, but in a natural way.

I came here for my birthday with my husband and they made it special. They even included a delicious dessert of my choice and while this may or may not be what they do on the regular, the way they did it made all the difference. I will definitely be back and recommend to all my friends (all 2 of them)."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to go for Happy Hour. Also, a great date place. I guess this would be considered a Hipster place but I just love the atmosphere, the food, the beer and the excellent staff. Absolutely never disappointed with service or food quality. Plenty of outdoor/indoor seating. $5 beer pitchers. Braised beef and crispy fish tacos are my faves and highly recommended.  Love, love, love it!"}
{"text":"Foods are good, specially the tacos. Nice employees and great place to hangout. Indoor area is nice and outdoor backyard is very romantic."}
{"text":"I love this place! The best tacos in town. We have been coming here every week for the last year, and the service is always great and the food and drinks are even better! Tori has been the best server we have had, and we love coming in to see her. Trust me we will come back for a while."}
{"text":"Went to Joyride Taco House for the first time last night for Taco Tuesday! Took a seat at the bar which is always my first seating preference.  The bar tender offered up a recommendation which I went with.  Had 3 tacos; carne asada, pork adabado and Baja crispy fish, plus a heaping bowl of guacamole garnished with slices of fresh Serrano chilies.  My friend had four tacos which included an extra carne asada!

Excellent bar and although the bar tenders were busy they took the time to chat with us which made us feel very welcome but most importantly the G&Ts were well made.  We Got there around 5 pm, there was already a nice crowd with positive energy.  I really liked the food here, great flavor and good variety.  Give it a try and let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place!  If only it were slightly closer to my work, I would be eating here a lot more often.  I've been here twice with co-workers for lunch during the workday.  It can get crowded, so if you have a larger group, I suggest showing up before noon.  They have a great lunch special that offers a small salad and two tacos of your choice for $10 (or is it $9?).  I've gotten that each time I've visited and have not been disappointed!

What's good/dangerous about this place is that they also serve delicious chips and salsa while you wait for your food.  Fortunately, I have a decent amount of self control, so I don't go crazy on the chips and salsa -- but the salsa really is great!

The decor is eclectic, colorful, funky, definitely a very joyful feel when you walk in!  They have a small parking lot, but if you come at peak lunch time it might be full."}
{"text":"We were seated in a great little spot outdoors right on Gilbert Rd. The night was perfect for conversation, tacos and guacamole.  The atmosphere is very chic with dim lighting that casts the perfect ambiance.

We started out with salsa, some guac and then moved on to what all the hype is about; tacos. Ordering from the waiter recommendations we sampled The Standard, Braised Beef and Crispy Fish.  Chicken Tacos are generally not my favorite but The Standard was definitely my favorite followed by the Crispy Fish. 

One annoyance was the salsa....  Tiny little saucer of salsa and big bowl of chips. When sharing this with a party of 4 the salsa was gone immediately and refills cost $2.  Little issue I know but it made me :( as I loved the salsa.  :)

Enjoy the Joy Ride!"}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this place from friends and have seen a line out the door several times, but I wasn't impressed like I expected to be. The food was okay, but I don't see myself wanting to go back there again. It was super hot in there because of all of the glass, and our server only gave me refills when I asked. I also don't like how you have pay for any salsa refills when every other Mexican restaurant provides free unlimited chips and salsa. The salsa ran out really quickly especially if you have 4 people with you. I will say that the place was packed though, so maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Amazing atmosphere!   I Love the prickly pair margaritas! Definitely a go to restaurant when wanting to get something eat. Try the ceviche the next time you go!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was awesome! Had a couple tacos, baja and carnitas, excellent taste. The shrimp ceviche was citrus rich. Did a pitcher of their market beer. Dined on the patio, quick service."}
{"text":"Joyride offers great open-air seating and some pretty good people-watching.  I popped in around noon on a Monday and the place was already pretty full. That might be because their happy hour starts at 11 AM.  I did not decline the $5 house margarita when my server offered it to me! It was served on the rocks and had just the right balance of sweet triple sec and tart fresh lime juice.  You can upgrade to Don Julio for $2 more, which I did on my second margarita just to see if I could tell the difference.  I could! Try conducting your own taste test if you're there for happy hour.  My drinks came with a basket of chips and fresh, chunky salsa that was on the mild side.

The tacos were packed with fillings, and very good, but didn't necessarily stand out from the all the other street tacos out there.  I chose the Standard, which featured chicken and avocado, and the carnitas, topped with avocado and tomatillo sauce.  You can get a free side dish if you order three tacos, but I found that two tacos was plenty to eat.   

Service was friendly and helpful.  Overall, I'd come back to Joyride to try some of their other tacos."}
{"text":"I really liked it here.  Nice atmosphere, friendly waiters, cute decor, The Clash playing on the loud speakers (a wee bit too loud for my liking), and best of all - prompt chips and salsa delivery (for those of us who are famished and just don't like to wait).  Indoor and outdoor seating - with the choice of 2 patios.

Chips were good - not burnt or too thick, house salsa was nice with a little smokey flavor and not too spicy for those who are spice-challenged.  I ordered a cucumber mint agua fresca which was really light and refreshing.  Also got the nachos with a little added corn.  The server was right when he told me, \"it's like a meal.\"  Totally filled me up and I definitely had a lot left over.  

Will definitely be back to try different agua fresca flavors and their veggie tacos!"}
{"text":"I love Joyride! The tacos are amazing, the queso is awesome, the tea is magnificient! I even like the cucumber orange salad and I don't usually eat any types of salads! The service has always been great when I've been there. Even when the person I was with sent something back. They took care of it and the manager came over to check that everything was better when the alternate taco came out.

The lunch special is pretty great too!"}
{"text":"The people that brought  you Postino's, Federal Pizza,Chelsea's Kitchen  have done it again!  

We went on a Sunday at noon.  We had excellent service with numerous servers checking on us throughout the meal. I'm a New Yorker, husband is a Londoner and we really get crazed when the service isn't good and this was not the case!  Service was top notch!

The tacos were terrific. I  had Grilled Shrimp, Baja Fish and Ahi Tuna and loved them and I'm not even a Mexican food lover.    Hubby had Carne Asada, Shredded Beef and I think Chicken Tinja and he thought everything was delicious. 

The music was great - Cat Stevens to Prince to Sting and not too loud like Federal Pizza.  The interior is a well designed cool urban space."}
{"text":"So far my favorite taco joint in the Phoenix area. We are new to Chandler, so when asked about a recommendation I quickly turned to Yelp for suggestions. With over 1000 reviews, I had to check this place out. I arrived early to put in our name for a party of 8. It was Taco Tuesday, so I new that it'd be packed. There was a 90 minute wait, so I grabbed a beer and sat out front for the rest of the party to arrive. I love that you can sit outside and get adult standby drinks from a server that takes drink orders while you wait. Beats standing at the bar and waiting forever. 
The food was great! I powered down 5 tacos ($2/ea.), chips and salsa, and some churros. Everyone else raved about the food and service, so I was the praised as the food hero that night. Thank you Yelp.

Only suggestion to the restaurant owner: Different patio chairs. I kept sliding on the seat and ended up slouching for most of the night."}
{"text":"\"As gas prices continue to drop, 28 states are now selling regular gasoline for less than $2 a gallon. It's getting cheaper to pump two gallons of gas outside the station than it is to pump two squirts of nacho cheese inside.\" ? Jimmy Fallon

Pfft, you know that quote is old.  Gas is expensive AF.

Joyride Taco House is my waifu's, Kazi H., favorite place for Taco Tuesday.  Although we have never gone together or even the same location, this place is great.  Happy hour is from 3PM-5PM and that makes my wallet and me pleased.  You can get tacos for $2 a pop, nachos for $6, and $5 margaritas.  They also serve beer too.

Food is great, location is amazing, and the staff is friendly.  Sit at the bar for the best service imaginable and check out all their nerdy artwork.  Joyride is a great place for a quick bite [especially during HH]!

I'm not into competitive eating, unless someone orders nachos \"for the table.\""}

It's always a great meal when you come to Joyride.  Whether it's this location or the one in downtown Gilbert, service is always excellent.  I actually think service at this location might even be friendlier.  The bartenders didn't even give us crap for sitting at the bar and not intending to drink [it was a bit early, folks.  I'm a *sensible* alcoholic.  ;D]

After working an early-morning gig over at The Wrigley Mansion, we headed over here for some tacos and some street corn.  Everything was delicious.  My almond horchata was so thick and did nothing to quench my thirst but that's why you get water on the side or steal your buddy's cucumber mint agua fresca.

Taco Tuesday?  Psh, that's err'day.  Come to Joyride!"}
{"text":"We came for a friend's birthday lunch, her second time and my first. It was pretty crowded although it sounds like that's pretty typical for Joyride.

We had a 45 minute wait that went by quickly thanks to the fresh squeezed margaritas and craft beer. My favorite drink was the cucumber margatprita with serranos and green tea syrup. 

But the star of the menu was the guacamole...and I am a picky guacamole consumer. It was freshly made with chunks of avocado, sprigs of cilantro, and a few diced jalapeños. We ordered two batches. I also enjoyed the neet, pomegranate, green leaf salad and my friends were gushing over their shrimp tacos.

All of these plus the fast, pleasant,and attentive service and attractive decor make Joyride a hit. We can't wait to come back on our next trip to the Valley; what an excellent addition to downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I went with a friend of mine that has food allergies and ordered the vegetarian platter and did not see it came with beans (part of his allergies) when we told the server we messed up he worried more about us  having a great experience then the cost of the food, comped the mistake and the remake. Places don't just do that anymore. Then we went up to the bar and the bar tenders are just as personable, when we asked for a shot that they didn't have the stuff for they improvised, and introduced us to a new shots we have never had and ended up being amazing. Thanks Chase! Great place to visit or repeat."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've reviewed a good place to eat, so here comes the paragraphs..

Third is a great spot in beautiful downtown Gilbert that is a go-to for some decent Mexican food and happy hour. I've been here several times in the past, it's a decently sized restaurant bar with outdoor seating.

Happy hour is something like 2-5/6 on weekdays and gets you 5$ margaritas that are pretty tasty and strong, or a pitcher of beer for 5$, as well as 2$ tacos. 

The tacos are okay, being the chef that I am I feel like they lack flavor, although the chips and salsa are on point... but try not to munch on them too fast because the severs inconsistently charge you 2$ for a refill.

I enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant, although it was kind of confusing being served by two people who kept asking the same questions, and provided two bills. 



I have to be a critic and add that I've had better food like Nandos that is great overall,or similarly priced, but being that this place is located in such a cool area I would be inclined to return again soon."}
{"text":"Came in for a little date night cocktails. Sat at the bar for fantastic service and enjoyed our drinks but the best part was the food. 
Deliciousness ahi ceviche, guacamole and perfect chips. Finished the night off with El Domingo... A heavenly concoction OD vanilla ice cream, caramel, caramelized pineapple and malted corn flakes. Oh My!!!"}
{"text":"I havent been here in a while but I'm glad I came back. This little corner has a handful of great restaurant/bars to choose from and some even share parking lots. It was a Saturday and I got semi rockstar parking and they werent needing to do valet since its not peak season(according to one of the hosts). As you walk in you wil see the U-shaped bar with plenty of seats and then tables both indoors and on a decent sized patio. We were a group of ten and Austin was our main server. He was always paying attention as each person showed up and made sure no ones drink glasses were empty. Same with checking on orders making sure it came out and the way you wanted. We had a veggie burrito that was supposed to be no mushrooms he realized kitchen didnt do it right. Got a replacement on the fly boxed up the old one and even took it off the bill!. 

A handful of people had the corn to start I just my serrano margarita which I would get again and again and again. Some reason last night I mixed it up and switched to beer once I got my tacos. The whole table loved the carne asada whether it was in a taco or burrito. I was expecting flavor from the adobada and the braised beef. Ive had other tacos there that I liked more but carne asada everytime for sure. Since I've had the ceviche before Il comment on that. It was good size nice flavor great mix no one else at the table seemed real excited about having it so I didnt order it last night but I'll get it again. 

Good prices Great service (split checks for ten people never fun) nice clean fun vibe."}
{"text":"Tried this place out after finding it while in the downtown Gilbert area, went for HH and the prices were good and he food and service was great. We tried multiple tacos and the veggie burrito and everything was really good. Even the chips and salsa surpassed expectations, although a side note on that, only the first basket/bowl is free. Plenty of options we will definitely be going back and soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent for Taco Tuesday! Tacos were $2 each and very delicious. As an avid taco eater, I highly recommend this place. The Mexican corn was also extremely good...if I had room, I would eat 5. Margaritas were $5 each and went well with the food. I will definitely be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. I come here often, actually all of 4 of the upward projects stores. Happy hour is the best at any of the stores. I particularly have been enjoying the fact that the soup is ever changing. The shotgun lunch special is great. 2 tacos and a side for $10. Must do it with soup or salad. They are sooo good. I hope they bring that potato soup back. The braised beef taco has so much going on for flavor. The carnitas are really good as well. If you're coming with more then one person and wanna share something, go with the nachos(a personal favorite). The staff is usually super friendly and upbeat. I understand when its super busy, you can get overwhelmed and frustrated, but they still tru their best to be upbeat. I really love the open window to the kitchen. Its funny watching the cooks have fun with each other. Overall a great place. If you don't like huge crowds and wait times try stopping in for lunch."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots here in Central Phoenix. 

The Space:
So happy that Upward Projects has added the necessary parking lot among their complex of restaurants along central avenue. Granted there's the Valet available for Joyride but I'm sure none of the valets are enjoying parking an old 96' Geo Prizm :P There is street parking available as well for those of you not wanting to valet if the parking lot is full across the street. The overall space is fun, energetic, and retro. Beautiful geometric tile work along the walls, fun lighting fixtures above the bar and on the walls, a beautiful patio with fireplace, and a glass wall open during the winter months to create a true indoor/outdoor dining experience. Much of the inside of the restaurant is taken up by a large wrap around bar with several booths and tables set up around the perimeter. 

Service:
During most of my experiences I have had excellent service! Staff usually contributes to the laid-back, fun atmosphere by getting comfortable with guests at the table and engaging in conversation - not just taking our order. Every once and a while (primarily when the restaurant is slammed) service tends to lack a little - for understandable reasons. 

Food and Drinks: 
Most speciality cocktails are regularly priced at $9. The cocktails are generous pours and mostly tequila based. Fun cocktails including a cucumber-serano drink. Food has always been excellent! From the variety of delicious tacos to choose from to the large burritos the food has always been on point. My personal favorite is the Nachos with Chicken Tinga - certainly more food than one person needs but I can never stop myself!! 

Head on over to Joyride for a fun, casual dinning experience with everything to offer: atmosphere, service, food, and drinks!"}
{"text":"Really tasty new taco joint in town! Servers are really friendly and they have great beer on tap. Love the atmosphere here. Their chips and salsa are A+ and they just kept slingin em our way. For every 3 tacos you get, you can get a side for free (hells ya) so if you're with a group, I say order a shit ton of tacos and try all the sides you can. 

I had the Cochinita Pibil and Shrimp tacos, I've had better Pibil but the shrimp was incredible. I've heard great things about the ahi taco and veggie ones too. I also got to try the beans, slaw, and orange/cucumber salad. All very good. 

Also, valet parking which is nice."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant. my favorite atmosphere. love the food. burritos chimi style are the best. ahiAmarillo sauce is amazing. chips and salsa are so good. blood orange margaritas.... YUM!"}
{"text":"The decor and surroundings are fun and inviting but, the food and service was average. We had the enchiladas and tacos that were just so, so.  They never brought more chips and salsa and they never refilled our drinks. Now, we never asked but having two daughters that work in the restaurant industry, I know what's expected. Would I go back? Probably not, unless I was with friends that wanted to go. I would much rather have SoCal Tacos right down the street for half the price and ten times better."}
{"text":"Knowing that Joyride is owned by the same folks as Postino and Windsor, the flavors are exactly what you would expect - fresh, colorful and everything we tried had several layers of flavors. 

We went for lunch and our server was great and quick. Beverages were always full and we tried several of his recommendations. I had a couple tacos and the cucumber orange salad, my friend had a burrito. All of the was great.

The salsa that comes right away is very flavorful and was well enjoyed. Only downside for us (just based on our preferences and sounds super picky) is that the chips are just too thick.

All in all, great spot for lunch and looking forward to trying more again soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. we got lucky and found a parking spot along the street but they have purchased the lot just south of the building with extra parking spots. our wait to sit was only a few minutes although I would anticipate a longer wait during the busy hours. Staff was very friendly and on top of getting us drinks while we waited for our table. Loved the atmosphere here, and I don't know what it is about the Upward Projects but they always play great music. You get complimentary chips and salsa to snack on while your picking out your food. The salsa was very good. We ordered 3 tacos which were all fantastic and they came with a side, we chose the grilled vegetables. Oh my, simply delicious. I will be bring friends here next time."}
{"text":"A shockingly small step up from taco bell. Don't let the hipster vibe fool you, nor the fact that it is nestled between two competent restaurants. The flavor and quality had \"chain\" written all over. Before Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were in LaLa Land, they'd want you to forget they debuted together in Gangster Squad. Joyride=Gangster Squad!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to downtown Gilbert. The restaurant is small, but there's a nice outdoor seating area if you're willing to wait. Service varies from good to kind of slow, but I think the food speaks for itself as it's tasty and well made. I definitely recommend a (spiked!) agua fresca.The lolo grain salad is an excellent choice if you're trying to go meatless. I think there's better tacos in the valley, but they're solid and will fill you up for a decent price. Don't skip dessert! Get an order of churros and let your taste buds walk through fried cinnamon heaven."}
{"text":"I am becoming a big fan of Upward Projects. I love Windsor, Federal Pizza, Churn, and Postino. Now I can add Joyride to the list.

Parking is much easier with the addition of the lot next to Windsor. You can also park along the street right next to Joyride if it isn't peak meal time. There's several doors around the perimeter of the building; someone will gladly point you to the host/hostess.

You can sit at a table, at the bar, or at a community table. Restaurant is large, has nice geometric patterns on the walls, and there's interesting light fixtures by the bar.

Chips and salsa: thin crispy warm chips yum, and delish spicy salsa

Cheese y mas: lots of nice fresh toppings on a bed of warm queso; simple flavor and really good

Veggie and goat cheese enchiladas: a little limited on the veggies in the enchiladas, and a lot of goat cheese so if you aren't a fan, get chicken. Also, no sides. That being said, the verde sauce is tangy and delish, and everything is well seasoned for a delightful harmony of flavors in your mouth.

The beast: made it enchiladas style with verde sauce. Delicious, tender beef and a nice mix of beans and avocado inside.

Good drink specials, as with all the Upward Projects restaurants. I can't wait to try the agua frescas and margaritas."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here after finding it on Yelp - so glad we did. The atmosphere is casual, but not overly so. Our server, Taylor, was one of the most knowledgable and bubbly servers I've ever had. She knew about all the food and had great recommendations (based on our tastes) and even made me feel just fine for ordering an item plain (standard taco with just chicken and cheese). The blood orange margarita is phenomenal and not terribly priced. I HIGHLY recommend the \"Better than Betty's\" dessert - it's brownie, ice cream, caramel, and walnuts but oh man. So delicious. If you're in the area - make it a point to check this place out...ASK FOR TAYLOR (this is extremely important)...and get some dessert. You'll thank me for it later. Ugh...so full."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and ambience. Surprisingly downtown Gilbert is popping. This spot in particular seems always packed. Drinks are great. The blood orange and prickly pear margaritas were great. Then for dinner we had some corn appetizer dish which was the highlight of the meal. I'd go back just for that. Dinner was a chilaquille dish and a veg enchilada with green and red sauce. It was good but not the best. I'd give this a 4.5 but I'll round it up. Bc the overall experience"}
{"text":"I am biased.  I love this place.  I love the atmosphere and the service.  The wait staff is great.  My glass in never empty and the chips keep coming.  
It is priced a little high...but well worth it to me.  The quality of the food is great and the Carne Asada is a favorite.
The El Capitan Torta is amazing.  I can eat about 6 of them without blinking.
That's why I'm fat."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The food and drinks are delicious and the staff is friendly:) definitely will return! They have courtesy valet fri night be sure to bring cash to tip the guys!!"}
{"text":"Do you want tasty yet overpriced food and drink?  Do you want a waitstaff team to ask you questions every few minutes? Do you want a free basket of chips, but just one basket because the next is $2?  Then this is your place.  If you want tasty food, more authentic tasty food, and if you want to spend about 1/3 of what you'll spend at Joyride...then keep driving."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I ordered three street tacos, two chicken and one carne asada. The chips and salsa were so good i didn't want to eat my tacos when they arrived. The atmosphere was young and hip. The music was was a little loud but i kinda liked it. The best part of this place was the service. We had our cups constantly refilled and people asking us if we needed anything. They kept on bringing chips and salsa to our table the entire time. The only reason why I'm not giving this place a 5 star is because the price was a little high. It was just me and my husband during lunch. We ordered water and we both had the street tacos. Our bill was in the thirties YIKES!!"}
{"text":"Props to the Sioux chef @Louis, came out and greeted us, made sure our tacos were on point and thanked us. Great food and a great experience."}
{"text":"I like flavor and the carne asada had ZERO flavor. The restaurant is very nice and the spiked agua fresca was awesome. BUT the food has no flavor. Good for drinks not for food. Chips and salsa are ok."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. I had high hopes for this place because from what I understand, the same people who own the Federal and Windsor also own Joyride. It was just the exact opposite of those places. The food was bland and overpriced. There are other places who are making these same tacos, but doing it much better. I would compare it to eating tacos at the airport. They were ok, a little more pricey then they should be, and forgettable. 2 stars because they still do the $5 pitcher before 5 deal everyday. But if that's all you're in it for, go next door to the Federal or Windsor and the experience will be much better."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and some tacos on a weekday. I really do not understand the hype around this place at all. I tried three different tacos (chicken tinga, beef and carne asada). First, i do not think the food was cooked well enough. Second, nothing wowed me to even make me want to order more. The food is definitely subpar and lacks flavor. The drinks were good however and thats the only reason I'm giving 2 stars. The service was good as the waitress was friendly. I guess i just dont understand the hype here. People of AZ must not know good, flavorful mexican food."}
{"text":"I really love the decor & the feel of this restaurant! The servers are all pretty nice too! I wish I knew the name of the server who took care of our big group of 23 people- she was awesome! 

I had the Lola Grain salad (It may seem crazy that I had salad at a taco place). It was DELICIOUS! One of the best salads I've ever had really! It tastes healthy & full of flavor! (I had it without the bell pepper!) 

I've tried a couple of the tacos- they are a little too \"different\" for my taste, but they aren't bad- just not for me. 

I had the mango-mandarin margarita & it was very tasty! Many people love the prickly pear margarita, they are bright pink & really attractive for a cocktail! 

I highly recommend the salad, chips & salsa & drinks here!"}
{"text":"Came for my birthday. Gotta say I just expected a delicious taco with all the hype.... This is a super trendy taco joint, great vibe, great customer service. However the food was a let down. The tacos are piled with stuff that takes away from the little akward flavor the meats had. The best thing I absolutely loved is the corn tortillas it came on. They seemed fresh and homemade. For the price you are paying I was expecting authentic bomb street tacos, instead I paid for what looked like art in a tortilla, it looked nice but wasnt up to par with the taco cart in Juarez. It was a big disappointment when you can get a better taco from a taco cart, then you can from this potentially awesome restaurant. So if your into food photography this is the best place to snap some pics, if you are craving a authentic bomb taco, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent Margarita, chips were warm and fresh. Baja grilled fish taco was really good, and our servers were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. Came here expecting nothing great. The inside was very hipster and they had good music. The service was really good but it could be because they weren't too busy yet and they were only open for an hour and it was still early. Our server immediately brought out chips and salsa for us to snack on and the salsa was delicious! Well seasoned and really refreshing. I ordered the short rib, crispy fish, and carnitas tacos and wow were they delicious! The crispy fish and short rib tacos were really good but the carnitas wasn't all that great. There was a lot of meat in the short rib taco and the crispy fish was a nice size and had a great crunch. My boyfriend had a carne asada burrito called \"the beast\" and wow was that amazing too! The meat was tender and well flavored and the meat had a charred grill flavor to them which made the burrito super delicious! We had their mexican 75 cocktail and almond horchata with armaretto and those were delicious too! the drinks are on happy hour all day till 5pm and they were only $5. Overall experience was great and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"service = great. super attentive but not bothersome. all the staff were friendly. originally we were told it would be a 45 minutes wait (understandable for a friday night), but were called after maybe 20. it wouldn't have mattered if we had to wait the full length of time because the patio is cool and comfy and we were immediately served chips, salsa and waters.

drinks = fantastic! loved my blood orange marg, but i was lusting after my boyfriend's pineapple mojito. so. good.

food = excellent. we tried the veggie, crispy fish, shrimp, braised beef and carnitas tacos and all were great. we also got rice and beans for our sides and split an order of the mexican street corn as well. highlights were the crispy fish, braised beef and the street corn!

vibe = super hip and trendy. i liked the decor and the bathrooms had cool sink knobs (i'm weird and always judge restaurant bathrooms)."}
{"text":"I love the tacos here and when they're $2 they can't be beat but they recently changed their happy hour menu for the worse. The non-margarita drink deals used to go until 6pm, now it's only 5pm, which is early by any happy hour standards. They also removed the appetizer deals from it leaving them all overpriced now. 

I'll still be by for delicious tacos with fresh ingredients, good $5 margs, and surprisingly flavorful free salsa and chips but I'll be hunting for a place with a happy hour with more options as well."}
{"text":"Not impressed. 

I realize its a holiday but maybe management could have planned better.. The wait wasn't ridiculous it just seemed like chaos everywhere, free for all if you will..

The location and concept are on point though a little over ambitious, it seemed like everything on the menu had one or two too many ingredients making it just a little over complicated.

The reason for two stars is the poor execution of a great idea.. EVERYTHING (nearly, pinto beans were piping) was Cold, eck!! Side of chicken, roasted veggies and tacos all intended to be eaten warm were luke warm at best.  It lends concern to the \"danger zone\" theory. And why so hot on the beans but so temped on everything else? Microwave maybe? Either way, ew!! Plus side my salad was cold but oddly closer to that room temperature feel (given over 100° outside cold to warm food is acceptable, warm to cold is just inconceivable this time of year)..

Lastly I feel like they were a little over priced for the size of tacos we received. Like tiny small, I'm all for quality ingredients but lack there of is kind of a slight at $3-$4 a PIECE.. 

I would be willing to give it one more try, but I won't be going out of my way if I have a choice.."}
{"text":"I saw there were 999 reviews so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to write the thousandth! 

The beast burrito is amazing and so are the veggie tacos!

BB's Rating: Tequilalicious"}
{"text":"Oh My Land.... the tacos here are phenomenal. Loved the shrimp taco, the fish taco, and the carne asada taco. The guacamole is amazing as well. Service is very attentive and they were REALLY busy when we visited. The beer selection is small but good, and the place has a wonderfully friendly vibe. We loved it!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I get why this place is so popular. It is decorated uber-cool and has great music. Unfortunately the popularity means that we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. That would have been ok if it weren't for the fact that A - the hostess told us it would only be 15 minutes and B - she took our drink orders and my friend's credit card and then never came back and C - we saw multiple other parties that arrived after us were seated before we were. We sat outside in the lawn chairs, drinkless, until my friend went and tracked her down to find out what was going on. And even after we were moved to a table inside and greeted by Josh, our server, she still had a hard time getting the credit card back. After that we had to wait another 15-20 minutes just to be able to order.

Overall, the service was pretty terrible. Apparently the owners think that 3 teenagers are enough waitstaff for the entire restaurant and bar and that plus the fact that they pool tips means that none of them really care about whether the guests have a good experience. The drinks were also hit or miss. I really enjoyed my cucumber agua fresca even though it was a little too sweet for me. But another friend got the blood orange margarita and it was awful. I am not sure if it was made wrong or what but since Josh's visits to our table were few and far between she didn't have an opportunity to send it back.

So, why 3 whole stars you ask? Well, the tacos were pretty tasty. We all got the three taco plate because with three you get the free side. The orange cucumber salad was definitely worth it. I ordered the braised beef, grilled fish, and cochinita pibil. The pork on was a little underwhelming but the other two were outstanding. The fish was cooked perfectly and I loved the flavor of the beef. Other favorites from my girlfriends were the shrimp and veggie tacos. The tacos were all pretty small so you should definitely order 2 or 3 of them. So, overall the meal ended up being about $12. Not bad. But the drinks were really overpriced so that balanced out. Overall, I was happy with the quality of the food and it would be a pretty cool place to hang out if they could improve their staff."}
{"text":"The standard taco was my favorite. They have great specials for taco tuesday and everything was very quick. We saw the restaurant really picked up after 5pm so get the
re early or there will be a wait for a table. 

I am surprised at how responsive the restaurant is and am very pleased to see that management reached out regarding my concern from my last visit. We are very happy and would gladly come back to this level of service."}
{"text":"I love their tacos and just about everything else. This is a chill place to hang out on date night or with friends. Their drinks are delicious too! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Whos got two thumbs and really likes this place.. This guy!

I didnt give it a 5 star because it really takes alot to.... wait. I dont have to justify my Yelps to you or anybody! ;0)

Went with the kiddies. Yummy Guacamole.... (could be a slightly bigger dish.)  Its great place. We had fast service. Pricing is reasonable. Atmosphere was cool. Im a big fan of places that dont have uniforms on the staff. This is one such place."}
{"text":"This place probably has the best tacos in Phoenix! Amazing staff, environment and music! 
Every taco I've tried was sooooo good! Great place for a date night or girls night! If you go definitely try the \"standard\" taco! Its anything but standard(:"}
{"text":"I go here so much it's borderline embarrassing. Somehow always manage to miss Taco Tues ($5 margs and cheaper tacos). Even the chips and salsa are bomb. Cucumber Serrano marg is a must!"}
{"text":"This was a great spot for Taco Tuesday! The tacos are only $2 and I was pretty full off of two. I tend to always lean towards the seafood ones, they were BOMB. I don't remember the taco selection off the top of my head, but there was plenty of seafood, pork, beef and chicken options for everyone to enjoy.

My husband and his buddy got Margaritas that were only $5 during happy hour. The Lime margarita and the Blood Orange ones were delicious and they went for round 2. So free chips and salsa + $5 Margaritas + $2 Tacos? Pshhh, why not. 

All in all, I would go here again."}
{"text":"This is a fun place on Central where the old Humpty Dumpty used to be.  Kind of a fun interior of retro colors and shapes in a cool new vibe.  You don't have just one waiter but the whole crews waits ob you and therefore the service is attentive. The menu is fun - street tacos, salads of local ingredients and some tasty agua frescas.  Terrific cocktails and the the place was full of urban hipsters so it2one of the in places in town.  I don't understand the name though."}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's Day with a gal pal! The food and drinks were just ok.  However the service and ambiance were great. The staff was all very accommodating and prompt despite being so busy. We had a good time!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Our visit was on point. They have a nice menu selection and everything we ordered appeared to be prepared fresh. The restaurant also gets five stars for design and ambience. In the area? Just go! Place attached next door they own as well and it's all good!"}
{"text":"As with the other Upwards Project restaurants this is a win.  It may not be authentic Mexican food but it is good.  
The decor is a lot of fun.  The seating is very comfortable.  That was the first thing that was mentioned.  The booths were big and comfortable with plenty of room.  The music is fun and upbeat.  
Now to the food.  The chips and salsa are great and they just keep coming.  We got the nachos which we could have finished with and had a great night.  My mother in law got the vegetarian burrito and said she would love to come back and get some more.  My husband and I got the 3 tacos and they were each very good, not authentic but still good.  My daughter had had the chicken tacos in the past so decided to have the burrito and ate every bite.  If she only kind of likes something she will eat some of it but when she eats the whole thing it means she really likes it.  The orange cucumber sale was a big hit.  The black beans were ok the rice was not so good.  For dessert we had the churros and the banana pudding.  My husband knowing full well that I am allergic explained how delicious the pudding is.  The churros come with a chocolate sauce that has a hint of spice to it.  I have already been there twice and plan on returning."}
{"text":"Good food, poor service.  No fault of the staff though, they seem to always be under staffed these days.  Due to this your long wait for a table is usually complimented with a even longer wait for food and drink.  So be prepared for the long haul when coming here and try to not take it out on the severs, they looked stressed enough."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Love everything on Central!!!!
Loved every drink I have tried so far...there spin on the Moscow mule is delish.  I have only tried the tacos so far...crispy fish, shrimp and ahi. Very good!!  This place will be a regular stop for us I'm sure of it!"}
{"text":"Fun, hip, yummy & local! Crispy fish tacos + mango margarita with chili salt = awesome happy hour!"}
{"text":"We ate lunch at your restaurant today. The food was good but the service was terrible. We left the office to have lunch and sat at the table almost 45 minutes waiting for our food.  Refills on a drink and/or water took incredibly long after the server said he would refill our drinks. Very expensive too."}
{"text":"Seen this place on yelp and wanted to try something new in a new area since we barely came across downtown Gilbert today. (we are not from AZ) Cute little town area. We were greeted as we walked in, we sat outside in the open patio. The area they had for patio was cute with the hanging candles and lights.  Our waiter Clark, he was really nice and gave us great recommendations that we ended up trying. We ordered the Fila Ensalda (something like that) which is a really flavorful salad. I ordered the almond horchata with no booze, it was tasty. I also ordered the three tacos and get one side. The braised beef, shrimp , and Baja fish taco with the Mexican slaw as the side. 
It's not authentic Mexican food but it is all very good food. I love the edgy atmosphere. 

Rating: 
Quality: 5/5
Presentation: 5/5
Service: 5/5 (came to check on us multiple times) 
Cleanliness: 5/5 

I do wish they would have more dessert choices though."}
{"text":"Our new favorite taco spot! Cool vibes, great food and service. Looks like they have some amazing drink options too. The patio was nice and even kid friendly :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an excellent lunch today. Service was attentive without being bothersome, food was outstanding. Lunch special of two tacos and a side salad was delicious. Awesome to see great LOCAL places doing it right."}
{"text":"When my friend invited me to the Hale theater I asked her if she wanted to indulge in some light bites before the show and she agreed. Not sure what was over there since I live clear over on the other side of town I told her to pick. Amongst the list of fantastic new eateries right at the theater was Joyride.

 Not the biggest fan of Tex- Mex food it takes a lot to get me to want to try Mexican. I have only about three favorites and constant Mexican eateries I will go to in town and they are more of a traditional Mexican. With that said, I had heard how great this place was so I wanted to give it a try. The verdict? Thumbs up! They have a great Happy Hour, good Guac, and tasty street tacos. ( And cheap!) My Raspberry Ancho Marg drink was tasty and again, cheap! 

The place was packed though. On the way out and I got spilled on twice. Pretty tight quarters for sure if you sit inside. I guess that is part of the fun. I had a shoe that smelled like beer all evening. Oh yeah, the servers were all very nice. The food was delivered fast with a group concept. I like group concept restaurants. I'd go back. However, maybe  to the phoenix location closer to my hood."}
{"text":"I have been to this location of Joyride a couple times now.

It is super cute and I love the decor.  

Currently there is construction next door for a new breakfast place, so there is no more \"play area\" outdoors to chillax.  Still, they have tables outside.  I was seated there on my most recent visit.

I love their chips and salsa and could eat it all day long.

I've ordered a few different entrees and tacos from Joyride.  They were all pretty good.  On the most recent visit, I ordered a Garden Variety veggie burrito ($8)  sans the white magic (as it contains egg).  It was actually really good.  

However, I have to say that the food is inconsistent in that the entrees have all been pretty good, but the sides and soup are just plain boring.

I ordered the pinto beans on my last visit ($3) and ate two bites of the dish.  They seemed to lack any flavor and could have used, at the very least, some salt and pepper.  On a previous visit I ordered a bowl of the tortilla soup ($6).  It tasted like chicken noodle, at best.  It was not good and I sent it back (which I never do).  My dining companion ordered a side of \"The Bomb black beans\" and he only ate a few bites, when he normally inhales them.  I noticed a guy at a table in front of us ordered the side of rice.  I observed the guy ate one bite and left the rice untouched after that. 

My daughter ordered the kid's meal nachos, which had some sort of fondue-like melted cheese on top.  The chips looked good, but she had fewer than ten nachos on her plate.  It came with milk and a side of some cut up fruit.  The tray had a place for another side and I think it should have had beans or something in addition for the $5 they charge.  Still, it would have been fine if my daughter would have eaten all the nachos. Unfortunately, we were seated under a tree and leaves kept falling into her food.  She refused to eat the food, even after I removed the leaves.  Unfortunately, we did not see our waitress often and it was too inconvenient to be moved at that point.  I would  ask to be reseated if the tree still had leaves (on a subsequent visit).  

If Joyride had more \"zippy\" or exciting sides, they'd have a loyal customer.  It's too darn bad they can't get better beans going.  I am still thinking about how good the veggie burrito is, but I won't be back unless someone else drags me."}
{"text":"Some tacos were ok, the decor and ambiance was nice but the food is subpar and made to please everyone. Their salsa is bland and made for its clientele which want mexican food but not anything spicy."}
{"text":"First time here.  Was disappointed.  Service was great the beer was cold and I enjoyed the salsa but everything else was lacking and over priced.  The wife got a burrito enchilada style...this was nothing like an enchilada style burrito and they'll charge you 2 bucks to put sauce on...the red sauce according to the wife tasted like spaghetti sauce.  They filled the burrito with mushrooms mango red and green peppers rice and chicken...with all of that it was extremely bland.  I got two over priced tacos...the Baja taco that had grilled fish that wasnt very good and the crispy fish taco that was ok but I've had better fish tacos at Rubio's.  For what they charge I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Me & my husband were regulars literally every taco Tuesday. This place has insanely good prices with food to match. Margaritas are amazingly good. The standard & crispy fish tacos were my favorite. The street corn was insanely good & the churros at the end were perfect. The spiked horchata was SO good. Just everything. Since becoming vegan tho this place doesn't have much to offer besides good drinks so that's a bummer. For such a hip place down town I wish they catered to vegan diets.


UPDATE;
So very cool update to add! The manager messaged me after seeing my review & told me about their burrito & how to make it vegan. VERY good. So filling, so full of flavors, absolutely delicious & give me a great option for a date night with hubby. These guys rock."}
{"text":"Oooh that was worth it. I got the taco platter which had three different meats, corn tortilla, and all the fixin's. Make sure to ask for white magic with it. My daughter had garbanzo bean soup that was a little bland but nothing some hot sauce didn't fix. They were pretty busy & it took a while to get moving but then food & drink came quickly. The retro 70s vibe and look were great, and we loved the patio."}
{"text":"AH MAZING!  Such good food and great atmosphere here.

Not stuffy and no mexican music blaring. Not that there's a problem with mexican music... just wouldn't fit the location. Very cool atmosphere... hip and fun. Bar in the middle to serve your Happy Hour needs.

Food is really good. Chips and salsa are delicious and salsa serves a hidden kick."}
{"text":"The feel of this new Upward Projects concept is amazing!  Mid Century Modern with a Mexican twist... so unique.  The people working here are very friendly and the despite being a newer place, the service doesn't seem to have kinks to be worked out, which is nice.  The food is very good, with the exception of a couple \"just ok\" experiences.  The drink specials, and atmosphere keep us coming back for Sunday Fundays and weeknight dinners!"}
