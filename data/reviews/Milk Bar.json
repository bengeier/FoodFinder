{"text":"First time here and Gerrit was amazing to us! Great drinks , service and hospitality. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic space and a great addition to downtown!  It's a hip little small bites and cocktails place.  Lots of great outdoor space and even a cozy private room if your crew needs some space.  You really feel like you're in the middle of the urban city center when you're inside the bar.  The patio on 3rd St has some of the best views of downtown you can see while downtown.

RACIST?  Pretty sure the other reviewers that are claiming racism here are full of BS.  Maybe competitors trying to shut down any new bar before it takes off?  We were here with a group of 12, mixed races, and all of us were treated like gold.    

We tried the meat pierogi's, sliders, and fries - All were good.  Excited to try more of their nibbles next time we go back."}
{"text":"So finally came out to try out the milk bar in phoenix with some friends on a Friday night and all I can say is wow!!!! These guys are a small family run place personal service and the drinks and food are just phenomenal. The service was great and the price was resonable. I would recommend trying mothers milk and meat pierogi."}
{"text":"I noticed this place after grabbing a coffee across the street at the songbird location. I was intrigued by the all white building, so googled, and promptly found this unique establishment. I waited until Wednesday evening to visit, and showed up at about 6:15. I was alone, odd for me, but upon entering I immediately felt comfortable. 

There are small tables along one side where a single person feels comfortable, so I grabbed one. I took in my surroundings. Low key great electronica music, beautiful ultra modern interior, very white and cool looking as we go into a 120 degree summer. Nice friendly staff, then I was given a menu. Oh.My.Goodness. I am ethnically Slovak and I thought I died and went to heaven. I started to get very excited and decided to order A LOT. Potato pierogi, potato pancakes, kielbasa, and to top it off an amazing vodka concoction the \"Marie Curie\". The menu had plenty of other delicious sounding things to try next time. 

The food did not disappoint. It was AMAZING.Especially the pierogi. I have not had pierogi this good since the Polish priests in Trenton NJ made some for my grandmother that she shared with me back in 1992. My pierogi standards are HIGH and these rocked.

I also tried a raspberry liquor shot thingy and it was strong and delicious. 

I already frequent the LUX mornings, and I envision this place as the perfect after work place to chill and get a few drinks, while soaking up the beautiful interior and delicious food. We in Central Phoenix are getting very very spoiled with all these wonderful establishments found right in our own backyard. Everyone should try this place - put it in your rotation this summer."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! We got the desert pierogi's and loved every bite. Huge selection of creative drinks if you are looking for something different for the night."}
{"text":"Fabulous, sleek and mod. This place is a feast for the eyes. The \"milk bars\" of eastern Europe are akin to local delis in the U.S., and the theme here is a very modern update on this concept. Their menu boasts a variety of down-home, Polish comfort foods. The perfect compliment to the selection of Polish beer! The cocktail list is what makes this spot really shine. Aside from a few -decadent- milk-based treats, vodka is the main attraction. For Martini aficionados 800m Milk Bar is a must. Otherwise, the staff are very friendly, welcoming and attentive. My glass was never empty.The creative lighting scheme, gorgeous industrial accents and fabulous Polish artwork make a truly posh atmosphere. I'm sold."}
{"text":"Dang. Went in for a couple of drinks on a Tuesday night. Bartender was flustered by 4 people at his bar. He admitted he only bartends on Tuesdays and also works at Starbucks as a barista. He also admitted he didn't have good taste and couldn't taste well....
He was sweet. So there is that.
He was super unorganized, really amateur. I appreciate them trying to employ someone who may not have a ton of experience but if that's the case- have them working happy hour where drinks aren't $12. We got two very sub par cocktails and our tab was $26. Mind you, we are the type of people who would regularly spend that amount on cocktails- if they are worth it.
Put your money aside and go see the mixologists at Lux or Match if you want a quality cocktail. We won't be back. Shame, because it's a super sweet space."}
{"text":"It's a cool new spot, enjoyed the sangria.. The place had a nice vibe. The owner was super sweet and the staff were friendly. I live downtown and will be back again to try the food.."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix has been needing a place like this for sometime!  Beautiful space, great cocktails and delectable food!  I would highly recommend this place to others!  I would chalk up the bad reviews to surburbanites!  Sorry it wasn't comparable to Chilis!  Lol!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the place on what seemed to be a quiet night, service was great, staff was friendly and sociable. Had a couple of drinks with my wife. She enjoyed the atmosphere and we sat outside on their deck.   I read some of the post about this place and the claim that they are racist towards Hispanics. Being Puerto Rican I was prepared to meet resistance but was greeted by the friendly staff. We like the look and enjoy the .atmosphere Would recommend Milk Bar to anyone, cant say anything about the food because we didn't have any. But ,I'll write another review and let you know after our next visit."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, nice chill place but not the best.  The first couple of times the experience was not bad, the waiters were pretty nice and efficient. Until today, some buddies and I decided to stop by for a drink, bad idea! There was no wait to get seated, so we were excited for a bit. Little did we know that the service was not going to be good. We noticed that the previous waiters were not present, and they were missed! Our waitress took our order, and only brought 2 of the 3 drinks. I waited about 30 minutes for her to bring it to me, at this point my other two friends were done and we were ready to go. I told her i didn't want the beer anymore because we were now leaving, her attitude change drastically and rudely replied \"what to do?!\" I told her \"I don't want it, I've waited  30 minutes for a canned beer\" and she proceed to argue that it wasn't 30 minutes \"just 15\". It was 30, we timed it. Even if it was 15 min, 15 minutes for a canned beer? Really?  She then just told me to leave it on the table, and an apology was never given. The place was not busy at all, idk if she was new but her attitude was not appropriate, I will think twice before i come here again. Her name is Malina by the way. I gave one star because i like the decor."}
{"text":"5 stars!! Champagne, organic fruit liquors, vodkas, and absinthe. A numerous well thought out alchemy. I imagine the only thing more enjoyable than reading these concoctions was trying them in the R & D stage! A review of the food I'll save for another day. No review is complete without a mention of the service. Danielle tends bar with speed, precision, and has a hell of a pour. Our server Melena was very pleasant and full of spot on drink suggestions, thank you:)
The Milk Bar is a must stop when in downtown PHX!"}
{"text":"I'd like to add my voice to the positive reviews of 800M Milk Bar!  I'm a little skeptical of some of the negative reviews here, they seem contrived to me... Just my opinion!  I can't remember meeting any servers or bartenders in recent memory that were more friendly, accommodating or attentive than the staff at Milk Bar tonight.  Plus the food and drinks are EXCELLENT!  Wow.  Don't let the bad reviews fool you, check this place out right away."}
{"text":"I just had my first experience with this place yesterday. I had a Polish Sausage omelette and a Mimosa which were specials of the day. Both were very good!! I loved the interior and the owner and staff were very cool. I sensed there was a lot of passion about the neighborhood and buying local in general from both the patrons and the owner/staff. The place's aesthetic spoke to me as well. It is very modern and somewhat minimalist. They treated me very well even though I'm not what I consider hip. I think that bodes well for them trying to create a unique atmosphere while not being exclusionary. I think at some point they might want to push back the hours a bit to take advantage of the slightly cooler night hours during the hot Phoenix summers. This is a unique and beneficial addition to 3rd St. IMHO."}
{"text":"I got a cactus milk cocktail and it was great!  I really like it however my friend couldn't take the heat.  Its definitely not for the faint of heart.  I would definitely order it again next time.  The place was very nice, trendy atmosphere attentive bar tender.  The drinks are not exactly cheap, but if made from scratch I think they are worth it.  I didnt get a chance to try the food.  I would come back for a drink, nice place to start the night."}
{"text":"My second time here, first time had the pirogies and the hunters stew, both were good and priced low but the portions were a bit small. This time I had the meatloaf sliders, consistency was lacking, two came on the plate, one was almost twice as tall as the other, the smaller had a piece of meat that was maybe half the size of the bun about the size of a half dollar coin. 

The signature drink I had was overpriced and weak, straight liquor on ice was much better. Two drinks and sliders plus tax and 15% tip, service was very slow, was $36.

 Love the look, love the music, liked the food, unfortunately it's priced for New York not Phoenix."}
{"text":"What a fantastic gathering place!  Excellent drinks,  delicious pierogi's, friendly staff and wonderful atmosphere.  A definite new addition to my favorites list!"}
{"text":"Came on busy Saturday night. 4 of us got table. 8-10 minutes to get order from the table through the bartender. We got our food quickly, but drinks came after? My mint chocolate drink was over an inch lower from the small glass-disappointing for $10 as I sipped it down so fast. Probably won't be back for the slow blah experience- sorry from a polish girl : /"}
{"text":"This is a nice attempt at post socialist nostalgia.... I think the most authentic part of it is the terrible service (long wait, disorganized, with attitude). The food is adequate although does not do justice to delicious authentic home cooked Polish dishes. My favorite were \"golabki\" (cabbage rolls) made with cubed rather than ground meat. They seemed to have a South American flair. They were served undercooked but tasty. 
There are too many items on the menu to be made fresh as most are quite time consuming. But that is just an unconfirmed theory based on personal experience with Polish cuisine."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere and all the seating areas for groups. I may be used to the stiff drinks at Bliss Rebar, but my cranberry vodka didn't have much of a kick. I may need to try the sangria next time!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. After 7 of us were seated we waited 15 minutes before deciding to leave because not one staff member came over to our table. We let the hostess know why we were leaving and all she said was \"Okay.\" with zero apology. We were hoping to celebrate our friend's birthday and were really excited to check out a new place. All of us our locals and love to support local downtown Phoenix places. This was a huge disappointment and I would discourage others from checking this place out. Thank goodness for Moira and their wonderful service right next door. Their reverse happy hour was a bonus."}
{"text":"This bar took way to long to get a drink. Bartenders were inattentive and didn't care about caring to our service. We watched a couple leave after being here after asking for another drink and not receiving it after 45minutes of sitting by the fire. Service sucks beers are okay and vibes aren't the best if I could I would barely give this place 1 star."}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving some pierogies over the weekend and decided to see what Milk Bar had to offer. We came here on a Saturday night and our group of 6 was easily sat at a table on the patio. They have a great ambiance here including the music and rainbow mood lighting. Our server, Garrett, was friendly and helpful. We were interested in the \"flag shots\" that came in 3 varieties, and he suggested the pomegranate flavor which we all loved. He also recommended the meat and cheese pierogies with a vodka dipping sauce, which were also delicious...WAY better than the frozen kind at the supermarket which were the only kind I had ever had before. I wish we had ordered a few more! The selection of eastern European beers was very interesting although I wish the menu came with a pronunciation guide! I'll definitely come back to try some more items from their menu as well as explore the craft cocktail list."}
{"text":"I really like the decor here, both inside and out.  It has a modern lounge vibe and I like the music.   The only downside was that we were the only people here on a Friday night at 7pm.  There were a few other groups by the time that we left though.  They have a great cocktail menu.  I tried the Krakow mule and it was really good (made with a pepper vodka) and they also have an interesting selection of beers that you won't see everywhere.  For food, we ordered the pierogis, one order of the jalapeno and cheddar and one of the cheese and potato.  The jalapeno and cheddar were not very flavorful, but the cheese and potato came topped with bacon and a side of vodka sauce and were very good.  Overall everything was good and I'd like to come back to try some bruschettas (they have some very interesting flavors) and some of their other cocktails."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the more underrated bars in the area.   Good food and an extensive menu of imported Eastern European beers.   A great patio to hang when the weather permits.  Definitely a hidden gem in the Roosevelt area and a must visit if you are looking for something cool in the area."}
{"text":"My fiancé has been wanting to go to Milk Bar for a while now, but it took some convincing on his part to get me there. I'm glad we ended up going because we had a good experience!

First: the atmosphere. It was still a bit earlier in the evening when we got there, around 6:30pm or so. We walked into the restaurant and were taken to a table on the outside patio. Our waiter came by, grabbed our drink order, and gave us time to look over the menu. Unfortunately, before we even got our drinks, a few people came out to smoke. I really didn't want to be around that while we ate, so we talked to the hostess who was more than happy to re-seat us to another table inside. It was in the back area of that restaurant away from the other tables. I'd definitely say it's a cute little area to request, especially if you're on a date! The best part about sitting inside was actually the music. It was at a perfect loudness - low enough that it wasn't difficult to hear what the other was saying, but loud enough that it created a zen-kind of environment.

Secondly: the service. As a result of us moving to a table inside, we had a waitress helping us out. She was attentive but the waiter outside was definitely friendlier. She came by to ask if we needed anything, got our check in a timely manner, etc. No complaints.

Thirdly: the drinks/food. This is probably the reason for why I can't quite give Milk Bar 5-stars. I had gotten a Krakow Mule and my boyfriend got a dark beer (I can't remember the name). Both were really good so our night was off to a good start. Our original waiter had told us that all the items are served tapas-style so we got a few things to share: three jalapeño & cheese pierogies with salsa & cream cheese / three farmers cheese & potato pierogies with vodka sour cream / potato pancakes with sour cream & applesauce / and tacos. It was interesting how the two pierogies were so different from each other. The jalapeño & cheese had a crispy outer cover whereas the farmers cheese & potato had a boiled outer cover. By far the best thing at the table was the salsa & sour cream that came with the jalapeño & cheese pierogies! It was almost like a spicy-sweet & sour sauce with cream cheese. I wasn't much of a fan of the tacos mostly because of the kielbasa, however my boyfriend enjoyed them. And lastly, I thought the potato pancakes were way too greasy that they were difficult to eat! I would skip the latter two items, but would recommend the pierogies.

Overall, like I said perviously, I'm glad that I was finally convinced to visit Milk Bar. I think the next time I come back, I'll plan ahead, eat a little something before coming in, and just get drinks and some pierogies!"}
{"text":"In the midst of a Third Friday bike ride me and friends stopped in here. The patio was really nice, service was a bit slow with one person handling all the tables. I found every server and staff to be friendly and warm. I thought the signature drinks were really tasty, and am looking forward to trying the menu on another visit. It's a pretty snazzy addition to the downtown. Maybe have the bar lights shift a little slower and I'd hang in there, too."}
{"text":"Unique place with great Polish food and interesting drinks. The atmosphere feels a little strange at first, but the music is good, and everything comes together well. The staff knows their stuff, and they were able to provide great advice with regard to my food allergy (lots of gluten free options here). The cocktails are a bit pricey, but are extremely well made and definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Was here for 25 minutes ordered a drink TWICE and and it never came out. I finally left after sitting at the bar for 30 minutes. Apparently it's fun if you know someone behind the bar, but if you don't know anyone, steer clear."}
{"text":"Delicious cocktails, but unwelcoming staff and hectic billing situations. \"WE ONLY ACCEPT TWO CREDIT CARDS PER TABLE\" is printed on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a gorgeous, highly modern, and tastefully done bar - inside and out. It has rainbow LED interior lighting, but don't worry, it's soft on the eyes and very soothing!

It has a wide selection of drinks and food, although known as a Polish bar, I did see Czech, Slovakian, and other liquor from other countries. I actually ordered a Grapefruit beer from Slovakia and it was incredible! The prices are also very reasonable.

The staff was very kind and patient, and gave us complimentary water when we didn't even ask for it, amazing service for a bar! The music was very soothing as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Milk is an absolutely beautiful and modern bar downtown. They play great music and probably the best European feel to out of any bar in Phoenix. The food is great too if you're looking to have a bite to eat while you're out for cocktails. I'd highly recommend Milk to anyone looking for a new spot in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the stew and pierogies. Our server-a gorgeous woman with an exotic accent (European) paid great attention to detail (noting my vegetarianism), and took very good care of us. They played Prince's Purple Rain and Massive Attack while we were there, which made the experience all the more enjoyable. Milk Bar's small, but gives you this sense of an intimate space. It was our first time at the bar, but we will definitely go back to this pleasant European surprise hidden in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"The most unique style of dishes I've ever seen. The servers actually listen to the customers.  Very friendly."}
{"text":"A great location with an intriguing concept, but the execution during my first visit was just short of a total catastrophe.  If not for some tasty dishes, this would go down as my first ever one star Yelp.  As it is, there is a bunch of issues this place needs to work through if this concept is going to survive in a neighborhood that puts a premium on value and a pleasant experience.  Neither of which was the case during First Friday night.

A friend of mine caught wind of this place earlier in the week.  A new cocktail bar on 3rd Street & McKinley that serves Polish food?  Count me in I said.  I've only been to one other Polish restaurant in the entire Phoenix metro (A Touch of European Cafe in Glendale), but I remembered how much I enjoyed that food.  So a group of 7 of us decided to get together here on First Friday artwalk night.  Don't get me wrong, we knew it would be busy, but most any bar worth its weight in Downtown Phoenix knows how to handle a big crowd on a busy night.  We got here around 7:30 & surprisingly found seating immediately.  The building itself is one that I've walked by dozens of times, but this is the first I've seen the inside since becoming the Milk Bar.  The atmosphere is modern & clubby with a decent sized bar up front & a small amount of seating inside, as well as a pretty sizeable outdoor seating area.  The walls & tables are almost all white with neon colored lighting throughout & clubby music in the background (like I said, very clubby).  There's even a random multicolored portrait of Pope John II on the wall (which makes some sense since he was from Poland).

The menu is fairly limited but consists mostly of Polish food classics like pierogis, kielbasa, & cabbage rolls.  The cocktail menu is pretty wide-ranging with drink combos of all kinds, but almost all have a Polish flare in terms of the alcohol used and/or the ingredient combos.  After we were seated, the problems began to ensue.  For starters, it took almost 15 minutes just to be waited on by our waitress.  When she finally arrived, we were ready to order both our drinks & our food, but she told us she could only take care of drinks at that time.  Alright fine, we just gave her our drink orders.  She came back 10 minutes later having forgotten our drink orders.  5 minutes after that, she came back again having forgotten half our drink orders.  Finally 5 minutes later we got our drinks.  

For my drink, I got a Polish Flag Shot.  Its a shot of Polish vodka mixed with what tasted like raspberry and strawberry syrup.  It actually wasn't too bad, but for $7 it was hardly satisfying.  And after going more than 30 minutes between our arrive time and first drink, we were starving.  Finally after giving us our drinks, she took our food orders.  I went with their cheddar pierogis.  They come in a plate of three.  They also have goat cheese, spinach, jalapeño cheddar, meat, and sauerkraut pierogis as well.  I asked the waitress if my plate could have three different pierogis but she said that was forbidden.  Really?  To compensate, everyone at the table got a different kind.  Another 20 minutes passed by before the waitress brought our food by.  By now we were all in a pretty bad mood about the experience, but we were so hungry we all dived in as soon as our food arrived.

To the credit of Milk Bar's chefs, the pierogis were delicious.  Great texture and tasty filling in each.  Mine were topped with bacon and sauerkraut and included a side of sour cream.  My favorite was actually the jalapeño cheddar pierogi.  They aren't as good or as authentic as A Touch of European's pierogis, but still very respectable.  The downside however was (again) the price.  $7 for three pretty small pierogis?  A Touch of European would give me twice that many for that price.  I was still hungry after my dish, but we were ready to leave and walk around Downtown.

It was after eating that our bad experience became a disaster.  It took about 20 minutes for waitress to come by and clear our table, another 10 minutes to get our checks, another 10 minutes for her to come by and pick up our checks with the cards, and then 30 minutes (!!!) for our waitress to charge our cards so we could sign the tab and go.  Altogether, we were stranded at this restaurant for more than 2 hours from start to finish.  Based on the limited amount of food and drinks we ordered, we should have been here for less than half that time.  I've worked in food service so I'm usually a sympathetic tipper, but tonight I didn't give the waitress a good tip.  She didn't earn even a sympathetic amount.  

To the credit of the manager, he did come by to apologize and offered everyone a free shot for the trouble, but we were so done that we just wanted to get out of there.  So yes, all in all, it was pretty brutal.  As intriguing as this Derek Pasieka creation is, the staff needs to improve their service and the prices need to moderate if this place is to last beyond the next First Friday"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink. The drinks are a bit expensive considering their well vodka is crap but aside from that , Everyone was friendly and the place was really cool. Hope to go back to try the food."}
{"text":"Went there for a small gathering. The music was good and the atmosphere and look is great. Can't wait to try the food."}
{"text":"After seeing this place from the street and seeing it on happy hour lists for the downtown area, I got some friends to check it out with me. It wasn't packed or even very busy, so when we got seated at the bar we were kinda perplexed since there were open booths behind us. After placing our orders, we asked to move sections. Once that happened the experience really fell apart. They billed us for an order of fries that we never received as well as had menu options that weren't in stock. what gives? The real kicker came when they asked my buddy if he had another form of payment than AmEx because the restaurant gets charged a higher fee. Who does this? like why would a server think its ok to make their transaction costs a public issue? Super unprofessional. While the drinks were great, it really didn't rub us the right way."}
{"text":"I work downtown as a server and this place is around the corner from mine yes the same hours so it can be hard to get too unless I'm off but well worth it our bartender was awesome made my friend a specialty drink with absinthe and champaign or sparking water I don't remember he was definitely fiddling with the mixtures and experimenting  she said she loved it so go him I had the mothers milk I believe and that was amazing along with some Pirogues divine!! For the look of the place and the exoticness of the menu I was expecting it to be pricier and looking at the menu pricing I was shocked that it was moderate now our bill came out to 100$ but with six specialty cocktails and three food items that's fair...I'll be back I hope hours will be extended so I can frequent more often as they develop and further the business I see great things in the future for them GO MILKBAR!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to our downtown Phoenix neighborhood and I love that it's an ethnic cuisine (Polish) that doesn't already exist in our neighborhood!  My father-in-law was Lithuanian, so we have eaten many of these recipes for many years...so it is so nice to have this comfort food close by when you want and crave it.  We tried 5 or 6 different dishes to share and loved every one of them.  We'll definitely be back for the food, but also for the great cocktails I hear they mix up."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes at a table after ordering 6 drinks and opted to leave.

Adding more words because yelp won't let me post this story without more words but there's nothing more I need to stay"}
{"text":"Meh. Cute place, cool ambiance. Staff was very friendly and attended to us right away with waters and menus. But nothing to be excited about. This might be a tad unfair but I just needed to satisfy my sweet tooth when I came here so from their choice of milk & cookies or sweet pierogis for dessert, I went with blueberry pierogis (usually a choice of strawberry/blueberry but only blueberry available around 10 pm) because I figured at a Polish place, the dessert version of their signature dish would be the way to go. Boy was I wrong. Literally a moist, flavorless dumpling dough with bland, slightly bitter blueberry filling. I couldn't even finish one. What a shame. I may be interested in trying the milk & cookies and their savory things on the menu but I think I'll skip this place for the most part."}
{"text":"I just got back from here and the experience was just amazing. You don't come here for just the food or for drinks. You come here for both. Think of it as you favorite wine bar, except you switch the wine out for vodka and the Italian food for Polish. All the Polish customary staples are on the menu, and executed better than any other Polish store in town. 

I had the pickled herrings which were on point and the pierogies with potato and cheese. They were also really good, make sure you get the toppings. The portion size for the pierogies can be small, but expected as quantities are notated in the menu. To be fair, the food menu is fairly priced. Prices start at about $5 and up. My wife and I were able to get a little bit of everything, we personally liked the menu set up. She got the hunters stew. We drank the Clockwork Orange and Copernicus. Both very good cocktails, a bit of each spectrum.

This is not the typical Polish bar that has the grocery store attachment, which I hate by the way. So to say this place has an identity crisis is an utter statement of confusion and ignorance. It's new and unique to the valley, sure, but the elements and details of the restaurant tie back into modern Polish culture. 

I'm Polish, and this place made me connect with past memories and experiences that I've had in Poland when I visited as a child. It represents my favorite Polish attributes, a pollacks love for vodka, a pollacks high energy which is usually channeled though electronic music, their taste for European interiors which are synonymous with minimalism and modern, and the direct yet friendly service. My wife is Asian, so the racist remarks earlier I also agree are B.S.

Milk Bar will be my favorite novelty secret spot to bring friends."}
{"text":"My friend and I happened to walk by on the opening day. My Clockwork cocktail is delicious. An orangy take on the classic White Russian. Friend got a Copernicus cocktail. It is a classy take on a vodka pineapple. Could use a bit of blueberry puree to go with the floating blueberries so it would impact the flavor.

The little pail of fries is adorable. Shoestring fries in a 1.5 cup little pail served with ketchup. It's the perfect European sized bite when you just want a little something to take the edge off the cocktails.

I'll rate them a 3 because there is room for improvement. As they get the vibe of the city, I think the music taste will stabilize. I like the decor. I could see coming back in a classy dress after dark. The prices are gentle for Phoenix and the Polish theme is intriguing.

It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have wanted to try it for a while. Lots of great food and great service.  I like the decor as well, urban, trendy. The bartenders and servers did a great job.  I am second generation Polish descent and grew up on Golumpki, Perogi that my mother made. For years I  have resorted to frozen Perogi to fill a void and No Golumpki in many years.  The fries and sliders are good too.This is close to my home in downtown as so glad I found it. Its nice to try the Polish beers and different Vodkas."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Good food and service. Experience was dampened by lack of a Women's restroom which resulted in a woman in my group having to sit on a unisex toilet seat which was urinated on."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want to people watch and just drink water... because it takes more than 45 minutes to get a cocktail around there.

Our group of 4 was there on a slow Friday night; no one at the bar, a handful of tables left. We first sat at the bar, but then moved outside to order drinks for a better chat session. Little did we know that the bartender either 1) instantly hated us because we left his domain or 2) wanted to mess with us, because we ordered 3 drinks and got nothing despite polite inquiries causing us to leave 50 minutes after ordering. We left because we were tired of waiting and watching others around us get their drinks (likely smarter patrons who ordered at the bar and THEN moved to a table).

2 stars because the free water arrived timely, the sleek ambiance and the Polish waitress was super nice.

A tip for management: hire another bartender vs that guy decorating the trees outside with lights. You've got plenty of lights up, including that chandelier hanging from the front tree. I also saw his buttcrack while he was fixing the tree on the corner."}
{"text":"Cool place, nice idea! These drinks were pretty strong for me, maybe I'm just a big baby tho! In a good way tho! You feel like you're paying for a real drink! The bartenders are very knowledgable about their menu. They gave me great suggestions on what they think I would like (based on what I told them), as well as what's popular in general! Not pushy at all to hurry me, which I loved as well (I can be pretty indecisive). I was throughly impress with both. One tasted like apple pie, literally! Yum! The other was clockwork orange I think? Like a strong creamsicle is how it tasted, really good! Just a little much for me, but still loved it! Love the ambiance  and look of this place- modern, cool, sexy. The lights are neat and I love that they change, but mildly so it's not too much. Overall, I really like it! Definitely a spot I'll have to revisit !"}
{"text":"One word to describe this place is wow. Very nice inside, like something you'd find in Miami. The music and ambiance was great, really makes you feel comfortable. When I went in it was a little slow but Bernie the bartender from Chicago made it a good time. Everything is there is polish (as the name is from the 1800's, it has a very historic meaning) go on in and find out, they have the story on the menu's. They have an eclectic menu and the drinks are a work of art."}
{"text":"Came here with friends from out of town and got denied entry because according to them it was to capacity. Then the guy at the door says \"20 bucks gets you in\". Yea right. so we walk to the corner and guess what i see? the people behind us walk right in, about 4-5 people. WTF? i didn't see anyone come out or anyone exchange any money for entry. I felt like i was discriminated against because of the way we looked. I don't recommend anyone come here, not every customer is treated the same. i will make sure to spread the word about this bias establishment."}
{"text":"My friend had his birthday dinner here & I was excited to come try out a place I had bookmarked on Yelp. First of all parking sucks! We had to drive around numerous times before lucking out and finding parking right across the street from the Milk Bar. Our friend had made reservations so we were seated in the back room right away. He made reservations for 12 but there was enough seating for 8. I had to ask our server to bring in another table because there was no way 12 grown adults were gonna all fit. Our server was nice and brought another table right away. I liked the white interior and I enjoyed the atmosphere of the bar. We stared off by ordering some drinks. My fiancé got the atomic beer & I got the Copernicus . My cocktail was sweet & you couldn't really taste the  alcohol. Then we ordered the sliders, meat perogi and cheddar & jalapeño perogi. All their food is tapas style so don't expect a large meal. I really didn't care for the perogis. The meat one was soft & reminded me of a steamed dumpling while the cheddar & jalapeño one had a crunchy texture. Out of the two , I would recommend the cheddar .
The sliders were probably my favorite. Two mini sliders and I liked how they used a small pail for the fries. 
I don't think I would come back for the food but it's a nice place to come grab drinks! The inside area is kinda small but they also have an outside area. If you also come with a large party, remember to bring cash!!! They don't split the bill & only take two credit cards when paying for the bill."}
{"text":"Went there last night to meet some friends had no drinks prior to arriving. Will come back to that later, sat down and no one came to get our drink orders so we had to get them from the bar. Also no came to clean the table next to ours, we were sitting around the fire pit. Finished my first drink of the night there was still no server coming to see if we needed anything. But there was couple a few tables down that had a server that kept on coming to make sure they had what they needed. So I go in place a drink order, mind had only one drink there entire night up until that point, as I open the door which is a sliding I stumble a little on the siding rail. 5 minutes later the bartender comes out and says I'm cutoff because of the way I opened the door. I will not be going back to this b place any time soon if they are so quick to make jugement calls people."}
{"text":"The waiter was very sweet but the service was awful. I waited for almost an hour for my drink. I was with a large group on a Saturday night and multiple of us never received our drinks. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks with work a polish twist.  Unique eclectic r in the midst of downtown phoenix. .."}
{"text":"A disaster of a bar...

Drinks are God awful. Or if you're in the 21 year old demographic, you'll think they're \"awesome\".
Food is just mediocre at best. Overpriced for sure.
Ambiance is disconnected with theme.
Owner/manager likes to hang out and smoke outside rather than deal with real issues within the establishment.
Got a dirty, lipstick encrusted glass with my cocktail. Fortunately the drink was so bad anyway that it didn't matter."}
{"text":"Watched this place develop in downtown Phoenix till now not known for sophisticated cosmopolitan night spots. Wondered why with the ultra contemporary vibe, and euro-techno background, it wasn't more crowded. Just seemed too cool to pass up so we walked in one night to try the experiment. Wow, great idea! Unique cocktail and beer choices and eastern European fare presented in a tasteful fashion. Courteous and knowlegeable staff, tasteful contemporary decor. Thought I was in a cafe in a European metropolis. Very interesting and more of what we need in our town."}
{"text":"I really dig the aesthetic of this place. Sort of pseudo euro contemporary decor. Lots of alcohol to choose from. Mostly polish, so lots of vodkas. They have their perogis on happy hour, which I definitely advise getting. You get to try four different types of perogis and they're all delicious. Made me curious to try more. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Super friendly and funny bartenders, a unique vibe, and great cocktails. My favorite was the clockwork. All are vodka based, so this will complement nicely with the Rum bar down the street. They also had some unique Polish beers, ranging from light varieties to a porter. We came before they were officially open, and everyone working was welcoming and attentive, yet still laid back. They seemed to genuinely be enjoying themselves, and wanted to make sure we were, too. The decor inside is very sleek and modern. This will become one of our neighborhood spots. Plus, the food is reasonably priced. AND -- They have hand-crafted, silver bull statues outside, decorated with the owner's crest, and the menu explains their Polish manifesto! What's not to love??"}
{"text":"This place is having a serious identity crisis. 

Located in downtown Phoenix, this new establishment can't seem to figure out what it wants to be. Its all white interior, color changing lights and techno music scream Scottsdale lounge/bar, yet apparently they're a Polish restaurant. What? 

I came here last weekend for a drink with some friends and was told they would be closing in 15 minutes. For a place with \"bar\" in the name, 11:30 seemed pretty early to be closing on a weekend night. But whatever, we only wanted to get one drink and check the place out. 

Once seated at the bar, I asked the bartender why they were closing so early. He rudely shot back that they were \"a restaurant, not a club\" and are trying to set themselves apart from \"all the other clubs downtown\".

Hold up, buddy.

First, what clubs are you talking about? Yes, downtown does have a few clubs, but this isn't Scottsdale. 

Next, for a place that's trying to set itself apart from all these supposed clubs, they're doing a hell of a job. Based on their over the top interior/exterior I had absolutely no idea this place was a restaurant until I was directly told so.   

Again, let me reiterate that the place is all white, has color changing lights, and plays loud techno music. Oh! And did I mention the large bull statues outside? And the name! Milk BAR. BAR.  

But whatever, let's get to the drinks already.

Their cocktail list is made up of six drinks and one shot. I tried the Clockwork and my friend had the Tatanka. I'm 100% sure the apple juice in the Tatanka was just some Martinelli's with a shot of vodka. Martinelli's has a very distinct flavor, so it was pretty clear that was the main ingredient. Pro tip: do not use bottled juice for your cocktails. The proportions of the ingredients in my Clockwork seemed very off; it was overly sweet and very thick and syrupy.  

We ended up not finishing either drink and got the hell out of there. Maybe the food is awesome, but for a place that's trying to establish itself as a Polish restaurant and not a bar/lounge they're going to have a pretty rough time."}
{"text":"Fun vibe. They don't take American Express. Bar staff is great- food was so so. Nice to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"More reasons to venture downtown, everyone in my group tonight lives adjacent to Mill Ave or Old town yet our dining plans drew us to Metro Phx.

Word is spreading about this ambitious Euro-Trend Hot Spot. This place is Keen, Super Sleek, and Tasty as Heck. Service tonight was Spot-On and very informative (everyone had a ton of questions) those questions and deft service handled well by our charming waiter Javi.

I was impressed by the set of restrooms that weren't labeled, about time, and I hope more places follow suit.

Lots of small plates (tapas style) hit our table and everything was remarkable. The Pirogues where delish, Kilbasa had just the right snap and spice, and the Cabbage Rolls beat expectations although the Tomato *Cream sauce was not expected yet still tasty.

Beer selection and Cocktails where Stellar, and well thought out, I cringed when my group was asking about margaritas but they were quickly steered towards some amazing well crafted drinks."}
{"text":"Great place. Great atmosphere, friendly staff! The food is good, try the euro bruschetta! It's wonderful! Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Bartender was very informative. My boyfriend is a whisky drinker and this place was all about the vodka. He recommended a drink he really enjoyed"}
{"text":"Hmmm...This place is located in downtown phoenix, but not close at all to the rest of the bars and hotels. About 1 mile away/20 minute walk. Polish bar, with cool architecture is the only positive thing I can say about this bar. Came here a few days ago for a small event they were having to help promote the new bar...was very disappointed.  First was the exact location,  2nd there were ants and bugs all over this place (on the bar, in the bar, on the floors, in the bathroom..
It was insane), 3rd this bar is trying to copy/imitate your Bitter & Twisted/Bluhound & charging $12 a drink as if the drinks are \"craft cocktails\". Let me tell the price point for this place is not on point and the drinks are not good at all. Lastly, they charge a cover after like 8pm...but then close early and tell customers we aren't trying to be like a club...However they have charged covers! I know for sure our group that was here last week will not be back!"}
{"text":"The milk bar was different for me. Not only was the atmosphere very futuristic, but the menu had some Polish in it too. I had always passed by it but never dared to go in. My first impression was a hipster bar but a closer look proved wrong. It is a new type of bar that derives from Poland. I ordered a Polish Princess drink and the cake of the day which was a Polish version of Apple pie. 

The drink was fancy looking  and it was strong! My friend Jenn ordered the vodka ice cream which was just as strong or even more so. Is that what makes it Polish? The Polish cake was VERY good. The presentation of our dessert and drinks was classy. I would recommend this establishment of you're looking for a chill evening out and feel like experimenting. 

My whole tab was just under $15 for the drink and cake. The service was ok. They were a bit busy due to first Friday but overall it was friendly. I would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty interesting decor! The inside has cool neon lighting with everything themed in white. Even the Christmas trees they put out were white. 

The food was pretty good, although smaller portions. Not that I'm complaining when you usually get way too much in the USA. We ordered pierogies (polish style dumplings), polish sausage, bigos (hunter's stew), and barszcz (beet soup). All of these items were super tasty!! And like I said, portion sizes were great for me.

We also delved into some beers. Nice imports that weren't necessarily from Poland. Mine was called the Lobster Lover and had 9% alcohol. I pretty much got it because of the name but it did not disappoint on taste! There was one with 15% which had a pretty strong flavor of you like beer!

All in all, Milk bar is a nice bar with good food so if you're ever in the downtown area, check it out if you're looking for something a bit different."}
{"text":"I think 4 stars is spot on for this bar. Very cool ambiance, nice lighting at night with fire pits outside. Chill music. Different type of drinks here (polish bar). Nice date spot."}
{"text":"Great new spot downtown featuring Polish food.  The bar is small, but has a huge patio that will be great once it warms up.

I opted for the potato and cheese pierogies and they were fantastic.  My other half ordered the meat pierogies and they too were excellent.  We also split the stuffed cabbage roll and loved them.  

The owner came out and introduced himself and gave us some free shots. Thanks!!  I didn't see if they offered a happy hour, but if they do it will be a great addition downtown."}
{"text":"Two words: Vodka Icecream!

My husband is Polish and having just returned from a Trip to Poland raving about their \"Milk Bars\" we were excited to find out that Phoenix is getting one of its own.

I love the white interior and the overall vibe. The drinks are a bit pricey, but after trying a few I settled on the Clockwork being worth the price. It even has a little Kumquat on the rim. It feels like a lounge but has a full menu. 

Drink Recommendations:
- Clockwork if you like something sweet and strong
- Dirty Commie if you like strong martini drinks and pickles
- The Grapefruit beer if you want a European alternative to a Summer Shandy

Food Recommendations:
- The potato pancakes (Kart-o-fel) are crispy on the outside and just amazing
- Pierogies- I have not had the dessert pierogies, but the potato and cheese is perfect

From what I understand, the MilkBar is still in it's \"Soft Open\" phase, and while they are working out kinks on the menu, drinks, and staffing, they have a solid base in home-style Polish classics and High-end cocktails. 

As with any concept restaurant, it's not for everyone, but it's definitely for me."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing! The decor is hip and elegant; great electronic music that creates a chill ambiance. The owner Derek is not only cute but super friendly and kind. The food is amazing and the bartender makes such amazing drinks I can't even believe! Peirogis are a must and the keilbasa is out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if zero stars was possible but if it was this place would get it times three. They're lucky yelp doesn't allow it. The fire outside on the patio is the one star it receives. The bar sucks, the beer sucks, the bartenders are terrible. People next to us waited over 30 mins for a drink and never got one. I'll never be back here again!"}
{"text":"I am going to start this off by saying I have been here 2 times before and I LOVED IT.  I am Polish and a very traditional one.  My family has been making Polish food my whole life.  When we went there, we all fell in love.  The decor is awesome, the music is awesome, the food was awesome and our drinks were great.  This was Christmas last year.
Fast Forward to last night...
It was First Friday...there were a TON of people roaming the streets in the area.  All the bars were so busy, except for the Milk Bar...which is why we went in.  
We were told right off the bat that they were short staffed and it would take awhile to get drinks.  Thats OK...we'll wait and talk.  20 minutes goes by...I see tons of people coming out with drinks.  Servers were walking by with drinks for people.  We never get our drinks.  I ask the waiter if our drinks were ever ordered...he said yes, they're in the queue.  OK fine...we'll wait a little longer.  A manager (or person we assumed was the manager) came over and lit the fire pit we were sitting next to.  Asked how our night was going and we told him we've been waiting for a drink for over 30 minutes.  He did not offer to go check on our drinks but instead went back to talking to his friends and drinking his OWN drink.  The waitress comes back and tells us that the order is in but he hasn't made them yet.  Tells us we can go get our drinks ourselves but she's not sure how long it will take to get them made.  My fiancee goes to walk up to order them...but at that point I was just done.  We left...and with a sour taste in our mouths.  I will not go back there until things improve.  It is so terrible too...because I loved that place and I have talked it up so much....
Please improve on things."}
{"text":"Pierogis, dumplings, empanadas looking! Milk Bar has your polish needs! Other than that unless you're @champagnepapi and shooting thehotlinebling video 1800- eat me! Don't skip out on the cool interior this lounge/ restaurant is pretty dope in the heart of the art district of Phoenix, exquisite polish meals with a modern twist! Also if you're looking for different brews they got them with their menu of cocktails and European beers and drafts!

{"text":"This place is very cool inside and you can tell they put a lot of hard work into creating a unique vibe here. I can tell you I am Polish and am used to eating and cooking Polish food on a regular basis so I had very high hopes coming here. I will say I thought the pierogies portions were kind of small, left me wanting more. I thought they tasted good, as well as the potato pancakes we ordered. I think they need to take a more traditional approach with their food, it seemed they were trying to be very modern even with how the food is plated, which is fine if you are eating at an expensive steakhouse. Place has a lot of potential, go check it out."}
{"text":"Oh heavens! You're sporting a \"Got Vokda?\" slogan. You market yourself as a Polish restaurant, yes, but before that a craft cocktail bar specializing in vodka. 

You use Sobieski in the majority of your cocktails. What the actual heck? Nothing small-batch. Not even something a little upscale. You use vodka that would only even pass as mid-shelf at a freaking Wal-Mart, but charge the same prices as places like Blue Hound or the rest of this city's premier watering holes.

My \"Napolean Complex\" tasted like rubbing alcohol. The alleged absinthe was not noticeable. It was icky all the way down. The \"Cactus Milk\" I tried tasted like someone panicked about not being able to fill the glass with ingredients that mattered, and topped it off with way too much soda water. It was diluted. If you're gonna take forever to get these drinks to us, make them with care! Or at least, better ingredients.

On the way out, we learned they don't take AMEX. Yes, in the 2010s. In a neighborhood in which we can be chauffeured about using smartphones, and bars are still unable to take certain cards. How gauche. 

So yeah, this place is aesthetic. It looks and feels cooler than it actually is. The workers appear sharp. That's nice. I didn't try the pierogies, and perhaps I missed out. There are plenty of other Polish restaurants I can enjoy these in. As a bar, this messes up on a very fundamental level. If I'm going to splurge on my drinks, I'd be better served virtually anywhere else within a two-mile radius, so this will go in the books as a rare one-star review."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Milk Bar for discriminating and not letting me and a few buddy's in. Person at the door checking IDS said the venue was at max capacity but that $20 would get us in! Really? 

So we walked away and looked for something else and while waiting o the sidewalk we notice a group of people walk in no questions asked and no money exchanged.

Now I'm getting threats from their employees for leaving them a review. They also contacted yelp to get my review removed. Thought yelp was supposed to an honest review company?"}
{"text":"I really want to give this beautifully designed resturant a glowing review and say that the food and service matched the great decor.  Unfortunately after waiting ten minutes (felt like 20) after being seated by the bartender and then completely ignored, we decided to go somewhere that would not only acknowledge our existence but would also feed us.  The final straw which dictated our exit was the table next to us explaining to the waiter who was bringing out a side that they had ordered with their main dish, that they were finished eating, they no longer wanted the side but just the check.  I might go back for a cocktail sometime,  after they have worked out their complete lack of service."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday dinner.. He made reservations for 12 but when we got there we were taken to a table that only sat 8 ppl we had to ask for another table to add to ours.. Thankfully some ppl weren't able to come so it ended up working out but still... How do u seat a party of 12 that clearly only seats 8?? The waitress started off nice but as the night went one it took longer and longer for her to check up on us and she also became very rude.... It sucked that 20% gratuity was automatically added bc we has more than 6..  When we moved outside (they turned off the air conditioning !!!, we had to ask them to turn it back on) because we got so hot, the only sitting that fit our party was around a fountain. We asked if they can wipe down the chairs bc we didn't want to sit in water she made a smart a$$ remark saying \"your sitting near water, ur going to get wet..\" The food was eh.. The sliders were probably the best item that anyone ordered.. The jalapeño and cheese potato dumplings and cheese/potato dumplings weren't bad... But everything was bland.. Just FYI if you go with a big party they only except TWO cards or just cash... So come prepared.. Oh yeh, the parking options around the restaurant sucks if your going there in the evening.."}
{"text":"It seems like there is a recurring theme here based on some other reviews. I came by with a group a week ago on a Saturday night. It was 9:45, and there were about 10-15 patrons enjoying the place, clearly not packing up or leaving. We walked up, and one of the employees told us that they were closed. The hours here say that it closes at 11:30. Maybe the hours were different a week ago, but it did feel strange to be turned away from a bar at 9:45 when the rest of the place didn't seem like it was closing down. The place looks nice, but they wouldn't even let us check it out. I was excited for a new place opening in the neighborhood. Instead, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth without even trying their food or drinks."}
{"text":"Went here a few days after they opened a couple weeks ago. The \"Euro-techno\" architecture was pretty cool, kind of a ultra-modern Polish vibe to it. Tried a nice sampling of 4 or 5 different menu items, the pierogi were ridiculously good! I could not recommend them more (go for the meat or sauerkraut), the dessert, and the golumpki were also great. 

The beer and liquor selection were pretty good, definitely going towards the vodka bar theme, hence being a Polish place. The bar tender was cool and entertaining after my buddy had one too many (I remember my first beer...). I spoke to the owner a few times, really cool guy who seems to know what he is doing. He was very open to comments and suggestions. My only real gripe was their prices were a little crazy, the food portions were a little small for the price and the mixed drinks were really pricey, stopped me from drinking too many. Maybe do drink specials?

Not many Polish joints in Phoenix, ill definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm so excited about a new fresh venue downtown. The view from the patio is amazing, considering it's a single story building. Love the patio, the art and the vibe -- very Miami/LA.

The Perogies are great, and the cocktails are delicious. We had the pleasure of meeting the owner and he was a very nice and accommodating guy.

We've been here twice so far, once on a Friday and once on a Wednesday, and both times the experience, drinks and food was excellent!

These reviews about racism and negative experiences have to be bogus. First of all, the two times we've been here there has not been anyone at the door -- it's a bar/restaurant, not a night club. Additionally, my friends and I cover the gamut on race and we were treated equally and with much respect.

We will be going back for sure!"}

Sit down with Heidi the bartendress.....she'll explain the menu, its a bit difficult if you don't understand the cuisine.  Must go, must try..... the milk bar is like an Irish pub kinda..... totally delicious.... Tim"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Seriously. I don't understand the low reviews. The service is friendly, yes it's a leisurely pace but they aren't mass producing a pizza or burger - they are hand crafting comfort food and that takes time! For drinks we recommend the Tatanka cocktail it's simple and light - perfect for the AZ heat (or anything with the Zubrowka vodka). For food, get the Goulash. Don't think twice, its heavenly. Dessert is on it's way - based on what we have had so far, I have no doubt it's wonderful. Ignore the low reviews and give it a shot, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"As someone who recently visited Poland, I was a little disappointed with Milk Bar. A milk bar in Poland is like a grungy cafeteria.... usually with ladies in hair nets serving up simple Polish fare for crazy cheap prices. Milk Bar is not that. Milk Bar feels like it's trying very hard to be hip or different. The prices are high and the portions are small. The first time I visited I was delighted to find they had a tatanka drink (really popular in Poland), but was a bit disappointed that it was 9$ and extremely small. As far as the food goes, it isn't bad. Their golabki was a bit flavorless and small. The pierogies are decent, but nothing too much better than their frozen counterparts (not to mention other establishments around town that offer pierogi) you can buy for much less. The portions are tiny. The only saving grace is the bacon topping. Without it, they would be fairly bland. I was very excited for the opening of this restaurant and hope they make some adjustments to ensure their longevity in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Visited this bar after eating at Angeles Trumpet just down the way to get a change of scenery and another drink. This is a polish bar. Delicious. And the drinks were all polish themed. I had the Madame Curie, it was a twist on a gin and tonic and it was amazing! I would definitely recommend it! We sat out and it was a little cold but the staff was more than willing to turn on the heater and turn up the fire outside as well! Awesome place to get a drink and try new drink concoctions!"}
{"text":"Very unique space! The music is just right, the drinks are different than your normal fare and the food was tasty. The menu is different than your normal fare as well.

My wife and I had the sausage plate, some tacos and a few drinks, including absinthe. Loved being able to sit and chat in a space that felt very laid back and relaxed.

Going there again next week. :)"}
{"text":"1 year later and still going strong.  Love Milk Bar!! The food is just as great as are the drinks!"}
{"text":"This place was great! It even changes color!  We went here as part of my birthday bar crawl I did downtown. We sat on the patio where they have nice little fire pits you can reserve, we sat at a regular table though.  I had a Polish Princess which was excellent and there were all kinds of things on the menu I wanted to try! We did get to meet the owner and he was very nice, even bought me a birthday pie shot.  The pie shot was amazing, very strong but very delicious, could possibly be dangerous as they're easy to drink. I can't wait to go back and try more cocktails and some of the food."}
{"text":"First time here. The restaurant was clean and modern. The staff was very welcoming, nice, and prompt; however, they were a little slow when getting desert and the check. Our waitress was knowledgeable about their drink and food menus, and gave good recommendations. We had some of their pierogis and kielbasa, and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Polish place in the city. I've never tried anything I didn't like. Great atmosphere with a very European vibe. Lots of patio seating right on 3rd street which makes for good people watching. This is one of my go-to's when I have people in from out of town and I want to show them something unique."}
{"text":"The parking to try and get here really sucks but then again, anything downtown is hard to get to, especially finding parking. We came here for a friend's birthday and it was a party of 10-12 that he reserved. They put us in this tiny room that comfortably fit maybe half of the reserved amount of people. The decor of the place is really nice, very sleek and clean and modern looking. They have good music, I'm thinking it was Polish music but I enjoyed it. They for some reason decided to turn off the ac in the room we were in so it was super hot and we were all sweating and had to call our server over to look into it. The perogis were not good and I really tried to like them. The texture of the meat perogi was hard to oversee, it was like puréed mush for meat and just didn't taste good at all. I tried some of the other varieties my friends got and those weren't very good either. Costco often times has a perogi vendor come and let you sample them and I'd have to say those tasted way better than the ones this place served. We also ordered the sliders which were also not good. The patty was dry and the cheese was just placed on top of the patty and wasn't even melted on, it was cold, hard cheese. Their food was definitely disappointing. Their French fries were good, they were thin and crispy and I enjoyed them. The drinks on the other hand were really good!! I got this polish lemon beer called Warka and was kind of nervous to try it because I wondered if the beer would be sour because it was a lemon beer but it tasted so good! It's sweet and refreshing and is now a definite favorite. The percentage of alcohol is very low, but I still got a little buzz from drinking it. We also got another beer that was similar to a Guinness and that was also really good. Their mixed drinks were also good, so I'd say this would be a good place to come for a drink, but I'd recommend to skip the food. The server was nice until the end when we decided to go outside and sit by the fountain. Someone in our group asked if she could wipe down the chairs because they were wet from the fountain and the server said, what's the point? It's going to get wet again. That may have been true, but it would take some time before it got wet and at least we could sit down in the meantime. We probably won't ever come back, but I'm glad I came for the experience and found myself s favorite beer!!"}
{"text":"It'd heard of this place but had never been there before. The reasons for the two stars are for the cool menu and ambiance/decorations. The service was abismal. We were seated right away, the lady explained the menu is great detail which was cool, we were excited to try some fun drinks but she never came back to us again. She came outside about 10 times and never ONCE looked our way. We left after about 20-25 minutes of waiting like idiots. Safe to say I will never be back and will go out of my way to make sure to spread the word about this god awful service."}
{"text":"Who knew, Polish food in downtown Phoenix. Amazing barszcz & krokiety, fasolka and don't forget the to die for nalesniki with cloudberry jam! Yum! Pycha!"}
