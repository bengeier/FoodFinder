{"text":"Nice and clean restaurant.  The staff are nice and helpful.  I like Roast beef sandwiches.  The classical one. The curly fries is delicious.  And plenty of free sauces"}
{"text":"This Arbys was on point. Good food and fresh salad. The cashier was freindly and brought the meal out to our table.  Their new shakes are delicious as well"}
{"text":"Arbys's it's a fast food place and what more can u say about the food. The food I recieved tasted like anything from another one of their stores. My fries were fresh and my sandwich hot. So for the food dept it was good.

What I really wanted to write about was the service I recieved. I believe the manager was on duty and she rang me up it was Kristen or Kurstin I can't quite remember. She was extremely polite and super friendly. The rest of the staff seemed very happy and the atmosphere here was just plain wonderful. I really felt welcome and had a nice dining expeirence. It's good to know that there are some people who can still provide great customer service in the fast food industry."}
{"text":"The food is what youd expect from a fast food joint. Cheap, but tasty. But what really stood out was the crew and fast service. Our cashier was the best out of them all as she was fun, funny, and kind."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and manager. 
The women's bathroom was absolutely filthy - The floor was covered with water, paper towels were taken out of the wastebasket and thrown on the floor, in the corner by the sink. The changing table was also covered with used paper towels. Somebody had an accident on the toilet seat and the outside of the toilet bowl.

I notified the manager, Eric, and the staff quickly cleaned the bathroom.

Just before I got here they'd  thrown a homeless woman out of the restaurant. Someone had bought her a meal and once she ate it she became disruptive.

I dined in and enjoyed listening to the camaraderie of a the crew!"}
{"text":"Its Arby's and I love mid beef and cheddars with no red ranch and curly fries. 

I stop at this location when I do business on that side of town, the staff is very friendly and accommodating, the manager came by to take my tray as I left and throw it out for me. Service is fast and the employees seem to enjoy working there.

Good job everyone for keeping this location fun, friendly, and courteous!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning after eating at this location, I almost went to the hospital after about 12hrs of vomiting and diarrhea. I will NEVER eat Arby's again"}
{"text":"They don't accept Arby's gift cards. Shame on them!

They have since closed their doors for good at this location."}
{"text":"Best experience of the day... The food came out quick and the staff was very accommodating."}
{"text":"It's an Arby's, food tastes like every other Arby's. 

However, the service is consistently good and that's important when you're trying to cram a quick lunch within a half hour break, so they get a few stars from me.

Edit: This outlet didn't honor their nationwide promotion of free curly fries after a Matt Kenseth NASCAR win. The cashier didn't even know who Matt Kenseth is, and made me feel like an idiot trying to collect on a dollar side item. What the crap?"}
{"text":"Yo, why does this location ALWAYS have you pull forward or around the building for your drive-through order? It doesn't matter what you order or if you're the only car in the drive-through, you WILL get asked to pull around to get your food. I promise you.

I'm pretty sure they are trying to falsify their order completion times by getting you off the sensor right outside of the pay window. So for that reason, I'm publicly announcing my displeasure with how annoying this is here."}
{"text":"This location sucks.  Shake machine broke. Employees didn't even see happy to be there or want to take me order. I hope they get this fixed soon"}
{"text":"this place has my favorite soft drink Diet Mountain Dew so come one come all for some good roast beef"}
{"text":"Roast Beef Sandwich on King's Hawaiian Roll with swiss cheese and pickles is delicious.  However, it will run you $6.50 for a fast food sandwich.

Jr. Chicken sandwich is a hit with my daughter.

Fries & curly fries are not good."}
{"text":"It's an Arby's like any other Arby's...    staff's always been friendly and food's always been a good value.       The facility seems clean,  even if the interior's a bit dated - I don't go to a quick serve restaurant to be wowed by the ambiance.  

I'm giving them 4 stars because as Arby's go,  they're fine."}
{"text":"I only went through the drive thru earlier today, but, everything I could see was clean and Melissa was manning the window, great smile, super friendly.  I was able to see two two of the other employees and they all seemed to work well together being friendly AND efficient, wasn't even going to check in until I had such a great experience."}
{"text":"The service here is decent. The food is blah. I went here because I was starving. I don't think I will go back for anything but the Jamocha shake."}
{"text":"This location is bad!  Gyros came out cold , the BBQ beef brisket was nothing like the picture.  Just globs of brown sugar on the bacon and looked like it was smashed and bbq sauce didn't look right (as if they spit in my sandwich).  An overall disgusting experience!!"}
{"text":"It had been a lot of years and I was thinking, you know, some questionable cow and fake horseradish sauce might just hit the spot.

Their signature roast beef sandwitch comes in 3 sizes: small, medium, and something approaching the size of your head. 

I think my meal had enough salt in it to pay a Roman legion with, but since the legions today are paid in Federal Reserve fiat greenbacks, the salt goes to Arby's. Maybe I'll try it again after I time travel into the future a few years."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday, not normally a busy day but for some reason they were packed. 

The shift manager must not have been prepared because he was very unfriendly and he slammed the cash drawer shut after completing our order. The food was good but something tells me that is was because of it being busy so it was fresh."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the Hell that stuff is that they try to pass off as \"roast beef\" ... but Damn I LOVE that crap!  Yummy.

But seriously ... what the Hell is that meat mulch?"}
{"text":"Ordered the angus beef sandwich. I got home, took a bite, opened the sandwich, it was cold, the meat was discolored and the cheese was slick and wet. I vomited and was so sick for about 10 hours. The health department obviously doesn't know this place exists but they will!! Never again"}
{"text":"The drive-through was quick and the representative was professional. The food order came out right so high five, five stars."}
{"text":"This was a return trip to Arby's.  This time we ordered potato wedges along with their roast beef sliders.  The roast beef sliders were delicious.  However, the potato wedges were awful.  They tasted like fish!

There was no doubt they used the oil to cook the potatoes in that they use to cook their fish in and the oil hadn't been changed in a while.  No way could we eat the potato wedges.  They were taken back to the cashier.  No offer of replacement but we wouldn't have wanted anything else deep fried either.

Next time we order from Arby's we'll ask if it's cooked with fish."}
{"text":"I always come to this location and normally don't have any problems with the food at all. But tonight as i went through the drive thru about 10:32 pm put in my order to come home to find out it was all wrong and to top it all off it was cold and the curly fries where cold and Stell. I would have gone back to have them fix it but they closed.  I hope by putting this out here will make them make sure the put out the right order no matter what time it is."}
{"text":"This location is always on point. I live in a condo complex one street over and come here once or twice a month, and they're always fast w/ my order and always have it correct, whether I'm ordering for just myself or myself and 3 others. Today was no exception - Zach was fantastically fast and accurate with the order taking. He read it back to me perfectly and when I received the order, everything was right. He got me a drink holder for my 4+1 drinks and put each order into individual bags which made giving them to their designated recipients very very easy. One of the recipients of this order has never had Arby's, but since I'm writing this in the Arby's parking lot before taking the food home, I can't attest to if she'll like it as much as I do. Wouldn't eat it every day, but want to. Hehe. Mmm Jalape√±o cheddar bites w/ bronco berry sauce is bae."}
{"text":"Why am I seduced by fast food sometimes? Is it because I work in a full service restaurant and can eat wonderful food anytime I want? Or because I crave something processed that's laden in grease and riddled with sodium? Or is it because my bf texts me and says hey, pick up arby's? I order the number five for bf and see a delicious looking sandwich staring at me. I mean what a photo! Who took this photo? Annie Leibovitz? It's perfect looking. Turkey and Swiss on some fresh looking bread with plump tomatoes and crisp lettuce. How bad can it be? Well. Hmmm. So bad. You spit it out in a napkin and scrape your tongue with a pumice stone. Gargle with Listerine and vow to the heavens to limit your fast food to In N Out and the Philadelphia Sandwich Company. Arby's Shmarby's. Gross."}
{"text":"Won't be eating here again , watched the cook handling food without gloves .
Didn't offer a refund when I pointed this out . Awefull service and not to clean ."}
{"text":"It's an Arbys.  The food is good, the prices are fair, and the employees are competent and friendly.

What really sticks out at this Arbys is the faded, mid 1980's decor and the over squishy booth cushions that threaten to suck you, butt first, into the lower bowels of the booth's framework!!

For crying out loud, I recently sat at a booth and sank down so low I looked like a 3 year old, barely able to see over the tabletop, and the next booth wasn't any better.  O_0  Fix that crap, STAT!"}
