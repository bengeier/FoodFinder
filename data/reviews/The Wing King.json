{"text":"I'm start out by giving you guys 3 stars. You do serve good food. I must admit it takes entirely too long to serve it. Y'all need to be fast and push them orders out. People don't want to wait in line for 30 to 45 minutes just to get 6 pieces of chicken. You need a menu, you can't tell people to go on Facebook to get the menu. A menu at the front is always a plus. If you have a cashier working at the front and they don't no the menu they need to learn it. And you guys really need to specify what come with french fries and what doesn't. I love supporting black owned businesses but y'all got to get it together. Or this place not going to last im sorry. One more thing that cash register dirty y'all need to wipe the cash register off that whole counter need to be wiped off I noticed that when I was in there the other day once again you are a good business it's just that you gotta push that food."}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying most people enjoy good chicken me being one of those people. This is like the 3rd time I have tried this restaurant and it's always an issue. I am down with giving people chances but to mess up on every chance that's been given is a major issue.   1st time I was there it was a coupon that could be used the cashier told me I could not use it, I told him i didn't understand why he said he don't have time to explain it. I was puzzled. I went ahead and spent less money. Said I was gonna pay with a debit card, he went on to tell me the machine was down. This was a major inconvience. The fact woodmans had no few at their atm was the only reason I didn't go off.   2nd time I placed an order over the phone. My son wanted the chicken and cheese fries, You have to place a completely different order for cheese fries instead Of them charging an upcharge. After picking up the order the chicken was fine but the cheese fries were disrespectful. They were old and had shredded cheese melted on them.  I could have made those at home.  Bottom line they need to do better, I'm gonna make my own chicken at this point unless something BETTER comes along."}
{"text":"I stop by a couple days ago and just have a couple comments. When I got there I asked how long it would take for my order and they told me about 20-25 minutes. So I had a little grocery shopping to do at Woodman's so I went there and when I came back it was ready. That would be my suggestion for anyone who wants anything like the chicken or the wings anything that has to be fried. I don't know about the sandwiches I can't imagine that they would take as long but I would suggest calling ahead first and place your order or place your order and then going and running a quick errand.  The chicken was delicious! It tasted like it came out of my own kitchen, definitely that homemade taste! I have no complaints about it whatsoever. I would however say that they need to work on the fried gizzards! They just didn't even look like gizzards. The taste of them was so so.  One suggestion I like to make which may be kind of way out there but there is a chain of chicken restaurants out of the Chicago area call Brown Fried Chicken. Their food is so delicious and they are always looking for someone to franchise and I would love to have one here in Madison! I would encourage them to look into that, even though their chicken is good but Brown's gizzards are the bomb! So maybe someone wants to think about that. Otherwise the service was friendly and I have no complaints about the amount of time because I did ask when I placed my order and each order is made to order. So unlike Kentucky Fried Chicken or Popeyes chicken or any place else where they just sit there on your heat lamp basically this is made to order so it's going to take a little bit longer just be prepared!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible 45 minute wait for 18 wing in twenty five minutes I got 14 wings then  had to wait another twenty minutes for four more wings then went home fries are cold service horrible they do not inform you of daily deals open when they feel like it.."}
{"text":"I don't know about the other reviews, but the chicken was great, seasoned perfectly and very crispy! Their homemade BBQ sauce is finger lickin' good. The inside of the restaurant is not typical, to say the least. But the two ladies in the front are hilarious though. Highly recommend, I have been back twice."}
{"text":"My fianc√©'s friend has told him that this place serves really good chicken. We got there and we were told that the wait was about 45 minutes (for total of 12 wings and fries). The cashier also asked if I wanted BBQ sauce and I said yes. I guess they charged for a small container of sauce (I don't remember how much). Then, another customer asked for 10-piece meal after us. He waited a while, too, but guess what? His food came out before ours.  When we got our food, it was hot and the chicken was crispy. But the flavor? Eh. The BBQ sauce tasted like any other regular BBQ sauce from the grocery store. Oh and there was a piece of white bread under our fries. I guess it was to soak up all the fat?"}
{"text":"So I get that this place just opened, but there were some things that were so inexcusable I just have to give this 1 star. First of all, the order counter did not even have a cash register. All financial transactions were cash only (which is fine, lots of places do it), but the cash register was in fact, a roll of cash in the cashier's back pocket.   The customer service was sketchy at best. After walking in and hanging out at the ordering counter for 5 minutes (the menus, by the way, are those flyer-looking handouts sitting on the counter), a lost-looking dude wanders up to the counter and just looks at us. My friend tells him what she wants (10 piece wing bucket) and he has to look that up on the menu to see how much it is (or if they serve it, I guess?)   Bonus: there's no tax since everything is kind of under the table? Basically the prices are rounded up to the nearest dollar (everything ends in .99). So he takes her money, makes change from the roll of bills in his pocket, and then wanders off to the back without taking my order. I wait at the counter for another 5 minutes and a couple comes in behind me. At this, the dude gravitates back to the counter again.   The couple asks if they can place an order for 30 wings and pay with card. Dude gestures to the lack of any sort of equipment to process plastic transactions, and the couple says they'll hit the ATM and be back. At this time, I am finally able to get my order in for the 1/2 dark chicken basket and dude has to consult the menu again. I pay him, and he wanders off to the back again, presumably to make the food. We sit there for the next 40 minutes as people come in sporadically and order to-go, and everyone that came after us were served before we got our food  (yes, even 30 wings to-go lady who did not have cash). Dude doesn't say anything to us like Oh your food will be ready soon or anything. I should note that I saw him wearing plastic gloves at one point so I think at least they were observing the health code.  He does pop out to ask us if we wanted hot sauce on the wings. We were confused because when you say wings and then offer 4 different choices of sauce, the assumption is that the wings are the buffalo style wings commonly served at bars. But whatever, we tell him we want hot sauce on the wings. When the food does finally arrive my 1/2 dark chicken basket is 4 pieces of fried chicken thighs with a handful of fries, and one piece of wonder bread. My friend's order (some how wrapped up to-go, even though we both said we were dining in) consisted of ten WHOLE (literally the entire chicken wing) fried chicken wings, split up into two baskets, fries, the tiniest container of cole slaw, and wonder bread (yes, that's the kind of bread you get with your meal, not like a dinner roll or anything). We were joking that they probably got a lot of their ingredients from Woodman's.   So the food itself was not great either. The fried chicken (and wings) were sorely in lack of seasoning. I'm guessing they did not add salt or pepper at all to either the chicken or the batter. They did put out an entire can of Morton's salt (yeah, not in a salt shaker) for customers. So the chicken was not marinated at all and the batter had literally no seasonings in it. The chicken also tasted like it was fried a hair too long, as the top layer of meat was stringy and tough to chew. The wings were a disappointment as well, especially as we were expecting buffalo style wings. Instead, we received aforementioned fried whole wings with a container of Frank's Red Hot on the side. The fries were equally as terrible; I don't think they got any seasoning either and probably did not spend the right amount of time in the fryer. We were unable to finish half of the wings, and they eventually ended up in the trash.  Facilities: aside from the bare order counter mentioned before, there were maybe 4 or 5 booths for dine in customers. Those were fairly clean when we got there, but it seems like most people get their food to-go. Also we never saw anyone wiping down the tables, so take from that what you will. There was no decorations on the wall, and also no water dispenser (so if you want water you'll probably have to pay for bottled). The bathrooms were laughably poor. It's one of those one-stall unisex bathrooms, but there was no toilet paper, no trash can, and no paper towel dispenser. Instead, there is a roll of paper towels sitting on the sink. At least there's hand soap? And the lights work?  TLDR: They were obviously not ready to open, and even their food needs work. Hard pass."}
{"text":"The service is spotty at best, I stood at the counter for quite some time before anyone came out. It smelled amazing so I was very excited for my order of 6 wings. Beware, they are tiny whole wings, not a single thick drum stick. You might like the wings if you prefer more breading than meat but it isn't for me. The sauce tasted just like Frank's but there wasn't enough to really tell."}
