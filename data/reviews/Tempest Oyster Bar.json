{"text":"We tried Tempest for brunch and while the food was good, the service was abysmal.  My partner works in the service industry and we are usually very forgiving of stressed staff.  But Tempest was not even busy!  There were maybe ten tables in the entire restaurant-- dining room, bar, and cocktail lounge.  We waited nearly 20 minutes for our order to be taken, and then another 20 before the pot of tea we ordered arrived.  My partner had somewhere to be an hour and a half after we arrived-- we figured this would be plenty of time for brunch.  An hour into our visit, the waiter and host offered a few apologies for the wait and the server once told us it would be just a few more minutes.  Twenty minutes later, my partner had to go.  He asked for his food in a to-go container and I stayed behind to wait for it.  Fifteen minutes later, the food arrives. (95 minutes after we set foot in the restaurant!)  I had ordered an omelet and my partner a salad.  The server brought the food, the host brought the to-go containers and set them on the table.  One meal was comped and I immediately handed over cash to pay.  I sat and ate my omelet, packed up my partner's food, and my change never arrived.  Granted, it was less than $1 in change, but after all the waiting, that should have been speedy.  No waiters were in sight  to ask after it so I left.  The food was fine, but we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"We love going to Tempest in the summer and sitting outside during their happy hour.  This has to be one of the best happy hours in Madison, yet I'm always surprised how few people are there.  The oysters are pretty good, although sometimes not shucked properly.  We once tried the burger and it was surprisingly excellent for a seafood restaurant.  The servers are always fabulous.  Will return!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I was with someone who didn't like raw or chilled seafood. So I ordered a cooked dish with her -- it was solidly good. But then I came back with my husband and got the seafood tower, which is what I had really wanted. We shared 3 tiers and it was full-on great! It transported me back to Le Coupole in Paris where I first tasted this treat. Absolutely light, refreshing and so tasty. So many restaurants are in a race to see who can out-pork-fat, out-deep-fry, out-charcuterie, out-cheese-curd each other -- I don't want to eat that way every time I go out! THIS is what I want!"}
{"text":"We came here tonight for restaurant week and it was honestly one of the best meals I have ever had! The lobster bisque, scallops, steak and lobster, and desserts were all phenomenal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Tempest ever since it opened. Great atmosphere, decor, great food and excellent cocktails. Not fussy or pretentious--just solidly good in every respect. This past week we were fortunate to host a private party here and the experience exceeded every one of our expectations.  The food and drink were outstanding (one of our well-traveled guests said it was the best meal he'd ever had at a \"catered\" event). The staff was efficient, professional, and friendly. They added to the atmosphere by seeming to enjoy themselves even as they worked very hard to make our party come together.We wanted an event that was fun, festive and elegant and Tempest delivered all of those things--and more. There are a lot of great restaurants in Madison, but Tempest will now always be at the top of our list."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic , had the best meal I've had in a long time. All aspects were great , ordered Smokestack appetizer , nightly special of venison and lobster tail and key lime pie for dessert and all were spectacular. Tried other entrees the rest of table ordered and they were equally great. Great atmosphere as well.   Check this place out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We visited Tempest on a quiet Sunday evening.  The redecorating from the previous warm tones of Magnus to the cool, watery blue interior is very attractive and they have opened up an interior wall that had blocked off a small, separate room in the previous incarnation.  Very well done.  Our waiter seemed to have a heck of a time keeping straight what order went to which diner even though we were his only table and there were only four of us.  Yes, you're good-looking, son, but at some point you are going to have to learn a skill or two.  The shrimp in the shrimp cocktail were huge and perfectly cooked.  Not much heat evident from the horseradish in the shrimp sauce, even after stirring.  The Fruits de Mer suffered from overly heavy breading.  I had the fish and corn chowder, which was good but not exceptional, and the lobster roll.  I liked the lobster roll a lot and didn't mind that it did not mirror every other lobster roll I had ever had.  My husband had the skirt steak, which was overly salty.  Our friends had the whitefish, which was excellent.  We tried two desserts, a custard and a chocolate-caramel tart, both of which were outstanding.  Overall I felt Tempest would have difficulty standing out in a crowded Madison restaurant market.  There are too many great places to go here to use up limited time and money on a place that's not trying that hard."}
{"text":"Called on a Saturday afternoon and the only reservation for that night was 5PM.  We took it and we were so happy we did.  The place has a great vide - clean, modern with a hint of mid century.  Nicole our server was so friendly and explained the menu.  We had lobster bisque and the chilled tall tower.  The presentation was beautiful and the seafood fresh.  The bar has great signature cocktails.  We will return when we are back in Madison."}
{"text":"Great service and food... Tried the tower to start which is a sampling of oysters, clams and shrimp. The waitress was great with giving us first timers the lowdown on oysters. For main course my companion had the blue marlin... She said she really like the fish and the pesto crust but felt the sauce was a bit \"limey\" for her. I had a special which was a soft shell crab, morels and ramps...  Delicious!! We did get a side of scalloped potatoes but really didn't need them, barely at them.  Want to go back to try the fish fry..."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time. Great atmosphere, live music and delicious food."}
{"text":"The food is poorly prepared.  The menu is unappealing.  The service was extremely unfortunate.  The beer menu is disappointing.   My guest and I left, vowing to not return.  Altogether an entirely regrettable experience.  I strongly recommend avoiding this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for my 30th birthday and to say it was disappointing is an understatement. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Saturday. There was live music advertised.   Our reservation wasn't ready when we arrived  (on time). We were told to wait in the bar, which was already packed. Twenty minutes later we were seated in a cramped corner next to a window staring at a brick wall in an alley.   The service was TERRIBLE! I ordered an appetizer for my dinner and somehow my husbands entree came out before mine. The server dropped it off anyway. The host/manager asked jokingly if another entree was coming. We pointed out that we were still waiting for mine and he laughed and walked off never to be seen again. We hoped he was checking on it but apparently not. My husband finished his meal and we were waiting another five minutes to get my entree, an appetizer mind you. The host came back and asked if we were enjoying the \"third course\" as he seemed to have forgot the blunder. No one even apologized! Not to mention the Live music we came for never happened!  For the $160 spent for just the two of us I expect WAY better service a day LEAST an apology for the disaster."}
{"text":"So very good! We started with the shrimp cocktail (your basic), oysters rockefeller (good) and several kinds of raw oysters (fresh and good). For our main courses we had the halibut, blue marlin, whitefish, and a seafood cassolet that was a special. All the entrees were very good. The brussel sprout side dish was fantastic, the hashbrowns were meh. Our waiter went out of his way to make the meal wonderful. First he was very kind and patient with our 12 yo son, going thru several of the dishes to help him find one that would suit his taste. He ended up having the whitefish and loved it. Secondly, he call our other son a cab at our request and let us know when it arrived to take him back to his dorm. Very nice service. The only drawback is that it was a little to dark in the dining room.  Overall very nice. We will be back."}
{"text":"Tempest is the best restaurant in Madison, period. The oysters are super fresh, the Friday fish fry is crispy and light and moist inside, the steaks are broiled perfectly, the smoked fish stack is sublime, the gulf shrimp are the best we've had outside the gulf, the cocktails are well-balanced and delicious, the service is prompt and friendly, and the happy hour deals cannot be resisted."}
{"text":"The people who work there are absolutely ridiculously rude. I was appalled by the way that they spoke to customers. I have been here numerous times to sit at the bar for happy hour, and tonight made me never EVER want to come again. Never would suggest for anyone to come here."}
{"text":"Happy hour is where it's at! And the food is delish! A great spot in Madison if you're looking for sea food."}
{"text":"We went to Tempest during winter restaurant week.   There were so many choices but my husband was all over the blue marlin on the menu.  After a very wintery walk...it was -5 degrees that night, the entrance was warm and inviting.  We were a little confused walking into the bar/waiting area.  We didn't realize that the actual bar the past the drapes.  I don't think that's the Tempest's fault but I was intimidated.  That's my own thing.  We thought the reception area was too small and crowded.  However, we were seated quickly and in the main dining area. The ambiance was warm and stale.    We were served quickly and the food was delightful.  The she crab soup was delicious but sweet.  My salmon was perfect and the blue Merlin was seared to perfection.    You know, there are so many restaurants in Madison.  Tempest is an oyster bar which is foolish is Wisconsin.  However, there was a couple eating a stack of oysters and it look delicious.  And they looked happy.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we were pretty excited about trying it. Started off with some sparkling wine and the shrimp cocktail (the shrimp was great and the sauce was good too). Unfortunately there was about a 45 minute wait in between our appetizer and main course, which was a little crazy since it was a a quiet Tuesday night with not too  many people around. I got the Halibut and my lady got the Blue Marlin. My hailbut was a bit overcooked (which was a little crazy for $23) but  the Marlin was good, more like a tuna almost. I mentioned the overcooked Hailbut to the important looking lady when she passed by us and asked how things were, so she gave us a dessert on the house. We got the apple crisp, which was warm and delicious. Some missteps, but I'm willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Went there for a drink and app for anniversary.  Ambiance is really good. Drinks were great.  Food was horrid.  Had the fruit de mer and was disappointed enough to rate at a 2 instead of 4.  Everything was deep fried with a non-flavorful thin coating. All the items tastes like grease and not seafood.  The calamari was like rubber and most of the rings were inedible.  Other patrons around us had the oysters who he's looked fresh and what the restaurant is known for.  Can't rate it on what we didn't have how ever.  Bar tender was not overly friendly either."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere, super slow food service!  its raw, what the hell is taking 30 mins after the hot entrees arrive, when its not even busy?  we can make better at home, so the service and experience was important, and this fell short for us.  i called the manager to let him know, he did appologize, but offered nothing to keep a customer."}
{"text":"Fish cakes are good. Lobster roll was good. Great fancy bloody mary. Oysters are not any better than other places in Madison which isn't saying much. What I mean by this is that both times I tried the oysters here they were small, deflated and had at least 1-2 per dozen that were frankly unpleasant to eat. I love oyster shots but the oyster in the one I got did not taste fresh. Menu has nice variety. The bar and dining room are loud. I wish they would have considered acoustics on the re-design. When the place is crowded conversation is nearly impossible. I would never choose to go to this place over Osteria Popavero next door which always has outstanding seafood."}
{"text":"Oysters and scallops good. Service slow. Decent variety of wine, tap beer, and drinks. The \"keelhauler\" was nice and strong."}
{"text":"Great oysters, fun scene, above average service; a bit over-priced for what it is.  Also, I wasn't blown away by the drinks, but they did have great variety.  overall a good time."}
{"text":"My mistake for ordering a dozen oysters in Wisconsin.  I got the #2 tower and the shrimp were the best part.  The crab legs were not very succulent and almost seemed like they had been frozen for too long; the meat was a little mushy.  The oysters seemed OK going down, but I had terrible food poisoning later that night as my body rid itself of all of them.  I love seafood so I will probably try it again, but next time I'll stay away from the oysters.  Two stars because it has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went for the happy hour, stayed for the food and amazing service. This place is wonderful. The drinks are suburb and the food, is out of this world. Oyster selection is huge, starter menu is just as good and our special we ordered was just outstanding."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here last Saturday. While we enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere, it is always hard to make excellent seafood in the midwest. Tempest does well to bring in a lot of great shellfish and the oysters were quite good. We really liked the new look of the place and the bar area but it was quite noisy."}
{"text":"We were at the restaurant tonight for the restaurant week menu. The food and service were good. But they definitely need a new receptionist. He was rude and unprofessional, leaving people a very unpleasant impression about the restaurant."}
{"text":"After an incredible dinner at Tempest Oyster Bar, I finally have a favorite restaurant in Madison. This was the best fish and seafood meal we have had in years. We started with cocktail and the mussels, followed by salads ( the arugula and caesar) then had the tuna and flounder. This is the place for fresh and yummy food. A great basket of crusty bread and some vegetables were set on the table as soon as out drinks arrived. A nice touch that so many restaurants have forgotten. Our waiter was wonderful. The Friday night fish fry looked yummy as well. What a treasure. Our new go to place in Madison for friendly service and perfect food!"}
{"text":"I decided to take my mom, visiting from DC, to Tempest for happy hour. It was a great choice! We sat at the bar for drinks and apps. I had an Ale Asylum brew (always a good choice), while my mom had a well-made martini. We made a meal out of the small plates: oysters, shrimp and the sublime smokestack. All the seafood was fresh, the oysters were excellent, shrimp were huge and well-prepared, and that smokestack was to die for!   The place was pretty quiet on a Monday evening. Talked to the manager, who was very friendly and interested in our input.   I look forward to going back! May even drag my husband in, now that I know they have meat dishes, too."}
{"text":"Amazing Food!  mussels, bucatini and shrip & grits -- all superb!!! flavorful and fresh!  the waiter was super nice too -- we walked in late on sunday night and did not feel rushed at all.  This place is a gem!  PS.  They serve Madison Sourdough Co. bread -- it is by far one of the best breads i've had!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour oysters- a wide selection and very fresh. Definitely the best I've had in Madison. Yum! The service has always been good, and the ambiance is very nice."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Tempest on two occasions. The first visit was at 10pm and we sat in the bar area.  It was slow in the bar and, although it was loud, service was good and the food was also very good.  Then, I visited last week for a dinner reservation at 8 pm.  We arrived a bit early and the wait staff told us our table would be a few minutes.  We asked if we could it in the bar until our table was ready. We specifically asked if they would let us know when our table was ready. The bar staff was helpful with our drinks.  At 8:30 we hadn't been seated and we asked about our table status.  The waiters we had seen go by were completely preoccupied with griping. The front desk attendant said, \"Oh, we didn't realize you still wanted a table.\"  We ended up with a table close to 9 pm but then waited another 15 minutes until a waiter finally acknowledged us.  We ended up leaving at 9:15 without having dinner because we needed to get home to our children.  The waitstaff was completely unapologetic.  The moral of the the story is, if you go to Tempest, stick to the bar or a time when they are not busy because when they are full beyond half capacity, they lose the ability to keep track of their customers.  The food is good, but not good enough to compensate for the ambivalent wait staff, especially with Ocean Grill so close by"}
{"text":"Loved it, nice oyster selection present staff and good food. One suggestion bread needs to be served warm."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife and a friend.  Wonderful building, well maintained.  I can't say enough good things about the staff.  Friendly, courteous.  and skilled.  Our waitress was awesome, taking care of our every need.  The problem with this place is that the food is very so-so, especially for the price. Really disappointing considering the good reviews on Yelp. The special cocktails for the most part were terrible, especially the Bosun's Whistle.  That being said the bloody mary with the dill vodka was good. . Every oyster had shards of shell in it, not unusual for a place so far away from the sea.  For the money, there are better places to go in Madison.  Too bad, the staff and building are wonderful."}
{"text":"I was at  Tempest on a Wednesday night with family. We were offered a seat in the bar for happy hour (since the specials don't apply in the dinning area) but passed it up because we wanted to enjoy a laid back seafood dinner in a more spacious seating area.   My first complaint applies to the service. Every staff member we encountered seemed bored with their job and our waitress especially seemed like her mind was always elsewhere. She forgot drinks and side dishes but did not take responsibility for the errors. She would claim that we actually forgot to order that side of fries (flipping through her notepad to check) until someone else had to speak up and vouch that they had heard the potato request. A smile was hard to come by to say the least about the staff.   My food was great, I had the yellowfin tuna steak. I had never had tuna steak before, so I was very nervous. It was crusted and delicious, I even ate the whole thing! The side dishes were fine, but spendy for one portion. My mother in-law also enjoyed her fish--trout, I believe.   The men, however, were disappointed in their dishes. The Blue Marlin was EXTREMELY tough and the steak had nothing special going on. The flavor and consistency were completely forgettable. The Brussels sprout side came out black and crusty. We tried to eat them but they tasted like they had fallen into a campfire pit, so my boyfriend tried to point it out to our robot of a waitress who responded, \"oh really? They taste burnt? *(yeah... they are black and don't resemble a vegetable in the slightest)* I guess... I can have the cook start you a new dish...?\" Sure. thanks. The new dish (of course) came out after we were all finished eating which she apparently didn't notice, or decided not to comment on. She just dropped of the new bowl and walked away without clearing any of our empty dishes. No offer to take the $6 side dish off the bill. In my years as a server... well nevermind, I think you know what I'm getting at.   We won't be back. I was actually surprised to see all the ultra positive reviews on here. Sounds like happy hour is the way to go at this place. I do appreciate that I had a good first experience with tuna steak! But Tempest is not worth the time, money, or attitudes from the employees. Adios."}
{"text":"YUM. Very good oysters. Recommend Rockefeller, fried, blue point raw and kamamuto raw. Would also recommend Windjammer. Will be back next weekend!"}
{"text":"Drank and dined in the bar only: Best warm lobster roll in Madison. I've tried the mussels, burger & chips, and cocktails. All are great. The bartender took great care to prepare the drinks and was very friendly to me and my wife. I highly recommend this place for seafood and drinks."}
{"text":"I was at Tempest with a group of friends the other night. We had a big meal -- oysters, two rounds of group appetizers, and entrees, with drinks. All and all it was a pretty lovely experience.   Oysters were great and tasted fresh and the steamed mussels were probably the best I've had in Madison. The seafood chowder was tasty. The mixed drinks were by in large tasty; I had a 'Windjammer' (pretty good) and my gf had a 'Tokyo Schooner' which was excellent. The service was friendly and knew the menu pretty well considering it changes daily.   I had the halibut for my main dish. The fish itself was disappointing -- it had been frozen so the kitchen insisted on cooking it well done, which gave it a tough texture and not much flavor. The vegetables with it, particularly the beets, were excellent.  Highlight of the night was the brussel sprouts -- they were amazing. With the caramelized onions, they almost tasted like candy.  I'll be going back, though mostly for their excellent veggies."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 4 for the service, though the food was definitely a 5.  We dined on a Friday night, and were seated immediately for our reservation.  We started with cocktails which were fantastic.  Our starter was a scallop dish--one of the BEST cooked scallops I've ever had!  My entree was absolutely to die for...the shrimp/scallops/grits dish.  I would have licked my plate if I could have!  My husband's dish was the tuna, which was cooked to perfection and a very clean dish overall.    At this point in the meal, our server ditched us for a table of 8.  It was obvious that he was more interested in their larger tip.  We were asked if we wanted dessert, and we said we'd think about it....and we didn't see him again for at least 15 minutes.  Thankfully, he redeemed himself in quickly settling our bill so that we could head out.  Would definitely go again, for the seafood.  Delish!"}
{"text":"Tempest Oyster Bar is a great sea food local restaurant here in Madison Wi! Let's start of with a great Atmosphere in the restaurant! The visual side of the restaurant was really cool! The Service is really good and attentive they gave us many recommendations for Oysters! The food is spectacular the Oysters are great and the Fish fry is supper good also the surf and turf! I really recommend for you to go to Tempest Oyster bar!"}
{"text":"I would probably give it 3.5 stars, first off.  The decor is amazing and cool.  Love the bar.  It's fantastic.  The reason for the downgrade, is that I found the food to be just ok.  My entree, the venison chop, was superb.  However, the 5 other dishes at our table, all seafood, were just ok.  I think the price paid for the entree justifies an exemplary meal, and it just wasn't there, in my opinion.   And as someone else mentioned, it is LOUD.  The dining room was 1/2 full on the thursday night we were there and it was like a jet engine in there."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the previous review (1/23/2017).  We also booked during Restaurant Week and felt the experience was top shelf from beginning to end: 1. We loved the menu appearing on the Restaurant Week website.  So many interesting entres to choose from that were far different than almost any other restaurant participating.  We have visited Tempest twice before with excellent outcomes, so we booked. 2.  The food was amazing.  My partner had the fried oysters w/seaweed slaw.  Spectacular, especially the slaw.  I had the lobster bisque w/flying fish roe.  Similarly tasty. 3. The entres came and were greatly satisfying.  The Marlin had a nice lime aioli.  The pasta had a large portion of different shellfish that were quite delicious.   4.  Great selections from the desserts offered this week.  It was really hard to choose, and when ours arrived, they were great! 5.  The only glitch was there was no decaf. to order with dessert, but we had enough wine & water to be satisfied. 6.  The serving staff & the hosts were beyond professional.  This group worked together like a well-oiled machine.  Or maybe a well-tuned instrument.    A huge thanks to everyone who made this experience a bright spot in the middle of an otherwise dreary week in winter.  WE WILL RETURN!"}
{"text":"Not inexpensive. But good seafood typically isn't.  The oysters were excellent!  Drinks were unique and well made (but how could you run out of dill vodka on a Saturday evening (early)?). The food overall was very very good.  The service started out good but then completely broke down between the oysters and the salad course.  Took FOREVER to get food out of the kitchen after the oysters. Not sure what happened there.  But, I am willing to forgive if a one time glitch. The food and drinks more than made up for it. Terrific Caesar salad crispy cold and perfectly dressed.  Warm lobster roll was delish and bountiful.  Halibut main was very unique and perfectly cooked (not largest portion i've seen, but very very good)."}
{"text":"I just love this place! My husband and I enjoy eating here in the summer on their patio, it's a calm, romantic environment. Both times we went we ended up getting the Towers. Once with the snow crab and another time with the lobster. I absolutely love them, my husband thinks it's too much oysters (I didn't even know that possible).   We recently found out they  The reason I give only 4 stars is because of the Smoke Stack. We read such great reviews about the smoke stack and we were both really looking forward to it. We both thought it tasted like the fish meat was from a can, mixed with horse radish sauce. Perhaps the consistency? Not sure. But overall, I still absolutely love this place and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"We had no reservations and they fit us in.  The oysters were fantastic as well as the halibut."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks and atmosphere :) They have the best caesar salad and mussels!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Tempest. As a native New Englander, I miss seafood. Their fruits de mer is a delicious pile of fried seafood with shrimp, scallops, clams and other fried morsels. This is my favorite thing on the menu BC if I have three cocktails I can pretend I am back home.  Do not, under any circumstances, order the lobster roll. Just don't do it."}
{"text":"I love this place....went here for my husbands b-day and was the perfect date night spot before a show at the majestic. Fresh and delicious oysters, salmon, crab...everything we tried was spot on."}
{"text":"I've dined at Tempest on many occasions. I give it 4.5 stars (and am rounding up to 5) for the following reasons:  Oysters, from both coasts, fresh (probably) daily (menu changes daily).  Happy hour is an absolute steal. Lets you try a variety of oysters/apps.  Beautiful bar with very creative house cocktails. Live music (most?) Friday and Saturday nights.  The tuna is phenomenal. Your server will tell you it is sushi grade, which means absolutely nothing, but order it rare and you'll see what they're trying to say.  They have massive Alaskan King Crab legs. For special occasions.  It is rather loud and it can take a rather long time, but the quality of the seafood is unsurpassed (for Wisconsin). I especially recommend the outdoor patio during warmer months."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at Tempest during Restaurant Week in January. It was, hands down, the best restaurant we visited that week. We shared the smoke stack and the shrimp and grits (which also included scallops and pork belly). The food was AMAZING, the service was excellent.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food here was good.  Beautifully presented and very tasty.  I got the venison chop with butter broiled oysters ($32) and a side of roasted parsnips.  The chop was served bloody/cool in the middle.  Not a huge issue for me but I could see how others might want to be warned.  It was a little tough to eat (two bones + rare/chewy meat) but the flavor was good. One thing I'll say is that the parsnips, while good, were $5 and not quite as substantial as I'd expect- I understand that at restaurants like this entrees usually come strictly a la carte, and to augment that one should order sides. But there was probably less than half a cup of sliced parsnips, simply roasted with minimal seasoning (if any) in my side.  Our table of four was going to share them but decided not to upon seeing the portion. I would suggest that Tempest take a page from Tornado and include a salad or soup with its entrees.  After all, the prices are comparable.  The appetizers of Fruits De Mer and Crab Cocktail (both $14) were ample and delicious.  Same with the bread basket.  My glass of red wine was sooooo good.  And well-priced.  There were a few issues: our server was swamped and stressed.  We felt really sorry for her because although she was obviously adept, the place itself was also obviously understaffed for a busy Saturday.  Speaking of which- they ran out of two of our entree picks but she did not tell us until she brought our appetizers (about 20 min after we ordered).  When my friends were perusing the menu to reorder, we found out that they were out of a couple other entrees as well.  Not a huge deal, but the wonderfully eclectic menu became pretty limited after we heard the whole rundown of what was off the table.   Finally, the place was nearly unbearably loud.  I usually like the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant.  This was pure insanity.  I'm not exaggerating- I was hoarse when we left, and my ears were aching the way they do if I endure a punk rock or metal show in a tiny club sans earplugs.  It was a little shocking.  My friends were annoyed, since we had made reservations at this swanky place to catch up and celebrate and we ended up yelling at one another and struggling to hear.  Fabric or wood somewhere in the dining room might help?  The overhaul of the old Magnus is breathtaking, especially the bar. The place is beautiful and I think it's a great addition to the downtown scene.  I hope they work out the kinks and I'll be back regardless- the food's just that tempting."}
{"text":"We came for NYEs.  The oysters were fresh and tasty. The bartender even created a special oyster shooter at our request, delish!  Wait staff was attentive and professional. Scallop appetizer also very nice, cooked well with crisp apples and salty bacon.  Sturgeon was a small portion, still tasty with the fried egg and caviar, but not something to return for.  8 oz Tenderloin reminiscent of Tornado Room. Fried shrimp left little to be desired- overfried with cornstarch batter. Overall, appetizers and oysters are the stars of the menu. Beer selection adequate, and we found cocktails to be creative and nice.  We've not found fresher oysters in town. Happy to find a place like this in Madison!"}
{"text":"Romantic and delicious! The pear upside down cake for my birthday was divine :)  Food is wonderful and the service was great. I loved sitting in the bar area once when we came in for cocktails they had a small jazz/big band quartet playing that was fun to listen to."}
{"text":"Great seafood incredible location nice design to Decore. Not so good with customer service or scheduling reservations timeliness.."}
{"text":"The happy hour is a great deal! Love the vibe of this place it has a true nautical feel. Martinis are spot on. It's a must stop if you stay in Madison."}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot, specifically the bar area. I have never eaten in the dining room, thats how much we enjoy the bar area. Always start with the fruits del mer, then move on to the day's oyster menu, finish off with something heavier like the lobster roll. Never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing time!  Great wait staff and very nice ambience.  Had an amazing time, there was a live guitarist the evening I went.  Food was amazing had the one level oyster platter plus the smoked sampler.  The smoked sampler was amazing, salty smoked and fresh fish and crab.  Had the blue marlin for entree which was excellent the lamb chops too were great!  Overall great food great job will be back!"}
{"text":"If I could give tbis place zero stars I would. The whole place stinks of dead fish and arrogance. We were not dressed as fancy as the staff felt we should be.  We ordered drinks amd the waitress left them behind the counter and laughed at us in an obvious we are not serving you move. The smell alone made us want to run for this hills. Nasty place!!!"}
{"text":"It's a really nice place! Bathrooms are clean. Service is great. Drinks are good. Food is good. Oysters are okay. I really thought I was going to have the best oyster experience here, like I did @ an Oyster Bar in San Francisco... but I have to admit I was pretty disappointed in the selection of oysters and I was disappointed in the Oysters Rockefeller. I still say that Rare has the best Oysters Rockefeller. I tried every Oyster they had available and I was extremely disappointed. It just did not taste good at all. Good thing the best Oyster was the last one! The Elkhorn Oyster was my favourite it hit the spot and had the taste I was craving. Too bad they didn't have any oysters from PA, PA seems to have some of the best oysters! So I was really rooting for the east coast oysters! But it seemed the west coast had the best Oyster. The Elkhorn. Now I know which one to order when I come back! Also, they offered 2 different sauces, one that was a vinegar and the other was the original cocktail sauce. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We went during Vday weekend. I'm chalking up our loss to that.   Ambiance: poor lighting. I need to see my food. Sight is one of our food senses, so light it up. Jazz music was nice.  Drinks: decent wine list. Cocktails looked a little watered down, so we didn't try any.   Food:  Oysters - great variety, but $3 per oyster. Vinegar and shrimp sauce were both great, but we like ours naked. Blue points were on point. No sand/shell in either.  5/5  Scallops - tad overcooked, warm (not hot), good pan crusting on scallop, great apple + bacon accompanying flavors. 3.5/5  Mussels - good taste, but cold. Decent size mussels and large amount. They give you one medium size grilled bread to dip in sauce (two would be better). REALLY wish this had come out hot. 3/5  Swordfish (special of the night) - barely warm seems to be the theme. The size of the fish was about 4-6 oz. It came out \"barely warm\" and raw in the center. We sent it back to cook a little longer - they hit it right the second time (no angry over-doers in the back). Once hot, all the seasoning and sauce bouquet opened up and really engaged us. There was a lime type butter sauce on top that was... perfect. It had a smear of red ancho paste (not hot, just a flavor) on both sides and placed on a white congealed (cool) puree of .... grits (we were later told). The ancho paste didn't do much for me, and I was scared of the white puree. When I found out it was grits, I sampled it - it was bland. Fish (hot) = 4.5/5.  Waitress - too slow. Maybe the reason all our food is cool? Ex. We waited 15 min for our wine.  The restaurant was busy, but our waitress didn't have that many tables (4 tables of 2 people?). Not sure if the food was ready before the server could get to it. We ordered a special of the night, but we weren't told about the side items (in fact, we were told there weren't any!) and were later surprised with \"grits.\"   Bonus: They were helpful for my lactose intolerance. Due to the cool items, the waitress  comped them (without us bringing it up), which is one main reason I will retry the Tempest.    Overall, we liked the flavors but wished it was hot and a more lit environment. We will retry at later date."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday in 2013.  This place did a good job on the food, but the service is poor and I will tell you why.  We had a table of seven and were charged 18% gratuity automatically.  They had nothing on the menu for a toddler and when we asked for noodles, we had to switch to eggs.  I'd never return with a group, but might with just my wife to the bar for oysters.  The server was aloof and disconnected to a customer dropping 300 on a meal.  And the idea noone brings a 3 yo to dinner came from?  Three stars is a gift earned by the line cook."}
{"text":"What a great place! The remodel from when it was the Magnus is beautiful. The staff was super knowledgeable and nice. The happy hour seafood specials were great too. $2 huge shrimp, $4 scallops that were some of the best I've had, $1.50 oysters & more! I'm hungry again just writing about it.  My mom & I had lobster for dinner & my dad had the carpetbagger steak. All awesome & prices are expensive, but reasonable for what you're getting. We all had specialty drinks that were very good too. The brussel sprouts were great too. The fish chowder was just mediocre. If you're a seafood lover, this restaurant is for you!"}
{"text":"Waited TWO HOURS for our meal.  Yes, they were busy, but a highly rated restaurant should be able to manage a busy night.  Maybe waiting an hour for a mean to arrive but TWO?!!?  I think not at an expensive and well regarded establishment.  Worst was the manager who came over to said \"it is what it is on a busy night\" with no offer of even a dessert on the house.  Wow.  Food was good but not fantastic for that wait.  Lots of other amazing restaurants in Madison - try a different one!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best seafood places in Madison. The ambiance is swanky but still relaxed and there's plenty of room at the bar.   I've been a few times, once on NYE, once on a Tuesday, and once for restaurant week. All three times the food has been excellent, and I especially recommend the tower options, and soft shell crab when they have them! I would highly recommend making reservations for busy events or if you have a large party. Or, you can grab some grub at the bar! Cocktail menu is .... Different. Ended up with a jalapeño tequila because I skipped the jalapeño part so read the happy hour menu carefully! On that note, the servers I've had have always known which wine to pair with you dish."}
{"text":"The food was ok, and presented well...   Unfortunately the restaurant was open and unprepaired for customers.  They were understaffed. With more than half of the restaurant empty we were asked to sit at the bar where we were all but ignored. The bartender was more interested in buying drinks for the girl that sat next to us. It was not until after we had been there nearly 30 minutes that he realized that we may want to have dinner. The complementary bread came out after the appetizers. And overall I give the food an A and the service an F.  It was not until after we had been there nearly 30 minutes that he realized that we may want to have dinner. The complementary bread came out after the appetizers.  Honestly  as good as the food was it did not make up for the completely in adequate staff.   The maître d'  has the people skills of a scallop.   This was our first time and I'm certain we will not be back.  I would have given them 2 stars but after my comments on FB i was insulted by a patron/staff member so yeah 1 star."}
{"text":"This is most likely the best and only acceptable place for seafood in Madison. If you're used to great and fresh seafood this place will meet your standards. The oysters were great but were noticeably different from the fresh oysters I am accustomed to, but I craved them so much I ordered another half dozen. I had the fish and chips and it was the second best fish and chips I ever had. Also ordered the red snapper, which I would highly recommended, its one of the best options on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here during happy hour... and WOW am I impressed. We had at least one thing off of the happy hour menu and it was all DELICIOUS. Scallops, oysters, and smoked fish were just like having smaller portions of whatever was on the menu that day. You could pack yourself full of gourmet seafood for less than $20. We got a little carried away with cocktails so our bill was a bit more than I expected... but sometimes you gotta go with your gut -- literally.   Who'd expect such great seafood in the middle of Madison?"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner for my 54 th Birthday during restaurant week. The menu gave us delectable sounding choices, so it was hard to choose. After choosing our cocktails, Clove, our wonderfully pleasant server, was happy to answer our questions. My hubby chose an oyster on the half shell and the she crab soup. He said the oyster was quiet tender. The soup was flavorfully with chunks of king crab. I went for the spinach salad and enjoyed that it was not overly dressed. My hubby enjoyed his sturgeon so much, not a scrap was left! I had the trout and it smelled so good when Clove set it down, I was practically salivating! It was moist and tender, perfect amount of almonds and wild rice accompanied it. As for dessert, yum, yum, yum!!! We shared our choices of the apple cherry crisp and carmel chocolate walnut tart! We left the Tempest full, satisfied and with smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad time at this joint! Can be romantic or fun in large groups! Best happy hour for food/drinks. The raw oysters are great. The scallops are to die for and I'm a big fan of the smokestack... I have to say the last dinner I had there the sturgeon wasn't the greatest but I had had it before and it was really good so it may have been a fluke... can get pricey for dinner but the happy hour is a great deal! Specialty drinks do not disappoint! I really enjoy this place! Do NOT miss the oyster shots with various infused vodkas/tequila."}
{"text":"Impressive design and architecture, great service, and great food.   Their happy hour deals are amazing.   Definitely worth a visit for all of the seafood lovers out there. Don't forget to throw some change in the wishing boat on your way out."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed 2 meals at tempest; the first was about 2 months ago and the second was last night. Both dinners far exceeded my expectations- which is perhaps why I'm giving them 5 stars. For what Madison has to offer, Tempest has managed to stand out. I had heard generally mixed reviews, so that I had 2 overwhelmingly positive experiences seemed significant and worth a yelp.   Night 1: Quiet night out with my significant other. Night 2: Last minute group reservation; the criteria of our one female guest was \"I wanna wear a dress.\"  Tempest seems to be large enough that they can handle last minute larger reservations.   FOOD: 5 Stars. The tenderloin with beef bone marrow was perfectly done and prepared. The sturgeon and lobster were also impressive. We all enjoyed a variety of cocktails- and all were beautifully presented and tasty.   SERVICE: 5 Stars. Our servers from both nights were exceptional, appropriately educated on the menu, efficient, entertaining and knew when and how to give us space to make decisions or enjoy our meal.   AMBIENCE: 5 Stars.   Tempest will easily be on our list for a future group reservation."}
{"text":"Pretty Pricey, but sometimes you have to pay for true quality. This was an authentic fine dining experience in a somewhat casual setting. The scallop appetizer is a must- sautéed with brandy and  brown sugar. Salmon with roasted beet glaze over potato pancakes was a winner- as was the herb  tartar sauce. Double bone pork chops with mash potato infusion was delectable. Tuna Steak cooked to perfection. Dropped 300.00 for five people with drinks (several) but it was worth every penny. You must try this place out if in Madison."}
{"text":"We stopped only for happy hour but will most definitely return for dinner another time. PEI oysters were fantastic. The horseradish cream in the cocktail sauce in the shrimp cocktail made it. And the scallops were AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I went there on 5/9/17 and I wish I would have remembered the waitress's name. She and everyone else there were SO sweet, and the food was delicious. We had the Oysters Rockefeller for an app. SO GOOD. I got the trout for an entrée- I wanted to try a fish I hadn't tried before. I didn't care for it, but my boyfriend loved it & said it was made perfectly, so I guess I just don't like trout. He ordered steak and it was one of the best steaks I've had. I'm going back to this place for sure and ordering steak next time. Their scalloped potatoes are amazing for a side, and they don't skimp on the free bread, which I always love at a restaurant! Neat atmosphere as well, has a retro feel to it."}
{"text":"I am teetering between 3 and 4 stars due to slow service and the shrimp. I came here on a Tuesday night after reading yelp reviews. I was a bit hesitant as Madison isn't close to any ocean, but it had great reviews.  I came for happy hour as recommended and they have a great little menu. I got a drink from their cocktail menu with vodka and it was a bit sour due to the grapefruit, but it was a heavy pour. Then I settled on the scallops ($4 each), 6 oysters ($1.50 each) and three shrimp cocktail ($1.50). I figured if I was still hungry I could order more. But it took about 20 minutes just to get that order in, so I wasn't able to order more before happy hour ended.  The scallops were very good. They were cooked perfectly with bacon and a fruit compote. The oysters were very good. I ordered two different kinds and was given the traditional fixings with them. Again, these were great. Then came time for the shrimp cocktail and I was disappointed in these. They were rubbery and looked very old (tinged with brown and smelt fishy). Everything was great except the fish. I wanted to order a smoke stack, but time ran out.  Overall, it was a good experience and I would come again. Just be prepared for a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Everyone has to visit here for BRUNCH! It's almost the weekend. I came here for about 3 weeks in a row. If you like seafood, this is the place to be. Also, I expect you should visit before everyone starts to flood this place like every other brunch place in Madison. Don't you wish you had a quiet place to go to for brunch, with delicious delicious food?  Don't expect much service here. I tend to overlook it for the one and only place where you get seafood brunch! And good quality and delicious brunch indeed.  What do I like here? Crabcake benedict - delicious real crab meat, not minced into tiny tiny bits. the hollandaise sauce is so good I can't get enough and need to ask for another tub of it... Lobster mac and cheese - are you serious? Thank you for the entire lobster pincer and another half pincer. It is not chopped into tiny pieces, excuse me, it is an ENTIRE PIECE OF LOBSTER. the mac and cheese is delicious and not overly cheesy or creamy. If you had a small appetite like me, be prepared to bring home leftovers, which still taste really really good.   Also, get the rosti for side! the rosti is one of the best potatoes I've had in Madison for brunch. love the crispy crust on one side but actual potatoes on the other."}
{"text":"Used to be a big fan of Tempest, until tonight. Although the menu DOES warn you about ordering undercooked fish, in all fairness, if you order the tuna medium rare you might get to know your bathroom in ways more intimate than ever before. Let's just leave it at that, shall we?"}
{"text":"Why the heck haven't we checked Tempest out before? Finally did during Restaurant Week and it vaults near the top of Madison area favorite restaurants!! Enjoyed delicious cocktails at the beautiful (and much larger than we ever imagined) bar. We are not oyster people, but when in Rome: We ordered a variety of oysters that the waiter chose for us and we now understand the appeal so much better. They were erotic and tasty. Started out with a side of the Conch Fitters. Amazingly delicious. Jack had the She Crab Soup. Instant favorite, beating anyone's best lobster bisque or similar in town!! I had the Hanger Steak Oscar, medium rare and perfect, which came with lobster, fingerling potatoes and asparagus. The sauce was oh so good. Jack had the Blue Marlin, enough to feed two, in this hazelnut pesto lime aioli to die for. We both had Chocolate Caramel Walnut Tart for dessert. Crazy yummy. Cannot wait to return to try everything else on their menu! Bravo Tempest!"}
{"text":"I just left there and it was horrible. I had planned a fun celebration with my boyfriend, and the food was bad along with a 2 hour wait. I even complained about my food being too salty, but the Manager never came out to apologize for the food or wait. Our bill wasn't discounted either. I expect top level food when I go to a nicer place. I will never go back here. Madison has much better places to eat when you pay these prices."}
{"text":"Restaurant week in Madison lets you try places that maybe you usually wouldn't.  Tempest Oyster Bar is in the old Magus spot.  Three of us went on a weekday and the place was PACKED; we had reservations and were seated right away.  The service was attentive, but we were seated in the bar area and I thought it was loud.  The abbreviated menu was fine for us and we all ordered different appetizers, entrees and desserts so we had a bit of a tasting experience.  The crab cakes were OK, but my smoked fish appetizer was very good.  One had a pasta and seafood medley (the pasta was over done) but the salmon and blue marlin entrees were very good.  Hard to know if the desserts were made on premises since they were all just OK.  Wine list was good, overall experience good.  They can do a better job of fixing up the entry/vestibule; it was just STRANGE."}
{"text":"Tempest is a really great seafood option in the downtown Madison area.  The two of us came for dinner around 8:30pm on a Saturday night, and the restaurant wasn't too busy.  We sat outside, but the inside of the restaurant is also worth experiencing as well.  As an appetizer, I had the lobster bisque that they had as a special for the evening.  The lobster bisque was good, but I wouldn't consider it to be one of the best lobster bisque's that I've ever had.  I would rate the bisque a 7/10.  The oyster's we ordered were nice and fresh.  There was a decent enough variety of oysters to pick from on the night that we were there.  My favorite part of my meal here was the lobster roll and fries that I ordered as my main course.  The lobster in the lobster roll was so fresh and tender.  I also liked that the lobster wasn't swimming in a bland sauce like the lobster rolls at some other places.  Even though the hand cut fries were a minor part of the meal, I was actually a big fan of them and ate way too much of them."}
{"text":"It starts with great management-Nick! The waitstaff is knowledgable and friendly.  The mussels are terrific. Drinks top notch. Seafood tastes fresh with sauces and spices to complement but not commandeer the dishes.  The atmosphere is inviting and understandably nautical. Whether it's for happy hour drink and a bite, fun group dining or romantic dinner for two, Tempest will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Positives: Ambiance, cocktails, appetizers.  Negatives: Pricey, mediocre service.  We stopped by Tempest last week for a round of alcoholic beverages and a few appetizers. The lobster mac&cheese ($18.00) was DELICIOUS - I highly recommend this; the portion size was decent for two people to share. We also ordered the shrimp cocktail ($14.00) - this came in a martini-type glass with horseradish cream and cocktail sauce, plus 5 large shrimp. I felt there could have been at least 6 shrimp for this price, and a nice even number makes it nice to share between two people. House cocktails were $10 each - I had the \"Exocet\" (gin, sparkling rose) and the \"Shanghai'd\" (rum, ginger, prosecco) - I would get both of these again! Very refreshing and nice summer-y drinks.  I felt that the service was just ok. The waiter did not seem pleased that we were only ordering drinks and appetizers, even though we made it known immediately. We would have preferred two seats at the bar but the host seated us at a table way on the end (closest to the room with the big boat) in the bar area/room and it was just an awkward spot.  Two drinks, two appetizers, and $65.00 later... our date night was complete. I will return but hope that the next experience is a bit better."}
{"text":"A friend recommended we visit Tempest after visiting here with his co-workers. He just raved about it, so he and his fiance and I and my husband decided to try it out last Friday.   The ambiance is wonderful and our waiter was nice at first. The drinks we had were superb and most of the seafood was beyond compare in Madison. However there were a few glaring mistakes that we just couldn't ignore, so I doubt that we will ever return to Tempest.   1 - I ordered the mussels as an appetizer and a few of them were still raw in the shells. Unfortunately I didn't find that out until I had already bit into one of them. The taste was so disgusting that I will be off mussels for awhile in general. Especially disappointing as there are several restaurants in Madison that do mussels well; I thought that a restaurant that touts its seafood would at least be able to cook them. I guess not. I didn't mention anything to the waiter; I hated to complain in front of the people my husband and I were with because they had talked up this restaurant so much.   2. My friend ordered a steak medium-well and it was served well-done. She sent it back and it arrived again medium-rare but by then she had cut into it and didn't want it to dry out if they \"put it back on the grill\" as the (uneducated) waiter had suggested. Pretty disappointing for a $30 steak, which, I might add, came with a size of mediocre fries and nothing else - no vegetables, no nothing.   3. Once my friend sent the steak back, the waiter had had it with us. He was nice up until then and the restaurant was not all that busy, but his attitude completely changed after she sent the steak back - which she was nice about and acknowledged that it was not the waiter's fault - but for some reason he took it personal. He had to be asked three times to bring her a drink, which he eventually brought at the end of the meal, when she no longer wanted it.   I'm really sad to report this about Tempest because the food was good - the Oysters Rockefeller were the second only to Louisianne's as far as oysters in Madison go. The fruits-de-mer were so amazing that we ordered a second plate. The ambiance was wonderful and my drink was super tasty. But for a high-priced meal, Tempest failed for reasons 1-2-3. In any other situation, I would have asked for a manager but again, I didn't want to offend the other couple we were with who had been talking up the restaurant for a couple weeks. I'm not sure what happened to Tempest in the couple weeks between their great experience and our terrible one, but we will not be giving it another chance."}
{"text":"One of my top 10 restaurants in town. I have eaten here countless times. It's always a great experience. It is such an improvement over the former Magnus (both the South American and Scandinavian incarnations). So many things to love about the menu...Cesar salad with fresh anchovies (not oil packed), seaweed slaw, shrimp po' boy, lobster roll, fish & corn chowder, raw bar, oysters, fresh Lake Michigan white fish, whole red snapper, exceptional French fries...I have never had a dish I did not like. Even the little touches, like house-made tartar sauce, are spot on.  For those who need meat, the Tempest burger and steaks are just as amazing as the fish.   The bar makes solid, quality cocktails - not craft cocktails, but well executed. The wine menu is short, but well considered with plenty of options that are appropriate for the food. You can come for drinks only in the bar and listen to live jazz some nights. The bar is uniquely modern with green glass and purple stained glass windows.   Service has always been friendly and attentive, appropriate for a restaurant in this price range. Like most restaurants in Madison, customers dress in levels of attire that range from casual (for men, jeans/collared shirt/leather shoes) to suit/tie. In summer, there is outside seating where I have seen people in a smart shorts outfit. They have a private room that can seat 36 for dinner or 50 for standing event.   One complaint...the acoustics are challenging, creating a noise level that can be an issue for some. If you have good hearing and can easily separate conversation from background noise, you will be fine. If not...when the music stops for a brief moment, the guests seem to stop talking in unison and you can get in a quick word!!!"}
{"text":"Some thoughts:  It's dark, with little tea-light covered trees. Everything is champagne colored. It has a romantic ambiance, although many of the tables were groups of friends and not couples.   Our waiter looked like Joaquin Phoenix, so that was pretty fun.   The crusty homemade bread was excellent. Bring on those carbs.  We ate a huge pile of oysters, from little baby ones to intimidating sea-monster-sized ones.   The Smoke Stack was (a) stacked, obviously, and thus super trendy and fun and (b) full of flavors! So many flavors! Not for the faint of heart. I liked it.  For dessert, I had pear upside down cake that looked like a brain and tasted awesome. Yum, brainzzzz!  There's a big boat in the lobby. Why? Because boat."}
{"text":"Polite and freindly staff. Elegent atmosphere. Fantastic food and drinks. Perfect for small groups."}
{"text":"Our group of 7 arrived and were quickly seated with no reservations being made.  We tried a couple of the seafood towers for appetizers.  These were an assortment of raw clams, oysters, shrimp, etc.  Overall, very delicious, though members of the party of preferences for the different types.  Three of us ordered the yellowfin tuna.  We asked for rare but it came out more of a medium.  Still, it tasted wonderful.  The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their meals of salmon and crab legs.    The Tokyo Schooner was our drink of choice.  A very easy to drink to have again and again.  For the Midwest, I thought they did an awesome job at serving fresh seafood for the price."}
{"text":"So, my boss wanted fish while we were in town. Fish. In Madison.  I wanted cheese and beef, but that's because I'm a good midwestern gal.  So together with my coworker, we came up with this place.  I was skeptical at first because where I am from is not known for any sort of quality fish, and after having a big ole Mainer BF for a while now, my palate has become particular.  BUT: the variety of dishes was impressive, all sorts of cuisines.  I got the tuna with spinach and potatoes, and it was a large, fresh cut of the fish.  Everyone loved their dishes.  The coffee I got after dinner was this rich french press, I did not expect.  It was so creamy I wanted to drink the entire pot myself.  And our chocolate walnut desert was amazing.  Service was good.  The atmosphere was not really my jam, but it was fitting."}
{"text":"This may be our new favorite restaurant. The picture shows the smoked stack appetizer my husband had that was fantastic. I had the fried conch that was okay, not great. His really was great. You could order two or three of those for dinner and be totally happy. We showed up for happy hour and the prices are great for the food but the rail drinks use house liquor, which isn't great.   For our main course, we had the trout and the mahi mahi. Both were delicious but the mahi was superior.   Our server was Nicole and she was spot on with her recommendations and knowledge. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the decor of Tempest -- they picked a theme and committed to it. I always feel fancy walking in, even though there's still a laid back vibe. Is mermaid-y an adjective?   I've only been here for drinks, and have been lucky enough to walk in whenever there was live music. The music is incredible when they have it, the kind of incredible that makes you stop and look around to see if anyone else is appreciating it the same way you are.    Our group of 5-7 can usually find seats pretty quickly, not to say that it's empty. The drinks are pretty forgettable, except for this one passion fruit one, and the oyster shots. We tried three different flavors and they were surprisingly tasty. Where else can you get a snack and a drink in one?"}
{"text":"This place has very nice atmosphere. The staff was very nice and accommodating. I came here on a Friday night with no reservations for my parents' birthday and they were able to seat us in the bar area within a few minutes. The food is just ok. The flavors of the dishes are a bit boring and bland. I took my parents there for dinner and it wasn't terrible, but definitely wished I got more than what I paid for.  For starters, we ordered the scallops and the mussels. The scallops were nicely done, but I feel like I can cook this at home. The mussels were also fine, about what I'd expect from a shallot, white wine, and garlic preparation. Again, it was nice, but nothing that awed me. For the entrees, we got the double cut pork chops and the salmon with a side of brussel sprouts. The pork was pretty good, maybe slightly on the dry side, but it was not terribly noticeable. The salmon was a little bland, could definitely have used more seasoning. The side of the pan roasted brussel sprouts were actually quite delicious."}
{"text":"Tempest is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Great atmosphere, great service, great food. It is expensive, but it is worth every penny.  To get a good deal, try to visit during Happy Hour. They have nearly a dozen different oysters available to try on the half shell. It's a great opportunity to compare different varieties. Other appetizers include the fish cake, the conch fritters, and the smoke stack (whitefish salad, lox, trout, caviar). I've been pleased with the freshness, presentation, and flavors of all of them. The bartenders are friendly and make very good (and strong) drinks.  For dinner, we've always stuck with the seafood (trout, crab, tuna, marlin). It's always perfectly cooked, fresh, and delicious. Our service has always been outstanding. Friendly, prompt, respectful.  If you haven't been, I highly recommend the Tempest Oyster Bar."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends for a Yelp event, and got to meet some pretty cool people.  First off, the service was a bit slow. Then again, we had one waitress for a group of about 25 people, so that can be forgiven.  The cocktails all sound very delicious and fancy, but really, most of them tasted like low tier alcohol + juice mixers. However, they are quite alcoholic, so I guess it's a good deal if you're paying by alcohol content.   The food was delicious, and I got their happy hour specials of clams casino and fish cake. The fish cake was creamy and had a good balance of fish and patty. The clams casino was really juicy and the garlic gave it an extra kick.   I'll provide a more in-depth review next time once I've had more of their menu."}
{"text":"Seafood, drinks, jazz in a sea shell. What's not to like?  I love tempest and would come regularly for happy hour and jazz if I had better working hours.  Awniker is my go to drink... Just try it before you ask me what it is.  Amazing selections of seafood entrées, from blue marlin, tuna, shrimp and scallop to lobsters, clams and mussels. They also do surf n turf if that's your thing. More economical sandwich choices are also available!   Come here for happy hour for seafood platter and oysters! On the weekend after 930, live jazz! Fantastic place for a date in my opinion.  I tried their bucatini with lobster, mussels, clams and scallop.. The tomato saffron broth was hearty and flavorful. Seafoods are pretty fresh (consider the fact that we are in the mid west).   It's the place to be if you are craving some high quality seafood!"}
{"text":"During my visit to Madison this past November, I stumbled across this very nice oyster bar. Upon entering the front door, the 20 foot boat is the cherry on the cake regarding the ambiance. The Happy Hour was the best I have ever experienced. I ordered the Blue Point oysters and they were so big and salty (my mouth is watering as I type this)! At $2 an oyster, I ordered a dozen and ate them all...in record time...lol.    The only negative comment I have is, I explained to the bartender I was a pescatarian and only ate seafood (no meat). Nonetheless, I ordered a few scallops ($4 each), and after eating one, I realized it was cooked with BACON. I was instantly nauseous!!!!! I expressed to the bartender that we just discussed the fact that I didn't eat meat - only seafood, so why didn't she disclose to me the scallops were cooked with bacon??? Her response was, \"I thought I told you\". As a bartender/server, you must be very attentive to your customers restrictions, especially if they are communicated to you prior to ordering. IF I EXPRESS THAT I AM ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS AND YOU PROCEED TO ORDER ME A DISH COOKED WITH PEANUT OIL......... the ending will NOT be a good one  Overall, I will frequent this establishment again and again :-)"}
{"text":"The choices here are so many, we decided to go with our first loves, my husband went for 8oz Tenderloin and I went for the King Crab. Our sides are sharable, we did the asparagus and scalloped potatoes. I have to say, I really enjoyed my crab but the amount I had- I had too much crab. In fact my husband's jaw dropped when I said, \"I think I've had too much crab, I can't do anymore\". He also helped me finish it. The steak came out perfectly cooked and well seasoned. I'd have to say, the scalloped potatoes really lacked compared to the rest of the meal. I did add some butter and salt and it did perk it up, but I would never want to tell the chef that! We were always tended to for water and drink, and even when the staff was short, our server was great! The price wasn't too bad for the food we got, but we usually don't spend this much; only a special occasions, and this one was- it was our anniversary."}
{"text":"Would give it a 4.5 if I could. Minus half a star because service can be very slow when they're busy, so go Sunday - Thursday if possible. Love the decor.  The food is always delicious. Things I would recommend:  Mains - Blue Marlin, Yellowfin Tuna Sides - Lobster Tail, brussel sprouts (although the brussel sprouts have gone downhill lately) Starters - Crab bisque, whitefish cakes, oysters (surprisingly fresh for Wisconsin) Late night - Tempest Burger  They also have specials which are are usually worth getting. I tend to avoid meat dishes here, but my SO enjoys them.  They also have one of the better late nights in Madison. Great opportunity to get the Tempest burger."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times since it has opened.  Each of the 3 visits have been equally un-impressive.  For me, being a former resident of both coasts, seafood in WI just doesn't cut, but I can understand the appeal for some people. I think the interior ambience and decor is lovely, but to allow the college dorm look on the porch roof is really a detraction. Cinder blocks and folding camp chairs!?!  REALLY!"}
{"text":"This place would have been four stars in the early 2000s.  We went on a Saturday night for our anniversary  The oysters were very fishy with 6 out of the dozen we tried. They also don't know how to shuck as there were pieces of shell in them. A very uninspired cocktail list but they are mainly focused on wine and my glass was lovely  I almost did tree stars because the seaweed salad is one of the best salads I have ever eaten but the rest of the menu is pretty old school and no surprises   This place is GREAT  if you really want to treat someone with a conservative pallet or you are Madison person in their sixties ( they will spend lots of time lavishing attention on you as you are the demographic they are going for) Nothing inspirational on the dessert menu so we passed. Pricy and boring"}
{"text":"This is the spot for happy hour, starting from 4-7pm on weekdays. You can still drop a pretty penny but the appetizers are on point. My favorites are  the smoke stack with crackers and the pan-seared apple brandied scallops. No more scallops and bacon for me, I make them similar to that at home ever since our first visit years ago. The conch fritters are breaded tastiness and come out very hot, but the sauce accompanying it was an added surprise-some kind of sriracha mayo? (we kept that for dipping other things even after fritter plates were cleared). The cocktails are strong and good. The awniker with jalapeno tequila will stick to you for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"My mamma's in town for the weekend so we wanted to try a new place by the Capitol. Tempest did not disappoint.  Exceptional food, actually very fresh oysters for a land-locked restaurant. The rainbow trout is diviiiiine and seaweed slaw refreshes the palate. Decor is swanky w/ an old Chris craft in the front and a v realistic swordfish thing."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a largeish group on a Friday night recently.  Place is just as loud as the Magnus was but it was bearable.  Ambiance was fun, sort of Red Lobster + Taste.  The food was mixed with price not correlating to quality.    Shrimp cocktail was excellent.    We got a few of each variety of oysters not being very experienced oyster eaters.  All were pretty good, some quite good but every one of them had bits of shell all over the edge of the shell so most of them had grit mixed in even after wiping the shell off myself.  Only have had oysters a few times (including at The Magnus) and they always seemed cleaner shucked than this time  For the main course I had the 15$ fish and chips thinking I'd be stuffed from the other stuff and not want anything too fancy.  It turned out to be the best part of the meal, I have not had such good fish fry anywhere!  Frites were nice and dark, fish perfect and breading flavorful but not too greasy/heavy.  My wife had the lobster roll which was pretty good though her frites where white and undercooked.  Others in our party had the whole red snapper and it was excellent as well.  So in general I'd say check the place out, but maybe not for the oysters."}
{"text":"This is my favorite happy hour place in all of Madison! It can be a little pricey for dinner, but their happy hour is perfect! They have an amazing list of their cocktails, beer, wine and their incredible seafood for insanely cheap. It is comparable with Sardine's happy hour for their oysters, but Tempest has much more to offer than just oysters. I would recommend trying all of their food offers. They are each delightful in their own way. The atmosphere is lovely- simple, elegant, transports you to a warmer climate with their ocean-esque decor. This is truly a hidden gem in Madison."}
{"text":"I went to Tempest on a Monday during Madison's Restaurant Week, where we got a three-course meal for $35 a person. The maritime atmosphere of the Tempest is fitting, though it's such a cavernous and dim place that it was difficult to take pictures of the food (which isn't to say they should brighten it up for the sake of Yelp reviewers like myself!).  Our waitress, Asia, was attentive and sweet. The first thing she brought out, after our drinks, was some crusty bread with super-creamy butter that I had to fight myself not to fill up on. Then we ordered and the first course came out: Whitefish cakes, she crab soup, and conch fritters. The whitefish cakes were good, but they fell apart under your fork; the soup was hearty and sweet - almost too sweet - but was balanced out by a nice smattering of black pepper from our waitress, and I didn't think the crab flavor was as prominent as it could have been; and the conch fritters were the highlight of the appetizers: perfectly fried and drizzled with a delectable sauce (go easy on the mango salsa as to not overwhelm the other flavors).   Then onto the main course, which took a little too long to get to the table: blue marlin, rainbow trout, and bucatini. The blue marlin was melt-in-your-mouth fabulous with great aioli on the bottom, hazelnut pesto on top, and leeks. The rainbow trout had a buttery, but overly salty walnut crust and was my least favorite of all the dishes. It was a bit too boring and almost chewy, more Friday Night Fish Fry fare rather than worthy of an upscale seafood restaurant. The bucatini came with succulent scallops and chunks of delicious lobster, all perfectly cooked.   For desert we had the walnut tart, apple cherry crisp with ice cream, and the key lime pie. Everything was good, though our favorites were the key lime and the tart. Then again, unless someone made a disaster of it, how could key lime pie be anything but amazing?  By the time we left around 7, almost every table in the large dining room was full, which might explain the slower service. Though I wasn't impressed enough to want to want to go back anytime soon, I'd like to give Tempest a try on a regular night and the kitchen doesn't have to churn out dishes like clockwork."}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week and loved everything! The decor was really nice, service is good, and food was awesome.   For appetizer, I got the fried oyster, which comes on a bed of seaweed salad. The oysters were nicely breaded and paired really well with the refreshing seaweed salad. Even better, my friend had the mussels which came in a huge portion and were perhaps the juiciest mussels I've ever had, with a delicious lime broth (I think it was lime, anyway it was delicious).   For the entree, I had the snapper which was the waitress recommended, and it was HUGE. A whole fish, fried, and topped with pomegranate seeds and green onions. There was a sweet pomegranate sauce that made the whole thing just delicious. I got to try some of my friend's blue marlin which was super flavorful. The pasta also looked like it came with a lot of seafood, including lobster, though I didn't try any.   My dessert was also great - creme caramel. It was a creamy custardy dessert, kind of like flan but less sweet, which I liked.    Definitely recommend coming here! Too bad it's pretty pricey normally, but I will be keeping this on my list for really special occasions."}
{"text":"We loved it! Oysters were phenomenal and the scallops appetizer was tasty! The sauce was sweet/salty and the bacon was a great combo.  I had the shrimp scallops and grits with the pork belly and loved that It wasn't spicy like most \"shrimp n grits\". My daughter had the lobster roll and enjoyed it. The fries were awesome and crispy. Server was attentive and made great suggestions. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"3rd time at Tempest. The bar is wonderful, they have a great oyster happy hour. And the food is consistently amazing. But all 3 times service has been bad or worse. Being seated and then ignored for 15 minutes. Servers who can't answer questions about the menu and then just disappear. And spilling water all over the table, that was a nice touch. Madison is overflowing with amazing restaurants who provide great service to their patrons. But Tempest isn't one of them."}
{"text":"This restuarant was across the street from the Monona Hilton so I tried it.  Good selection of oysters, tried 3 That the waiter recommended.  Good garnishes with the oysters.  Selected the australian sea bass.  Came over rice and veggie garnish.  Enjoyed it.  Topped it off with key lime pie.  Yes abit pricey but enjoyed it"}
{"text":"A seafood and late night gem in Madison. They have live bands on the weekends and have an awesome great night menu starting at 10pm. The late night mussels are $9 and delicious. It's fun to visit in the winter because it has a cozy, warm feel inside. During warmer months they have seating on the cute outdoor patio. Great drink menu and lovely atmosphere, a wonderful date night location."}
{"text":"I've visited Tempest on several occasions now, with two out of the three being excellent and one being just okay. My last visit was during Madison's Restaurant week a couple months back, and the three course menu with beers to pair was amazing, especially for the price. Although the service was slow, our waitress made it up for it by supplying our group with another beverage from the beer features that night and extra salad accompaniments. One of the best things I ever ate at a restaurant was the scallop croquette (See picture), which all three of us ordered as an entree. It was served in a large sea shell which was a nice touch. None of us spoke after our first bite diving into this creamy, pillowy, creation until maybe the third bite because it was just that good!  We still talk about it...This review was long overdue."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant in town. Chilled seafood tower was great. Oysters were delicious. Ordered the broiled lobster for dinner. Claws and legs required some work but worth it. Wine list was solid. Good service."}
{"text":"I'm giving those three stars because I was expecting more from this place, it was good but I don't think it was great. The oysters Rockefeller was OK I've had better. The mussels were in a watery sauce with a lot of grease, not too much of a taste to the garlic wine sauce. Our actual entrée was delicious, we had the grass fed beef steak and a shrimp and scallop dish. Overall it was a decent meal but not sure if I will be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"She Crab Soup- 5 out of 5 starfish The she crab soup was loaded with meat, topped gracefully with fish eggs, and bursting with flavor. Perfect appetizer, we couldn't wait to see what would come out of the kitchen next.   Marlin with Pesto Crust- 5 out of 5 starfish I was living on the edge when I ordered this exotic, new fish, and I am very pleased with my life choice. The marlin was cooked well, cut easily with the fork. The pesto crust and lime aioli topped this entree off.   Hanger Steak- 5 out of 5 starfish The waitress told us that the hanger steak is a top notch shoulder cut, and top notch it was. The steak was sliced and spread over oyster mushroom ragout. It tasted like heaven on a platter. The meat cut with ease and was so juicy and flavorful. And the mushrooms were great too. (Also made for great leftovers the next day.)  Key Lime Pie- 4 out of 5 starfish Very classic key lime pie in generous portions. Spot on graham cracker crust and refreshing whipped topping.   Chocolate Pecan Tart- 3 out of 5 starfish Very rich. Intense chocolate top protecting a gooey pecan goodness inside. The graham cracker crust was lined with a chocolate layer and very difficult to break through (although a lack of upper body strength may be attributing to the success of eating the dessert).  Nautical theme set the mood. There was a boat right inside. The bar wall was colorfully designed and decorated with wine bottles. Quite lovely and date night material."}
{"text":"Doesn't everyone like a great \"Happy Hour?\"  My beautiful fiance and I stopped by for a Happy Hour with the United Way Rosenberry group and we had a great time. Neither of us had ever been here before and it was very nice. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, the bar staff were attentive....and THE OYSTERS were the bomb!!!  They have fresh, fresh, seafood and the menu changes daily - not much for the vegetarian of the family but plenty for me :) Did I mention the fresh seafood and OYSTERS!  As we only stayed for a few drinks and oysters that is all that I can comment on at this time but I will definitely be back for the full meal sometime soon."}
{"text":"Went to Tempest last week with friends and I really had no complaints. Sat outside which was perfect. Our waitress was excellent- definitely a pro. Smooth, friendly and knowledgeable. Our group had two appetizers - oysters Rockefeller and shrimp cocktail. I only tried the shrimp (not really an oyster fan) and though they were a bit pricey, they were very good. Came with some excellent sauces too. For dinner I had the shrimp po boy - but split it with our friend who got the lobster roll. Both were good but I preferred the shrimp a bit more. The breaking added some extra flavor. Only wish was that it was a bit more spicy or offered a Cajun type sauce to add on it wanted. It was my birthday so we tried a dessert - Key Lime Pie. It was beyond amazing. SO good, maybe the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Interesting entrance. A Boat..Has a little I'm in Florida feel.....A little too dim lighting for me. Cool casual chill music.  Had the shrimp appetizer... was pretty good. Would've liked a little spicier for horseradish dip just picky me...  I ordered the Bucatani? Looks good What  good is good."}
{"text":"Romantic environment! They were about to close but we only came for late night appetizer before we went to hit up other places. I, of course ordered oysters! SO. GOOD.  The oysters were so fresh! I ordered the West Coast oysters because I heard they were more fresh and sweet. let's just say I could eat about ten of them!  I also tried my first oyster shot here. SMOOTH is all I have to say. Our waiter was awesome so the overall service was A+."}
{"text":"I find Tempest a bit over average, the food is good but unremarkable.... I suppose if you want a 'good' meal than this is the place, I had higher hopes... I know the dining room is loud (it has been for years), I expected the service to be just over average (and it was)...  yet I was really hoping for some 'wow' dishes. We had the oysters (which were great but don't really rely on cooking), the cooked clams however were like leather, everything else was.... fine.... With honorable mentions to the trout which was really tasty, and the deserts which were yummy. Maybe I eat too much spicy food and am being unfair, but the only spice I got here was salt and a lot of it on everything."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Amazing oysters - which are rare in Madison!  I had the marlin crusted in pesto, and it was delicious!  Perfectly seasoned and not overcooked.  Desserts were also great, I think they change these up often.  My favorite thing about the place was the bar area!  Its such a light, inviting atmosphere that I could have stayed for hours.  A great change from the overly dark decor that was Magnus's signature.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. I've enjoyed many Madison restaurants and my overall (and first) experience at Tempest has outshined almost all of them. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was unique, and the service was fantastic. Everyone was perfectly polite, attentive, and timely. If you have the opportunity to visit during or outside of Restaurant Week, I highly recommend. Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal for my boyfriend's birthday at Tempest Oyster Bar.  We started with a selection of two of each of all the raw oysters and clams (we're addicts).  They had terrific oysters that were pretty expertly shucked (only got a couple of small shell pieces, and I've never been anywhere that didn't have that) -- a great variety of briny to creamy.  The clams were meh, but probably only because a raw clam seems a bit vulgar compared to the heavenly experience that is a raw oyster.  I also had the arugula salad, which was delicious, huge (the more arugula, the better!) and well-dressed -- not too lemony, with tasty bits of chevre throughout.  My entree, the carpetbagger steak, was out of this world.  Cooked perfectly (I asked for medium rare), in a \"brown beer sauce\" that I probably would have drunk out of a pint glass given the chance, it was stuffed with several --you guessed it -- OYSTERS!!  I nearly died eating it, it was so good.  I didn't even want to give a bite to my boyfriend and it was his birthday!  Definitely in the top five things I've ever eaten in my life.  Dessert was also delicious: I had a blackberry-peach crumble (not too sweet), and my boyfriend had a chocolate mini-bundt cake with a candle in it!  They also brought him shortbread cookies with whipped cream upon learning it was his birthday.  All were very tasty.  Great service.  Good wine list.  The decor was kind of weirdly sterile-nautical (try the bar section if you want to look at pretty things), but I don't concern myself much with that, especially when the food is to die for!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried oysters at the (gorgeous!) Tempest bar Sunday night. They were fresh, firm, plump...and clean! (I'm guessing the kitchen's pulling it together there). Love the decor and the smart and friendly staff. Will save up a little cash to go back for full dinners, but we will be there soon!  (Jimmy P. : I always had great service at Magnus and I'm pretty sure it was the \"Scandinavian\" menu that sunk that ship. Pun intended)."}
{"text":"The best oysters in town!  Wide variety of both east and west coast oysters that are constantly changing from day to day. All are excellent!!  Other great things to eat include the smoke stack (a variety of fish mixed with egg and lettuce with topped with roe.  Capers, pickles, and pickled onion on the side!), fish chowder, mussels, conch fritters, and scallops.  Best special I ever had was softshell crab and morels, but it is hard to go wrong ordering whatever special they have. Wait service and ambiance are fantastic!  For the best deals, try happy hour from 4-7 PM weekdays (oysters are $2)."}
{"text":"The owner painstakingly nailed hundreds of decorative metal spoons behind the bar & there's a giant wooden boat in the front room making most of the interior very cool (except for the clamshell in the wall).  The cocktails are simple, fresh, and delicious. I've had three of them and liked them all pretty well. Personal favorite is the Wheelhouse. Fairly solid beer selection too, including Schlitz.   Somehow I have an appetizer addiction, and Tempest helped fill my addiction. The seafood tower might not be worth the money - I'd just get oysters and clams a la cart. Last tower we got had some sketchy crab on the top which was a big turn off. The smoked fish platter is spot on -- you can't miss this. Also the scallop and clam apps are both very tasty.  Main courses have been nice also. Seems like the special is always pretty awesome. It's weird though - they seem to run out of things a little too often. Heads up: the lobster roll has lettuce inside of it, so make sure to get that removed. The sturgeon was okay - I think it's a personal thing. I also had the trout which was yummy.  Overall - I like this place. It's an innovative seafood restaurant in Madison with a refreshing interior."}
{"text":"Went for valentine's day, so it was obviously busy. Despite this, everything was cooked to perfection. Scallops were an excellent appetizer. Steak and whitefish (special for the day) were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I have to say I am a bit disappointed my first review was filtered by Yelp, but I went back last night to Tempest, and have more good things to say about them.  We ate in the bar instead of the restaurant this time, and the noise level was actually quite manageable.  I love lobster rolls (have lived on the East coast and have traveled to Boston and the New England area) and I was not disappointed with theirs.   I'm not sure if the recipe has changed since all of the bad reviews were written about it, but it was filled with perfectly cooked lobster meat.  Delicious.  It wasn't a traditional roll in the sense that it wasn't coated with mayonnaise and slopped on a hamburger bun (like street vendors in the New England area generally do) but it was very much like the high end lobster rolls I have gotten at places like Neptune Oyster Bar in Boston and the like.  The lobster is served on a butter toasted hoagie with a nice dollop of mayonnaise on the bun.  It was a perfect amount of fat, meat, and arugula.   The fries were also quite good that came with it, and the dipping sauce was nummer.    I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the mussels.  Unfortunately, I am comparing it to Sardine's mussels, and none can ever compare.  The sauce was too salty and thick for my taste,  but the mussels were tender and debearded very well, so they were yummy.  My friend got the fish and corn chowder, and we had to send it back.  Sadly, it was quite bland and she pulled about 4 fishbones out before she gave up and signaled the bartender.  Ah well, it was only a side, so I can't complain too much.  All in all a very tasty dinner : )"}
{"text":"In a land locked city such as Madison, there's reason to be skeptical of oysters.  But that said, the martinis served were iced to perfection, the oysters were delightful and offered a few varieties I'd not had before, loved the selection and the help from the staff.  Tried the scallops with a perfect sear and a fantastic bacon and apple bit sauce.  The decor is unique and feels hip and quaint at the same time.  Will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best seafood restaurant in the city. the happy hour has  the best oyster specials in town and the cocktails are super tasty. check the schedule before you go and try to plan your trip on a live music night, the jazz band plays out of a gorgeous oyster shell stage, it's like being in a 1950's Hollywood movie."}
{"text":"Amazing food and unbelievable service. Alex and Eric were incredible. Great knowledge and recommendations on the menu. Thank you"}
{"text":"The location was great. The service was on point. The menu looked very interesting and the wine list was pretty long and with a good variety.  Now the food. I shared the fruit de mer (basically fried seafood) and I hade the marlin. The fried seafood was pretty good, but the Marlin was really disappointing: the  Marline itself was fine, but the crust was way to heavy with mostly pistachios and the sauce was basically pure butter, the whole dish was in dire need of some acidity. The key lime pie was pretty good, but pretty expensive, and way too much cream! Luckily you can scrape that off, but no scraping off the butter from the marlin and even if you could scrape all of that and the pistachios off the fish, then the fish would be too thick for not having some acid to cut through it.  Having said that, there were plenty of dishes that looked interesting so I'm suspended between going back and trying something different or deciding it's not my place."}
{"text":"Such a lovely spot.  Great for going out with a small group or for a first date.  Intimate yet not packed in.  Can make a great drink.  Probably should like oysters and seafood, just in case you hadn't caught on."}
{"text":"Awesome decor and fantastic food.  Must try the scallops/shrimp, oyster rockefeller, mussles and salmon!"}
{"text":"Heard of this new place, was excited to try it after the Bartell. Glad to see some empty tables in the first room. Waited by the host stand.... waited...waited... uh..w a i t ed. The many staff walking by never made eye contact. Ah - the guy chatting with his friends by the boat was the host I guess. Pretty young girl stands one second at the front desk - he pops right over. FAIL!  We walked out and had a fantastic experience and meal (as usual) next door at Osteria Popavero. Faith restored in food service."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal and left extremely full! We shared a HUGE raw tower and everything was absolutely delicious!! Such great oysters, lobster, crab and clams. We then shared the crab legs, and a lobster roll! The lobster roll was a bit too dressed for my liking-- I prefer just bread, butter, lobster and mayo, but this had arugula a bit too much bread. The fries were excellent and so were the crab legs! I'd definitely come back here again. Great service and attentive staff!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!   Had some East Coast Oysters- Great!  The little brown vinegary sauce that is served with them is so good. We saved it to dip bread and stuff in! ;)  But don't wreck the oysters by adding the sauce- they are great alone. ' Also had the white fish cakes- yum!  I had the Marlin and tried the Halibut both excellent.    Everything was terrific.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Revisited with some new friends for dinner, we were not disappointed! My wife recommends the surf and turf burger, shrimp placed on top of a burger. I had the tuna and it was amazing. The shrimp and grits were also enjoyed. We also ordered a tower of oysters, shrimp and clams. The oysters were incredible.  -original review-  I had the occasion to visit tho establishment for a post holiday get together. I honestly was not expecting much as good seafood is very difficult to find in mid-America.  I was very surprised and pleased with their raw oysters. Very great and of high quality. Their fried oysters were incredible, I can only assume that they are using the fresh oysters for these as well. The fried oysters melted in my mouth. The other items were also very good and they seem to be using quality ingredients. While our group only had appetizers and drinks that evening, I would return for the oysters alone. I do intend to make a return visit sometime soon for dinner and shall hopefully have equally high praise then."}
{"text":"I loved their restaurant week menu! I had the caesar (which was great and good caesars are hard to come by) the shrimp and scallops and grits, which were awesome and the key lime pie.  I was pretty full by the time dessert came around but had a couple bites and it was good.  Our server was super knowledgeable and guided us through our oyster order and they were awesome!  Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 was that courses were very slow.  Had I not had an excellent dinner companion I would have been antsy.  I will definitely be back for happy hour soon.  I also loved the new decor much more than when it was Magnus.  Felt much brighter and lighter."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant pulling off the improbable: the service of high quality no-hint-of-fishiness seafood in our land-locked city. It's tough to even get decent whitefish in Madison sometimes, so their impeccable service of chilled raw oysters and clams is deserving of high praise and patronage. Our assorted seafood platter was easily as fresh as oysters I had this past summer off the Chesapeake Bay. They were also correctly shucked----all of the liquid was left in the shell, no grit, no cracking.  Fish chowder soup was very good with a decidedly homemade flavor and lots of fish. Lobster rolls were generous portions for $15 and served with excellent fries. However, the lobster itself was served straight without any butter or mayo dressing on rolls covered in aioli. It was good, but they'd be smart to baste the lobster just a little. That said, again, no hint of fishiness at all, just fresh seafood.  The pear upside-down cake with homemade carmel and whipped cream may be the best dessert in Madison. Expertly executed and nicely warmed, it was so big that it fed 5 happy people.  They also have the best happy hour in Madison. All of their appetizers are significantly less expensive and their quality cocktails are only $5. Make a point to try whatever oysters they have at $1.50 each--a great deal. \"Smoke stacks\" are also on good happy hour special and are basically smoked salmon, whitefish, and a few other notes such as caviar stacked on top of each other with house-made pickled vegetables. Very good.  Do note that for dinner you'll spend a good $35-50 per person for appetizer, entree, and drink, and possibly more depending on what you order. I think you can go to the bar and just order a sandwich for $10-15, which is doable for undergrads."}
{"text":"Has become a classic for me, I go several times a year. I have never been disappointed with any dish.   Best oysters in the city, go during happy hour for better prices!  Decor is A++, as is service. They occasionally host amazing live music events, I strongly recommend going to one!  This is probably one of the best \"fancy\" date spots in Madison."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon as I was looking for a special dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday while we were in town for a conference. What a find! First, the room is really understated beautiful. The tones from dozens of candles against the barreled ceiling creates a warm and comfortable room. Service was top notch from a helpful and knowledgeable server who delivered the perfect amount of attention. We stared with oysters (of course) which were fantastic. Entrees were cooked perfectly and what a nice surprise to see Marlin on the menu. You must try the brussel sprouts!! Wish we had time to sit at bar and enjoy the place more....next time for sure."}
{"text":"Another solo dinner at the bar (on the road for business). The first thing that caught my attention was the entry way! Very nautical and tastefully decorated.  Had the seaweed slaw - which was really impressive. Definitely worth a go if you enjoy that sort of thing - you won't be disappointed. Followed that up with the Yellowfin tuna, rare. A lot going on with that dish - many different flavors that overshadowed the flavor of the fish, but not bad. Would have enjoyed the taste of the tuna a little more. Perhaps without the capers.   All in all a great experience - will return on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at Tempest. The oysters and scallops are delicious. The drink menu is filled with tasty concoctions. I loved the complementary pickled vegetables served before our meal when we have eaten there. Service was generally in the not remarkable to pretty good range. However, I went for happy hour (which is really a great deal) and had a fairly negative experience there. Erin, our server, seemed not only not pleased to be there , but actively was openly irritated with us. We were patient and only made simple requests and did not complain about any of the food. She acted annoyed while we asked for an extra chair, needed split checks between three couples and ordered half a dozen more oysters. I was really disappointed in this level of establishment. I hope it improves."}
{"text":"I love the way the bar looks. If you haven't seen it, come see it. Hundreds of wine bottles stacked together underneath a smooth light wood bar. Subdued art deco and that shiny backbar. It's beautiful.  I sit in the middle of the bar and order a warm rum drink, a lobster bisque, and a carpetbagger. I've met a lot of the staff here, so they were fairly casual with me, but I wish they had steered me in a better direction with my orders.  The warm rum cocktail was totally fine with the horrible weather we've been having, but the bisque was pretty moderate. Bisques are heavily seasoned creamy crustacean soups, and while the bisque wasn't as hot or seasoned as I'd have liked (I want my bisque to be heavily salted and seasoned and gluttonous in general), the real offenders were the burnt capers and overdone bits of lobster. Now, I get that Wisconsin folks can be scared of seafood, but they're lobster! Figure out just how much to cook them before throwing them in hot soup and it's amazing.  A hip mixed couple sat down next to me at the bar. The man was a berret wearing Jewish gentlemen that kept company with a Japanese woman wearing legwarmers. We had a really good conversation.  The steak arrived mid conversation. I was kind of stunned with the presentation. Carpetbag steaks are oysters and steaks put together. Tldr carpetbag steaks are opulence for your mouth. What was on the plate was a 12 inch kabob through my 8oz tenderloin on top of a thin brown sauce. It didn't look rich which is a problem especially when it doesn't taste rich. I immediately tried ordering the scalloped potatoes (which I know are amazing), but I was told they were out. Hilariously when my chef buddy showed me the kitchen, there they were. I tried ordering anything *fast* so I could keep my meal going, but neither bartender knew what was quick. I ended up with hash browns.  Jazz starts. Dim yellow lights and shadows bounce around the contours of the giant sea shell at the end of the bar. Of course it's Wisconsin and they end their set with a birthday shout out.  My friends came and we sat and talked. Chef buddy from before is interested in food and we chatted a lot - especially about that carpetbagger. He agreed with me on p much all points. I probably could have complained my way to something else on the menu, but that wasn't really my goal. My other friend came and she ordered an Awniker and a smoke stack. Along with the Oyster Burger, those two are my go tos.  What's really funny is that while this review sounds pretty negative, I still like the place. It's really easy to discredit the ambiance, and conversation, and music. It's really easy to focus on my bad experience even though that Oyster Burger is maybe my favorite in Madison. To be honest, this review is just a long writeup about the small things that keep this place from being great."}
{"text":"There is a huge wooden boat when you walk in! Wicked. Also loved the huge sea shell in the bar area. Now just needs a mermaid to be sitting in it.  If you want to get a taste of what they are like. I would recommending going during Happy Hour.  $1.50 Oysters : $2.00 Shrimp Cocktail : $2.00 Fish Cake : $2.00 Rockefeller : $2.50 Scallop : $3.00 Smoke Stack  $5.00 Specialty Cocktails : $3.50 Rail Cocktails : $1.00 off all taps    The rockefeller was o.k. But the smoke stack stole the show with layers of whitefish salad, lox, trout, caviar, and horseradish cream.  Serves was slow. Was in a group of 15-20 and only gave us one server and it seemed that she also had tables for dinners in the dining room too.   Drinks were not strong and too sweet for me. The Bosun's Whistle was a fun twist with dill vodka. I got no heat from the jalapeno tequila in the Awniker.  Didn't get dinner but may return when/if craving seafood. Always wanted to try soft shelled crab and they do have that when in season."}
{"text":"Nice, very nice.  I did not expect to find a really good seafood restaurant in Madison, much less one that serves a good variety of oysters.  Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  Nice atmosphere, there is an enormous wooden boat as soon as you walk in.  Dining outside was a bit dicier; there was enormous spider web and an enormous spider in its web on the window right next next to our table.  Anyway, small minus in retrospect as the food was excellent.  Oysters and clams were outstanding.  My dish was a play on the classic fish fry.  I never had Blue Gill before but I found it quite tasty and still delicate after a perfect cornmeal fry.  An excellent Key Lime pie topped off what was an excellent meal.  Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Post before hunting food for this year's restaurant week! Miss oysters and juicy steak there!"}
{"text":"Okay, I really hate spending this much money on one meal. But we do splurge once or twice a year for special occasions. We made reservations because we were going on Valentines Day. I thought it would be super crowded and loud but I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. For food me and my husband split a Lobster Bisque and Mussles. They were both very good. My husband says its probably the best Lobster Bisque he's ever had. For our main course I ordered the Walnut Crusted Rainbow Trout and my husband ordered the Lamb with Scalloped Potatoes. Sometimes with a \"crusted\" fish the crust is very light and just a little hint of flavor. Well, this was definitely walnut! It was good, just more noticeable than what I was expecting. My husband really enjoyed his food and devoured it! The service was good, we never ran out of water (big pet peeve of mine!) and have no complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Killa food, great ambiance, and service rocked!! Everyone go there!! So good! Boat in entrance was surprising and you felt like you were on the water!"}
{"text":"Came back second time for happy hour. And it was definitely worth it: only $2 for an oyster so we ordered 20 of them for 2 people and that was dinner for us. We also got the fish cake, scallop and fries on the side.   I would say this is the best place in Madison for oyster. They offer a wide variety of raw oysters. My fav is the west coasts ones. And those are a bit pricey so going during happy hour is a must. The Rockefeller is always good so if you are new to this restaurant, it is a must try.   Fish cake was perfectly cooked. Very crisp outside and moist inside. Personally for me, the fish flavor is just not as good as crab cake. But if you are judging the chef's cooking skills, it is 10/10 for this one.   Seared scallop with maple syrup was amazing. I love the maple sauce. The only down side of it is that they only serve 1 scallop per order.   Overall, Tempest made it to my regular list. I would recommend this restaurant and would definitely stop by here and there for a good oyster meal"}
{"text":"5 stars just for the AMAZING interior.  Other things that are wonderful about this place:  - Tasty oysters  - great happy hour specials  - the mussels are different from any I've tried before, and in a good way- very light sauce. Oh and they are served with fire grilled bread :)  Definitely a place to visit in Madison (there are very few of those, so, you don't have an excuse not to)"}
{"text":"Big fan of the scallops, and the French wine selection pairs well with any entree. Great place to take visiting family from out of town for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Best seafood outside of Maine. Just a delightful dining experience. We tried to go light because it was our third night out in a row in Madison celebrating my daughter's graduation from college. We couldn't stop eating so it didn't turn out to be too light. Smoked Stack was amazing. Bucatini was perfect. Oyster po boy topped all off but wait, there's more. We finished all off with key lime pie. Just a perfect evening. Service was great. Huge fans. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow......... The food is awesome and lived up to their oyster bar name!  The service was a bit slow, and the bar area very loud, but for the quality of the meal it is worth the minor inconvenience of very busy server.  Definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: We're big fans of Henry Doan's other ventures. This one rates favorably with his other restaurants. I had the halibut cooked with capers and a savory sauce that was superb. My wife had the fish and chips. The fish was fabulous, but she's not a fan of shoestring potatoes (I like all potatoes and thought they were fine).  We ate at the bar and were given excellent service. it's an attractive bar with a good beer and cocktail menu. We didn't try any wines, but I noticed a good selection of by-the-glass wines."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not been to the Tempest.  They've been open quite awhile but to tell the truth I had forgotten that the former business was no longer there.  You can tell I pay attention to downtown restaurant changes.  Well that is why I like to take advantage of Restaurant Week, which is what we did summer 2013.  We chose Tempest.  We ordered the Blue Marlin and the Salmon and both were delicious.  Hated to see the bottom of my plate.  The presentation was great very nice.  The bar has changed and they have a big boat in the lounge area.  We sat in the dining room however it looks like they have a decent sized outdoor seating area.  The deserts were scrumptious.  I ordered some raw oysters and really liked them.  We were told they came in fresh the same day and they sure tasted like they did.  The happy hour looks very tempting for oyster pricing and other fun specials.  The bar is fun and has been rearranged.  Give it a go if you like dining from the sea.  We did not participate in the fun drinks because it was a \"school\" night but looked like there were some fun choices."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great food and a great atmosphere. Come here at 4 for happy hour, oysters are only $1.50 a piece. I highly recommend this place. It's a great place to go for a romantic meal or just to eat oysters or hang out at the bar."}
{"text":"The food was pretty amazing if expensive.  Everyone at our table enjoyed the oysters but the whole deep fried sea bass stole the show.  Head and tail still on.  I was impressed.    The space is cool and feels retro yet new.    The problem I had was the bartenders and the lack of music.  On a Saturday night you'd think the bartenders would be in a good mood.  They weren't and their attitudes took something away from what should have been a great bar scene.    Overall the food is great but they need to make the place have more 'vibe'.  Its kind of stale even with the really cool decor (a boat inside!)."}
{"text":"I've wanted to eat here for a few years now. The other day I was craving a po boy and my go to place had just closed. Thankfully I live on the same block as the Tempest. Perfect time to check the place out! Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations.  I've lived in a few different states and one of them had a fast food seafood place called Long John Silver. The breading on the po boy tasted JUST like the breading at the fast food restaurant. Kind of bland and way too greasy. Considering the price difference, I was very disappointed. On top of that the fries were bad. The only solace was in the aioli.  On the other hand, the crab soup was delicious and the key lime pie was absolutely amazing. I'm not sure if it's worth coming back for though, but they were almost good enough to makeup for the disappointing main course. In the future I'll likely stick with The Bayou when possible and maybe just grab a soup to go."}
{"text":"Tempest is a one of a kind seafood spot in Madison. The ambience is fun. It's classy, but not pretentious. It's warm and comfortable but kind of tacky in a wonderful way. The food will not disappoint. The scallop appetizer is among the best scallops I've ever had. My husband LOVES their swordfish (which isn't always on the menu, but is a frequent addition to the list of specials.) Everything I've eaten there from steak, to salmon, to tuna has been amazing. I also really enjoy the oyster shots.. they have a number of different alcoholic shots that they put an oyster in and serve it for $6. I like the one that has a tomato base, and the dill one is also quite delicious. I highly recommend Tempest for a nice date night out or for any special occasion."}
{"text":"This place is the BITCH. That being said, it's expensive and you get what you pay for. The marlin main and the smokestack starter are the tits"}
{"text":"This whole place is different - Magnus is gone, and a delightful little oyster bar has taken its place. In the front, there is a boat. Not an image of a boat, but an actual boat. It's decor. It's kinda fun!  Magnus's old bar area has kept a little bit of its original majesty, and the main dining area is still separate. We were there late and they seated us in the bar zone at once. We ordered two dozen oysters. God I love oysters. It's what I'd probably request if I was going to be executed. No need for the little sauces but we ate them anyway. They were freaking great.  We also polished off a delicious chocolate dessert. Bonus points for having a sparkling chenin blanc on the wine list for $7 a glass. That was an easy choice! What's better than champagne and oysters? Delicious!"}
{"text":"I had heard mixed reviews about Tempest, but I am happy to report that my dining experience did not disappoint. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and was wonderfully attentive. He really did not miss a beat.  As far as the food, one of my dining companions had a sampler of the oysters and rated them at some of the best he has ever had. The one complaint I have is that they do not have a scallop or shrimp entree on the menu, which is rather disappointing. I ended up doubling the scallop appetizer for my meal, but found it was a little too sweet for my liking (prepared with apples, brandy, brown sugar, and bacon.) The three others I was with all ordered steaks (two bone-ins and one tenderloin) and all enjoyed their entrees.   We had been on Lake Monona all day, so the nautical-themed atmosphere was fitting. I did not think Tempest was especially loud. It was perhaps louder than L'Toile or Muramoto, but certainly quieter than Great Dane or Old Fashioned. Perhaps that is a big noise level range, but I was surprised to read that other reviewers rated Tempest at 'Very Loud.'  Overall, I thought Tempest was great. They succeeded in having a nautical-themed seafood restaurant NOT feel like a Red Lobster and the food and service was outstanding. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place embodies everything I love about Madison.  We live in Chicago but regularly hit Madison for a relaxing weekend getaway that's honestly just as delicious as Chicago.  This trip fell during Lent, so we were in search of a spot for a Friday night fish fry.  After extensive research and the ultimate decision that we didn't want to drive outside the downtown area for a true supper club, Tempest won out.  When we got there we were worried it was way fancier than we wanted, but the service and atmosphere are actually much more casual than they first appear.  The fish fry wasn't on the menu, but I asked about it and they did indeed have it.  $17 for the fish (perch), fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce.  We decide to split that and add on the mussels and chowder for an appetizer.  Oh my gosh, fantastic.  The mussels were awesome, probably one of the best broth preparations I've tried.  The soup seemed pricey at $8, but was a HUGE bowl of rich, fish-packed soup.  And then the fried fish, ahhhh the fried fish.  Perfectly breaded, delicious tartar sauce, all around win.  And even with 3 drinks our bill was something like $75.  Honestly, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"First time there and we immediately liked the atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and helpful with both the menu and our drinks. Speaking of which their mixed drinks were unique and well thought out. Oysters were great as well!"}
{"text":"Do I miss the old Magnus (previous incarnation of this restaurant)? Most certainly. Both the Spanish and Norwegian versions. It was the best bar in Madison, hands down.  But I have to say that Tempest is among the most under-appreciated bar/restaurants in Madison.   Yes, you can go to Merchant, just up the block, but you can't get a seat and you can't hear the person sitting next to you. And the place is just an industrial space. Tempest is genuine plaster walled vintage. And that boat in the front lobby is a solid wood beauty.  Drinks are expertly made, the seafood is fresh, and if you get the #2 tower between 2 couples. you have the equivalent of 4-5 appetizers. Plus the clam shell is beautiful, and if you close your eyes, you are back at Magnus.   Again, one of the most under appreciated bars in Madison."}
{"text":"Right off the bat: this review is coming from someone who's not a big seafood guy. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised here. Drinks are not bad and their cocktail menu is decently inspired. I ordered the Marlin which was actually quite good. Decor of the place is a bit confused: I really want to like the big boat when you come in and sea-inspired pieces, but it just doesn't come off quite right. Everything feels like individual pieces decorating a white blank room, almost like a eating in the middle of an underfilled art gallery. Overall though, we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"These folks have Saturday & Sunday Brunch! This should be highlighted in Google Searches. I'm mad that I never considered it or remembered such.  The brunch menu is egg heavy/reliant upon eggs but WAFFLES are offered.   The Happy Hour includes Rockefeller Oysters so I'm going in today to compare them to (a) their sister restaurant, Tornado Room; (b) Rare, the new steakhouse on the Capitol and (c) Cap Chophouse.   Update forthcoming."}
{"text":"Came here for Friday night fish fry based on a recommendation. They only had bluegill and not the perch today, plus cod as always. The bluegill was well seasoned and fried, but I was honestly very disappointed by how little fish there was. 6 small pieces for $16. The $18 cod that a dining companion got was 2 huge pieces that he said was the best batter he's had. We did get solid sourdough bread to start. I would go elsewhere for fish fry unless you don't eat much - I like having a lot of delicious fish."}
{"text":"Really really good. The food was very good, great selections. The service was top notch. The decor and ambiance were perfect. We will most def go back!"}
{"text":"The food was good at first. Happy hour is a great deal! I had high hopes for this place when I arrived with my friend. We got here a half hour before our party of six and so headed to the bar for cocktails. The high sea is a good drink. Good atmosphere. Those are the only positives I have about this place.   What made this place a two and borderline one star was the service. It was INCREDIBLY slow! Also-happy hour doesn't apply to the seated area-only the bar. I was shocked. It took an hour to get out our food... We asked for our check as soon as the food came because we were running late to our nine o clock trivia. (We sat at our table at 6:45 and ordered at 7:15/20). We got our food at 8:41-I checked the time.   Absolutely unacceptable service here. Would not recommend it. Sardine is a much better place to get food and better service by far.   And the guy mixed up our receipts.   Horrible service."}
{"text":"We went for their oyster happy hour.  It was early and pretty empty, but it's a great space.   We sat at the bar--the bartender was low-key and professional and made some fantastic martinis.  The oysters were well-priced and delicious.  Just one tiny little request-- it would be nice if they wrapped the lemons in cheesecloth like they do at Graze so that seeds wouldn't pop onto the oyster.  That's a really tiny issue, though.  We were very impressed."}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend here for an early Valentine's Dinner on a Sunday. The dining room is very open but cozy all at once; it wasn't very busy, but there was enough of a crowd to provide a nice ambiance. I find it really awkward to be the only two in a dining room so some background noise is always nice. Service was outstanding. Our waiter was friendly and you could tell he was well versed in the art of fine dining.  Their beer and wine list had something for everyone. I ordered beer, she ordered wine. They were of course very good... it's hard to find a bad drink in downtown Madison. I've also heard that their cocktail menu is creative and delicious though I did not order one.  (Quick note: Everything here revolves around the sea. From the name and decor to the design of each dish. If you like seafood this is probably THE place to eat in Madison.)   We shared a scallop plate as our appetizer. Two nice sized scallops, pan-fried with lardons and little diced apples. The brown sugar and brandy combo brought everything together. Tender and savory with the perfect sweetness to it. My favorite dish of the night.  I then had a crab bisque. Quality stuff. The seafood here is just so good. I dipped a little bit of their homemade bread in it, and I don't regret the decision.  For the main course she had the rainbow trout and I had the bucatini. Her plate was simple. Vegetables and a whole breaded trout. Simple, but the breading complemented the fish so well. Gave it a small crunch to each bite of light, airy fish. My plate had mussels and a scallop, and one giant shrimp all served with thick spaghetti noodles. I usually avoid spaghetti, but tasted as great as all the rest.  Finally, for dessert we had an upside down pear cake (served warm) with homemade whipped cream. Again it was, like every other part of the evening, perfect. Especially with a cup of coffee.   Final thought: Eat here! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Food is more than \"just ok\". We order two starters and two main dishes - all good to very good.  Service is ok ( could and should be close to very good, but it's not) Dessert....only 4 option without anything special or creative. We skipped."}
{"text":"Food was very good but it was quite overpriced. Over $140 after tip for two with only a 3 mixed drinks. The waiters seemed a little bored with their job and the place was very empty on a weekday night. I would recommend going on a weekend night for a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"We ate there last night. We had to wait forever to get our main course for below average food."}
{"text":"If you like Seafood you have to add Tempest to your list.  I had an exceptional experience trying Tempest for the first time.  The Oysters were absolutely delicious.  They offer a variety of Oysters From both the East and West Coast.  They also have a selection of clams, mussels, and crab.  Make sure to get one of the towers of hand picked oysters, clams, mussels, and crab by the chef.  You will not be disappointed.  I had the tuna for my main course and it was truly exceptional.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There is nothing, and I mean NOTHING bad about this place. I love it. From the vibe, to the restaurant decor, to the food, everything was great.  I loved the amount of detail and creativity they put into the restaurant. When you walk in there is this large wooden boat, which I've never seen in a restaurant!  I came here for a wedding rehearsal dinner, which was a pretty decent size party, and the experience was great. There was a spread of oysters, cheeses, shrimp, mussels, fruit, calamari, salad, chicken, rice, and crackers. The starters were so good, there was nothing bad. I couldn't stop eating. The servers made sure we had drinks the entire night, and had something on our plate. After the starters, the servers came around with burgers, blue gill sandwich, and shrimp skewers!  After the food, they then brought out key lime pie and some kind of dark chocolate pecan pie that was amazing.  I truly enjoyed this place and highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Service: Subpar. Barely could get our waiters attention, yes I understand when you are busy it is hard to pay attention to ALL of your customers, but waiting for a drink for 25 minutes is a bit of a stretch. Service was one of the main downfalls of the visit.  Atmosphere: Ambiance of the place is great, lively, separated for intimacy, but a bit dirty. The window sills hadn't been cleaned in a while and there were dead bugs on it (which was right next to our table where our food was placed). The whole place looked like it needed a little TLC. I think a remodel in the near future would help, so all the table are a bit larger, even as a party of 2 our table was quite crammed. Maybe some colors on the walls?  Food: Brilliant. Not a single thing wrong with the meal, I had the marlin and it was superb. My boyfriend had a steak with the snow crab. Best crab either of us has tasted in the Midwest. They oysters were fresh and our waiter did a great job answering questions about what was fresh and what we would experience in difference for farmed vs. wild oysters.  We will be stopping by at least once more to see if the service and cleanliness will be improved on. Looking forward to updating my review after our next experience."}
{"text":"So asking me to rate an Oyster place is like asking Tiger Woods to rate a golf course. I grew up eating seafood nearly every day and have eaten seafood in just about every state in the country and several other countries.   For where this restaurant is located the Oysters are of good quality and are fresh. The Blue Points were my favorite. There was no shell in the oyster, they all tasted great and they were detached from the shell so they slide out easily. I admit the cost was a little more than I normally pay but what do you expect a few thousand miles from the ocean. If I wanted a deal I would be here at happy hour."}
{"text":"My dining companion and I went to Oyster for the Happy Hour and we were not disappointed! We spent way more than we had anticipated but I have no regrets. The oysters were delicious. We also ordered the lobster po boy and it was very good! Some of the tastiest food I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"Wow. Straight up some of the best, most unique cocktails I have ever had anywhere! So glad we stopped in for some before-dinner cocktails last weekend; we had an absolutely great experience.   Walked in right after they opened at 5:30 and told the first server we saw that we'd just be drinking. He led us into the bar and when we told him that we'd be joined by another couple, he suggested we sit in the seashell. You have to see it to appreciate it but basically one end of the bar area has been formed to resemble the inside of a shell-complete with a round 'pearl' light right in front of it. So unique and somehow not as tacky as you'd think. I doubt I would even have noticed it had the server not pointed it out.   Very cool bar area and dining area as well. Love the old boat sitting in the middle of the front room. It takes up a lot of space but really adds a lot to the atmosphere.   The cocktail menu will have you saying 'oooo that sounds good' with every entry. It was very hard to choose so I just started at the top. The jalapeño tequila drink first on the list was simply outstanding. The server was wonderful and made great suggestions. Never steered us wrong. All cocktails that everyone tried were excellent. Even the sake cilantro one was great and I wasn't so sure about it since sake's not normally my thing. Yum!   Someday I'll have to come and try the food!"}
{"text":"Hoorayy for my first yelp event ever! And a huge thanks to Tempest for hosting us. (:   My two cents:   Cocktails - sound good on paper, but I wasn't particularly impressed by my Batida or Tokyo Schooner. The bartenders pour with a heavy hand, so I still ended the night on quite a high note...but I guess I like my drinks tasting a little more like the mixers and a little less like the alcohol.   Scallop - 5 stars. Self-proclaimed pescatarian? Not anymore! I just ate all the bacon on top...and I don't feel guilty at all!  Oysters - Fresh, fishy, perfect. Gone way too quickly.    Bar service is slow, but prices are reasonable during happy hour. I do think I will be back eventually to try their full menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent. I am getting the feeling all the Madisonites flee to the 'burbs after work and leave all these wonderful restaurants empty. Tempest is another marvelous treasure in the pool of Madison gastronomic pleasures. I made sure to get all my tastings in before happy hour expired. I started with one of every oyster and a couple of clams. It is so much fun eating your way around the sample platter of little mollusks. They were all delicious and quickly slurped up with their brine. I also double ordered cocktails for the discount and the Awniker had a fantastic back of the throat burn from the jalapeno. I was craving a Mai Tai and the Cabin Boy was a great sub; a citrus fruity version of a Mai Tai. I followed with the conch fritters; good tasty with a hint of some Indian spice but if you plan to eat a belly full, they could be skipped. Next I tried to be a little healthy and had every intention of stopping sooner but I ordered the asparagus and, thankfully, abbreviated happy hour smoke stack with some saltines. The Stack was perfect blend of smoked seafood and egg... I didn't understand the pickled stuff and how that was supposed to play into the dish. By now, I really should have just said, \"Check, please.\" but instead I asked about the Oyster Po'boy and then the the Surf and Turf with oyster sandwich; crap. I wasn't exactly full but I knew if it wasn't quick my tummy would finally get the signal to my brain to stop eating. Unfortunately, the burger took a little longer and I got the DING I'm done and the burger arrives WITH fries. I picked up the warm soft to the touch bun and looked for the morsels of fried oysters tucked under the bun. Lovely!!! It was delicious; I did all I good to shove it in my mouth to pack everything tighter into my belly. Smartly, I asked for the check and the fries to go and I am now enjoying the perfectly fried fries, writing this review, and watching Dark Knight. Through all of this Avery was a delight the whole time for the 2 hours that I sat and engorged myself. I was never wanting or waiting, except for the burger, and I am just glad she did not offer \"And finally, monsieur, a wafer-thin mint.\" I will definitely be coming back here before I leave to enjoy the happy hour a little more."}
{"text":"Tempest is so cool, from the entrance to the bar to the dining room, there are no bad spots to sit back and enjoy a bite to eat or a drink.   When my wife and I lived in Madison we used to enjoy eating in the bar's lounge area and hanging out in the clam shell. Yup, the clam shell!   If the bar isn't your thing, never fear, the dining area is beautiful.   Service is friendly and prompt.  Cocktails are delicious.  Food is on point."}
{"text":"Romantic, yet ok with friends as well, unusual, great food...if you want to go to Red Lobster, please do. However, if you want an experience, a conversation over great food, then this is the place. And the best snackie thingies, hands down, in the square area after work. Good beers on tap."}
{"text":"Wow... EXCELLENT seafood. I don't like oysters so I can't speak for the oysters but I did have several other types of seafood that were all amazing. The mussel appetizer comes with a lot of mussels that are so delicious you will want to gobble them up in 2 minutes. For the main I ordered the shrimp, scallops, and grits. Don't expect grits- it's more like a sauce/paste, but the shrimp is tasty and the scallops melt in your melt like butter! It also includes a large piece of pork that is possibly one of the tastiest pieces of pork I've ever had. I would come here and order the same thing again if I revisit the area. It looks spooky from outside but it's a nice ambiance inside."}
{"text":"You can serve me terrible food. You can mix me a crappy cocktail.  Your ambiance can fall flat.  You can even charge me more than I want to pay.  But take note Tempest (and really any other business in Madison and beyond) you can't be complacent. I mean you can, but I will not patronize your business nor will I recommend it.   When you turn the lights on, polish flatware and open your doors you are entering into an agreement with those that are coming to spend money that you want their business. But after 4 visits and an event that I unfortunately brought 28 people out for, you have done nothing to make me think you a. want my business, b. care to make money. So I have to ask... why show up to work?   Tonight was the last straw. My friend and I were sitting at the bar for ten minutes before someone came over not to ask us what we wanted to drink or to show us menus, but to stand there. To stand there and look at us blankly until we asked if happy hour was still going on. He said yes and lobbed the conversation back our way, didn't go over the happy hour specials of which there are many. I felt terrible for suggesting we grab light bites and drinks to this friend who had never been to Tempest.   *flash forward*  I'm not eating sugar right now and the brown sugar sauce that tops their scallops is entirely too sweet, so I asked for seared scallops with the bacon lardons that typically top the dish but not the sauce. I explained if the kitchen wasn't interested in accommodating my request and leaving the sauce out, I'd find something else. Surprise, the scallops came out with the cloyingly sweet sauce and this is how the next few moments went:  BARTENDER: Yeah, I said just the scallops and lardons, so maybe they can't separate the lardons from the sauce?  COREY: Ok, well I don't eat sugar, so I can't really eat these, there's no way to get just seared scallops, no sauce? BARTENDER: I mean, that's what I asked for, so I guess they can't do it. Did you want these?  (I'm sort of fuming at this point) COREY: No, I mean I can't do the sugar so.... BARTENDER: They'd be on the house.  GO TO THE KITCHEN AND SAY THESE CAME UP WRONG, CAN YOU SIMPLY SEAR SCALLOPS AND PUT BACON ON THEM? What's the challenge here?   *flash forward some more*  Drinks went empty, food was eaten, and it took forever to catch someone's eye to get refills or order more. Why? Because it was more important for a gaggle of servers to talk with the bartenders about what a proper wine pour looks like. I counted 5 at one point staring at the same glass of white wine, then repeating this behavior 15 and 25 minutes later. So detail oriented.  Last up, the gent that cases the joint, a manager I assume, does laps around the restaurant every time I've been there, but never asks how we're doing. And that's really the crux of my issue. I know full well a business can't be 100% \"on\" 100% of the time, we all have bad days. But when leadership at the top has no vested interest in how people spending hard earned money feel about their establishment, that trickles down, and I want no part of it.   There are plenty of restaurants in town that serve seafood by people who are interested in striking up conversation, making menu recommendations and righting wrongs that may occur when things go awry in the kitchen. I'll go to those places, a giant wooden boat and tea lights don't do it for me."}
{"text":"Love this place for Happy Hour Monday through Fridays from 4-7! Really nice place inside, although the lighting is a little dark. I've never actually come here outside of Happy Hour (because prices, yikes) but $2 oysters and shrimp cocktails I could never say no to. The oysters are delightfully fresh and come out on a beautiful tower. They always feature different east coast and west coast oysters to choose from and the waiters are always very helpful in deciding what to order (or if you're me, you just close your eyes and point). Simply awesome, fat, juicy shrimp cocktail that come with cocktail sauce and horseradish in a small martini glass.   Appetizers like the calamari are always a good pairing as well. Cocktails at Tempest are also phenomenal and surprisingly strong so beware! Great place to come with friends after a long week to kick back, try some new oysters, and get a little tips."}
{"text":"Bright and fun on the inside. Food was good. Service was friendly and on the spot."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim in the spring, it was amazing! I would give it 4.5 stars.  The oysters were delicious, we split the special which was prime rib and yorkshire pudding, and we still talk about the meal 6 months later. It is pricey, but worth the one or twice a year splurge."}
{"text":"Intimate and low-lit space evocative of a hidden European cafe that only the locals know about. Great for a date night or small gathering of friends... noise can carry easily but otherwise a lovely place to spend a night out."}
{"text":"As a 19 y.o., I can't speak to any of the booze options at this place, but I certainly can speak to everything else. Took my significant other here for her birthday, and we were both very pleased. Smoked sampler was out of this world. She is a very picky eater, and she raved about their salmon dish. I tried the rainbow trout, which was presented in an interesting fashion (head, skin, and tail included), but tasted fantastic. On that note, I would say I have a bone to pick, literally, as I found several in my fish. Our service was excellent and very quick, and to top things off, when our waitress learned it was my girlfriend's birthday, dessert was on the house! It was a wonderful experience. One of my favorite seafood places I've ever been to, and I LOVE my seafood.  I understand what many said about poor lighting, but I would put my two cents in to say, it's not unusually dark... It was certainly dim, but for a dining room with not a lot of privacy and plenty of candles, I thought it was quite enjoyable...   Dined 10/09/15"}
{"text":"Visited several times for dinner service and haven't been let down. A hidden gem not far from the square, whether you're looking for oysters, fresh seafood or even a solid steak, Tempest's menu has something for everyone. Looking at their late night and happy hour menus, I think I'll try visiting earlier and later in the day soon. Many of the great items I love offered at lower prices. Solid cocktails as well."}
{"text":"I agree with Ariel W. all the way around. Great happy hour specials, especially in Madison where I have yet to find an awesome happy hour.  The smoke stack was amazing! Especially for $3, totally worth it. Order two! The oysters were good, many varieties available.   Service was extremely slow...perhaps they expected fewer patrons on a Tuesday night, but we sat with empty glasses for at least 20 minutes, waiting to order a second drink and food (first drink was ordered from the bar).   Nevertheless, I'll give the Tempest a second chance. If they expand their happy hour food offerings and hire a few more servers, this could be a regular go-to happy hour spot."}
{"text":"I've been to Tempest twice now and enjoyed both experiences.  The service was welcoming and attentive, we were seated immediately and checked on just the right amount during our meals.  The she crab soup was delicious, with chunks of real crab in light tomato cream base that doesn't overpower the flavor of the crab.  The shrimp and scallops in the shrimp, scallop, and pork belly dish were perfection.  The pork belly, while good, was too much - I'd have preferred a smaller piece with more shrimp or scallops.  The decor is simple, but fits the nautical theme well without being campy.  Oysters and cocktails are a nice addition to a good meal.  Overall I highly recommend Tempest."}
{"text":"We visited tempest for my birthday last weekend and my wife and I were very excited to experience a special night (away from our little ones as well). I ordered their special, a Lobster Pot which was billed as a fresh water lobster boiled on a bed of shrimp, mussels, andouille sausage and veggies.  When it came, the lobster was tougher than normal and over cooked.  Below the lobster was a couple pieces of andouille and veggies, oh yeah...  One shrimp.  When I brought the discrepancy to the servers attention, she dropped a plate with four cold mussels and A shrimp on our table.  As we were settling our check, we brought it to a employees attention.  After conferring with someone, they took our drinks off which came to $20.  My wife shared her King Crab Kegs which were quite good.  Bummer my birthday dinner was ruined."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday, there were two tables outside and it was the first beautiful day in Madison after a long time so we wanted to sit outside. One table was taken by a couple, but we got seated at the other right away. I wouldn't judge a place harshly on a Friday during happy hour but this was just that bad. After 5 minutes of sitting, a person came to give us water - - she said our waitress would be out soon. Ten minutes pass, someone else comes out, quickly sets plates on our table and walks away before we can ask where our waitress was. Meanwhile, the couple next to us has their drinks and soon after gets their appetizers. They even said \"wow this is the fastest we ever got them\". Their waitress had her back to us the entire time and we felt extremely uncomfortable to run after her. By this time we waited for about 15-20 minutes and happy hour was almost over. We said if we had to sit there for another 5 minutes without anyone coming out we would leave... Surprise, no one shows up. We get up and walk away down the street. We turn back around to look at our seats, and SOMEONE WAS CLEANING OFF OUR TABLE. So someone was able to quickly clean the table, but not even take our order? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've been back to Tempest twice since my first review and I'm bumping them to a 5. Biggest reason: consistency. Every experience at Tempest has been thoroughly enjoyable with a warm and inviting ambiance, excellent staff, amazingly fresh and delicious seafood, and fun had by all! My first review is more comprehensive but Tempest has earned the fifth star in my book!"}
{"text":"While I have been here many times for dinner and loved it, this review is in reference to a party I held at Tempest. Chip, the manager was incredibly helpful and responsive. He helped me figure out the best food to serve for my guests, where to set up the tables, food and drink and every detail for the party - all via email, my preferred method of communication. He was prompt in responding and happy to help with suggestions. When the night of the party arrived, his staff had prepared a beautiful space with many bar tables and chairs, a convenient area to place the food and easy access to the bar. We also had a server dedicated just to our party who was very personable, kind and helpful. They, and the many bartenders who served us, made the night seamless and fun. The food was wonderful and refreshed without anyone having to ask."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was awesome and so was the food. The bartender and manager,Chip, were amazing! Took great care of us.  Thanks Tempest! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! It's pricey but for a special occasion, it's perfect! Came here twice with my boyfriend for our anniversary and both times I've loved it. It was about $80 worth of food for two people but you will not be disappointed. The food was DELICIOUS! If you like sea food and want to go out somewhere fancy, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a drink and a bite at the bar before an event I was going to elsewhere.  I was happy to see a Happy Hour.  I had a nice German Pilsner for 4 dollars (a buck off) in a tall glass.  I ordered four oysters and the conch fritters.  Tempest does a good job bringing in good oysters.  The Naked Cowboys were large and tasty.  I had heard good things about them and they didn't disappoint!  The Conch Fritters were good but fried maybe a little too long.  They were a little on the darker side of golden.  The sauce served with them saved the day.  It was so good I was thinking of other things I would like to add the sauce too.    The bartenders on duty were nice and attentive.  I was brought a water just prior to my meal being served without even being asked.  I was checked on and acknowledged the duration of my visit.  I would like to try Happy Hour again...maybe a dinner too."}
{"text":"fresh & delicious clams in the Midwest? I am in!! Very good food.... a bit pricey but not completely out of control...... we had a fabulous meal and will be back and will hope that our server is better next time!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Deceiving from outside but it's very decent inside. Simple decor but well appointed. Great quality food and exceptional service. We had the mussels which is pretty big fir an appetizer. There was a sword fish special which was very tasty.  The wine list is extensive and they have a wide range of prices. This was a nice surprise to have a place with such a nice wine list in Madison.  The desserts were awful!  We got this brownie crunch bar thing that you can easily buy at a \"Gas Station\" counter. Yes, it was that bad and goofy. The pouched pear tart was just as bad. They really need to hire a pastry chef or simply sell cookies or only cheese for dessert."}
{"text":"We had a group of 4 and went to for dinner around 8. We only had to wait 10 minutes, about the time to grab some drinks. I had the windjammer specialty cocktail, which was very good. Service was great, would definitely come back for dinner.   Appetizers: Shrimp Cocktail Entree, Smoke Stack, and Fruits de Mer  The smoke stack had a combination of different seafood in an elegant tasty package. Highly recommended.   Entrees:  Shrimp Po' Boy - standard Po' boy but I will note that the breading was great on the shrimp. Often times you see the breading coming off mid-way through the sandwich - not here.   Blue Marlin - probably the best dish. Uniquely prepared and fantastic taste.   Special of the day:  Friday Perch Fish Fry - classic fish fry, well done.  Duck Breast - Very rich and full of flavor. Tasty but a little too much fat left over."}
{"text":"We sat outside and enjoyed great service as well as good food. The shrimp poboy was delicious and the tower was outstanding. We kept adding people to our group-- my kids arrived in shifts, and our server was quick to accommodate them and bring them food. Eating here was a spur of the moment decision but we were delighted that we did!"}
{"text":"I have always heard of how wonderful this place was, and today I finally got a chance to experience it myself! I came during the happy hours. First of all, the restaurant is very beautiful. The shells made me feel like I was a mermaid eating under the sea lol  I tried the happy hour menu:  1) Oysters-I added the lemon juice and vinegar (with garlic?) to all. Naked Cowboys-They are a must try! They were so fresh, sweet and crispy at the same time. They almost let me scream when I ate them! Wianno-also a sweet and crispy one, but not as outstanding as the naked cowboys  Shigoku-a west coast oyster recommended by the staff. Didn't like this one that much. It's more salty. But what is really interesting about these oysters is that you could really taste and discover how different they are from place to place!  2) Smoke Stack- basically fish salad. The top layer was smoked salmon and the bottom was a mix of greens, some white fish and eggs. You might get sick of the taste after a few bites, but I guess that's what the onions and pickles are there for. The sour cleansed out the taste buds really well. And as suggested by the staff, do not forget to save some bread to go with the fish! This was the most impressive and special item I had for today!  3) Scallop Didn't like this too much. But I guess if people have a sweet tooth, this might be the one. It comes with a sweet sauce, maybe caramel, with apples and pork in it. The scallop was a little overlooked for me, but it was very flavorful within.  Had a good time here! Don't forget to pair your meal with a nice wine!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, with good service and good food. It's a great place for a nice date (think Valentine's Day). My one complaint would be with their cocktail selection, which left me wanting... But the fish and Brussels sprouts were excellent!"}
{"text":"Great food. Four of us had a tower, chowder, cakes, slaw, fresh lobster, mussels, real fish & chips. Would be 5 star but service was pokey."}
{"text":"Fireworks in my mouth!! Holy moly I've never had anything so delish! Every bite of every plate was spectacular!!!   The fish corn chowder was absolutely amazing. I highly highly recommend you check this place out when you're in Madison. It did not disappoint.   Exceeding every expectation from other friends who recommended we try it!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Tempest.  It's cozy, they have great food, and it might be the best happy hour in Madison. Did I mention the happy hour? It goes til 7 (the latest of the happy hours on the square) and features a lot of their items from the dinner menu at half-price.   My favorite favorite happy hour item is the Smoke Stack. It's a combo of fresh seafood including smoked salmon, caviar, trout, and whitefish. The conch fritters are also quite fabulous. We ordered the shrimp cocktail and the fish cakes; they were decent, but not our favorites.  Their drinks are decent too, although not quite the steal as the happy hour food. They have house wine for $6 and last time I was there, it was a NZ sauv blanc. Score!  The space is cozy with a different feel in each area. The dining room is intimate and dim. The front room is bright and friendly, while the bar is lively. I look forward to going to Tempest just to try out each room.  When every other happy hour on the square ends at 6, head here!"}
{"text":"I've only experienced the Tempest bar. With limited time in Madison, I had a list of places friends suggested I go, and I tried to cram them all in my short trip. What I can say is that every dish I saw looked delicious (I did sneak some tastes), and I'd happily return to eat a proper meal. As a business traveler that frequents solo dining experiences, I can say that the team at Tempest was awesome. All were incredibly friendly and quite amusing. The bar, led by Nick that night, was entertaining (pony up at the bar and you'll be happy). He's a great mixologist, taught me how to peel a lemon as a garnish, and we all tried some new concoctions.  I highly recommend stopping in. My girlfriend gave a great recommendation and it's worth passing on."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Service had a slow start but ended up being pretty good although we were bummed to hear the specials being told at the next table - our server was so delayed in the beginning that she didn't tell us the specials. The shrimp cocktail was AMAZING minus one poop shoot not being removed. That sauce though .. yum! Don't get the scallops. They are so laden with a sugar reduction sauce that all you taste is sweet. For $15, you want to make sure you taste those beautiful sea scallops you're paying for. The bread was disappointing. Only a very tiny bit of soft bread vs the amount of hard scrape the roof of your mouth crust. Loved the raspberry point and Irish point oysters. Caesar salad was ok.  My boyfriend and I split the 8 oz tenderloin and scalloped potatoes for $34. Those potatoes were amazing! Delicious. Yum. The steak .... well hmm. Although it was tender, it wasn't a filet. Or at least didn't resemble one at all. It tasted like pot roast. Not that pot roast isn't good, but $34 for a steak, you want that baby to be like a delicious buttery filet. I would not recommend the steak at all.  We will return but it will be for the oysters and shrimp cocktail only and perhaps we will sit at the bar so service is improved."}
{"text":"Cute place. Food was yummy. One strange thing... They delivered steak and potatoes first and then 5 minutes later, out came our Brussels sprouts.  Service could have been better and woman hostess could have been nicer."}
{"text":"Tried Tempest for the first time on a Friday night at 6:30. Trying to find parking was a hassle. But once we got there our table was waiting for us.  Dining room was not super busy, but getting our food was slow, and rarely saw our server.  Sharing the fried seafood appetizer was good and plentiful, but slightly over cooked. After waiting an hour for our entrees we inquired of the server.  She said they were just being plated....but 10 minutes later and still no food, we tracked down the manager. He went to personally check on our meals, and said 5 more minutes.... Sorry your kitchen was SO SLOW we walked out. Not sure why it took FOREVER for 1 salmon and 2 soft shell crab.... we would have liked to actually EAT them...."}
{"text":"The food was good but it took almost 45 mins to bring the food to us. The environment was nice and quiet."}
{"text":"I paid Tempest a visit during Restaurant Week at the end of July and was kicking myself afterwards for not having stopped in sooner because Tempest is fantastic. The atmosphere, service, and quality of the food is on point.   We dug into a 3 course meal for an incredibly fair price of $35, and what's more is the portion sizes didn't appear to be scaled down in the least. During restaurant week, you'd expect restaurants to provide you with the same food items, at a cheaper price only because the amount of food is substantially less. This was not the case at Tempest. After a delicious appetizer, entree, and dessert, we left here stuffed.  While the namesake oysters were not on the restaurant week menu, we knew that was something we had to experience. We simply ordered one west coast and one east coast oyster and both were fresh and well worth the extra expense.  Then for my first course I chose the She Crab Soup with King Crab & flying fish roe. I am typically not a soup person, which makes this selection curious, but I had heard great things and having now tasted it, I am glad I did. The soup was very creamy and had a unique yet delicious flavor to boot.  The second course was the Blue Marlin, broiled with hazelnut pesto lime aioli & fried leeks. I loved this fish. It was a large filet and I polished off every last bite. The outer crust was perfection and the taste of the pesto and salty crunch from the leeks were great with this particular fish.  For dessert I chose the Chocolate Caramel Walnut Tart and boy was this a large slice of decadence. From the thick layer of hardened chocolate to the gooey caramel interior and interspersed walnuts, my mouth salivated with anticipation between bites. I don't recall putting my fork down until I had near cleaned my plate of this very rich, very indulgent dessert.   I took advantage of a few spots during this latest restaurant week, but Tempest has stuck out in my mind as one of the best."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and it was definitely worth it. We were able to get some happy hour specials, which are great (they go from 4  to 7 pm on week days). First off, the cocktails are spectacular. Second, we are novices to oysters and I ate all west coat oysters which I would recommend to newbies; they're a little more delicate and softer in flavor. We also had their fish cakes which were super, super good. If you like crab cakes you will love these as well. I had a lobster roll and my boyfriend had a scallop and pork belly entree, which were both very good and tasty, but honestly I'd probably come back just to do appetizers, oysters, and drinks. Also, very dim atmosphere, which I liked."}
{"text":"We came to this place to have a birthday dinner.  We had a great cocktail shrimp and fruits de mer as our appetizers. The latter came in a huge portion but so good.  Tho it's cocktail, the waiter confirmed no alcohol involved. I guess the name is coming from the appearance. Maybe.  Out tips: If you wanna save some money but still want to have some delicacy, the appetizer is more than enough.  Ps. We brought our main dishes home as we were still full from the appetizer."}
{"text":"I just got chance to write this review for my experience during RW 18. The $35 for three courses is a great deal as for the normal menu, most entree itself price is 25+. For this 35 I tried the combination of hanger steak and butter lobster, which both yummy yummy yummy. For me, tempest RW food taste level is definitely higher than the most other restaurants. In addition, it has six choices for entree during RW (comparing to three choices for others). The crab soup is delicious as well. Key lime pie is good.  My husband tried cioppino (seafood combination), apple cherry crisp and clams.   You deserve to try it either restaurant week or normal time. By the way, smoke stack and oysters during happy hour is nice deal as well!!! Smoke stack is beautiful as oysters are juicy."}
{"text":"Went here on the first night of Restaurant week winter 2016, so I wasn't expecting everything to be perfect.  However, to have to wait about 15 minutes for our table (even though we had a reservation) and then another 15 min to be greeted by anyone, was a little ridiculous.  We were grateful to the server who took the initiative to help us after noticing we hadn't been.    Other than the service not being up to par (which is understandable during this busy time)  Almost everything else was perfect.  I had the steak and lobster which was a great value for the price.  The steak was delicious for a hangar steak.  The lobster however was a little under cooked and could have been cleaned a little better.  Either way, I enjoyed my night here and will definitely be back to see how the full menu and service compares to that of restaurant week.  Another Positive was I loved the decor.  It was very romantic and quaint, something different."}
{"text":"Wow!  I took my fiancee here to celebrate. We have lived in Madison for a long time but have only recently started getting adventurous with all the great food available. The interior of the restaurant has a very cool nautical theme. We arrived early, at the very start of service, so we had the dining room to ourselves for at least a little while. Our server was very attentive, knowledgeable and kind. We tried a lot of new things and he was always willing to help out.   We started with some cocktails--I had a very sweet whiskey drink and she had some kind of warm red wine. Neither one was probably something we would regularly order but very good nonetheless. We also had some oysters, obviously. It was our first time and the waiter did a good job of helping us pick them out. Very fresh and flavorful. We have been converted.   We then moved onto our appetizer--steamed mussels in some kind of butter and wine sauce. Again, very good. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. My fiancee, who had never had them, was converted once again.   For our entree, we both had the shrimp, scallops and grits. Very artfully presented, with pork belly and some kind of yummy sauce. I had a local Pale Ale with the dinner. We ended with a key lime pie.  All in all it was an unforgettable meal. Service was great and food was great. Definitely one of the best meals I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"In town for a visit, thought I'd try something new.    I heard good things about Tempest from friends, and I loved it.  The decor is really unique, and includes a beautifully aged wooden boat and a fun clamshell for seating.  I went for happy hour, and my waitress Lindsey was very helpful in showing me around the menu.  (I'm a bit of an oyster novice, myself.)  I started off with a great cocktail called a Tokyo Schooner made with sake and ginger.  Delicious.  My dining partner had an amazing bloody mary with cilantro vodka.  She says it's one of the best cocktails she's ever had.  We also had a couple oysters, which were fantastic.  Very fresh.  They really didn't need any sauce, but there was a house vinagrette with scallions that complemented them perfectly.  But my favorite was the Smoke Stack, a great little stack of smoked trout, whitefish salad, and vegetables that was superb.  The best part?  It was so inexpensive!  I'm looking forward to coming back when I'm in Madison again."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Loved the oysters service and location. We've taken customers here twice and they did real well!!  Suggest this one highly"}
{"text":"Went to Tempest earlier this week, looking forward to sampling the Lobster Roll. Unfortunately we were very disappointed! The lobster was chewy and overdone, and it was on a hoagie bun w/lettuce, mayo, and pickles?? I have never had a Lobster Roll like this one. I know we are in the midwest, but try to make it somewhat authentic.... The tuna appetizer was well done, as were the matchstick french fries. I will give this this restaurant another try, but definitely not order the Lobster Roll."}
