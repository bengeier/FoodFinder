{"text":"I declare....Best....Fish....Fry....EVER!  We've just started coming here, having only been introduced to this hidden gem last month. Thebestfishfryever!  Usually these little hole-in-the-wall places only accept cash, but they accept Credit Cards!  We've gotten the fried shrimp, grilled shrimp, fried cod, and baked cod - all perfection. The fried cod is lightly battered and fried, no heavy coating here. And no slimy fish after the batter has fallen off, the batter hugs each lump pieces of cod from arrival to the dip in the tartar sauce. The shrimp specials are something sort of amazing; jumbo, mass of perfectly cooked, devined shrimp are packed with flavor. They don't need any sauce. The texture is firm, crunchy, like the shrimp version of al dente! No chewiness here!  They don't have any drink specials on Fridays but the most expensive thing our group has ever gotten is a $4.75 old fashioned.   The best part is you can just come as you are, it's local but not \"judgy\" local like your most watering holes. Noise level is loud, so I don't recommend this as an intimate spot to take someone out on their first date."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favorite bar and grill restaurants. I am SO happy to find an amazing fish-fry only 10 minutes away from home! Prior to this (for my entire 20 years in the Madison area) I have been going to Oakcrest Tavern in Middleton for my fish fry fix. (I still think they have an amazing fish fry). But Paoli Pub and Grill is right up there with them! We've tried the perch, cod, and deep fried shrimp. All amazing! You get a choice of potatoes and the cowboy potatoes (a loaded hash brown casserole) are to die for. Prices are very reasonable! I have also been here for breakfast on Sunday and it's very good as well. Great bloody Mary's too!  Go to Paoli! It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"We decided to branch out a little bit last weekend on our quest to try every Friday fish fry in the area.  This little pub is your classic old time Midwest bar & grill, complete with video games up against the wall and decor that dates back to the 1980's.  No trendy brew pub IPA-style stuff happening here.  This is a no frills establishment; the kind that I generally prefer, especially for fish fry.  We arrived during the height of the Friday rush, and it was indeed very crowded.  It seemed like a miracle at the time but we were seated within a few minutes (more on that in a bit). There's also an option to sit on a patio out back but the weather wasn't that nice so we stayed inside.  Spotting the regulars versus the first timers is easy here.  Kind of comical, actually.  People who haven't been here (like us) look around with worried expressions, thinking they will wait an hour for a table.  The regulars just mosy on up, grab a drink and hang.  It doesn't take long for tables to open up.  People are moving in and out pretty quickly.  We both ordered fried cod and a couple drinks.  We also ordered some cheese curds.  Our food came so fast it was like they already had it ready.  They probably do.  That's not necessarily a good thing, of course.  But our fish was fresh and fantastic.  Very crispy outside and moist inside.  Not overcooked at all.  We ordered the hashbrown casserole as our side, and it's yummy - cheese and onions mixed in with the potatoes.  The cheese curds were just OK.  Nothing wrong with them, but not special.  The coleslaw is the same.  Creamy and chopped super-fine, kind of like KFC.  All told, we were in and out in an hour and had a great meal.  Not too bad for a small pub in a tiny town.  If you want to try something new, yet familiar, give this place a try."}
{"text":"We came to this small town just to spend the night. This nice little pub was a great place to eat. We are a family of 5 with very diverse tastes and even food allergies. Everyone was happy! The pizza, burgers, wraps and salads left everyone satisfied. The Service was fantastic and friendly as well. The bartender suggested a great IPA that is locally made. They accommodated all of our requests with a smile and great attitude. I would definitely come back if I'm ever passing through again."}
{"text":"One word: \"Paoli Burger\"  = 1/3rd lb, bacon, ham, cheese, bbq on the best bun you will ever have. I am still recovering from the last one I had a week ago.  Cheese curds are winners also. Excellent rural Wisconsin place that's not too far away from Madison."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch always a daily special offer"}
{"text":"Classic Friday Night Fish Fry Joint. Although I've heard the burgers are great as well.   I had the perch breaded instead battered. It was fantastic, nicely seasoned with a bit of crunch. I had it with the baked potato. But you have a choice of baked, hash browns, or cowboy potatoes. You also get a roll - nothing special but a necessity for a decent fish fry. You also get a decent cole slaw.   Companion had the baked cod - but digged the cole slaw - she had three of them!  I'd come back - this is a classic tavern with a consistent food and really friendly staff. You know my mantra -- Eat at the local joints!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here after an evening paddle on the Sugar River, and I am sure glad I did. The bartender who took our drink and food orders was friendly and efficient, and the outdoor seating in back was comfortable and quiet.  I ordered a 1/3 lb hamburger with pickles and onions and some waffle fries. Both were superb. The hamburger was thick and juicy, and the bun was a lighter type I like, toasted to perfection. The pickle chips were kosher deli style and very flavorful. The waffle fries were cooked exactly to the right level of crispiness without being too hard or brittle. I have trouble eating any type of fry if it is overcooked. If anything, I like mine under cooked and these were almost under cooked, but not quite. Perfect. The prices are pretty reasonable overall, and they do have free Wi-Fi - you just have to ask the waitstaff or bartender for the password.  I'll be coming back here again to try the breakfast some morning before or after trout fishing."}
{"text":"Yummy! I am going to add this burger joint as a stop on my seasonal Paoli trip.  I like to stop at the UW surplus, onto Paoli Clay company to pick up clay and glazes, across the street to Cluck for fun chicken shopping, and now HERE for a fabulous burger- so juicy- great, friendly, fast service!   Now we are off to the Duluth Trading outlet in Belleville.  I highly recommend this small town bar  Paoli Clay Mike has a great bumper sticker up in his store. It says: \"Paoli- We have everything but gas!\""}
