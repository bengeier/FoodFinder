{"text":"Old Doria was better. I found they had a very small and unreliable menu. One man service is annoying but he was cheery and kind ( it was my grandmothers birthday and he gave us a candle on our dessert:)).  The pizza was disappointing and so thin there was a hole in it. However on a brighter note there chocolate torta was divine. Great place for a coffee and snack 7/10"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch and dinner. Fresh, local food that's also healthy oriented but doesn't compromise flavour. Love the tomato salad with peaches, mmmmmmmm.   They have a great patio and it's a great spot for a great meal. Great for lunch dates, coffee and other meetings.   They have some wine but need some local offerings to help pair with their tasty food. The current wine offerings are a bit heavy for their food. Other than that great service and their coffees are excellent. Iced latte was perfect."}
{"text":"My Mumsy-in-law and I stopped in one morning for a coffee. We were dressed quite casually, perhaps far below the average customer of this place. Not like bums or anything, you know... baseball hat and jeans kinda wear.  We sat down at the patio and were promptly shooed out by the manager indicating that the patio was reserved for diners only. I was miffed but wasn't sure how quickly they might fill up with their brunch patrons so we obliged.  20 minutes later, we walked by to see a small group of coffee-sipping, designer-toting twats on the patio. None were dining.  Up yours Doria."}
{"text":"The food is average. If you have a dog with you don't come here. Sat out on the patio for brunch, left my dog on the outside tied up. The manager routinely checked to make sure he wasn't getting underneath the patio. Seems strange to have a patio if dogs cant be there. apparently they have a customer who regularly complains about dogs? Even though my dog is small. If he even tried sitting under my seat thw manager would come around and tell him to sit out in the sweltering sun."}
{"text":"Great place. Enjoy eating the freshly made food. Best tiramisu and coffee. Try it you won't be disappointed.  LM"}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner with two other friends. We decided to try it out after hearing that there would be a wait for the patio at the Rebel House. They have a lovely patio at Doria  and a bright seating area inside with large, wide windows open to give the feeling as though you are sitting on their patio.   The menu is fairly limited, generally featuring salads and pizzas with a few paninis. I got the funghi salad (mushrooms, parmesean, arugula, brown butter vinaigrette), which I believe was $12 (or it might have been $11). I asked to substitute tomatoes for the parmesean and for the vinaigrette to be switched to a balsamic and served on the side. The waitress assured me this would be possible and even checked with the chef first before confirming with me. When the salad arrived, there wasn't any parmesean, which was great, but there also weren't any tomatoes. In addition, the salad was covered with breadcrumbs (not listed on the menu), and the salad was oily, despite the fact that I asked for dressing on the side. Needless to say I was disappointed with my meal.   Our server was pleasant, although she seemed rather young and wasn't particularly attentive. I liked that the kitchen was directly in the restaurant, and it was clear that everything was made to order.  I would return and would likely try a different dish."}
{"text":"Doria is the renovated Cafe Doria, a Rosedale institution for many years. It's a comfortable neighbourhood spot with good coffee and a nice menu of salads and pizza. Some of the old pizza favourites have been retained. Prices are reasonable especially for Rosedale. Nice spot for coffee and a snack or pizza with a nice glass of wine."}
{"text":"I have been going to Doria for years but the new owners have really cleaned it up and given it a fresh, clean look.  The pizzas are AMAZING and the salads fresh and innovative....they offer two mains at dinner in addition to pizzas and salads etc.....Love the new hosts and staff and chefs.....best Margherita pizza in the city."}
