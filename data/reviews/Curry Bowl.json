{"text":"Excellent food. Must try the buffet. One of the best Indian restaurants in the valley. Biryani is delicious and authentic."}
{"text":"This review is only for my online order experience.  I ordered yellow lentils, butter chicken, riatha and naan bread (Total $30.00).  The food was good but the cost was very high for this meal.  The take away portions for the butter chicken and lentils is quite small for the price.  I wouldn't again pay $10.95 for what is really a side portion of lentils nor would I pay $11.95 for a small portion of butter chicken.  They also forgot to pack my raitha and my daughter had to drive back to go collect that.  Also, they didn't make the lentils I ordered and instead of calling they just made some other lentils and replace them with the lentils I ordered.  It all tasted good, but not worth ordering entrees online for take away."}
{"text":"I agree with Nicole C.  My wife and I have been eating here once a week for a long time. The buffet is really really delicious . I don't do a lot of reviews but am glad to give the Curry Bowl a 5 STAR. Fantastic food"}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT!! Our family is from Northern India - so we are very, very picky when it comes to rating Indian food. :-) The new management team is so nice and always smiling. Customers who rate this food poorly must be related to the previous owners of Bay Leaf Cafe and are sour to the fact that their restaurant was not successful."}
{"text":"We had takeout order today biryani and palak paneer. Since we are vegeterian. Biryani lacked salt but was ok but real horror was having chicken chunks in palak paneer. So be cautious anyone being vegan avoid this place. My husband did call them regarding this and they said we dont know what cook adds in food \"meaning chicken in palak paneer\" then who is to take responsilibity. Totally disgusting....who knows what else may land up in food. AVOID AVOID AVOID"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Phoenix. Authentic South Indian taste feels like I am eating at home in India."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find good south indian food and this place is amazing. Definitely try all the desserts. Hope the quality doesn't go down like the other Indian restaurants. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurant in phoenix, their buffet was very nice with lot of Indian food , their mysore bajji , Goat biryani and chicken 65 was awesome , I will come back with my family again and visit this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food. So many varieties in buffet. Taste is really good. So many options for vegiterians and non vegiterians. Serving is really good."}
{"text":"The food was very good. However, I was very disappointed that one of the items that I ordered was completely different from what I ordered.  They offered to replace. However, I did not have the time to wait as it would take some time to make biryani."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Indian restaurants with my husband for 30 years. The Curry Bowl is the best. Their South/North Indian buffet has a great selection of dishes. The curries are very tasty & beautifully seasoned. There are many appetizers, main dishes, chutneys & desserts. Everything is excellent but the sambar & curd rice are the best we've ever tasted. A complementary dosa & tea are served with the meal. The service is extremely friendly & kind. An extraordinary value & experience."}
{"text":"Medium was literally lava in my mouth but I'm just a wuss who eats ghost peppers whole with my kids for fun. Guess I'll have to work up to Trinidad scorpions, Carolina Reapers or whatever they're putting in the food here.  Either way it was great and we loved the food."}
{"text":"Went there for a lunch buffet on a Saturday with family.Both the veg and non-veg sections had a decent variety.The owners were very friendly.The chicken biryani was ok(needs to improve).Otherwise a pretty good place and value for money."}
{"text":"Perfect Indian food, enjoyed good food after long time in the valley area, their buffet was decent and ordered few items for our party, everyone enjoyed it and asked about it."}
{"text":"Love biryani Mysore bajji and chutney at curry bowl. Staff is polite. Also tried 'junnu-Telugu' desert last week. Wow it's good."}
{"text":"One of the best South Indian restaurant been in recent times. The weekend buffet is hands down the best. Huge variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Spice levels are apt and every dish we tried was very nice. Deserts were also many and each one had perfect sweetness and taste. Courteous staff and kudos to the chef. Amazing experience."}
{"text":"Mysore Bajji excellent, reminded me of Andhra Street Food. Sambar with Rava Masala was great. Kids loved Palak Paneer. Naan was yummy being a Eggless. Venkat Reddy and his team are doing great job. Been there 4 times in last two months... still not disappointed."}
{"text":"Our favorite food is Indian and Thai. Wherever we go in the world including the entire US, EU, Africa and further, we always seek out the best Indian and Thai. When we went to Mauritius, we thought we died and went to curry heaven. The Indian food was hands down the best we had ever eaten.   When we came to visit my mother and family in Chandler, we were not expecting much. However, we still sought out Indian food. Well, who would have known that Curry Bowl would steal the number one spot and become our favorite Indian restaurant in the entire world!!! From the extremely warm welcome to the flavorful food that has unique twists and turns on standard Indian cuisine, we can't get enough of this place. Within two days, we have eaten the buffet twice and took food home for the family. They were all blown away by the flavors as well. Curry Bowl, you found your favorite fans!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars for the tasty food.  It's fairly decent.  But take my advice, only eat in!  Have the buffet if you go to this place, but never order take away.  The portions that they claim will feed more than one person?  No, it absolutely will NOT.   Portions are shameful, and amount of food is substituted with a generous amount of sauce with.  Just a word of advice: Open your take away container and check it out before taking it home.  More bang for your buck to have the lunch buffet though."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in all of Phoenix I've tried so far. I found the food here to be very tasty and Soooo delicious! Chicken 65, Special Bonless Chicken Biryani, Chilli Chicken is really super yummy. Far better than the other Chicken Biryani's which we get in Phoenix.So all in all, food is delicious and service is friendly..  GREAT VALUE AND GOOD QUALITY FOOD!"}
{"text":"Tried Curry bowl for Lunch today - FRIDAY and their Buffet was awesome !!! I hail from Hyderabad but have my Andhra roots as well and i can say food is very authentic South Indian - Andhra to be specific and the Hyderabadi Dishes are really really good too.   The best part was they had Bhanginapalli mangoes today on their menu - which was the star of the Show.  Their Meat dishes were all amazing - Goat curry , Andhra Chicken curry , Chicken 65 and Chicken Manchurian. Had 2 types of Biryani's - Chicken DUM Biryani and Chicken Special Biryani - Boneless . Obviously i liked the DUM one - of course !!! as every Hyderabadi loves their DUM Biryani.  Their Junnu , bheerakaya chutney and Spinach dal was quintessential Andhra and top notch.  Their wada's were crispy , Sambar yummy ,Poori and Aloo Curry was just like how we get for breakfast back home.   Gulab Jamun was yummmilicious. Jilebi is good too. they had 5 - 6 desserts in total i believe .  Things that i thought needed improvement -  Pongal was too watery and not as rich  Shahi Tukda / Double ka meeta - Texture was Awesome , but was very very sweet Junnu even though taste was awesome , texture needed some improvement - i found it a lil  watery in consistency .  Overall very very happy with the quality of food and the variety on the buffet too. Wish they incorporate Fish pulusu and Shrimp Iguru on their menu on weekends atleast.  Should not be a big deal considering the fact that the CHEF is Telugu guy and those dishes are very popular among the telugu speaking region of INDIA."}
{"text":"So I've been back a few times recently and I think this latest owner/team has really nailed it.  The food was so scrumptious!   They are deserving of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted by an employee, and sat at a booth. Was a little unclear and what to do, but people started getting food from the buffet like they lived there. So we followed in behind. Great food and a little later a waiter stopped by and was very friendly. Will go again!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I had the chicken tikka masala, naan, and summosas. I'm only giving them four stars because it took them a long time to take our order. The communication was a little difficult because only a few people working spoke English, but I think that shows their authenticity. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food! The location is a bit off- they are probably the only open store in the strip mall!! But make this place very quiet for a nice dinner!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from curry bowl a few nights ago, and absolutely LOVED everything! We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter chicken, and Lamb Korma, plus rice and Naan. It was absolutely wonderful! The Tikka was very flavorful and definitely had a kick of spice without being overpowering, and the butter chicken was creamy and delicious. While I didn't eat but a bite or two of the Korma, it was definitely one of the best I've had. The only complaint I have is that the mixed up the labels on the butter chicken and Tikka containers so we ate the Chicken Tikka first thinking it was butter chicken but we're very surprised when it was spicy lol then we realized the mistake and happily continued enjoying the food! No biggie just a bit annoying. Oh also good to note that their Naan is freshly made, so it was light and very fluffy! Definitely going to be getting take out again soon!"}
{"text":"What a great place. The food is fresh and excellent.  I grew up on the South Indian food in little India. This is the Indian food your mother would cook if your mother was from Hydrabad."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic food. I had the chicken korma with garlic naan. My daughter had tandoori chicken and my other had the mango chicken. Everyone loved their choices!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and went with the buffet with my gal... and while they were very welcoming... the overall experience didn't quite live up to expectations. The staff was responsive with regards to clearing plates and delivering water, but the TV was up fairly loud and on what seemed like an action movie with a Bollywood level of violence which spoiled the atmosphere a bit, the food was meh with some dishes being cold that were meant to be served hot, and the decor was a bit run down.  While I'm glad that there are new Indian places popping up in the area... there's a good amount of competition now... and this place should make some changes to stay competitive."}
{"text":"We drive about 20 miles to come to this place, and we've been 10 to 12 times in the past year. We like it a lot.  The flavors are fresh, spicy and quite athletic.  We've tried numerous Indian restaurants in the Gilbert Chandler Mesa area, and keep coming back to Curry Bowl."}
{"text":"Great north and South Indian food!  Good quality during buffet in addition to ordering off the menu!"}
{"text":"Tried their Jumbo Biryani and chicken tikka last night. Biryani was perfectly spiced with a generous amount of meat. I have had a lot of homemade biryanis that were passed down through generations, and this tasted authentic and just as good. The chicken tikka was good too, but I was taken aback by the biryani.  Would recommend this place. I will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed. Food was very good.  We had the chicken teaka Marsala and lamb curry.  Food was cooked perfectly.  The nan was excellent.  Garlic nan is my choice. Very reasonably priced and service was excellent.  I recommend if you are in the mood for authentic Indian food, curry bowl is the spot to go in the chandler area."}
{"text":"Had the Lamb Vindaloo and it was amazing spiced perfectly and oh so tender !! Can't wait to go back as good as it was it will be hard not to order that every time !!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place last Saturday I really like Indian food have tried several other places around the valley. I just did not enjoy the buffet at this restaurant. There was not much meat left in the buffet container for most of the dishes, just the liquid and most of the food was cold, some dishes just did not have as much curry flavor as I have had in the past. The place is very small and the seat we sat on was broken. When we arrived we were given a bottle of water that was hot, my husband had to up and ask for a cup of ice. I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"I went in with my three children all under ten for Saturday buffet. The food was good although a little under spiced but I guess you have to do that for a buffet. Had an extensive menu which was good. Why a three star? They charged full price, $11.95 for my three young kids. Most buffets including Indian buffets charge a few dollars less for kids under 10. They barely had an handful of rice. I asked the woman if there is less price for young kids, she tells me they have to be 6! That is ridiculous! If they want families there, they need to change their policies! I ended up spending $70 for a party of five and NO leftovers! There are plenty of Indian restaurants that won't gouge you. Hopefully you change your policy and won't go down like the two Indian restaurants that were there in the past couple of years"}
{"text":"Best Indian Food. Goat Biryani and Special Chicken Biryani are awesome. Buffet is so good with many special items. Don't forget to taste \"Junnu\""}
{"text":"Delicious and I loved the variety of dishes.   I like the atmosphere  too, very friendly."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious. My son had been pestering me to come here- we weren't disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was in the area on a business trip a few weeks ago where I ordered through DoorDash. The butter chicken masala was amazing and the butter naan was fresh and flavorable! Sadly enough, tonight I decided to venture to the restaurant to order since business has brought me back to the area. My experience with the food was horrible, thus the reason for this review.  Where do I begin? Let me first say that this negative review is because of the fact that I feel cheated as a customer. This is an attempt to put out there that as customers, our business should be appreciated and the honesty in the freshness of a meal is expected from a restaurant. Tonight, when I left the restaurant and ventured back to my hotel to try the food, the butter naan appeared as though it was microwaved. It was not fresh, it was not hot, it had no bits of crisp that it should have when it's out of the tandoor. The butter chicken...I had to fish for the small chicken pieces in the masala! Smaller bits of chicken that tasted as though it was left over from the lunch buffet. The only thing fresh of my meal was the veg samosa because it's the one thing that actually has to be fresh, otherwise it's highly noticeable. What isn't noticeable is the fact that I have ethnic roots to this food but based off appearance one may think otherwise. I believe that going into the restaurant to order take out tonight was a mistake.   Considering one main butter chicken, naan, and a veg samosa amounts to $25 is a bit expensive. As customers we should be receiving fresh food and not fooled and definitely not disrespected with being served reheated food. Giving it a one star review because their butter chicken is actually pretty good if it's good amounts of chicken and fresh. I however will no longer order and felt entitled to share my experience."}
{"text":"We just love the lunch Buffet here. The food is always fresh and delicious. They have plenty of the favorites but they also have a lot of new items every time and we enjoy trying all the new dishes. Very vegetarian friendly too!! The people there are so helpful too."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try.  It is close to our new house.  The mango chicken had good mango flavor.  It was not spicy, even though we ordered medium.  Would order again.  The veggie korma was yummy.  The veggies did not appear fresh per the menu but the cashew sauce was to die for.  The garlic naan was super tasty.  You better like Indian movies if you eat inside the restaurant.  Next time we will pick up an order to go."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service. Deserts are delicious. The staff is friendly Biryani is awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent food and super service. We went there once for dinner and once for the lunchtime buffet. Both were excellent. Had chicken Tikka Masala and Mutton Rogan Josh for dinner with garlic naan (perfection). The lunch buffet had a very good assortment of vegetarian dishes as well as non-vegetarian dishes and appetizers and desert if you have room. We really enjoyed both meals. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner and had the molai koft and some naan with paneer in it.  It was all very tasty and I'd eat here again.  I picked \"spicy\" for spice level and it wasn't very spicy.  I do like spicy food, so keep that in mind if your are sensitive to spicy food.  The ambiance was pretty bland, but not horrible by any means. With that in mind, this place would probably be a better candidate for takeout at dinner time for me.  It's definitely not a place I'd take people to impress them with a dining experience, if you know what I mean.  It might be a much better spot for the lunch buffet, not sure. The server was friendly and the portion sizes were typical for Indian restaurants (not huge, but not tiny either).  That said, I left feeling satisfied and the prices were reasonable but not cheap.  If I could, I'd give them 3.5 stars but 4 seems a bit much at this time after one meal."}
{"text":"We celebrated my bday party here. Great appetizers and food. I really enjoyed the tandoori chicken and the nilagri chicken. The service was exemplary. They were nice to allow us to bring our own wine since they do not have a liquor license. Service was awesome too for a party of 12. The staff was attentive but not too over bearing. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the Sunday buffet here. The chutneys, starters, breakfast items tastes perfect and reminds me of my place. If you are craving for South Indian food, especially Andhra food..one of the best choices in the Valley. Hope you guys continue the same taste with different varieties.  Junnu, jilebie, allam chutney, Mysore bonda, apollo fish fry are the few I would love to eat here."}
{"text":"We tried Curry Bowl two weeks ago, as I was getting home late one evening, and I asked my wife if she would like for me to bring home Indian food from our new neighborhood restaurant, and she said \"yes\".  Very nice staff; however, the restaurant needs to improve the interior surroundings. I know that it's new but, you just don't get a great feeling when you walk in the door.  We ordered several items, and I must say that I was most impressed with the quality and flavor. We had the Lamb Curry, and Chicken Tika Masala, and Garlic Naan. Would love to have a little larger portion for the price that we paid; however, I will definitely come back for another try.  It's good to have great tasting Indian food so close to home.  They could definitely turn down that TV."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Buffet. Very busy and mediocre for sitting arrangements all the way up to 2:30.  They were able to keep the food replenished and ready for many helpings.  Lots of Veg, non-Veg, chutneys & desert  selections.  Spice level was impressive also.   Will definitely go back despite seating."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times for take-out. Really good Indian food and plenty of vegetarian options. Kind, hospitable service."}
{"text":"Excellent taste and quality in the food along with many food varieties. Tasted exactly like home-made food. This was the first restaurant i really liked in Phoenix and Chandler after having tried around 10-11 indian restaurants.  Must try the weekend buffet (Fri - Sun) - fully worth the money.  special items such as punugulu with peanut chutney (awesome taste), junnu, pongal etc.,  Hope they keep up the same quality."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 2pm.  Place was packed, hot, and a bit disorganized.  We got seated right away though, in front of the opened restroom doors and the whole restaurant smelled like it.  Almost got up to leave but stuck it out because I thought the food had to make for it since it was packed with people.  On top of being hot already, we were only served warm bottled water.  Now to the buffet line, there was a large selection.  More than any other Indian buffet I have had.  The food has good taste, but the meat and vegetables were cut up so small, it felt like eating scraps of food.  Kept waiting for the paneer to come out, but was never refilled.  A lot of items were near empty.  Being an all day buffet, i wish they were more generous on bringing out fresh food.  However staff was friendly.  I felt like this was eating real Indian street food or perhaps eating home made food at someone's backyard party."}
{"text":"Tasty food. I feel like I traveled to my hometown in India. I had lunch buffet and tried all non vegetarian items."}
{"text":"I have visited this place multiple times, the food has been good. Taste and flavor was truly authentic.   I read about the recent violation of food safety by this business. More Info can be found here : https://envapp.maricopa.gov/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodSearchInspection?p=FD-53315&i=0  I would have given 5 Stars if this has not happened recently. Hope the owners have take appropriate steps to avoid future violations like this and continue to serve good food to the customers. Will be visiting the restaurant again in some time."}
{"text":"I am torn. I have had 2 good experiences and 2 bad ones. I tend to not review a place till I have been more than once. The first time was good! I had Chicken Tikka Masala to go and really enjoyed it, although a little hot for me, I didn't specify so it was my fault. I had the lunch buffet with a friend and it was also good food. A few months later I went back and placed a to go order. It was the same - Chicken Tikka Masala. I admit it was an odd time to eat, about 330-400. I watched the server go to the lunch buffet - THAT ENDED AT 230  and scoop up my order right there. Maybe I am fussy but I want it made then, not sitting there for hours. Perhaps that happens in all restaurants but I don't SEE it. Then after a couple month boycott, I ordered again via Door Dash. I specifically asked for mild, it was way too hot for me and the quantity or rice was small. It was also hot, but yet not rich in flavor. So.... I don't know. I want to love it, but we shall see."}
{"text":"Good food, feels like authentic Indian food I hope they continue this way for the days to come."}
{"text":"Omg this food is amazing I have never had chicken tikka masala so fresh and authentic. I've been looking for a good Indian cuisine spot in Arizona for so long and this is now my #1 Oh yeah the staff is so nice very humble!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and when I came in to pick it up the cashier had given it away to the wrong person. Not only did they refuse to make a new order but they completely acted like it was my fault they gave my food away. Will not return to this place ever again. Worst customer service I've had in a VERY long time."}
{"text":"We went for Saturday lunch buffet,food was delicious with many options, except that they don't have any shrimp/fish items  I felt that this place could be less noisy(TV sound) and more organized with regards to space and ambience  This is a must try place only for food,but not if u expect Ambience/dining experience"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet really hit the spot. Nice amount of vegan options including my new favorite Navaratan korma. 555 chicken was perfectly spicy. Tandoor chicken had a beautiful spice blend. Only knock was that the chicken tiki masala was dry / over cooked. I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Coming from the U.K. where Indian food is pretty much the national dish, I have really struggled to find a good curry spot in and around Phoenix.  The curry bowl is basic in terms of restaurant fit out, (don't expect lush carpet and fancy silver wear), but the food is incredible.  The flavors are fantastic and exactly as they should be, the menu has many familiar favorites to choose from. We ordered vegetable pekora, nan, chicken Tikka Biriani and a Chicken Tikka Jafraisi. While they have these on the menu as standard chicken, I requested tikka and Chef obliged - which was perfect.  The service could not have been more attentive. All round five stars, what a great meal."}
{"text":"We love this place but we have a hard time understanding what they say when you order on the phone. Also we ordered hot because we love Indian food and we love spicy food... But it wasn't spicy at all.  When we went into the restaurant another time we ordered chef hot and the lady came out and said we they reduced the heat. We asked why and she confirmed it was because we are white. In the end of this we laughed but we would love our food spicy even if we know it's super spicy. We love it spicy. We wouldn't order it spicy if we didn't want it spicy. If anyone knows how to get spicy food at this restaurant outside playing dress up, let us know."}
{"text":"I have eaten at over a hundred different indian resteraunts in 12 different states and 3 different countries. Curry bowl is the best ive ever had. Will deffinatly be making return trips to this one."}
{"text":"I almost don't even want to review the place because I like I can rush in get what I want and be gone if need be without huge crowds...this will soon change.  Food was fantastic, service was excellent and we've been there when busy (once) and empty and it was always excellent.  We lived in India for a few years, so we have a solid reference point, but we all know food is a preference individually but I love the place.  They are an Andrha run business (Hyderabad) style cuisine, so they can make it mild, but specialize in spicy!  Loved it.  It was so good my brother in-law who is afraid of 'unique' food, loved it to death!  A convert to good Indian food."}
{"text":"Excellent Authentic Indian food, fresh and many options to choose from including Vegetarian. Reasonable price and kind people."}
{"text":"Jalebi!! The best! I have never had such perfectly crispy Jalebi in the US! We went for the buffet on Saturday. Really great tasting food. So many varieties! All really well made. So glad they opened here!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on food quality/taste, menu and pricing as I have only had take-out.  The prior restaurant was not very good, also Indian, so I was very hesitant to try Curry Bowl.  However, that turned out to be a huge mistake because the food taste was exceptional!  I had chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo with garlic naan and basmati rice.  The portions were good and the flavor was fantastic (ordered both dishes hot).  The menu was extensive and prices were very reasonable.  They also have a lunch buffet that will be updated in this review as well."}
{"text":"Disclaimer; this was my first visit to an Indian restaurant. We went conservative, and got the mango chicken and chicken tikka masala.  We really enjoyed the food.  It took a little while to have our order taken, but it did seem like they were working on a petty big catering order. The prices seemed a touch high relative to the quantity received, but that is comparing against non Indian places as well, so may not be a fair comparison. Next time we go back will probably be to try the lunch buffet option."}
{"text":"Under new management. Absolutely delicious. Reminds me of my favorite, Udipi Cafe in Columbus, Ohio. Fried foods are not greasy, good spice, great selection. Helpful service. I can't wait to try the lunch buffet.  11-230.  UPDATE: Have been back many times- food is delightful!  And just found out from owners that they will be offering a DINNER BUFFET starting 10/16!!! Try Curry Bowl!!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good, authentic Indian restaurant that is comparable to the really good ones in Washington DC & New York. Well, I am happy to say that I've found it!! The food & service here is awesome!! Very authentic!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"we were hunting for indian food in Chandler and decided to try this spot. ordered a mixture of classics..tandoori chicken, mattar paneer, a dhosa, lamb pasand, and of course naan and roti. this is standard fare for most indian restaurants in the us x for the dhosa. everything was flavorful and made fresh for us. the meal was a great value. i would describe the meal as \"good standard,\" and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. They have a buffet. We were able to try all kinds of dishes. They were all really good. Perfect for first time trying Indian food."}
{"text":"Normally having to drive 15 miles for Indian food I really wanted to like this place. Food is tasty enough but on the not spicy side. Which was a plus as I had to ask multiple times to get a drink. They brought us some disgusting Indian pancake things. The naan and rice are plain and disappointingly boring compared to anywhere else I've ever ate.  But the butter chicken and 555 chicken were tasty enough. I got some biryani chicken after seeing raved reviews and was disappointed how unspicy it was.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone but a beginner who feared the spicy. Holy non spicy tandoori this place is also overpriced on weekends.  Went from a two star to a one."}
{"text":"Not that I'm an Indian food expert but this place has great tasting food! The spices are on point and they do accommodate palates that aren't accustomed to super spicy food! Will definitely come back to try the buffet and new foods!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to venture out on the weekends and try new places.  We have tried a few Indian buffets in Arizona and by far this has been my favorite.  Their staff is very friendly and their food is just amazing.  I tried Idly Manchuria today because my usually favorite wasn't out today (Gobi Manchurian) and I was not disappointed.  I love coming here."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough, THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! My husband and I eat a lot of Indian food and have been to many places, and this place is by far the best!!  Additionally, the owner is so friendly!  Many places have a few outstanding dishes and everything else is good, here, it's all outstanding!  Their butter chicken and andhra chicken stand out, but again, it's all amazing.   Eat HERE, you'll be happy you did!!!"}
{"text":"Not trying to be rude or disrespectful to the business, but I am a huge connoisseur of curry and BIryani, and this was the least palatable I have had in the valley. I asked for the curry to be mild and it literally was so spicy that it was inedible. I just filled up on the garlic naan, which was actually very good, hence the one star. The biryani seasoning flavor was not pleasant, coupled with a heavy hand on the salt. Chicken was a bit rubbery. The price tag was hefty too. If I'm going to pay $42 for takeout it better be worth every penny."}
{"text":"My favorite indian restaurant in Valley. We go there every weekend buffet. Selection is large and every item tastes good."}
{"text":"This is by far my most satisfying indian food experience in the past 4 yrs of being in Phoenix.   We attended on a weekend. They have slightly different buffet menu for weekdays and weekends. However, today was really good.   Such an elaborate variety of vegetarian items ( I am vegetarian) and non vegetarian items. What I also liked is that the counters for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian items were completely seperate and the counters were clean. Items were being refilled and naans were coming out fresh and hot. Very efficient and friendly staff who served us some special items like dosas on the table. Quick pick up of dishes that you are done with.   The highlight was the sweets section. I loved having sweets other than the usual sweets that I find at indian buffets.   All in all. A 5 star experience."}
{"text":"So we are here at Curry Bowl that used to be Mirchi and that used to be Bay Laaf. Well, this change in name and ownership how this place sucks. It took us 15 minutes to get a menu and 30 min for a drink. We are now waiting for our food for 40 min. Even if you nothing better to do, just don't come here."}
{"text":"Food is still very good and very spicy when you request it but the portions are shrinking considerably.. Dinner take out rice in a miniature box..Really for $11.95 ?"}
{"text":"After a long time we enjoyed the LARGE spread of delicious food, you will run out of space but the flow of the amazing food never ends.   New management team , new attitude and the love of cooking and customer service is all good   I went with a friends family and every one enjoyed for more that 90 mins   Will recommend every one to try the lunch buffet it's worth every penny.   Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Very, very good food! We stopped in for the lunch buffet and everything we tried was excellent. They have a number of vegetarian options and the spice level was just right."}
{"text":"Great Indian food including lots of vegetarian options Located where Bay Leaf Cafe used to be New Owners"}
{"text":"Me, my wife and my dad went there to eat the buffet on a Wednesday. All three of us had a stomach upset and stomach pain. I couldn't go to work for 2 days straight. And I still have the stomach upset and diarrhea. Bad food don't eat from there."}
{"text":"First time to this place ....Fabulous food ... I love it ..highly recommend... I love the owner Mr Reddy He explains well ..."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous at first. It was slightly divey and empty for a Friday night. But it filled up after a while and the food was amazing. Had the lamb tiki masala, chicken Hyderabadi, spinach pakora, and paneer naan. All the dishes were great, five stars for each. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First, let me say that the food is very tasty.  I have no issues with the food at all.    Beyond that, I'll never go back here.  Their service is beyond contemptible.     Our first experience was ordering online via their webpage.   Only to find out that they don't 'take orders online' despite what their website suggests.  They argued that it wasn't possible and I see they still haven't updated their website at all. So after months -- I can still order online and they would still not get the order.  Whatever -- lesson learned.     Next and last -- we were getting their 'Buffet to go' on Sunday and were told we had to take 'everything'.  Meaning we couldn't pick say Butter Chicken and Daal.  No -- everything.      Whoever is doing the cooking -- props to you.  The rest of the place is mismanaged and poorly run."}
{"text":"Didnt expect food to be good,but mind blown with the authentic taste. Especially goat biryani and dosa"}
{"text":"Wow...the best in AZ so far. Choices are out of the box!!! Homely taste. 8 desserts, dosa, puri, idly, vada, masala vada, Manchuria, spring rolls, biryani, bagara baingan, fries, roti chutneyand a lot more. These are just vegetarian choices. There are even more non vegetarian choices. Completely satisfied buffet and finished with indian chai. Price is $11.95. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to support a local restaurant and was blown away by the quality and the value. Hit the afternoon lunch buffet...only $10.99! Really well prepared selections with deep, complex flavor profiles.  Get in your car and drive past the fast food joints on every corner where you'll spend way more for less. The food is 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I joined my family for dinner   a couple nights ago and was extremely impressed. If your considering this place just put down the phone and go! Delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the Most authentic Indian food in Chandler. They have many varieties for Vegetarian. The Place is crowded on weekends. It's a like a family running the restaurant . The Biryani and the garlic chicken is really good."}
{"text":"Este restaurant es fabuloso la comida tiene un sabor auténtico, y fresco .. si quieren probar comida auténtica india este es el lugar perfecto"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. It was incredibly delicious and the service was perfect! I will definitely come back here, and recommend it to everybody that I know. The chicken Saagwala was outstanding as was the Lamb korma!!"}
{"text":"I was here with my family for a buffet lunch on Sat. The food was ok. The desserts were a bit stale. The jamuns were verybland.  The highlight was the cashier charged the full cost for my 8 year old daughter. This seems to be a technique that Indian restaurants use these days. He wanted to charge for my toddler son, but then the better and waived the cost. Please call ahead to confirm about cost of buffet for kids. If you have a below average eater, it's $14.00 down the drain.."}
{"text":"We were there dinner.  We ordered spinach pakora and Mutton Rogan josh.  Pakora and nans were nice, but the lamb was the worst I have ever eaten.  The meat pieces were very small, the curry was probably tomato soup, no flavor no taste. We couldn't even finish 10% of it."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had the lunch buffet at Curry Bowl. It was delicious! The service was great and the owner was very helpful. Definitely try the butter chicken, lentils, and Indian Tea (but it was all wonderful)!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner based on positive reviews that I saw from the Indian crowd. Was disappointed. I ordered plain Dosa where the batter was not cooked through so Dosa kept sticking to my teeth. My friends had ordered chicken lollipop which was also not flavourful and was under cooked. The goat curry lacked salt and the meat wasn't juicy but was rubbery. The only positive was sambar which was really good. Quantity on the goat curry does not match 13.95 price tag on it."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors. It is a brand-new restaurant and of course like many Indian places it is put together on a very shoestring budget. They need to purchase another buffet versus having them on a little card table with little buffet candles under the buffet.  I called ahead of time to ask if they had a buffet and they said yes and it was $10. When I went to pay my check it was $12.95. They said it was because the weekend buffet is more expensive. However it was a Friday afternoon. I don't think they fully understand what the weekend is.  I also don't like when restaurants charge a weekend price but don't add a special item in. Again this seems to happen commonly at Asian restaurants.  The food is very good here so the review is strictly for the food. The flavors were very good and had a gigantic variety.  The people were nice enough. They need somebody to get outside of the building and pick up all of the painting supplies and building materials that they have been using. It looks a little bit rough from the outside."}
{"text":"I am an American having lived in Bangalore, India for a number of years working. Curry Bowl is the closest/best South Indian food I have found in the area. When I brought my visiting friends from south India they gave their stamp of approval. Great buffet. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of India Cuisine. I visited this establishment on Sunday. I must say I was disappointed in the 55+ items. I don't believe I counted that many. The best part for me was the Butter Chicken although the chicken pieces were very small and the sauce definitely smothered the chicken. The curry and tandoori chicken was super super super small. The tandoori chicken thighs were at best the size of a baby's hand. The curry chicken had more bones than chicken.   One thing I love about Middle Eastern food is the Naan. The naan I had was dry and hard. I could tell it had been sitting there for a while. Most restaurants I visit bring out fresh naan once you order, even during buffet times.   I was hoping the food was better than it was because I drove 40 minutes to get there. But at least I tried it.   Last thing, there were 12 people inside including myself. A large family came in with about 10-12 people. They left because there wasn't enough space for them even though there was another room. However I'm not sure that part of the restaurant was open for use.   My best advise would be to go, try it yourself but order from the menu, if that's an option during the buffet. Oh and just an FYI, the buffet started at 11am. I arrived at 12 so I didn't get there towards the end when the food may not be as fresh. I arrived an hour after the buffet started. I wish i had a better review but this time I don't. Sorry everyone. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Went for the buffet which they have a large selection. They have special sections for vegetarian, desserts, and sauces. The food honestly was ok. They were open all day and we went in half day around 4pm which was just after a mini lunch rush during the weekend.  We were left with scraps on the buffet and they wouldn't reload the trays. It was a bit of a let down but it is what it is."}
{"text":"We went here today for the Sunday Lunch buffet, it seems like this place is relatively new and so I wanted to check it out. We were very pleased with the extensive buffet options, so much to choose from and everything that I tried was pretty good, in some cases \"spot on\"! My wife felt the same as well. I especially enjoyed the lamb curry and the special chicken biriyani, the vada was so fresh and super crisp (I did not have high hopes and expected a rather dry vada). Overall it was a good experience. I did see a lot of makeshift options especially with the layout and the tables, I believe since they are new, they are trying to make do on a low budget. At some point they may need to dec up the place.  Also, I called to check if they were open and they guy told me the buffet was $10/adult, however I was billed 11.95 (I did see the sign when I entered the restaurant) and the buffet was definitely worth what I paid, however you may want to communicate correctly in future, I saw that this happened to some other folks as well, it can tick off your customers (hence 4 stars). Overall we were happy and full and rolled back home :)"}
{"text":"The weekend buffet is great. The Majestic chicken and curry goat are really really good. Ask for plain Dosa with the curry. They also have good dessert as part of the buffet."}
{"text":"Yuuk.  While we don't eat Indian food often, this was way too spicy and the smell was not for the faint.  Got it carryout and threw most of,it away."}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything we ordered. Indo Chinese and andhra snacks. As well as North Indian main course."}
{"text":"We have a couple favorite Indian restaurants in the valley and this one just moved up to the top of the list.  The food is excellent and the service was awesome.  On top of that if your the valley south or south east of the 202 and 101 in Gilbert, San Tan or Queen Creek this is currently the closest and best option we know of."}
{"text":"Rip off, worst vegetarian , in the name of festival charged $60 for 2 adults and 2 kids, food is tasteless , service is pathetic , $16 for buffet is just worst, hardly 1 year max, far better Indian restaurants near by Phoenix , for vegetarians try Amaravati or chennai"}
{"text":"Wife was craving Indian food, so ordered the bindi masala, dosa, and yellow dal.  All pretty tasty, bit expensive, but we have had better.  Not bad if you want decent (though not stellar) Indian food."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Saturday lunch buffet is a cultural experience to say the least. I'm often the only non South Asian in the place. That tells Me, it's the real thing. At least 20 dishes to choose from, plus half a dozen desserts. The breads are delicious and interesting, the rice is the anchor of the plate. Veggies curries, chicken stews, some goat for the experienced. Fantastic condiments, mint, chili, Mango. The owners have been very kind to me, an old white man, stopping over to explain dishes, and even bringing things over to try. Highly recommend giving this place a try, delicious, clean, and verrry interesting. Only advice, I wish they would keep the place a little colder."}
{"text":"Went for a buffet n it was simply AWESOME. The staff is incredibly sweet. Gayatri always made sure everything was good. She even brought out some special made dishes for us to try. If she sees any of the food item is about to be finishd,  she brings out fresh items right away. They had house made pizza that was not even on the buffet, but Gayatri even brought it to us to try. That's really sweet Gayatri, Thanks! Their desserts was really awesome!! Especially the bread halwa, Bombay Karachi halwa, and the coconut barfii..it was a WOW!!   Every item in the Buffett was so tasty! I'm vegetarian so had tried all their vegetarian dishes and I will surely be back on a weekend to try their weekend buffet that includes idly n other items.   Chefs name was Hima I believe. Hima..u make really good food!!"}
{"text":"Great deserts. Great specials. Biryani, starters, sweets, breakfast items, everything was pretty great"}
