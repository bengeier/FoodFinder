{"text":"Lime recently opened up in my area, and after reading the yelp reviews, I decided to give it a try for lunch. I called into the restaurant to place my take away order from the lunch combo menu. The ordering process was simple and the staff member I spoke to was very polite.  My order was ready for pickup in less than ten minutes.

I walked into the restaurant, and as other users described it is beautiful inside. Very clean and modern.

Now for the food: I ordered the General Tso chicken with wonton soup and salad. The chicken was hot and crispy. The chili's offered the right amount of spice to offset the sweet sauce coating the chicken. The plain jasmine rice was a necessary side. The wonton soup was flavourful, the broth alone will make for a return visit. The salad was a pleasant surprise, filled with field greens and an orange sesame dressing.

I will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Always a go-to for delivery. Everything we've tried is delicious! Can't go wrong! So glad this opened in our neighbourhood ."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a great price. Love the interior finishes....very clean and creative. The fry tofu is a must try."}
{"text":"Like the food, like the service and the ambiance. 
The food is always fresh and tasty, not exactly real Thai food but pretty good for Toronto. The staff is always very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food at a reasonable price with a lovely Modern atmosphere!

Would recommend the Tofu Fries appetizer! The sauce and the texture of the tofu go so well with each other."}
{"text":"So far so good. Been here once since their opening in May 2015. 

Food nice and tasty. Range from 8-$22$. Average meal costing ~15$Good selection of curry, wok dishes, soups and dim sum (basic) dishes. 
Customer service very accommodating. 
Decor modern and plenty of space. 

Well worth a visit for some Thai, Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Been 3 times. Dine-in dinner. Delivery dinner. Lunch combo takeout. Food is pretty good but tends to be very sweet and not authentic Asian. Small portions and very expensive, in my opinion. Dine-in dinner for 2 adults and 2 kids was $150."}
{"text":"Great classic pad Thai with shrimp.
Dim sum sampler is the frozen stuff served with a decoration or two.
They served the main 10 minutes before the starter. Why call anything a \"starter\" unless you start with it?
Also, it was windy in there. Turn down the air circulation or deflect it.
Place looks great."}
{"text":"Lime Asian Kitchen has been our local go to spot in the area for the last several years. Their takeout is just as good as their dine in and their delivery is ultra quick ~20 min. The menu is vast and offers a well assortment from currys, street foods, steamed dumplings of sorts, soups and much more. They also offer the traditional drinks and coffees that go with it! 

Food was colourful, hot and offered a full depth of local flavours. Dinnerware and restaurant decor  was beautiful and elegant. Service was very friendly and speedy. 

An all around winner for a local spot and always consistently delicious.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"The place looks cool and chilled, the food also looks good but taste not as good as what it looks , also i must say a little pricy ."}
{"text":"Great quality food, service and atmosphere! Shared the coconut curry noodles and peanut chicken lunch special- both came with a side salad that was fresh with a orange vinaigrette!"}
{"text":"An absolute wow!    
I love the the szechuan hot & sour soup -- I've been hunting for the perfect one for a long time and this one is it :)  
We also had the \"Thai chili with cashews\" and the \"Lime's famous street-style pad thai\" and both were just perfect, lovely delicious sauces great quality ingredients -- just perfect.  Oh and they gave us ginger rice to go with it, wrapped in a banana leaf!  Which was pretty cool and very tasty.
The decor is very pretty as well -- the restaurant has a great ambiance.
The stuff are extremely nice and attentive -- we have some food requirements and they looked into everything for us and accommodated our limitations.
And to top it off the price was laughably low for the quality and the value."}
{"text":"Summary: there's a reason why it's empty. 

Ambiance: poor. 
Service: poor. 
Food: Tofu frites - 1/10 (requested refund), Limes famous street style pad Thai - 2/10, Black diamond eggplant - 4/10 

Recommendation: TERRIBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"What an amazing array of flavours. Vegetables are crisp and fresh. Chicken curry was outstanding. Pleasant surroundings, cool music and excellent lighting.

Super cheap. Honestly you should increase your prices."}
{"text":"This place describes itself as Pan Asian which means it has a variety of Thai, Chinese, Malaysian, etc. dishes instead of specializing in one thing.  I'm always a bit weary when a restaurant does this but decided to give it a go anyways.  I tried a couple of dishes from here and found them to be light on the spices.  Again, another restaurant catering to tempered western flavors which is to be expected.  The curry I ordered has 2 hot peppers beside it on the menu but hardly had any bite.  It's not a bad neighborhood option if you have the craving but don't expect anything too authentic."}
{"text":"Solid experience 
Food - Had a chicken Penang curry. I can't speak to the issue if \"authenticity\" but it was Amazing!! I've had this dish right around North America and this is by far my favorite.
Price - appropriate
Service - very friendly and quick 
Ambiance - I would probably describe it as casual chic"}
{"text":"Tasty! 

Stopped by for lunch and as always my trusted yelp app came through! 

Food was great, and service was friendly. They took the time to go through the menu with us as it was our first time there. 

Overall a very positive experience.."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a girlfriend. From the moment we entered, we were catered to. Right away after we sat down they asked if we wanted anything to drink. They were gracious enough to not bug us as we hadn't seen each other for a while. After we ordered, they showed us how to mix the Lime Chicken Lettuce Wrap which was unbelievable! Again, showed consideration for how long it took us to finish the appetizers, and did not bring the main course until we were finished with our appetizers. We were talking a lot during the appetizers, but the whole time, never felt rushed to finish as they were waiting for us in the kitchen. Once they brought out the Lime Famous Street Style Pad Thai it was just pure heaven from there. I highly recommend this Thai restaurant. From the moment we walked in till our last bite of the delicious food, it was wonderful. Highly recommend Lime! You must go!"}
{"text":"Nice service and classic Thai dishes. Taste much better than the rest of the Thai joints around Yonge/ eglinton to Yonge and finch. 

The green curry was perfect and flavourful, and same with the pad Thai. It didn't have that weird sour taste most of the other places do."}
{"text":"Classy, delicious, and diverse menu.

One of the best panang curries in the city. So many interesting things on the menu.

If you are into Thai food this is a must visit."}
{"text":"Top notch service with delicious food. The sticky rice with curry beef was fantastic. The place had a nice quiet atmosphere with an upscale decor. I definitely enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I'm kinda obsessed with this place since I found it a few months ago! There soft shell crab is amazing! I am gluten free and there are plenty of options for me. This is my new favorite thai place."}
{"text":"Second time here! 

Tried something different other than the basic Pad Thai. I started off with the Thai Iced Milk Tea, which was delicious!!! It's not too sweet and compliments any spicy flavours to help soothe your tongue (if your spice sensitive like me). 

Then my friends and I split the Tofu Fries and it was my first time ever having them. These fries are obviously not like basic fries, they are crunchy on the outside and soft / chewy on the inside. Very light and flavourful so you don't get as full as you would with regular fries! 

I ordered the Silky Coconut Curry Soup and it was really flavourful, and not too spicy! I didn't have a large appetite so it filled me up just right. 

My friends really enjoyed their Pad Thai entrees and found it to be very filling with lots of flavour. Worth your buck! 

Would definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Service can be really slow when they're busy and I'm not sure if they're well-staffed enough to keep up with the demand but otherwise the servers, food, ambiance... everything is great!"}
{"text":"Although I feel like this isn't really an authentic Thai experience I do like the food here. The staff are always friendly and helpful. I really liked the fresh rolls here, the spring rolls and Gyoza weren't anything special. My favorite main is probably the short rib and sticky rice, I love how they use sticky rice! Their juices and Thai iced tea (if you like sweet drinks) are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the area. Tried a few others and was severely disappointed.  Pad Thai here was marvellous as was the curry dishes. Will order again!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and the food came hot and was fresh. Enjoyed their Lime Famous Street-Style Pad Thai with Chicken and Silky Coconut Chicken Soup.
It has decent servings and flavourful food. 

The tofu frites was the most unique starter Thai dish on the menu and it's a must try if you like tofu. The tofu fries are slightly crispy on the outside and come with sweet chilli and Sriracha dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Great food and a cool looking place. Went there last night to try it out. We ordered pad thai, green curry chicken and coconut rice and also some appatisers.  Everything was great. We will definitely come back. They are still working on getting  there liquor permit, but go there for the food........it's great!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Thai food, which we were craving, look elsewhere. We had high expectations after seeing the beautiful decor (+1 star) and friendly service (another star).

We ordered Thai spring rolls, pad Thai and massaman curry. These were all listed on the chef's specials menu and were recommended by our host. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed as they are labelled as Thai food but found them to be lacking in authentic Thai flavours.

For example, the Thai spring rolls are nearly identical to Chinese spring rolls. The curry sauce lacked in coconut flavour as well. Overall, the freshness of the chili, ginger and garlic were missing from this experience. This can happen when the restaurant describes itself as a general Asian kitchen.

Just want to add: Yelp, are you paying the Elite members below to give high ratings to this restaurant? Welcome any comments."}
{"text":"This place has great thai food. The thai authenticity ranges by the dish but overall everything I ordered was great. The restaurant was beautiful but service on the other hand was below average with many instances were we had to flag the waiter to get some attention or the bill."}
{"text":"Place is pretty dope, love the decor and atmosphere. The service is great, quick and friendly. We ordered the Tofu Frites as the appetizer and it was life changing. They were seasoned and fried to perfection and came with two types of dipping sauces. We devoured it like vultures. As my main I ordered the veggie pad Thai which was good, but wish they asked me what level of spice cause it would have made it a bit better. Had to ask for it on the side.  All in all, great place you must check it out. 

P.s. Try the Thai Ice Tea!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place one day after work and was pleasantly surprised. Apparently the just opened about 7 months ago and this place is doing really well. I think the interior was very nice and clean, and the employees were providing good customer service.
The food was good but not excellent. I liked their thai curries but the texture and taste of the chicken was somehow rubbery and strange. Would like to come back and try another dishes."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night (around 7pm) and was seated right away. It was quite busy and was packed fairly quickly after we arrived. Their menu consisted of a mix of Thai and Chinese dishes. The ambience was casual but refined so it wasn't too loud. The tables were comfortably spaced apart so it didn't feel crowded. The service was friendly and food arrived quite promptly. Out of everything we ordered, I preferred the coconut chicken soup, street pad Thai and the fried bananas with green tea ice cream. The green curry was decent but not very spicy like other green curries I've had. Pad Thai might not be the best in Toronto but I liked how it came with a mango salad on the side and peanut sauce for the chicken. The batter for the fried banana wasn't too thick which I appreciate. The mango sticky rice was mediocre. It would have been better if the mangoes were cut into larger slices rather than thin strips (just a personal preference) and the sticky rice could be slightly sweeter. The price point was reasonable, around $14-15+ for the mains. 
It's a nice spot to grab a bite if you're ever in the area and craving Thai food."}
{"text":"The tofu frites are to die for. The best app I have tasted in a long time! It was presently beautifully with two side sauce dips. 

The basil beef and rice combos were good value. I do wish the portions were a bit bigger but understandable because its the combo set and not the regular entree order. The flavors were on point for a thai resto. The atmosphere is dark with a very class undertone that is needed for upper yonge street. I would come again for sure! 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"A neighbourhood gem, new addition to Yonge & Lawrence area.  Easy free parking on side streets, few minutes walk to restaurant.  Still in soft opening stage but you can taste alot of passion in the food.  Especially love the black cod & tofu fries.  Cool loft decor idea & spacious tables.  Couldn't wait to go back when alcohol license is ready!  In the meantime, try some authentic curries yum!"}
{"text":"Though I'd had a bit of a bad experience at Lime's other location last New Year's Day, I figured I'd give the joint's Yonge Street outlet a shot exactly one year later. The experience was better, for sure, but the place still isn't anything special.

I'm a big Pad Thai guy, so when I saw that not only did Lime have the venerable dish on the menu but they had two separate versions, I knew I was probably in good hands. I decided to go with the \"Famous Street-Style Pad Thai (\"stir-fried rice noodles in tamarind soya sauce with ground peanuts\"). I chose the House (chicken & shrimp) protein option and requested the dish extra spicy. (I know the waiter heard the \"extra spicy\" request because he repeated it back to me and appeared to write the directive on his pad.)

The food arrived shortly after and it's not bad. It's not the most flavorful Pad Thai I've ever eaten, but at least it doesn't have that sickly-sweet, ketchup-infused taste you get sometimes. The chicken and shrimp was relatively plentiful and the dish was presented piping hot.

The problem, then, is that not only was it not spicy, it had zero spice. I have no idea how me requesting \"extra spicy\" results in a dish without any spice whatsoever. If I were the type to get belligerent with the help, I certainly would have asked exactly what happened there.

The service was otherwise good, although the wait between dessert and the bill was well over a half hour."}
{"text":"Cute Thai restaurant uptown Toronto! Had the basil pad thai and it was delicious -- not too salty or too sweet. The fresh garnishes made the dish more flavourful. Also tried their tofu fries and I was impressed by the texture (fried on the outside soft and juicy on the inside)

-Knocked off the star because it wasn't the best pad thai/thai I've tried."}
{"text":"It was a casual Sunday evening. The restaurant wasn't overly crowded. The service was quick (and we actually asked the staff to come back a few times while we chatted before ordering and then chatted instead of eating our appetizer, etc) and friendly. And the food was GREAT!

First of all, we came here because of the picture of the fried bananas & ice cream. It looked so good, I was tempted to order and start with that first. But alas, we decided to try the tofu frites. It was fantastic. I could easily eat 3 orders of that! There were some slightly sauted chili and onion that the fried tofus were tossed in (not a whole lot). I didn't think the tofu was very oily (one of the reviews mentioned that). I thought it was light and tasty.

Then we ordered the honey-garlic eggplant (I love eggplant!) and the pad-thai (veggie). We commented to each other about how pad thai is seemingly always different at every restaurant. So it's sort of a gamble to try it each time. This was one of my favourite pad-thai's that I've had in a while. What a delight. I'm not quite sure how to describe it other than the flavourables were just bang on for me. There was no peanuts in it. It wasn't overly wet, nor very dry. The perfect consistency, and the other ingredients tasted fresh (bean sprout, veggies). It was very good. The honey-garlic eggplant was great too. Can't really go wrong with those combinations. Note though, if you order this, get some rice too. It is a little on the salty side. We tried to eat it with the pad thai and then decided we needed to try it with plain white rice, and that worked out really well.

For the finale...fried bananas with green-tea ice cream. Bananas were perfectly fried. Still crispy on the outside. Still warm. Banana on the inside was DEFINITELY warm, so don't throw the whole thing in your mouth (eat it slowly =). I thought the green-tea ice cream was a good pairing, but it was a little bitter to me given the sweetness of the bananas, though it's not necessarily a complaint. I mean, it's supposed to taste that way and probably intended to cut back the sweetness. But the entire time I was eating it, I did wonder if a tart sorbet would go well with fried bananas though?...hmmm

overall though, it was very good. I'd definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Simple, clean and nice decor. Great lunch value combo. Good is food but not outstanding.  Thai milk tea was too sweet and overrated; I tried to finished it cuz I didn't want to waste it, but only could drink 1\4 . Viet coffee was decent.  Short of staffs,  took a while to take our orders. But they were nice and pleasant. Still, we probably won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Real nice, lots of flavor one of the best I ever had. 5 star for food, 5 star for place, 5 star for dating. 2 star for the drink (half a can coke for $2.25) unreal. Other than that I love it"}
{"text":"Really nice Thai restaurant and good Thai food. The curry was tasty, but my complaint is that they are unable to make the curry less spicy (it was very spicy). Most places offer option to make the curry mild, or medium spicy; not here. Another complaint is chicken... the meat was little bit rubbery.
This is definitely a place to return and try more dishes. I am not sure I would choose chicken again, but the veggies were really good. I also want to add that the customer service here is excellent. They were all very friendly and attentive.
I highly recommend trying their Red Curry, Massaman Curry (very flavourful and little bit sweet), Panang Curry and Green Curry.
They do not have vegan (or even vegetarian) curries as they all contain oyster sauce and are not dairy-free (contain evaporated milk). I was told they don't contain dairy on one specific occasion but later learnt that they do have dairy. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here with no expectations, just wanting some decent regular Thai food. The place was pretty empty on a Saturday night.

I got the Street Pad Thai with mango salad and chicken. Food came surprisingly fast (but not suspiciously fast). It was delicious and filled me up quickly. The portion was huge, could barely finish everything. The mango salad was also delightful. 

Service was quick, attentive, and friendly. 

The restaurant is very very spacious, something that you dont find at most restaurants. It's also not loud like most Thai places. I'll definitely be returning for more."}
{"text":"Just tried this tonight as it came highly recommended.  It definitely lived up to my expectations! Super fresh and delicious.  I had Malaysian chicken and My husband had thAi basil.  Awesome! And delivery was super speedy!"}
{"text":"Had the veggie platter, green curry with chicken and yellow curry with vegetables and tofu. Great food. Highly recommend. Thai iced tea was delicious as well. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is relatively accessible with no stairs, you just have to get through a few doors at the entrance. I started with an enjoyable small tea cup of Ginger honey tea, can't go wrong with that. I ordered the vegetarian Pad Thai for my main course, which was good. For desert, I had the mango ice cream, which would have been more enjoyable if it didn't have pieces of ice and was smoother. The restaurant is well designed and the service was great."}
{"text":"Lime Asian Kitchen treated me to one of the best yellow chicken curries I've ever had. It's flavourful, not too spicy, and the chicken is super tender. The portion is reasonably sized. For some, it might seem small, but I was full after my meal. The staff was super friendly and efficient. Our meals were done within 5 minutes, but then we were the only customers in the entire restaurant on a weekday at around 3pm. They even have Siu Mai dumplings on the menu - my all-time favourites whenever I go to a Chinese dim sum restaurant.

My opinion might be unbalanced, because I've only been to Lime once and had that one chicken curry, but usually you can judge a restaurant's quality based on how much care goes into the preparation of a given meal. In this case, I knew right away that they don't mess around in the kitchen :)

I haven't tried their Pad Thai, but the curry was a solid win in my book. I would not hesitate to go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is probably my fave thai restaurant in the city. While the popular ones like Pai, Khao San Road, and Sukhothai are not bad, Lime wins with attention to detail, stellar service and a nice atmosphere (no crowds). Came on a Tuesday night so it wasn't a surprise that there were only 3-4 tables seated.

Their Thai Ice Tea is bomb - please get this. Creamy and just the right level of sweetness. 

For apps, we had their tofu frites, which is fried strips of tofu sprinkled with chili salt and pepper seasoning. These were also amazing and came with a sriracha mayo and sweet chili dipping sauce. Their beef tenderloin skewers were extremely tender and flavourful. 

As for mains, we chose their Panang Curry with beef & coconut sticky rice and House Fried Rice (can't remember if this is the actual name). The curry was good, although it was outshone by all or the other amazing food items. It was slightly sweet but a little too creamy and felt quite heavy. Sticky rice didn't help and just made it more filling. The fried rice though...this was so good! With bits of fried chicken and avocado, which brought a really interesting texture to the rice. The rice itself was perfectly seasoned and flavourful.

Service was super attentive, and the owner (I think) came to pour our water 3-4 times during our meal. Best part is that the prices are not crazy - for 2 people, our bill came to $60ish before tips."}
