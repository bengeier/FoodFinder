{"text":"I have to write a review on the Fractured Prune. First off I love doughnuts second I used to work in a bakery. So I know a little about the almighty doughnut. I was there this past Thursday night at Westgate where I was having a nice dinner at Opah Life. I wanted a little desert so I went to this doughnut shop it seemed clean enough so I made my selections and took them home. Mistake should have eaten one there I would have ask for my money back. I took a bite out of each on to confirm what I thought they were the worst doughnuts I have ever had. Horrible not sure if the oils was rancid or not hot enough either way eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"These doughnuts are the best , I could eat one everyday !!!  Every time I'm in Glendale we stop and get doughnuts I want to try them all . So far the ones I have tried are delicious . If you haven't had one you need to !!!!"}
{"text":"Cool little place to visit here and there but super sweet for my taste. My kids love it tho. The adventure of designing your very own donut and watching it be. Related before your eyes. Can't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Although I am not big fan of cake doughnuts, this place changed my mind. I had the OC Sand because of other reviewers recommendations and it did not disappoint. It was like a delicious funnel cake doughnut. I love that they are hot, fresh, & made to order! I also had one with key lime glaze and I would order that one again too. The key lime was sweet rather than sweet & sour but I didn't mind. It wasn't overly fake tasting either which I half expected from other reviews. Honestly, give this place a try and decide for yourself if you like it or not. I'm glad I did & will be going back when the craving hits!"}
{"text":"the doughnuts are the best I ever taste. my son got to watch what he ordered be made right in front of him how cool."}
{"text":"The husband and I have major sweet tooths, so we decided to give this place a try. It's great. The selection and combination are pretty vast. A must if you like donuts. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They had a booth at Snow Day today and I decided to give it a try. It was so good I stopped by the store. Seriously it was that good I wanted a fresh one. Not disappointed!! The fresh donuts were so amazing. If you've only had their donuts after they had cooled you're missing half the experience. Also there was a worker I think her name was Kelsey and she was so amazing!! She was helpful and friendly and in control even though it was busy. She even took the time to chat with me for a minute while she worked. I probably annoyed her with my questions lol. But you know how sometimes even when a place is amazing the workers really just are the cherry on top? Well she really made the experience even better. (Ps try the smores donut sooo good)"}
{"text":"I can't say I was impressed by the doughnuts. Friends of ours said it was great so we tried it. We bought a dozen and couldn't taste the flavor of the donuts. The only one we really could taste was the death by chocolate. The apple pie smelled like apple pie, but certainly didn't taste like one. The salted caramel was ok, but the salt lingered after you eat the donut. Disappointed, but we tried it."}
{"text":"Just wow. Loved every bite. Stopped by here before the Clemson vs Alabama game. blueberry glaze and sugar / strawberry glaze graham cracker and sugar / chocolate glaze bacon and sea salt."}
{"text":"Tried a few different donut locations and this has to be one of my favorite places so far. It is a nice little place in a good location, and the environment is pretty cool and modern. The unique thing about this donut shop is the variety of different donut creations you can order, and the fact that it's made to order. You can also make your own creation with the wide variety of icings and toppings that they have available. Overall it is a great place to go if you are looking for a donut shop that is a little different."}
{"text":"As a former Marylander familiar with the original Fractured Prune oceanside location, I was soooo excited to see them come to Arizona.  The Westgate store is perfection.  An efficient, well staffed operation.    And then there's those hot out-of-the-fryer doughnuts!  I was in doughnut heaven.  As many reviewers commented, you custom order your doughnut from a wide variety of glazes and topings, or choose one of their specialty creations.  I ordered one to eat there (with their amazing coffee), and a half-dozen to take home.  A few seconds in the microwave brings them back to their original hot out of the fryer deliciousness.    Thank you, Fracture Prune, for coming to the West Valley!!!"}
{"text":"Late night cravings need a Sweet tooth fix... This is a place you have to stop by. Had to spot by on a day off and grab a dozen plus my free O.C. sand.."}
{"text":"I'm not a Krispie Kreme fan. So when my sister asked if I wanted to try this cute little donut place I was skeptical. The two guys working greeted us as soon as we walked in. They were helpful and kind in explaining how the ordering process works. I ordered the dulce de leche donut and it was the best donut I've ever had!! Sooooo delicious! There were eleven of us and we each loved our donuts. The Fractured Prune is definitely worth a try. I'll be returning again soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic quality. Nice and warm. Friendly service and decent prices. Love this place!"}
{"text":"For me I like different. When I go out to eat I always prefer different. Not something you can just get anywhere. This place definitely is different. crazy mix & match flavors on doughnuts. Kind of like the yogurt places you see with all kinds of things you can add. The thing is different also had to taste good. For me that's where they lack. Super basic small doughnuts covered in sugary sauce & candy for me just isn't it. This for me it's just a novelty."}
{"text":"I love going here on weekends with the family. Happy hour after 11 am is 3/$5 so it makes a great after movie or brunch treat. Always fresh and the best texture ever for donuts. It's also super fun to customize and let the kids decide what they want on their own donuts"}
{"text":"$2 a doughnut like place, made to order anything you can imagine. I enjoyed a plain with cherry frost and chocolate chips."}
{"text":"Great concept, mediocre implementation.  I heard about this place from a friend of mine and decided today to try it out.  Saturday morning, 9 am, and the place is so dead, two teen age girls are running the place.  The actual donuts were great, but took forever to make (for more than 5 minutes, we used the entire production capacity of the store for our dozen doughnuts.  Had there been a line of people, it seems the ones at fifth or sixth place in line would be waiting well over a half hour).  The glazes, on the other hand, not much to brag about.  We decided to order a dozen ($15.99) and try some of the existing menu items, so we filled out our order card and waited for them to work their magic.  When we got them, we could not tell which was which.  Only after trying several of them, did we realize, they apparently packed them in the same order they were listed on the order form.  Even with that knowledge, we had arguments about which donuts were which.  The apple pie donut and banana creme pie donut were indistinguishable as were the caramel bacon and the maple bacon.  The margarita and key lime donuts had almost no discernible flavor and, unless I knew in advance, I would never have guessed that the glaze on the P-claire was chocolate (it wasn't brown and had no chocolate flavor).  I always hate the term \"watered-down\", but my impression of the glazes is that they had been watered down to the point of being almost flavorless.  The toppings didn't help as they were ground into such small pieces, you couldn't tell what they were.  Even the fruit toppings didn't help us separate the apple from the banana.  Unless they can find a way to increase the intensity of flavors in the glazes, this is a nice novelty place that we may take our grandchildren to when they come to visit, but if I want donuts with flavorful toppings, I will go back to my local doughnut shop."}
{"text":"I like the idea but I think its a bit too much when you just wanna grab a donut on the go. Probably cool for a date and to kill some time but I passed on this."}
{"text":"there is NOTHING sanitary about contaminating all the glazes and the toppings like this place does! they dip the doughnut in a plaze, and then into a topping while its STILL DRIPPING! so how they toppings have glaze of one taste just sitting in it, and the next time they use that dip and it was  DIFFERENT glaze, it just keeps getting mixed. thats not ok! if i ordered a chocolate coconut doughnut, i should NOT taste maple on my doughnut from the maple being on the coconut.....i rather go elsewhere than come here again! not to mention its pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Delicious with so many different selections to choose from to make your own doughnut.  They also offer military discount."}
{"text":"These donuts were super fresh and tasty. They make them right in front of you which is super cool. One thing that we noticed is that you can't buy one donut. You have to buy at least two and they are on the more expensive side for a donut. Great donuts and a great location. The OC Sand was"}
{"text":"The yummy bread is oh so amazing!  The banana bread was my favorite!  Wow!  Great location and clean.  We will definitely be back for another round!"}
{"text":"Amazing! There are so many choices and combinations! I went with the French Toast and MAN OH MAN it was amazing! The fun part is watching them make it....although, the lady wasn't very friendly and messed up on our order. But who really cares when you have a warm donut sitting right in front of you...you know...for all of two seconds! Ha. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"The donuts were good.  I had two.  The Black Forest and Smores.  The donut was lighter than I thought it would be being a cake donut which was good.  The donuts were also fresh.  I have nothing bad to say about the donuts themselves or the service.  They are overpriced though as the donuts are only about Entemenns size and two donuts cost over 4.00! The price is the only thing bringing down the score."}
{"text":"This place is genius!!! Doughnuts any way you want!!  These were delicious, but not good the next day!  Do not buy extra thinking you will eat them for breakfast.  Also the wait is worth it, but it does take a while to have it your way :)    We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The doughnut I had was quite delicious, warm, and melted in your mouth. Atmosphere is superb and nice. The only complaint I have is they are a little pricey."}
{"text":"Was feeling like something sweet so decided to try this place out. It definitely has an odd name but a pretty cool concept. It's like a Subway but instead of sandwiches you create your own donuts. They have a wide variety of choices. I realized all the donuts are the same plain donuts just with different glazes and toppings. The donuts are freshly made so they are nice and hot which makes them taste better. Only negative is the price as each donut is about $2. You can save money by getting a dozen but that'll also set you back about $16. I can also see how you might be there a while waiting for your donuts to be made if store is busy. We waited about 7 minutes for 7 donuts and there was only one other person there when we ordered. Would probably come again if I'm back in the area to try some other flavors."}
{"text":"While the $2.00 doughnut price is steep,  this place will become my  \"once in a while\" guilty food snack place.  I tried the \"Bacon Bomb\" doughnut...SHOCK AND AWE OF PURE YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be among other Westgate eats, expensive and just OK. But we decided on a whim to try their donuts and it was currently happy hour so we got three donuts for $5. Plus a couple more.   They were amazing! The texture reminded me of Trish's donuts in San Fran. They make them to order so they were still warm when we got home and we all did a little taste testing and every single donut was amazing. I got the maple with bacon and it was surprisingly delicious even though it sounded like an odd combo. My kids each chose their own flavor and all were good. The tops of the donuts almost taste like the frosting carmelizes a bit which adds a nice texture. I will definitely go back because they had a ton of options and the configurations are unique so they're not your average run of the mill donuts. I saw that they also have ice cream filled options so my kids will love that when we decide to try them again. We were happy campers!"}
{"text":"What a great experience for my out of town friends who were visiting!  The staff was so personal especially Kim and Shae. The chocolate eclair was a great new treat to try. They want to come back before they leave."}
{"text":"Build your own donuts!?!  Yes, please!  I learned of Fractured Prune a few days ago while looking for something to do in the Phoenix area.  We tried to go to the downtown location, but they closed just before we got there.  So we were happy to learn that the Glendale location had longer hours.  We decided to go after dinner.    We looked over all the creations they had listed and ended up picking 3 each...so we didn't exactly build our own.  We love that they were made to order.  I chose the chocolate covered cherry (because I love this little bites of deliciousness), the bacon bomb (cause BACON!) and the margarita.  As of this posting, I have not tried the margarita, but the other two were really good.  If I had one complaint, I wish the bacon was crispier.  Hubby had the caramel bliss, French toast and Salted caramel.  He would have eaten all of them at once if he could.  I think next time he'll o on an empty stomach and may order a dozen for himself."}
{"text":"These delicious treats never disappoint. Every creation is so delicious. We make the drive from CA every so often and have yet to be disappointed. They are high quality and delicious. They also aren't that heavy greasy feel that you get from other places. We've tried other places like local donut and those are good but not like these made to order wonders! And service is always very kind and professional !!"}
{"text":"Had a great first visit at Fractured Prune. I loved the made to order style. The assembly line that greets you is a bit overwhelming and inviting at the same time. I ventured to try the maple bacon and it had wonderful crispy pieces of bacon over a warm maple glaze. The donuts are almost too big to eat, lest you have a sugar coma."}
{"text":"Hot, tasty, and quick. I like the concept and even though the donuts aren't the absolute best...they're a great treat and cool concept."}
{"text":"The customer service was great but the doughnuts are horrible! Gross, small, nasty oil taste with flavor on top to cover up a Cminus doughnut. Then served too hot that it took me 5 minutes before I could eat it. If you are going to be in the doughnut business, at least be good at the old fashioned. I'll stick with Northern Perks and Welcome doughnuts."}
{"text":"Don't let the hype draw you in, fancy toppings does not make this a good donut , it's sub par overall. Cake doughnut tasted like the fry oil was old and the toppings are not of much quality. I LOVE doughnuts ... Repeat ,LOVE them! By far the best ones in Az either come from Rainbow my personal favorite , Bosa a close second and Lamars a great runner up . A plain French curler at any of these places is leaps and bounds better than the fancy Fractured Prune treat ."}
{"text":"Omg these donuts are amazing. My sil got them one time and I decided to take my son today he loves this place. Favorite donut place"}
{"text":"While it is a neat concept there are more cons then pro's.  Cons: $16 for a dozen doughnuts? Long walk from the parking lot to the shop Cake doughnuts Westgate is not convenient at all Not the best doughnut I've had Long wait to actually get the doughnuts after ordering Had to hang out in the stinky greasy smelling place for the long wait  Pro: Novelty"}
{"text":"The donuts were deeee-lish!!  it's a wee-bit on the small end but it is quite the delectable treat so you don't want to indulge too much!  I don't know if it's worth the $2+ per donut but they were quite good.  The staff was nice and the coffee was strong.  Definitely worth stopping by.  It took them a while to get our order so I don't know if it's worth coming when they are super-busy.  Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"Went here today with my Mom.  Great concept.  Donuts made to order.  Lots of exotic flavors to choose from.  My only advice is to have a few more classics on the signature menu.  Sometimes all of the choices can be overwhelming to the original donut lover."}
{"text":"This is pretty fun concept. Unlike most donut shop where you just pick a donut from those that are already made and placed under glass, Fractured Prune lets you pick the donut you want and then watch it being made. You can choose from the combinations they have or mix and match flavors and toppings to make your own. Write your order on a slip of paper and watch them go to work. You get to see them pour the batter, deep fry the donuts, and add the toppings that you selected.  Once you get your hot, fresh-out-of-the-oven, donut, sit down and enjoy it. We all enjoyed our selections and even split them up so we could try each others choices. Definitely a fun place to visit, although my waistband would regret going too often.  Fractured Prune, where it's only time to make the donuts when you're ready to eat the donuts!"}
{"text":"I LOVE TO EAT... I have been here about 4 times. never had a problem with service, never had a bad doughnut, and never knew doughnuts could be made fresh in front of your eyes. Its as if Subway and Cold Stone said we should make doughnuts and give our restaurant a really stupid name with a really stupid back story while we charge people stupid amounts of money for doughnuts. Keep up the great work!! Great doughnuts!! See you soon!!"}
{"text":"In the top 5 of donut places I've ever tried. Lots of options for every different kind of taste. Made to order and always taste fresh.   Clean location and friendly staff.   Never a long wait and for what they are, the donuts are reasonably priced. During the MLB Spring Training season, if you bring in that day's ticket stub it's BUY ONE GET ONE FREE (up to 3 free donuts per transaction)! I would call before hand to verify this.   They don't open super early but they stay open late most days and it's perfect for a late night sweet treat.   I come at least twice every year I visit the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I was craving a donut at 8:30 in the evening and stumbled upon this little shop on Yelp located in Westgate. After three different specialty donuts which were all amazing with flavor, I must say Bacon Bomber is my favorite. A great place to take the kids or treat yourself."}
{"text":"At 2 bucks per small donut, these things better be decent. The taste all depends on what you like, so this review and any review of these types of donuts are very subjective. All the donuts are the same, so if you like the donuts (which I did) then you won't have a bad experience unless you screw up your toppings. I had something with chocolate, so with the hot donut, those chips melt fast and all over your face, but it was still good. Too many choices too list, but if they can knock down the prices to a buck or so a donut, it would make better sense. It is still just a donut and instead of them making it in the back, they make it in front of you, so why the huge price increase? The novelty will wear off, but still it is a good place for a novelty visit if you are craving a new age donut."}
{"text":"After having donuts from here i dont think i could ever go back to a basic donut shop. This place makes their donuts right infront of you and they super fresh. The toppings for your donuts are endless. They have donut specialties, but you also have the option to make your own. If you are in Arizona The Fractured Prune is a must.. on your todo list."}
{"text":"Probably the greatest donut shop ever. They're pricey but your tastebuds will be like so what???  Coffee Cake, Gorilla, Carnival were awesome. & OMG Dulce De Leche is my favorite. Extremely tasty, amazing selection, and ingredients, and you can even create your own doughnuts. It's a diabetic's nightmare!!! They also serve coffee and other drinks. Extremely Good!!!   No vegan options and tons of sugar which is toxic to the brain and body. But the inflammation it causes may be worth it. A once in a while treat for sure! Awesome Possum!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Never been before and it was amazing! Fresh fried donuts, dipped in the glazes and toppings of your choice. They tasted great - as fresh as you'll ever get. And the service was good too. The girl that helped us (I forgot her name) was friendly and let us take photos of the process. They need this concept in California!"}
{"text":"As already said not a fan of caked donuts but these were amazing. Ordered strawberry shortcake and cookies n cream, custom-maple glaze with bacon and chocolate glaze with mini chocolate chips and oreo crumbs. Fave was the maple bacon. If short on time strongly recommended calling in the order or online."}
{"text":"Literally best doughnut on the face of the planet. Highly recommend! My favorite is the banana glaze with chocolate chips. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It's a little pricy, but oh so worth it"}
{"text":"Glad that I tried this place =) Maybe I'm not a cake donut fan but the options are endless and that's what got me excited! As far as taste, I feel like one of them tasted like the white powder donuts we used to buy when we were younger. I would probably go again to re-try it and possibly edit my review =)"}
{"text":"I bought the carnival (honey glaze and rainbow sprinkles), coffee cake, and blackberry cobbler doughnuts and they were all good. My favorite was the carnival. The service was even better than the doughnuts. All smiles and very helpful. :)  They have a large selection you can choose from, and you can even create your own doughnut by picking any glaze with any two toppings. For example, vanilla glaze with mini M&M's and rainbow sprinkles. I'll call it the \"state fair.\" :P"}
{"text":"Make your own doughnuts. Tip: Order in pairs. They don't sell singles. Anyway, the fractured prune is fun because you pick up an order form and then choose one of their signature combinations or pick your own glaze and topping.   Pros: The fried doughnut is yummy. The glazes are fresh tasting and flavorful. The toppings are pretty.  Cons: One of the servers did not seem very enthusiastic about helping us at all. He had a dour affect. The drink machine was out of order. Pricey (6/$10).  This is a place that my daughters adore. I guess I will be back."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! Always clean and fast. There are tons of options to choose from and your doughnut(s) are always fresh! My personal favs are the maple French toast and the apple pie! Sooooo delicious! They are a bit pricier but totally worth it! Unless you eat there too often then that's a different story :p"}
{"text":"I was excited to walk in to this place. The cake was delicious and the toppings were just enough to not make it too sweet. I'll go again to create my own."}
{"text":"Omg. These are so yummy! I've been to a fractured prune before, but wasn't nearly as impressed. I'm guessing that one didn't serve them as fresh as this place does. These were made to order and served hot - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside; I could've eaten about a dozen of them; good thing We'd only ordered a couple! We also ordered an iced coffee; that was great, too! It was really smooth; not all bitter like a lot of places' coffee. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!! We aren't from the area and I'm obsessed!!!!!!! My boyfriend and my daughter were both amazing by all the variety. We got our donuts at about 9:30pm and the next morning they were still so soft as if they were just made"}
{"text":"Not the best donuts, not the worst. Small will some topping for $2 just doesn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"11am to 6pm is happy hour.  3 donuts for $5.  Each donut can have up to 2 toppings. They fry in soybean oil.  These are made to order cake donuts.  Rodrigo who made our donuts was generous with the toppings especially the bacon and the Bavarian cream. If your in that mood for a donut that eats like a meal like a Gourdough's in Austin....FP is your best bet here in AZ!  I will say I would highly recommend staying away from any cream filling for these hot donuts.  Just a straight up hot mess so it's a fail in my opinion.    Like seriously if Rodrigo is working there just know he ain't stingy and he hooked it up!  So if you are craving a hot donut....Krispy Kreme who?  Fractured Prune indeed!!  But I'd make sure you don't fracture your diet cause caution it may be habit forming!  3.5 stars for the bacon  glazed donut .  Look forward to trying other combos."}
{"text":"The salted caramel is heaven in your mouth. Extremely helpful employees with simple ordering system. Bonus.. You can make your own doughnut! Reasonably priced in swanky Westgate!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. I visited some friends in ocean city Maryland and had my first taste of Fractured Prune's gourmet donuts.... Heavenly is the only way to put it. Still warm from the dryer and you need a fork to eat them. And one is sometimes enough! They can be big depending on what you get on it.  I moved to Phoenix not long ago and was ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED and amazed to see that Phoenix has fractured prune too! I took my boyfriend and his kids there and they found their new favorite donut place.   My favorites include dulce de leche, green with envy, and this amazing donut I had with chocolate and bacon! Yum!!!!! Kids favorites include chocolate covered cherry, carnival, and s'mores. Honorable mention.... OC sand! Simple but incredible taste. Will be back every chance we get....  Side note: this is NOT Starbucks. Both me and my boyfriend have hated the coffee we got there on separate occasions. Stick to the donuts and you will very very satisfied."}
{"text":"Womp Womp   I'm a bacon lover, & the bacon they use is super gross, I couldn't even finish it. It was equivalent to the garbage bacon that you get in a junky microwave breakfast sandwich. Also, the glazes offered are pretty nasty. I can only speak for the raspberry & the maple glaze however. Last but not least, the sea salt, was basically just regular salt, shook over the donut with a regular shaker."}
{"text":"Omgosh!!! It's like heaven in your mouth. Made fresh in front of your eyes. Dulce de leche is delicious. French toast is a must. Blueberry too sweet"}
{"text":"During my most recent visit, earlier this evening on a weekday.. It wasn't busy at all...   I ordered the banana glaze+ chocolate chips... We sat outside and ate it a few minutes later... Omg the donut was still super warm and so moist.. And half the chocolate chips melted which made it even more delicious and sweet!.. The donut is a bit on the small side, a decent serving size actually.  Clean, several tables inside, and a few small tables right outside. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Best single donut ive ever had. Not sure if its because it was fresh just cooked or they all taste awesome. We got caramel glazed and the toppings were Oreo Cookies and sea salt. It had this amazing crunch. Soft and warm inside and then crunchy savory flavor on top. only had one but will definitely be back. This was my first timeat Fractured Prune. PS - the name after some woman nothing to do with doughnuts. It was bothering me the whole afternoon until i found out why the name. :-)"}
{"text":"Glad this location was open as the day before, we tried to go to the tempe location at 6 pm and it was closed even though yelp says they stay open. Greeted by the girl behind the counter right away and she asked if we had been there before. When we said no, she gave us the run down of how it all worked. It was happy hour so 3 donuts for 5 dollars. We tried to get 9 and use our check in free oc sand donut and then we're told getting a dozen would be a better deal. Why not? We got blueberry, lemonade, oc sand, bacon bomb, eclair, Apple pie, margarita, salted caramel, Dulce de Leche, and forgot the rest. Warm donuts made in front of you. Takes about 10 minutes to get the donuts so be patient. Good flavor and like the crisp on the outside of the donuts. 19$ for 13 donuts and one milk.  Interesting story about the name... Donuts are good and I'm sure kids live the pick your flavors or make what you want.  Satisfied our sweet tooth. This location is right by the coyotes arena in the fun little shopping district. Street parking or parking lot at either end."}
{"text":"Donuts are ok. I think it's too sweet for my taste. Or maybe because the one that made my donut put too much vanilla glaze. I saw how her face changed that she made it wrong but whatever. It's just nice to see how they make their donuts and that the donuts are fresh."}
{"text":"Our first visit here and we took advantage of their happy hour 3 for $5. The hardest part was deciding what to try! There are endless combinations you can create on your own or choose from their menu. My husband and I don't have a favorite doughnut because they're all good. For us, the caramel bliss had too many chocolate chips and over powered the caramel glaze but it was still good and tasty none the less. I was worried the chocolate chips wouldn't be melted but to my surprise the doughnuts are made fresh and they top it with glaze and toppings as soon as it comes out. So the chocolate chips were nice and melty!! Yum! There are only a few things better than a FRESH warm doughnut!  This place was so good and the employees were nice and very helpful. They didn't mind us gawking at them make the doughnuts from start to finish. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Super good! The people were friendly and the concept of make your own donuts is really cool. The food was great and the price was also pretty good. They didn't even take that long with our food, but they gave us a free extra pumpkin spice donut which was very kind and the donut was very good. I was very happy with my experience. When I visited it was about a hour before their close time on weekends (midnight) and the workers were not seeming tired, and they were friendly and full of energy."}
{"text":"Cool concept, but donuts are greasy and not edible. We might have hit it at a bad time, but I wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"Different, fun, and yummy!  Definitely not your average donut shoppe.  Its nice that you can pick one of many popular flavors or create your own.  We tried about 5 flavors and would get about 4 of those again next time.  The only thing that would make it better to me is combining this method with a krispy kreme donut which is sweeter and more dense than the Fractured Prune donuts which are more fluffy and cake-like."}
{"text":"This is like the Coldstone Creamery for donuts.  They have a bunch of different toppings (mini marshmallows, chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit, Oreos etc) and a bunch of different glazes ( banana, cherry, marsh employ).  They make the donuts in front of you from the batter to the fryer to the toppings.  The donut is more of a sweet bread flavor then a traditional donut.  They also have breakfast sandwiches which is eggs, cheese and meat with a donut as the bread. It's a little on the pricey side for donuts and they are on the smaller side but it's a fun experience. And I love the name!  I probably won't be back as the waffle place across the way looks way better."}
{"text":"This place is great! Girls night out with movie, then went here after for the first time. They have a huge selection, seriously, they have every flavor imaginable. They make them right in front of you when you order them. It was fun to watch them. The prices were a little more than Dunkin' Donuts, but the quality is so much better. Love this place."}
{"text":"First timer here and the doughnuts are amazing!! They are made to order hot and fresh and oh yeah they taste so delicious. With 20 different galzes and 15 different toppings there is a doughnut here to please even the pickiest taste buds. The dulce de leche is the perfect amount of sweet not to over the top. I love the fact that it's not only a great place to get breakfast but a late night sweet eat as well!! Will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Was our first time inside was very hot and not very clean tables needed to be wiped down the staff were not very pleasent and seemed put out when we asked questions. The donuts were very dry and the flavors and toppings are blaned. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Any doughnut fresh out of the frier is always a warm welcome. Tried lemonade and banana foster. Lemonade was great, banana foster was just good. Very happy with the service and first great experience."}
{"text":"I am pretty much a girl version of Homer Simpson. Needless to say, I was THRILLED to see a new donut shop so close to home and they did not disappoint! You walk in and are immediately engulfed in the smell of sweet, fried, deliciousness. Similar to Which Wich, you fill out an order form and are given the option of some of their pre-made flavor combos or customizing your own. The donuts are fairly priced and all of the employees were very sweet and helpful. The donuts are given to you piping hot with the toppings melting together perfectly. Also, I love that this place is named after a badass woman! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not a fan of donuts but I bought a dozen to set up a birthday cake! Great idea for someone that doesn't know how to bake. The birthday girl loved them and will be back on her own."}
{"text":"Donut melts in your mouth and I love that it's customized!!! New fave donut place in the valley."}
{"text":"Staying at the Renaissance and needed to bring donuts to my customers. They loved them, so I bought another dozen and a half for another company who has their favorite place and they loved them too. Nice workers there both day. Hours are earlier than posted on the Internet."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the doughnuts here! My favorites were the apple pie doughnut and the salted caramel. My husband liked the bacon bomb. My son liked the death by chocolate. We didn't like the key lime doughnut. I got an iced coffee which was good. Service was a bit slow. I would have expected more than 2 people to be working on a Saturday morning. We will definitely go back. I hope the service is a bit quicker next time."}
{"text":"I will always love KRISPY KREME more than any donut. But this place comes to second best. Seriously so yummy. They come out at the perfect temperature and so fresh. My first time I got the s'mores donut and the cookies and creme. Both are very very good. I was very satisfied. I will try two more the next time I go. If it was closer and donuts weren't so fattening I would have gone another time. I keep dreaming about a warm donut haha. But I recommend this place if you don't have a Krispy Kreme near you and if this is a decent distance. :)"}
{"text":"Holy shit. These are the best donuts I've ever had. They are made fresh the minute you order them so the donuts were nice and warm by the time I got them home. The glazes are perfect. Not too sweet to where it overpowers the donuts and not too think to where you can't taste it. I got a dozen for 17.63. I think it said single donuts are about 1.80. I wish this wasn't so close to me... This could be dangerous."}
{"text":"This place is a 5+ the concept is different and very unique. If someone says they have bad or stale donuts hen they are smoking something. If you want a donut with a twist then this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Every time (aside from the last) I've been to Fractured Prune, everything has been great. The donuts are AMAZING and yes, you need to go try one now.  Last time, however, was a little off the mark. The girl making the donuts was either new or having an off night. The donuts were good but not what I ordered. I did the Arizona spice (?) one but it had key lime glaze all over it so that was a little funky and not what I ordered at all. The donut that was supposed to be key lime was actually peach. :( Based on my previous experience and how friendly the staff was ill still give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Not Just Your Average Doughnut  As you enter the store you grab a  order sheet, and begin the selection process. You can select from one of  Fractured Prune Doughnuts most popular flavor combos, like OC Sand,  Green with Envy, Death by Chocolate, Carnival, or Apple Pie,  or you can pile-on whatever flavours and toppings you are craving.  As you make your way to the counter you can see piles of hot, freshly made doughnuts, awaiting your requests for how they should be glazed and decorated.    The doughnut artist drops dough into hot grease and fries your cake donuts up fresh and crispy. The piping-hot donuts are then liberally dipped into your topping choices as you watch and then the doughnuts are delivered to you piping hot and fresh.  Our favorites were the Smores, Apple Pie, and  Salted Carmel.  But honestly, there probably isn't a doughnut we didn't like.  The staff is  friendly and helpful. The store is immaculate.  Stop by you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"One person to make donuts on a Saturday afternoon...30 minute wait for two donuts that are 4.17...not sure it is worth it. So after eating the two donuts that we ordered...but worth the wait time or price. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"They took away half the menu?! Crazy where is all the extra glazes and Candy toppings. Must bring those back and add some seasonal! That's what Fractured Prune is all about!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical.... Fractured Prune?? But I needed a coffee fix and there isn't much around for that so I decided to check this place out. Usually doughnut/donut places have coffee! (Right?! )   Located at the Westgate shops, not at the Outlet mall but the one closest to the hockey stadium. I walk in.... Smells delicious!! Right off the bat, it smells amazing and I was welcomed by a very cheerful girl behind the bar. She asked if I've ever been there before and come out from behind the counter to help me!  I decided I no longer just wanted a coffee.... They have so many delicious choices and you can even make your own! Once you choose, you write the quantity of each doughnut you want on a piece of paper they supply and you pay. After you pay, they make the doughnuts right then and there, and since it wasn't crowded, my order came out super fast! They were so warm and moist. I had the Blueberry, Carnival, Coffee Cake, and Dulce de Leche and they were all amazing. They also offer hot or iced coffee and you can pour your own creamer, they offer flavors... And you put your own sugar, etc in it.   This place is a definite must try and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever!!!! It's literally a create your own donut factory. so many toppings to choose from and they make the donuts while you watch! It's fun and fresh and so YUMMY!!! We came back the next day but they were closed. Wish they had this in LA!!!! You have to try these donuts!"}
{"text":"We ordered 6 donuts. It was amazing!!! They were warm and soft with a slight crisp. Exactly what you want in a donut. Definitely go try them out. The perfect little indulgence. We recommend the salted caramel or French toast! Yum"}
{"text":"I have been super excited to go to this place. So I just moved back home from being gone for about 5+ years. I walked in to (granted I walked in 5minutes before close) but every guest should get the same great customer experience no matter what time it was. There were two gentlemen working, and immediately put on a face once me and my friends walked in. (YOUR OPEN TILL 10, so serve me until 10) . We were looking at the menu, and one of the gentlemen was in the dining room cleaning and immediately shouted (We are closed, Lock the doors). Talk about a rude experience, thank you for taking my excitement and throwing it out the door. Guess I'll be going to a different location."}
{"text":"We went in one evening after reading about what was new at Westgate. This was exciting since it's a new concept.   We weren't greeted upon arrival. There was a group ahead of us that seemed unhappy and there were a few behind us as well. After ordering and literally watching the staff do nothing except look at each other until one of them started making dough--literally 12 mins after we ordered, the first group came up and seemed to have a confrontation with the manager. There were no experienced adults on staff so the young man who seemed to be in charge was very defensive. Finally after 20 mins we got 4 doughnuts that were subpar. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love the concept and the store is great but not I'm not super impressed with the actual doughnuts.  The flavors were kinda bland."}
{"text":"Pretty cool donut place as you come in you get a order form to pick the donuts you want made fresh. Crazy good combinations of ingredients on the donuts.  Chocolate chips mint frosting to die for.  We got a dozen and they were all good. The only thing I really didn't care for was the fried taste but you get over it with different flavors. Over all good experience here.  Will be returning"}
{"text":"Came here after eating Greek food and I can say these donuts were great it was fun to watch them be made while in line, this was defiantly worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical at the site of the plain donuts. They looked like cake donuts and I figured they'd be too hard. I'm happy to say, I was mistaken. I ordered the bacon donut, and my hubby ordered the French toast. These two were similar in their glaze, but mine had bacon sprinkled in the center.  The outside of the donut was the perfect amount of crispness and the density of the donut was spot on. The inside was warm and I was able to savor each bite. I am a fan of Krispy Creme donuts but the way they melt in my mouth, always leaves me wanting another one (or two). This is not the case with Fractured Prune donuts. I could have had another but I felt satisfied with one.   I look forward to trying more of their creations!"}
{"text":"We were so hungry after watching a movie at AMC. Fractured Prune was just right around the corner. They have such an interesting name. As a first-timer, everything was self-explanatory. There was a little order sheet that I could select from their menu or create my own. We ordered the dulce de leche & salted caramel; and created our own with maple glaze and double bacon.    They have a donut fryer with a conveyor belt. The donut was super fresh. It was warm when I took my first bite. I would definitely return to create more donuts of my own!"}
{"text":"This is a fun and fantastic doughnut place!  They have a very unique and creative way of doing business and bring you a fresh out of the fryer goodness.    You start by picking out what you want on a sheet.  They have several suggest kinds of doughnuts to choose from and even give you the option of creating your own master piece.  You then walk up and pay for what you want which is all reasonably priced.  Then you get to watch your doughnut being made in the fryer in front of you as is put it, flipped, and taken out.  You watch as the glaze and toppings are put on then they are handed to you nice and hot!    They taste exceptionally well with the key being lots of good ingredients and it fresh out of the fryer!  You can sit inside or out to enjoy your food and of course there's a to go option for those on the run.  All in all I was very impressed with this place and will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Fun concept for donuts. You order your donuts using a card, and they fry the donuts to order. (They only make the yellow cake variety of donut) You can have them make it any way you want, or they have about a dozen pre selected flavor options. A little pricey, but at least you know they are fresh. Eating them right away is the best, but they hold up well the next day."}
{"text":"Donuts, toppings (bacon!), icing, and a great price. This is, as you probably have already realized, a doughnut shop where you choose an icing and a topping for your plain doughnut. Yes, the doughnuts are admittedly not huge, but I think for $1.89 apiece it was a fair serving. The ordering process is easy and you either customize a doughnut or choose one of their designs. I went with mocha icing and bacon and M&M's for the topping. Admittedly, the m&m's might have been a bit over the top, but it was tasty. I think if the doughnut had been any larger it would have been too much. It is nice to see some interesting places coming to Westgate after all of the chain mediocrity that is already there."}
{"text":"I really love this custom donut shop. They not only have a number of different toppings, but you can customize your own. They are fresh as well. They are made to order somewhat like a Subway sandwich shop. You can see them create your donut. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The shop is very clean as well.  I will be returning and also tell my friends about it as well!"}
{"text":"Over hyped. Thin tasteless glazes and poor quality donuts. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Have never had a bad experience at Fractured Prune.   Get the mad monkey! Banana glaze with chocolate chips!!  Or   Carmel glaze with coconut and chocolate chips"}
{"text":"YUM! Our first time at this unique donut shop. Basically they make them fresh to order and I got the Blueberry and my wife got the Morning Rush. They are warm and messy so we ate them with a fork. I wish I would have ordered two because they are delicious"}
{"text":"They are cake doughnuts, so keep that in mind. They are really good though. We went in on a Thursday night 10 minutes before closing and a movie had just gotten out. There was a girl on the staff that was really annoyed that we were there and wasn't trying to hide her annoyance at all. She wouldn't let it go and kept rolling her eyes. Made me feel bad for being there."}
{"text":"Some of the best doughnuts I have had. The  best part is eating them fresh and piping hot."}
{"text":"The donuts taste delicious! Great variety and made fresh as you order. A very moist warm cake style donut. Here is the challenge. There is no leadership in this place. The owner is absent there is no vision. The employees are simply there to fill orders and collect a paycheck. An employee, in between preparing donuts, took out a towel and wiped down the counter top with her gloves on, she then proceeded to handle the donuts with the same gloves. No employees corrected her and she proceeded to touch everyone's donuts with dirty gloves. The boxes are placed on top of the donut toppings while they fill them with donuts. The place does not look clean and there is clearly a lack of motivation or inspiration for these employees. Cmon leadership, where are you?"}
{"text":"The most amazing doughnuts in the world. This place is a MUST whenever i have visitors in town. There is nothing else like it. Despite the weird name, these doughnuts are to die for. I crave them constantly."}
{"text":"Aside from the cashier having to ring up every doughnut individually, I thought this place was awesome. Their bacon bomb was simply amazing! A must try if you're visiting the west gate area."}
{"text":"Get 'em - and eat 'em - while they're hot! Something for everyone, that's for sure!  Love the concept but even with the very clever ordering process (you see photos while waiting in line and use sushi-like ordering sheets once you've decided; good luck with that!), I can imagine it takes quite a long time to get your order if there's more than a few people in line. FYI-it took 10-15 minutes to get ours and there was only one family in front of us...  But that Bacon Bomb doughnut was pretty darn good.  So if you've got the time and you've earned a little treat, do give it a try!"}
{"text":"If I could give a half rating I would-2.5 stars. This place was just alright. Definitely cool concept but the doughnuts itself are fried way too long and aren't the same consistency as most shops. Took the 30 minute drive and wasn't impressed. I'll stick to Bosa and save my mileage"}
{"text":"Conveniently located in Westgate near the fountains, which is filled with screaming wet kids, sits a nifty donut shop.    It's a basic cake donut fried to order with your choice of glaze and topping.    6 donuts was $11 which we split between 4 people.  We had a maple glazed with cinnamon and sugar, strawberry glaze with sprinkles, honey glaze with cinnamon and sugar, vanilla glaze with Oreo crumbles, key lime glaze with sugar and chocolate glaze topped with eclair filling.    The honey glazed donut was my favorite but the maple came in close second.    Neat concept, wish they gave an option of filling and wish they dunked the entire donut in the glaze since it's so hard to distinguish them if you let them sit for an hour before indulging."}
{"text":"This place was much better then I expected!! I found this place on yelp and after reading reviews and looking at pics I knew I had to have one or more of those delicious looking donuts! They were made fresh while I waited and the first bite was literally \"A party in my mouth\".  I am here visiting my daughter from Wisconsin, and I will definitely visit Fractured prune donuts next time I come!!!   The guys behind the counter were Awesome as well with Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard ravings about this place so we checked it out. Very interesting as they make your donuts to order. I think that the donuts are quite good, although a bit expensive per the size of the donut. I would like for them to try real fruit glazes rather than the artificial glazes that you see."}
{"text":"I'm trying really hard to lose weight and places like this just aren't helping what so ever. SO and I went in to try it out after his co worker told him about it. Interesting place with a lot of good recipes, the create your own option is awesome as well. I picked a few flavors to try and I have never ever had a better donut. This place is great. Having first thought it was a senior dating service, I am so glad I was wrong."}
{"text":"First time I came in here it didn't seem all that appetizing and there was a long line so we left.  Just went back with my child and now I am sorry I didn't order anything on the first visit.  Honestly one of the best tasting donuts I have had.  The quality and texture of the dough is awesome.  My toppings were also excellent.  Price could be better but the the taste is tremendous."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Fractured Prune! We have one in Tempe, but we were in Glendale for Phoenix Comicon Fan Fest weekend, and needed a sugary, salty, or both(!) treat!  They were running a deal on a free Pig Pen donut on their Yelp App page, so I snagged that while my mom got a Key Lime and both were DELICIOUS.  Will I come back to a Fracture Prune Doughnut in the future? You bet your doughnuts I will! And afterwards you'll see me walking home to work off those lovely calories I just deliciously ingested!"}
{"text":"A nice place to stop by if you're in the mood for a different kind of treat. They have a donut for anyone, and they're baked right then and there. On Wednesdays they have a hump day special for 6 donuts. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Drove from Scottsdale with my kids for a special treat and walk up to the door with my 4 kids and to find out they are closed. They closed 30min before they have posted on the door."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge donut fan. Especially ones full of toppings. We came here last week to meet with the photographer that were using for our wedding. I have to say this place it's pretty interesting. They do you have a huge selection of topping and then they also have build your own. We opted with the ones that they already have on the menu. I posted a picture of all of the donuts we got. The OC Sand was my fav. I just like how it was nice light and fluffy wasn't overly sweet or overly full of toppings. So awesome how you can watch the donuts being made and fried and how they do all the toppings. I definitely like how they aren't just sitting out all day like Dunkin' Donuts or Krispy Kreme. They are made fresh to order which was pretty nice. Not sure if I would come back here just because i'm not one to crave donuts. But overall it was a really great place to meet with our photographer and have some donuts."}
{"text":"I give this place a thumbs up! I'm so impress with how soft the donut is and how it just melts in your mouth. You can experience the donuts being freshly made right  in front of you. Although its a cake donut, I'm surprise on how well the dough is and how spot on it was fried. So soft and yummy! The toppings we're not so overpowering, it is well balanced and beautifully made. I took my 9 yr old son, and he loves it as much as i did. Krispy Kremes, you have competition! I will be coming back for more"}
{"text":"Santi and I came to check out this doughnut store after finding it on Yelp. The sizable interior included a large overhead menu, plenty of seating, TV, natural sunlight, and assembly line to showcase the doughnut-making process. Doughnut enthusiasts should expect to fill out an ordering form to customize each purchase by glaze and topping, submit and pay at the counter, and follow the assembly line to retrieve your made to order doughnuts.   We ordered the Chocolate Covered Cherry Doughnut, Salted Caramel Doughnut, Apple Pie Doughnut, and Pumpkin Spice Doughnut ($1.89 each). Served warm, the size of these doughnuts were small and the texture was surprisingly weak. The exterior came with a few crispy spots and was easy to cut into with a knife. As cake doughnuts, the fatigued texture was missing the denser crumbly cakey consistency. The toppings and glaze tasted artificial and watered down. This included the Pumpkin Spice and the Salted Caramel, as the flavors were faint, and the quality of the doughnut was lackluster. Additionally, we couldn't detect the Apple Pie flavor, and the watery Cherry glaze tasted artificial. For the price, we expected quality ingredients, balance across profiles in texture and taste, and agreed the visit was a waste of money and calories.  Service was inconsistent, as we were given conflicting suggestions on separate occasions by the same person at the register. We did, however, enjoyed the spacious seating arrangement and warm sunlight coming through the windows. Overhyped and overemphasized by reviewers, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I really like the concept, and wanted to love it. There is a great selection of glazes and toppings ... unfortunately the donut itself is not for me. Instead of the typical soft and airy donut, it's dense and cake-like, similar to what you can buy prepackaged in the supermarket snack section. I just don't like this type or flavor of donut, so that sort of ruins the overall experience for me."}
{"text":"Each and every donut our group ordered was done perfectly.  They are a WorldVentures participating provider and I couldn't be prouder.  Donuts and staff were incredible!  Thank you WV for partnering with this great company."}
{"text":"So yes, the donuts are $2 a piece, and the donut itself isn't that big, BUT you get to choose a glaze and two toppings on a fresh, hot donut! Mmmm so good and so fresh. You can choose from one of their favorites, or make your own. I got the honey glaze with coconut and sea salt. Sweet with a hint of saltiness, yum!  The guy that helped us, maybe the manager, was so very nice. He welcomed us and thanked us for giving them a try, explained how to order donuts, and was genuine the whole time! By the way, to order, you fill out this paper with the kinds of donuts you want, and then you bring it up to the register. I like it this way, so people that don't know what they want don't hold up the line...  Anyways, the donut was very good, and one was enough for me. I wouldn't come here to buy a dozen of these for breakfast, but I would definitely come here as a dessert place for after dinner, movies, or hanging with some friends."}
{"text":"Come in and say hi! Best donuts in the valley! Happy Hour everyday 11an-6pm! That's 3 made to-order donuts! For $5!"}
{"text":"Located in Westgate's Mall complex in Glendale, this place is awesome. The smell alone is enticing. Think of it as a doughnut bar. You get to choose from several different flavors of glazes and toppings. They make the doughnuts from scratch, right in front if you. Yummy. Very family friendly and Military discount is offered. Check this place out."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place plenty of times and finally gave it a try with the family. You fill out a form, choosing an existing type of donut or creating your own. I chose the French Toast donuts. Your donut is made fresh while you watch. My donut was hot and delicious. I will happily return."}
{"text":"There's no other place like it! Everything is good here and their breakfast sandwiches  (Eggnut) are really good! Come check them out when you get a chance! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Purchased coupon one month ago that the FP owner sells through the entertainment dining advantage website (the same entertainment company that sells those huge coupon books....totally legit company).  Tried to use the coupon last night, but the clerk said the owner does not accept coupons.  Okay, then why is he selling then on the entertainment website?   Coupon was for this specific location and expiration date is 12-31-2018."}
{"text":"Yummy donuts, made with fresh dough in front of you.  Topped with delicious glaze frosting (choice of 20 flavors) and additional toppings (choice of 20 different toppers).  Visually similar to cake or old fashioned donuts but incredibly light.  Highly recommend for happy hour (11-6) for a slight discount.  Long line but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Freshly made! The OC sand is simple but very flavorful!!! I'm usually very picky about my donuts but this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Cool concept but all the donuts taste the same. We got Carnival, French Toast, Marshmallow, S'more, and Oreo. Too heavy for me and pricey for a donut. Probably wouldn't try again. Coffee is good."}
{"text":"Great experience. You can create your donut flavor. I watched them make my doughnut from scratch Through the donut fryer."}
{"text":"Great donuts! Had a blast watching them being made and loved the endless options!"}
{"text":"Some local friends took us here and I'm soooooo glad they did!  It was worth the 40 minute drive from Scotsdale!  This place is so uniquely Phoenix and I almost wish it wasn't because I could love having a place like this back home in Texas!  The doughnuts are freshly made to order and you watch the process as you walk the line to receive your custom made doughnut.  I also loved the idea of getting a free doughnut with my \"check in\" and it was a great fluffy dessert, especially if you add the ice cream on top!  The wifey chose to opt out of the creamy addition and she was kicking herself and eating almost all of mine for it!  I particularly love the explanation of the name and the company history that is given when you arrive...I leave that up to you to go and learn it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Went in 10 minutes before close and they wouldn't serve me. Seriously out of dough????"}
{"text":"You have to check this place out if you go to Westgate, it is a must! Take your child their for the kid's meal and they get to keep the frisbee which is fabulous! It is so much fun to try the different flavors and watch them make the donuts."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when we came here but I told my daughter about this place and she could design her own donut. They make the donuts after you order them, They look like they will be heavy and dense but that are really soft and perfect. We ordered a dozen and I ate 4!! and I liked them all"}
{"text":"Wow! I didn't know they donuts were made fresh to order. I wasn't too adventurous this time, but it didn't matter. The donuts melt in your mouth and are delicious with just enough sweet. The flavors offered will satisfy everyone as they have a build your own option. Can't eat these all the time, but they will definitely be an occasional treat."}
{"text":"Having walked by a few times before and after Arizona Coyotes, this place caught my interest.  On a recent Friday morning, I decided to treat my mom on her birthday to one of these delicious rings of goodness.  We got three donuts to split (S'More, OC, and French Toast).  As you can see first hand walking into the establishment, they are fresh, hot, and made to order.  The original pastries were as amazing as they sounded!  Overall, the staff was friendly, helpful, and fast.  The place was clean too, but for as new as it is, you have to expect that.  My brain is telling me we just can't go back, but my stomach is saying, we gotta try the_____.  At a cost of $1.89 per donut, they are on the pricey side, but so worth it.  Do yourself a favor, and cave in to your gut!  May I suggest everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"A fresh, hot doughnut straight out of the fryer which could potentially be made any way I want it. This should be a dream come true. But there are too many flaws to the concept, that just makes Fractured Prune feel like nothing more than an overpriced snack.  1. $1.80 for a standard size doughnut. That's a pretty hefty price tag. 2. There's only one actual doughnut type. You can cover it with any glaze you want to add flavor. But all of the doughnuts are the same plain cake doughnut. There isn't even an option for a chocolate doughnut. Seems like a missed opportunity for extra flavors. 3. Most of the toppings are same items you can find at any self-serve frozen yogurt shop. It kind of makes me wish I were saving myself the fat and calories and eating at one of those places. 4. If you eat it right away you will (a) burn the hell out of your mouth [yes, it's that fresh which should be a good thing] and (b) will only taste the oil. Seems kind of silly that I need to wait for doughnut to cool down before I can taste it. 5. Potentially long wait. The first time I tried a doughnut here there was a sizable line to order, which also turned into a quite a wait for a doughnut. Not exactly the type of snack I have much patience to wait for. 6. A really stupid name. I know there's some crazy story behind it about the original location's landlady, but I still feel like an idiot saying I bought a doughnut from the Fractured Prune.  But having said all that; The Fractured Prune is still a lot better than most of the standard doughnut chains. So if you don't have the time to go out of the way to a small shop, you're much better off picking up doughnuts from here."}
{"text":"I think I died and went to heaven. The smell alone of this place makes it worth it. I'm s bit dramatic I know, but literally so yummy. The fact that you can watch them being made after you order, that they can be eaten right away while still warm is amazing. I love the idea that you can pick up a card and either create one or choose from their menu. This makes the line go so much faster. With it being tucked in west gate along with restaurants and the movie theatre it is the perfect treat after a movie or a meal. I will say they are very sweet. I love my sweets and am definitely one who loves probably way more sugar than i should, but even I can't handle eating more than one. A bit on the pricey side, but it's s great splurge once and a while. Bacon donut need I say more?"}
{"text":"Cool place to go for expensive made to order donut treats. You pick from a list or can customize your own. You get to watch them make your donuts from start to finish. These donuts are good. The donut batter here is like thick cake not like the light donuts that melt in your mouth. Not sure if what this type of donut bread this is. But you must have coffee or milk or water with this. I will be back when I feel like having this kind of sweet."}
{"text":"A little pricy for a donut. The donuts are okay in taste and quality. Definitely fun making your own donut creation."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try out these crazy donuts....I got the cookies and cream and it was very good .my daughter got the bacon bomb....yuck...the bacon should be crispy,hot and not cold. It left a yucky taste in my mouth. If it was crispy and kept warm it would be better. I will try another flavor later."}
{"text":"I love donuts & was excited to see that they have so many choices in flavored & toppings. I didn't care for the donuts I tried, very heavy & too sweet."}
{"text":"A-MA-ZING!!!  If you've never had a light and airy doughnut, that's fresh and hot, with the toppings all gooey and drippy, then you haven't experienced pure bliss.  They have their specialty doughnuts, but you can also customize to your liking.  We've tried both, and they've all been deliciously decadent.  For a special treat...give it a go...you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Blah. Another failure for Westgate. Disgusting donuts made from grease. Great concept but not worth another visit."}
{"text":"Great service and great custom donuts to your satisfaction. Shae is the best and this girl loves her job. Thanks again Shae and Steve for a great experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I were walking around Westgate to see if anything was new and saw this place. We went inside and ordered the OC Sand and the S'mores. I absolutely loved the OC Sand but we weren't too crazy about the S'mores one. It seemed like it maybe needed more of the marshmallow part than the chocolate or graham cracker. Other than that it was a great experience and I look forward to trying more flavors!"}
{"text":"Fractured Prune makes their doughnuts to order, which is something that I can't commend them enough for.   The other half of the FP experience is what makes or breaks each piece, as guests are left to select their own glaze and topping. From there, it's really a matter of what you're going to do with this responsibility that's been given to you.   Are you going to leave it at it's most pure form and accentuate it with just a hint of your favorite glaze? Or will you walk out with an overgrown candy bar on top of a slightly fried piece of dough? FP lets you pick!"}
{"text":"I hate writing this review because I've eaten there in the past and it was very good.  I went in this morning, June 5th and there were 4 employees working; a cashier, a cook, and 2 people making donuts, or maybe I should say 1 1/2 person making donuts as 1 was working very hard, the other would make a couple, then clean for 10 minutes, then make a couple more.  I ordered my usual 2 donuts thinking I'd get them in 5 - 10 minutes as usual.  20 minutes later, still no donuts and same employee suppossed to be making donuts, just standing around like she was lost.  1 other lady was waiting next to me.  I asked her how long she had been waiting and she said 25 minutes for 2 donuts as well.  Finally, I asked the person standing around why she wasn't helping make the donuts.  The cashier at that time, jumped into action and started making donuts as well.  They cleared the back orders after that in just a couple minutes.  Why weren't they all working to start with?  Why did it take a customer to ask about their procedures for them to get everything made?  Not sure, but know I won't be going back for a while until they get things straightened out."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a date night at Westgate. We have seem this place on twitter so we thought we would try it. It was really busy so I could see it was very popular. We wrote on the paper what we wanted. We took it up to the cashier and we watched how they made the donuts. It was really neat watching them cook and watching them decorated with all the toppings. We got a salted Carmel, 2 mocha, cookie and cream, and a Smore's. The donuts were delicious. It is alil spendy so we won't be going all the time but we would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is the best donut shop in AZ! Not only to they hand make the dough, they have such a variety with toppings and it's unlike anything you'd have anywhere else! Fancy donuts that are delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm rating this fairly well because of the overall vibe and the novelty value of watching the machines fry your doughnuts right in front of you, plus you get to see them make your order, well, to order.  When I was there, they had a reasonable deal that included a knockoff brand Frisbee and I think two doughnuts?   These aren't my favorite type of doughnut; to me, they are heavy with grease.  Not what I want, but just because I only like filled doughnuts doesn't mean this place is terrible.  Just bear in mind you're not going to get any eclairs or anything like that here."}
{"text":"We had these at talking stick arena last night while watching the Arizona rattlers play indoor football. These donuts were absolutely amazing. They are served hot. I had the apple pie donut, and it was awesome. My husband had the strawberry with sprinkles and my son just had a honey glazed. So good."}
{"text":"Fractured Prune is the best place to get a hot and fresh cake donut! I've been here a handful of times and it never fails to satisfy donut cravings.   Bewarned: these donuts are messy. Stock up on napkins before hand.   My sister and I went right as they were opening up. We ordered three donuts: Apple caramel, blueberry hill, and rocky shores.   It took a little longer than normal but when they were ready we were surprised to be given double our order. The girl apologized for the wait because the machine hadn't been working properly so they comped us three extra donuts. Super nice customer service!   The donuts were hot and crunchy and fluffy and exactly what we wanted x2."}
{"text":"Delicious cake donuts that allows you to customize any way you want. Always made fresh and hot right in front of you. Not the typical donut!"}
{"text":"Great selection of donuts. Pretty busy place most days.,"}
{"text":"Great and creative way to get donuts. Fast service?you can order what ever glazed and toppings that you like! Bacon topping? You got it. You should try. Hot and fresh donut made to order."}
{"text":"This was our first time. When you go in there's a counter with paper and pencil to select your type of donut. Then you walk around the counter to the register and hand your selection to the guy at the front and pay for your donuts. I'm giving 5 stars based on my kids reaction to the donuts. They said they were the best doughnuts they ever had. I liked them too but I'm more of a plain glazed doughnut kind of girl when it comes to doughnuts. My kids had sprinkles and other toppings. What stood out the most was that you can watch them make the doughnuts right in front of you, from the moment they drop them in the hot oil to the moment they are layed in the box. We would stop by again. Oh yeah and the doughnuts are like a cake texture doughnut."}
{"text":"Love the concept of the place, love the vibe. The donuts were a little heavy/rich for my liking....but that was partially my bad. I'll def be back though!"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night, very quiet. Was excited I was able to experience the whole process. I've passed on other nights where this place is packed."}
{"text":"Excellent doughnut. Love the options and flavors.  Everything made in front of you.  Bacon and bacon.  Can't bet that. Mint and chocolate chips. Just like ice cream.  So good.  Get a tshirt for the road. Be proud."}
{"text":"I'm a raised donut kind of gal, so giving Fractured Prune a try you can say there was a bit of a hesitation. However, with the rave reviews and smells of deep fried goodness wafting through the air, it was hard not to be drawn in especially with the idea of DIY donuts? How can you resist? Even with a donut bias.  I decided to go with two self made donuts and one from the menu: 1) Peach Glaze & Graham Crackers 2) Maple Glaze & Bacon 3) Caramel Glaze & Sea Salt  The cake donuts themselves are so airy, moist and warm. They had a slight crisp exterior and soft contrasting interior, it was superb! Kind of similar to funnel cake! The Peach Glaze and Graham Crackers left a lot to be desired, not much peach flavor or that great cinnamon flavor found in Graham Crackers. The Maple Glaze was good, though the Bacon was a bit soggy and soft. The Caramel Glaze was subtle in Caramel flavor and was salty, nothing too complex here.  Big fan of the choice of creating my own donut, the freshness of donuts here and the great texture of their cake donuts. The glazes aren't great and toppings weren't bold in flavor by any means, but I believe with Fractured Prune ... less is more, stick to a classic glaze and enjoy.  Would definitely come back, but probably with a maple or chocolate glaze only."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of cake doughnuts, but thought I'd give this place a try.  I'm glad I did, but I wasn't blown away. There's a simple ordering process, the donuts are made fresh and to order, and you're in and out pretty quickly considering what's going on with the doughnuts. I ordered a Strawberry Princess (don't judge me!) thinking it would be extremely sweet.  My husband made his own with maple glaze and bacon.  We left with still hot donuts in a box and headed home.  We have now sampled these doughnuts, and while it's not at all what I expected, it's not terrible.  My Princess didn't taste like anything but the cake itself.  No strawberry flavoring to be found.  The maple glaze is flavorless as well, according to my husband.  If the glazes were a bit stronger/more potent I would be back here weekly.  The doughnuts themselves are really good, but not enough to draw me back time and again.  It's a great concept and an awesome location, but not my favorite dessert option in the vicinity."}
{"text":"One day my boyfriend and I were walking around Westgate and finally gave in to trying this place out. (We try and limit our delicious donut intake hehe.) When we walked in it was completely empty..like even behind the counter. But after only 2 seconds the worker walked out and was super friendly and helpful. She asked if we'd been there before and explained everything to us. We took a few minutes to decide cause there is so many options!! I love the idea of filling out a card to tell them your order and I was also surprised that they fry the actual donut right then and there! (Never had been to a place like this before.)  My boyfriend got one topped with bacon and the bacon was extremely crisp and fresh tasting. Our entire experience was amazing! The only thing I could thing of as a downside was that since they are served fresh, we had to wait a minute or two to dig in cause they were hot! I really want to return and try more toppings/glaze etc. I think it's a great date night thing because it's cheaper than a sit down restaurant for dessert and you get to have fun with it! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Too many selections. Very difficult and overwhelming to make a decision. Standard base donut with different toppings.   Donuts were fresh and made right in front of you. Average tasting donut. Same consistency as a New England dough boy."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts. Some people have complained that they are all the same flavor. That's not entirely accurate. The donut itself is a basic cake donut; the same base donut is used for all. However, the flavor really comes from the added toppings. Unlike others, I am a fan of the bacon bomb, even though the bacon isn't warm like the donut. The apple pie donut was also very tasty, as is the French toast. They get 4 stars because the donuts are a bit pricey, however, you do get a better deal if you purchase a dozen rather than buying individual donuts.  They make the donuts fresh, so be patient. They also give you back your order slip, which helps identify which is which. Get there early on football game days or else you may end up paying for parking. There are usually a few curb spots available."}
{"text":"Wow  Bypassing the disconcerting name that makes me think of fiber-induced regularity, this place is A-MAY-ZING. Be warned that the long list of options makes for a lot of combinations. So, come ready to spend a few minutes putting your tastes to doughnuts the first time.  The location is trendy and vibrant. The store is bright with pleasant staff. And the flavors make one salivate. FP's menu is split into specialty doughnuts and build-your-own. For the former, we ordered Blueberry Hill, Carmel Bliss, Chocolate Cherry, Dulce De Leche, Sand, French Toast, and a few others. On the custom list, you pick from a total of around 30 glazes and toppings. As they list, \"There's no wrong way to make a doughnut.\"  The doughnut bread is of the heavier, cake-type bread. One could stand for a meal if you want. Key word being \"if\". :o)   Prices aren't bad, so you can go crazy. I ordered twice as many as I intended to, just because of all the flavors and the cost."}
{"text":"Primera ves que vengo, más no la última, muy buen concepto, mucha variedad para escoger y muy buena las donas."}
{"text":"eat it fresh, so delicious and ono! outside crouncy and inside soft! Eclairs are to die for!"}
{"text":"I came in to buy my kid a donut but you can only buy them 2 at a time. So we got zero donuts. Skip this place its overpriced."}
{"text":"What's all the hype? Are people getting paid to leave good reviews?? From the pictures and reviews, decided I'd come here with dad and get donuts before heading home. You go in, fill out a paper and turn it in...they fry the donuts right then and there, so they're fresh. Smells amazing inside. Service was great...when I bit into a donut when I got back home is where it all went downhill for me. Bacon donuts are usually my favorite and nearly impossible to mes those up! Well, I bit into my bacon donut, and it was disgusting! Bacon tastes stale, and donut part it dry, greasy, and tasteless. Bit into another donut of the 12 we had bought...chocolate covered strawberry I think it was...ugh, this one is disgusting too. Tasted like strawberry cough syrup. We ended up throwing about 5 or 6 donuts away...also, they look NOTHING like the pictures... $15 for a dozen donuts?? Definitely not worth it, especially when I come here all the way from Surprise on a rainy night. Save yourself the money and gas and go get your dozen donuts from Safeway or krispy creme...they have way better donuts. Won't be back, sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Delicious donuts made fresh in front of your eyes. I ordered the Gorilla which is their chocolate flavor and it was warm, soft and melt in your mouth good. The location is convenient and only reason for the 4 stars is because the staff could be friendlier."}
{"text":"Favorite donut shop! If in the area this is a must stop. The donuts are cooked fresh to order."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally decided to try this place after going in two different times just to look. All the different flavor combinations kinda freak me out a little bit since I tend to stick with glazed or chocolate frosted donuts. We decided to try the O.C. Sand (honey glaze + cinnamon sugar) and Cookies & Cream (vanilla glaze + cookie crumbs). I liked the sheets of paper that you make your selections on (like Which Wich, where we had eaten earlier). Got to watch our donuts being made. I thought the pools of glaze that they plop the donuts into looked strange and also noticed the toppings get cross-contaminated from the different glazes. Hmm... interesting. When I tried the donuts, I was pleasantly surprised! They were still warm and had a nice texture. For some reason I thought the donuts were going to be cold and dense. Definitely happy with our selections. I guess I'll have to come back and try some other flavors."}
{"text":"Items Selected: French Toast - maple glaze + cinnamon sugar Rocky Shores - honey glaze + cinnamon sugar + mini chocolate chips Pig Pen - sweet bbq glaze, bacon, tajin spice Strawberry Shortcake - strawberry glaze + graham crackers + powdered sugar  Embracing the ongoing doughnut renaissance through expanding operation that has seen franchises opened from Colorado to the East Coast and back it was en route to University of Phoenix Stadium that I popped in to Fractured Prune and with fans both Buckeye and Irish standing in wait for hot n' fresh fried rings the smell alone was enough to raise expectations, and almost inexhaustible array of options for customization doing the same.  \"Always HOT since 1976\" with a clever name explained both on the walls above the fryer and available online the concept behind Fractured Prune is a rather simple conveyor belt process sending dough from left to right and register to consumer, more than a dozen glazes and far more toppings to be selected  from a list of \"Our Favorites\" or customized by a simple paper ordering slip, each one carefully finished by hand for $1.89 with discounts on a half-dozen or more.  Uncertain as to how or why concepts like this or Southeast's Duck Donuts have not gained more of a foothold on the market, though price likely plays a part, it was with four selections made that a short wait ensued and taking the quartet to a windowside seat it was not long before indulgence began, first bites of \"French Toast\" showing a high quality soft crumb beneath the cinnamon sugar dust and bold maple glaze.  Far less oily than feared, the levity of the batter a surprise given the texture within, teeth next plunged into the recently launched \"Pig Pen\" with restrained heat peaking amidst flavors more similar to pulled pork than bacon, the Strawberry Shortcake not quite as fruity as would have been hoped while \"Rocky Shores\" was a bold balance of honey sweetness and bitter chocolate chips."}
{"text":"The texture is insanely bomb. Crunchy but soft, not too crunchy tho. Best donuts I've ever had seriously. They're so not ordinary."}
{"text":"Made fresh donuts. I have to say it was finger licking good. Must try if you're in that area. I had the blueberry and dulce de leche donuts and both were soooo good."}
{"text":"Yummy doughnuts with creative flavors and friendly staff, but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Baller! This place is bad ass! Take your time to review the menu, and then fire away. There is no bad choice."}
{"text":"Went in this past weekend, not knowing what it was but being drawn in by the menu. The idea is pretty cool, you can order some unique donuts or even build your own with various glazes and toppings but in the end, it was just a so-so cake donut that was pretty spendy. I would say you should check it out just because they're pretty unique and it's pretty great ordering a donut covered in bacon."}
{"text":"I heard from lots of people that this is a very nice place with tasty donuts. I m not impressed. The idea is nice have a donut ur way with lots of toppings  and combinations, but the donuts itself is not even close to be good one . The oil they were cooked in was almost black ( I didn't know when it was changed last time) compered to donuts from bobbyq it is nothing. Won't go again . And not going to recommend."}
{"text":"Cheap donuts. Very warm. Lots of options. They make them right in front of you which is very neat. Did I mention cheap. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I stopped very quickly to pick up some doughnuts to take home as a 1st timer. I didn't know they had that many options so I just went with the number 1 seller which I believe is the honey glazed. I brought it home 10min away and a few minutes later I served my self on a plate and the doughnut was still warm. I was impressed! I topped it with ice cream and I ate it. The soft warm inside complimented the crunchy sweet outside. I will be returning back to this place to try other flavors. It was very delicious! I didn't like the small seating area but it is a small place not much you can do about that because of the space. All the seating was taken so it's good to see but not convenient when you Have a 1yr old."}
{"text":"The most unusually delicious donuts probably on the planet! I've made three or four visits and have never been disappointed. Good coffee too."}
{"text":"This is a donut shop, and for how much people talk about it I was expecting a lot more. I did enjoy that they added the toppings right in front of you and the donuts were warm when you received them but it wasn't anything really special. Not bad but not amazing, if you are in the mood for a donut and you're nearby stop in, by it's nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Many selections and you get to watch the donuts made there, sounds better than it looks though because donuts are fried and you get to watch the batter get dropped into a lot of oil. I rather not have to see that part and just accept it as a guilty pleasure. The pictures show a nice glaze on the donuts but when you get them the glaze is barely there. I think the donuts look better in the advertisements. I have a sweet tooth but this is not one of my favorites."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The donuts are made fresh right in front of you with tons of options for glazes and toppings. The possible combinations are endless. I always make sure to stop by here (usually more than once) when visiting Phoenix. They have a buy one get one free deal with a spring training ticket."}
{"text":"Went there today because of the sale on donuts.  The guy working was very nice.  The selection was amazing.  We got 6 of them, one for each member of my family (and me 2).  They fried the donuts on the spot, and put the toppings on.  Took them home because we had just had dinner.  They smelled amazing.  I took one out, took one bite, and nearly had to spit it out.  It was greasy.  Yeah, I know donuts are fried in grease, but I know other donut shops that aren't greasy.  Had others in the family try theirs.  Some liked them, others didn't.  A mixed bag."}
{"text":"Fractured prune such a unique name right. I wanted to try these freshly made dibs on my visit to Arizona. The set up is smart they have a list that you choose from and pick how many you want. I was there with 3 other people, and we didn't want a dozen, but it was much cheaper. We got a variety of donuts from dulce de leche to strawberry shortcake and so forth. The donuts are fresh so obviously they are greasy, but still yummy. After 2 donuts it's too much they are good, but way to rich. This is a must try at least once. The day we went there was only a couple people the staff was nice the place was spotless, and we got our donuts quickly. I will visit again, not sure about getting a dozen it's just way too much."}
{"text":"We were in West Gate distract this evening and the kids came across this place... Lots of favors and toppings to pick from it took us awhile  I loved the sea salt and bacon! Very clean ... Friendly staff... Fast service for the large amount of people there this evening.... We will return again soon"}
{"text":"Any donut flavor you can imagine. Very modern concept. They only offer cake donuts, not raised. They are fried fresh as you order. Very fun to visit, price keeps them from getting 5 stars. (16.00/dozen)"}
{"text":"Why change something good?? We would frequent this place, and today when we came in  the whole menu was changed.  Less toppings, less choices, horrible customer service.  You can't buy single donuts anymore your options are 2,6,12 good buy customization!!  Kids menu of 2 donuts and a milk off the menu,  GONE. The only reason you got two stars is because the actual donut didn't change, Thank goodness!!  When asked about the change he said while rolling his eyes, we got new owners.  People visit because of the appeal of customizing what you want. Charge for an extra topping if someone wants more than 2 toppings increase your revenue instead of turning away unsatisfied customers. And always remember that first impressions are huge.  The employee at the register was super unfriendly unhelpful and just straight up rude. Save your money, go buy a basic donut from your local grocer heat it in a microwave and throw some sprinkles on top from your cupboard."}
{"text":"Man!!!  Aaama-Zaning!!!   I ordered strawberry glaze and the blackberry frost.  TO DIE FOR.  Best D-M!!! doughnut EVER!  Service was quick and they were SUPER DUPER FRIENDLY!!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up and I had a sweet tooth. I stopped on by and there was a short line but it took awhile to get the doughnuts which is expected considering they make them as you order. I like how they have a large variety for you to choose from. The doughnut I got was pretty good."}
{"text":"OMG...I just happened to stop in this place on a whim. The employees walked me through how to build my own doughnut. It was amazing. I would say I will be back often but I would weigh 300 lbs. It will definitely be a special treat!  Employees were great and friendly but they did tell me I had come in when the store was very slow and the line was usually out the door."}
{"text":"Fast and Friendly service! The donuts were moist and fluffy, toppings push it over the delicious edge! The donuts are a base batter and the toppings give it its flavor."}
{"text":"Ridiculously overrated. I don't like how you can only buy one flavor of donut. The toppings sound delicious, but they are not. I was very disappointed - I could have had a better-tasting, much cheaper donut at Dunkin Donuts."}
{"text":"Went in and placed our order for 3 donuts to serve as desert after a nice meal at the yardhouse and a movie at AMC. Well the total was $6.45 and we had an expired groupon that was worth $6 (instead of the promotional value $10) the cashier either didnt know how to use the groupon or something and insisted we needed to order more items. We asked to speak to the manager and the cashier was also the manager and still couldnt figure out how to ring up the order with the groupon.  Left there with no donuts and ended up at Star Donuts in Surprise which delivered awesome donuts and boba drinks! Sad to say I will not be going back to Fractured Prune in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place best donut shop on the west side a Phoenix. Love the fact you can customize them the way you want  Had chocolate with bacon toppings and the cookies and cream ones they are the best"}
{"text":"Very, very good. The texture of these donuts is lighter and crispier than a normal donut and they are all made fresh right in front of you. And the flavor combinations are very unique."}
{"text":"I can't believe that this place has so many stars and good reviews. We went and had to wait in line, and got a variety of donuts, and they were awful. The donut had the taste of being soaked in the grease it was cooking in for a long time, but it didn't because we saw them being made but they were absolutely awful. everybody that was in that night while we were there said the same thing they were just not good. I don't think I would even try again to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Awesome! Fun/easy process for ordering. Just use the paper menu to check off which doughnut(s) you want then pay. They are made one at a time after you order. They are all made using the same base doughnut, but the toppings vary. There are a TON of options and combinations to try. There is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"These doughnuts will leave you thinking about them for days!  My sister bought a couple for my husband and I and brought them over to our place. I am not a huge fan of doughnuts, so I was ready to place the small box on the counter for my husband to eat later, but when I grabbed the box I could feel that the doughnuts inside were still warm. I don't know about you, but when it comes to sweets, if they are still warm...ah, heaven.  I immediately opened the box and saw that glaze was nice and melting, so were the chocolate chips my sister had picked for my doughnut. We hadn't eaten dinner yet, so I decided I would wild in a very controlled way and only take one bite. HA! Joke was on me! I couldn't stop eating it.  The doughnuts were the perfect consistency. They were slightly crunchy on the outside and soft and cakey on the inside. So good. Nothing like what feels like stale puffs of air from Krispy Kreme.  I can't say much about their customer service because I haven't been in the shop.  Try them. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found out that this was a doughnut place after walking around WestGate. We were excited for a different doughnut place besides Dunkin or QT. We were hardly impressed. They fry the dough too fast. The outside has a weird texture and the inside wasn't cooked the full way through. We could barely taste the flavor of the glazes.   We love the idea of it, but they need to slow down and actually DUNK the donuts in the glaze.   They get 3 stars because it has potential to grow. We will probably go to the waffle place across the way before we go back here."}
{"text":"The donuts were very good! Cool options and neat idea! The staff was very friendly and helpful because it was my first time here. A tad pricey but definitely worth trying, kids will love it! $5 for 3 donuts during happy hour from 11am-6pm daily."}
{"text":"These donuts are very yummy and hot ready for your enjoyment.   Great donuts, pricey but hey - you shouldn't be eating too many!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good not great, I think I need to try it again with different toppings.  I do NOT recommend the bacon, cold and fatty on a warm doughnut was just not appetizing.  Both my kids said they liked other doughnut places better and for almost $2 a pop not really worth it."}
{"text":"Love love love the freshness and creativity. Also DreamTrips members are able to earn pints here. Yayyyyy"}
{"text":"\"Fractured Prune?\" What does that even mean?  It sure got my attention.  I actually first heard of it through word of mouth, so I had to see what its all about.    In a nutshell, its the Chipotle of Doughtnuts.  Sort of.  You won't see a glass counter full of pre-made doughnuts, your order is made freshly in front of you.  As you go through the line and try to figure what you want, you are just overwhelmed with choices.  There's a slew of different doughnut creations you can have them make OR just invent a custom one to your tasting.  I guess that's the beauty and uniqueness they bring.'  The one thing I can judge at this point is the base doughnut which is what every guest starts out with before deciding on what concoction of toppings you end up with.  To simply put it, its very \"cake-y.\"  You get to see the entire process, literally made in front of you, from the raw doughnut ring dropping into the frying all the way to it rolling off the fryer.    As a huge doughnut fan, its a fun experience to see.  As far as toppings are concerned, it truly is an abundance of choices.  Jokingly, I'm no good when it comes to choices, I take too long to decide.  I go with my guts and what my taste buds are typically drawn too is how I end up deciding.    Anyways, if doughnuts if your thing and you love choices, you will love it."}
{"text":"Really fun place.  You get to pick your toppings and the donuts are serves fresh and hot. Great place to hir after the movies"}
{"text":"Cool spot for when you're craving something sweet. The doughnuts are made to order and they give it to you in a box. We ate them with forks because they were so soft."}
