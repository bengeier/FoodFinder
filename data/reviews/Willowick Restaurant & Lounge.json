{"text":"We used to come here a few years ago so we were kind of regulars i suppose anyways. I came here with my dad for dinner this last weekend, and cant complain about the food its homemade food not bar food which they have that, but they have home cooking no other bar has that. My dad got the pork chops i got the spaghetti and meatballs which i thought it was really good. The staff isnt rude either their food is good, theyre clean yes the outside is kind of boring with a patio, but thats besides the point. You dont feel like you have to go home and shower after leaving here like how you do at some bars you go to. Ive been there no one likes that feeling at all when a bar is so filthy that you feel grossed out to even eat there. Its clean, their bathrooms are clean as well. You can tell that your food is quality meaning most places just slop something together amd charge you an arm and a leg for it. Everything.is just fresh, and yummy."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give eve one star to this establishment. The waitresses are rude, there food is awful. Even with a really good band playing there is no one there.  Unless you enjoy bad food, an indifferent, rude experience from the staff and overpriced drinks, I would stay away. Many, many, many better options in the area"}
{"text":"I am a fan of their pierogies!!  These $5 gifts from heaven are AWESOME!  Ana, the restaurant / bar manager is also the daughter of the owners.  MA (the mother) cooks most of the food or at least provides all the recipes while 'The Ol'' Man sits at the end of the bar entertaining the patrons.    I like this place because the people there are soooo nice.  There is almost always free food out, they have the occasional band, and best yet, NO GUY BARTENDERS!!  They need something to get the boys away to spend some cash right?  Stop in on a random weekend, sit at the bar, order a beer and some pierogies, you won't be disappointed.  You'll also be amazed on how big and open it is in there.  They have some video games, a juke, decent bathrooms, and ample bar stools.  If its nice out, you'll find some people out on their patio which is really nice."}
