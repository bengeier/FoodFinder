{"text":"First off, they put the salsa on a small plate making it impossible to dip the chips into. Ask for a small bowl instead.  Other than that, the restaurant was great for a casual tuesday evening dinner. J and I shared the albondigas soup, a mexican meatball soup. The broth was light and tasty. I had a seafood dish--the dos something (can't remember the name)--which was on the spicy side, but not too much. shrimp, bay scallops, and mushrooms in a spicy tomatoe sauce with refried beans and rice. J had the tamales and he asked for both chicken and beef but they combined the chicken and beef inside the tamales which he thought was \"awesome.\"   There was an older gentleman playing the guitar and singing in the background and that was pleasant. Great place if you want a casual meal that's a step above Chipotle."}
{"text":"I am a guy that loves to go out to dinner. Whether it's with my kids, by myself or the whole family.. I love a good restaurant. I also know when to spot a crappy one. Tonight, my son found a rock, yes I said a rock, in his refried beans! It was awful. I brought it to the attention of my server, who assured me that he would let his manager know. We waited and waited and the only thing that happened that server brought me a bill! No apology, no nothing????? It was the worst exhibition of restaurant management ever. When I spoke to the manager, he almost looked at me like I put the stone in my sons food. I have never been as angry as I was at that moment... Do yourself a favor and stay away... Don't risk your meal, enjoy any other restaurant. Obviously this place has front of the house issues as well as the back the house!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Starting with the salsa brought with the chips to the actuall meal, the food felt cheap. What do I mean by that? The meat was fatty. The flavors were bland. The presentation was awful. Everything was doused in a very unappealing and very disgusting green sauce.  I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and have had my exact meal at other restaurants. 3 Margaritas just isn't up to par.  The worst part, $37 plus tip for two meals and two kids meals. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was in town for my sisters graduation. Had some lunch here, wasn't bad but nothing memorable. Reminded me of an El Compadre of Arizona but less tasty. Not to many people in here on a Friday afternoon for lunch but from the looks of this place it gets busy at night where they feature local \"mexican artists\". Next time?"}
{"text":"An old friend came to town and suggested we go here. I'd never been...which was surprising considering I shop next door at Safeway and have driven past it a million times. The chips were great, the dining room is casual with booths on the edges and tables in the center featuring your typical colorful hand painted chairs (and the tecate banners hanging from the ceiling). Service was very good.   I ordered tacos (because I consider myself a connoisseur of tacos) and always try those first at a new Mexican Restaurant, but was a bit disappointed when they served them in pre-cooked shells. My preference is the shredded beef, fried with the corn tortilla. The food does have good flavor but does not strike me as anything but standard.  It's your Classic Mexican Food! It's a tortilla, meat, cheese just served up a million different ways. I didn't expect anything too over the top here. I will say they get a bonus for serving Negro Modelo in the special Negro Modelo glass. Good times, good friends, good food. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I will admit, my first visit here probably biased me rather severely towards this place.  I had just moved to Glendale, AZ from NY.  It had been a rough trip, it was late, and I had just finished unpacking.  I wanted food like nothing else.  So, right down the street, my brother and I come across the happily lit sign saying \"3 Margaritas\".  Not a chain or a place we'd ever heard of, and that was good enough.  We went in and were greeted warmly by their very friendly server.  As soon as we were settled chips, salsa, and refried beans appeared before us.  Some wonderful organic margaritas showed up soon thereafter.  The food itself was excellent.  I had one of their specials made of chorizo, which I remember being quite impressed by.  I've been back many times since, and everything I've tried has been delicious.  The service has always been excellent.  And the portions are generous, but not overwhelmingly so.  With the exception of the burrito loco.  That is one giant(and crazy) burrito."}
{"text":"3 Margaritas is an old stand-by for me.  The food is pretty good and their salsa is full of chunky good stuff (I like chucks of tomato and onion in my salsa).  What I really like is their mariachi guy, he is very talented with a clear strong voice.    This place may not be my absolute favorite Mexican food, but it is pretty good and I find myself here a lot. The beans and red sauce are yummy and I am a red sauce kind of girl.  There are a lot of traditional dishes to choose from and the menu is extensive and full of things that I don't see at other Mexican food joints.   The decor isn't that creative, but they have a wall of booths snuggled up to a large row of windows. It's neat to eat here on a stormy day, because you can watch the storm move in.  Lastly, I have never had to wait for a table because it's pretty big with lots of room, so it never gets completely filled up."}
{"text":"So apparently everything has changed at our favorite neighborhood Mexican place.  The last 2 times we were the food was terrible!  3 Margarita's officially broke my heart and I am unwilling to get hurt again!"}
{"text":"We wandered in here around 6pm on a Monday and the place was DEAD.  This always worries me:  is the food lousy? The service bad?  Is it overpriced?  The answer is no, no and no.  The server was pretty quick to get to our table and was very friendly.  She brought some really good roasted salsa and a side of some veggie stuff, and a big basket of chips.  She took our drink order and was a little delayed in getting back to us but apologized for the delay and took our dinner order.  Dinner was HUGE.  I mean seriously!  I had the Chicken Chipotle and my finance had the seafood dish.  REALLY, really good; especially the Chicken Chipotle; spicy and a lot of flavor.  And the prices were very fair.  And their HAPPY HOUR has really cheap prices for drinks and appetizers.  So why is this place so dead?  I have no idea but I liked it, and I'm pretty picky about my Mexican food (salsa makes or breaks a restaurant IMHO!). Food was fresh, hot, and served in volumes.  Service was quick and friendly.  Price was reasonable.  What am I missing here?  Check this place out because unless I came in on an unusual night, this place is good. No, not amazing, but good. Yeah, I see the other reviews.  Maybe the place is under new management or something?  Seriously, it was a good place.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"This place is no longer in business, but the building is occupied by the restaurant \"The Place\""}
{"text":"We've been going here since it opened, so we're definitely fans. The food is good, service is fast and prices are reasonable. Their chile relleno is one of the best in town, and their lunch specials are super cheap."}
{"text":"This place was creepy and horrible!!! The fountain out front splashed on everyone as they walked by in the front of the restaurant.   Then when we walked in all three waitors were all standing in a circle by the bar talking and laughing with eachother.   We were seated in a booth with broken down seats.  The salsa had too much pepper and the chips were all broken crumbs.  I ordered pollo fundito, when i actually got my food after an hour wait it was gross with plain creamcheese and actually square peices of kraft american cheese slices. My boyfriends order was messed up as well.  The waiter was an authentic mexican that didnt understand english and there was only one other couple eating at that dump.  Never will i go to this place again....gross!"}
{"text":"Gross!  I don't know how they stay in business, with the Valley so full of fabulous authentic Mexican food.  How bad was it?  Let me count the ways:  - Cold, hard thick chips - A restroom with one broken toilet and two gargantuan \"la cucarachas\"-- roaches... they had to be at least as big as my hand, and they were alive - The apathetic attitude about said roaches when I told the hostess - BURNED beans-- how can you make BAD beans at a Mexican restaurant??!!   - Very mediocre, non memorable food - Amateurish service.  Friendly, but inept - Pricey for such crappy overall experience  DO NOT waste your dining dollars here.  You'd do better at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We went to 3 Margaritas on a Friday night for dinner. The parking lot was empty. It seemed that only employees were there. I almost wondered if the resaurant had closed down.   When we got inside we were seated right away and there was only one other table of people. Most of the staff was at the bar watching a soccer game. We were quickly given our chips and salsa and our drinks. The standard salsa is a bit runny and has a smokey flavor. It was good but wished it was more of a pico de gallo than a picante sauce.  I ordered the chicken flautas meal and my dining companion ordered the beef chimichanga meal. The waiter prefered we order using the meal number rather than the description. (i.e. The number 3 and the number 28 for example)  Both the meals were served with rice and beans. The rice was good, not overly flavored. The beans were a bit thin and very salty. The main dishes were great though. The meat was cooked well and there was the right amount of crunch on both the chimi and the flautas. Despite the beans we really enjoyed the food overall.   I would go here again if nearby but I don't think I would go out of my way to go for just the food. The margaritas and other drinks were priced fairly decenlty so if you're craving Mexican food and drinks out with friends it is the way to go.   During the meal, Scott Ian from Anthrax fame was seated next to us... Pretty cool."}
{"text":"Love this place, interesting take on Mexican food (hard to describe, but not your normal Sonoran AZ style), kick butt margaritas, and may I suggest the \"Classic\" which comes in a shaker.  Best part, family owned and run, come a few times and you'll feel right at home.  Our whole neighborhood comes on Fridays, kid and all (definitely kid friendly), you should too!"}
{"text":"3 Margaritas has a new name...  El Presidente  I cannot comment on the past food but the new food (same menu) was good.   Thursday night heading towards Valle Luna and I made an executive decision to go to new place on Bell and 51st Ave.   We were greeted and sat right away. There was a live band playing and plenty of people eating.   The chips and salsa were good, the kids liked the bean dip they give with the chips. We ordered some hot sauce too. It was a little too hot for me. LOL  Kids had a bean and cheese burrito served with rice and beans. The odd thing was the melted cheese on the outside of the burrito. Both kids liked the meal.   Angie, my sexy wife, had a Green Chile Pork Chimi. She said it was OK but missing something. I tasted it and couldn't  figure out the missing ingredient either. Served with R&B.  I had a Shredded Beef Taco and Chicken Enchilada with R&B. The taco was light and crisp with a nice flavor to the beef. The Enchilada was good, the red sauce was good too.   They also gave us two Flans to share. I thought it was really cool. I had never had flan but thought it was OK. I am not a huge sweet type fan.   $30 bucks before tip. Would I go back? Sure but not a place I would crave."}
{"text":"Ok so the service is fine here but everything else was terrible. They didn't have horchata, my taco was made with a hard shell and had lettuce,  might as well have been from taco bell. The chili renos had no flavorand way too much egg for my taste. It was also pretty pricey. Sorry but there are just too many better options for good Mexican food for you to waste your time here."}
{"text":"If you can get past the stale odor in the restaurant the food is okay. I'm being generous with two stars, it really should be one star.   We won't be eating here again any time soon."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's right next to my dorm and also, it's one of the few Mexican restaurants that I've found that actually sells a Mole (molay') dish (chocolate and poblano chile's if I'm not mistaken). Try the chicken Mole and you'll really like it... very authentic.  Chips are great, as is the salsa. You can tell its family owned... you can ask for Mexican cokes too I think. I've gone here twice and I'd go again whenever the stomach callers.  Sometimes they have a wandering mariachi guy. I always feel awkward when they come around because then you feel like you have to tip, but I think he sensed we were poor college students so he didn't come by.  I'm not sure what you ordered that you didn't like (to the first reviewer)."}
{"text":"$7.50 for a margarita with the whole shaker.  Pretty sweet deal.  Not the best margarita in the world, but it was cheap.  Other than that, the bar is weird with the short chairs and the chips are alright.  I wouldn't stop in here for food, or drinks for that matter.  But when you're on campus and need a marg within walking distance after being bored to tears by your professor, this place will do."}
{"text":"The food was over priced and tasted like something you would get in a junior high cafeteria. The meat had no taste the salsa was blah. The decor was way to bright and over the top.   I will never go back and have told plenty of my friends not to try this place, save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I think this place is great, especially since the new owners took over.  Maria and Albino are almost always around to greet you and they're warm and friendly.  Good drink (GREAT MARGARITAS!) and very good traditional food. Big portions too for those of us getting tired a restaurants that treat Mexican food like it's nouvelle cuisine.  Great place.  Thanks guys."}

{"text":"I wish they could give negative stars.  I mean seriously this place is a health violation.  I have eaten Mexican food on the streets of Tijuana and almost never has it been this bad.  Gordan Ramsey needs to put this place on kitchen Nightmares.  Honestly, I joined Yelp just so I could post a review of how bad this place is.  I am not even joking when I say the marg tasted like it was made with a mixing powder like Koolaid.  I have never, ever, ever walked out without finishing my food.  I can say after 4 bites we were out the door.  Help others and warn them that this place is toxic."}
{"text":"I went once and I will never go back again. The service was horrible. The waiter did not speak English well and kept pointing at whoever he was talking to when taking our order. The margaritas were syrup-ie and not very good. The worse part was the food. The food did not taste like Mexican food and none of us (there were four of us) liked what we ordered. I will never go here again after that first experience. Don't recommend going here at all."}
{"text":"Three margaritas?  Yes please!  When I lived in Tempe, my roomie and I would hit up 3 Margaritas when we didn't want to have to look cute to go have a meal.  (Ahem, Macayo's Depot Cantina!).    All the cute guys flock to the Macayo's on Ash, so we always felt pretty safe having lunch or dinner at 3 Margs.  Sometimes we would have more than 3 Margs too. And why not?  A cab ride was just a few dollars away.  Ah, the good old days.  The food here is okay.  This isn't a great Mexican food restaurant, but it's not bad.  Next time you're having a fat day, come here.  No one will judge you and you won't have to live in fear you'll see anyone you know."}
{"text":"Ok stuff, hopefully not the best that Arizona has to offer. But, it was walking distance and the margaritas had just enough punch to hit me, but not enough to knock me down."}
{"text":"**Note the West Bell Rd location has been closed for some time now***"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my 2nd fav Mexican restaurant in the valley, mostly due to Tacos al Pastor and other authentic dishes, which cannot be found at many places these days...  Service is usually decent, salsa is usually good, although it's different every time I've gone as it's probably made fresh.  Huge drink menu for mixed drinks (not a fan of margaritas)  Lately they have advertised Sat night dancing but have not attended this.  However, I have been there for live music, and the one-man performer is great.  He usually plays a mix of oldies, pop, and latin on keyboard almost like a Vegas lounge act.  Creates a nice date atmosphere.    Decent casual atmosphere.  Would go there more if it were closer, and was very disappointed when the W. Bell Rd location closed several months ago."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent mexican restaurant in Tempe. I drove by this place many times on my way to school. I really like mexican food and grew up around many mexican folks who were great cooks. So it's safe to say that I can be pretty picky.   The decor here is just kind of odd in a funny way. It's not necessarily bad it just strikes me as kind of funny. The food is great. I love the salsa here and find it spicy enough. I like to get their special called tres amigos. It's very filling and tasty.  The service has always been good and the food fresh. Overall a good find and pretty good food."}
