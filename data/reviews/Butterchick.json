{"text":"Butterchick is located in the recently renovated underground level of the Sheppard Centre mall.  I ordered the Butter chicken with rice which came out to a little over $10 total and was their special of the day.

Immediately upon placement of the miniature 6 inch diameter circular box on my tray, I was head-dropping Charlie brown-like disappointed.  I tried take the Linus bright-side, and thought to myself, \"maybe the quality of the food would make up for the miniature portion size.\"  As soon as I tasted the food I heard the Lucy-like \"you can do anything right Charlie Brown\".  Then I wondered, whether Charlie Brown was me or the restaurant, or a bit of both.  Although the food wasn't terrible, it was only slightly better than a box of frozen PC Brand microwavable butter chicken I would once in a while pick up at the nearby Shoppers Drug Mart for less than half the price.

Regardless, if you're in the Yonge/Sheppard area and have a craving for quick Butter chicken or other Indian food, I would recommend trying the \"Agra Fine Indian\" cuisine on the north-west corner of Yonge/Sheppard.  The even have an all-you-can eat lunch special for around $13 I believe with reasonable quality food."}
