{"text":"Went in with a friend to grab a bite while waiting for an order in the plaza. Food was great, portion size, taste and price. Waitress was nice as well. Wish this place was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"My work friends and I go there for lunch a few times a week. Its the best food around and great price for their portions. We get our meals within 15 minutes of ordering even when they're extremely busy. The service is also very pleasant, the ladies there seem to make effort ti get to know every single person that walks through the doors which is very welcoming. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some tasty greek food, or even a sandwich and fries. Shame theyre not open on the weekends."}
{"text":"Pop in here for lunch all the time.  Great food.   Pleasant service.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"The food and the service are quite good. But one thing I need to mention, which never happen to me before. We went there and ordered our food, and waited for 1 hour until our food is delivered. It was full at that time, which I could understand why they took so long to make it. But you need to know people who go there at lunch time, they want it to be quick, especially for a restaurant which does not open for weekend!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.   Very clean,  very friendly.  Food came out instantly so they definitely pre-grill the chicken which is probably why it was a bit dry.    Salad was pretty decent and so was the tzatziki. I'm not blown away but I would come back."}
{"text":"Not too shabby, as far as greasy spoons go! I had gyro on a pita with onion rings. Pretty much a garlic heart attack on a plate, which is what I was hoping for, so yay! It was quite busy at lunchtime, and the wait was a little longer than I'd anticipated.  Our servers looked a little flustered by how busy they were, but they weren't rude or anything. I've had better and I've had worse, but as I say, as far as  greasy spoons go, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast after a nightshift. Great value and good food. I've never had lunch but they seem to get busy around 1130am. Closed weekends tho."}
