{"text":"uh oh...   i have a feeling all you \"fans\" aren't going to like me much.

i'll try to give you only the details of my experience there (but it's not going to be short).  

day/time: sunday, 1:30pm
players: myself, friend, mom, uncle, brother, his wife and their family (including three young girls under the ages of 6)  and, i'll let you decide for yourself if this info is necessary, but we're all asian.  stereotypes DO exist.  don't kid yourself.

no reservations?  that's fine.  we were lucky enough that there were two 4 tops available side by side.  and it starts here.

the restaurant isn't that busy, people are finishing their lunches, and tables are freeing up.  but upon our seating, i notice two employees standing by the computer seemingly arguing about something, and staring at us (or maybe both were just staring straight ahead and we just so happened to be in their line of sight).  but i have a very strange suspicion that one of the two, was the manager/supervisor.  no matter, maybe our server was wanting to go home or something, and now she had a table of 9.  no biggie.  but when our server came to the table, they asked very abruptly, \"so, does everyone want water?\"  no smile, no greeting, no enthusiasm.  well, it was a cold day, so i proceeded to ask around if anyone would like some hot beverage instead, so i asked our server, \"what hot drinks do you have?\",  shaking her head as if i was supposed to know their selection, \"tea, coffee...\" to the tone of, it's in the menu, take a look.  at this point, three people wanted tea already.  my brothers' family was still settling down with the kids, so they never had an option.

water's came by hand, without a tray.  not a big deal, but for the inspired decor, i would think a little \"higher end\" service is called for.  again, no big deal.  our server came back maybe 10 minutes later asking, so do you know what you want?  well yes.  we ordered a few apps, and i specifically ordered a grilled chicken on a bed of quinoa to start.  our server looked at me and said, \"that's a main item.\"  well, yes, i'm aware of that, \"...but is it possible to have it come out as an app so we can share?\"  our server walked away and muttered under their breath, \"well, i have to see if the kitchen can do that.  ...yeah, but the chicken takes time to cook.\"  really.  they went to the computer and ordered everything and upon passing by, i told them, \"we're not in any rush, don't worry about things coming out a little late\".  \"yeah, i already told the kitchen\"  yeah, thanks.  you told the kitchen by just punching in the order at the terminal which was on the other side of the establishment.

food came out (the apps).  everyone loved the humus, the felafel were quite nice (sauce lacked any purpose) and when the chicken came out, it was no thicker than about two centimeters.  not a big deal to cook right?  on the plus, our server did bring us more pita (i didn't look at the bill, so i don't know if it's on the house like bread?) i mean, that's great!  but they brought it in their hand, in some open parchment paper, and plopped it in our existing basket.  is that the restaurant protocol?  no biggie.

less than midway through consuming our apps, yes, the menus were still on the table.  why?  ooooh, because our main course wasn't ordered yet.  so here's the server asking us if we want to order anything else.  of course!  so we ordered (i'll detail that after).  and i knew.  i KNEW at that time, that they wouldn't time the order.  i KNEW that the main courses would come out while the appetizer plates were still on the table.  and guess what?!  i was right.  so, we shifted, and piled, and re-adjusted who got to eat what...  with a bit of tetris experience, we fit everything, but food just wasn't in front of the person who ordered.  no biggie.  just eat, clear/stack, and eat.  without even our side plates (which are a decent size) or app plates cleared, we finished our meal.  our server THEN decided to put on that smile and ask, \"how is your food?\"  well, the food is fine!  \"do you need containers to pack the extras?\"  sure!  so they brought us containers and bags.  

that's the sum of the experience.  all the way through, i noticed that all the staff had at least one disagreement with one other staff member.  again, is that management?  why is he pissing everyone off?  

i'm a pure \"front of house\" guy.  i hate this about myself, but i just can't shut my eyes when i go to a restaurant.  in fact i openly admit it to my friends and family, that i'm the WORST person to go with (especially if it's western style service).  i'm not THAT picky, but if an establishment is looking to charge a fairly higher price for the style of food, trying to break the middle ground barrier of decor and supposed ambiance, you BET i'm gonna take notice of certain behaviors.  (if you look at my other reviews, there are some real dives, and i have no issues with that).  

food was decent!  and i ran out of space to wr"}
{"text":"good size portions. the staff is a friendly the rices not so much my favorite part of the - but is there. family oriented restaurant you'll see many families with their kids and having birthday celebration. Appropriate for a couples or small groups as well. It is say casual dressy. It is Middle Eastern food"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous server was awesome !!The manager was ridiculous. I asked to pay for an extra laffa bread and was refused. I had all this leftover hummus and she refused to let me have the bread I wanted. She would only give me pita for free. What is the difference??? Craziness. Just go to Bali Laffa or Dr laffa they are in the same neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Me Va Me for years, but after our last time there, we will never return. I am appalled by the experience we had and the way it was handled by management and the owner. As we have been patrons of this restaurant for many years (this location and the Steeles location prior to that), we always valued the good quality of the food as well as the consistency. I can say that I have never found the service to be spectacular, but its always fast and the servers are generally courteous. This particular time we went, we were surprised to receive only one piece of laffa bread (they would not bring more even though they always have before) and to see the large greek salad arrive with very little lettuce, and literally ONE tomato slice, and TWO very small cucumber slices. It was 1/3 of the size it normally was. I was there with 3 other people and although we found our portions substantially smaller than usual, they were still sufficient that we would not mention it to our server. When we told our server about the salad, she immediately called over the manager, \"Irena\". Irena did not introduce herself, but rather she listened to the issue and responded with \"I don't see what your problem is, that is how the salad comes\". My sister and I also had a greek salad, so we showed her ours and asked how is it possible that ours has all these vegetables and lettuce and this other salad does not? Irena began arguing with us and kept repeating that this is how the salad is and there is nothing wrong with it. We told her this is not acceptable and we are regular customers but will choose to not come back if this is the service and ridiculously sized portions we receive. Irena said \"Ok don't come back if that's what you prefer\". At this point I was shocked by how we were being spoken to and after about 5 more minutes of arguing, she took back the salad and brought it back with a few more vegetables and lettuce in it. She did not apologize, rather she continued to speak curtly to us. There was no offer of an apology, or complimentary dessert, coffee or anything for that matter for the incident that had occurred. I was so appalled by her behavior that I felt the need to report it to the owner, although this is something I have never done before. The owner listened to our experience and said he would remedy the situation immediately. He took my information and said he would call me back. That was almost 3 weeks ago and I still have not heard back from him.  The customer service is so horrendous that they do not deserve repeat customers. There is tons of competition in the area; Hannah Shwarma, Sofra Grill, Sababa and I will definitely be returning to those restaurants instead, where it is clear that they value their clientele."}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience with take out. I tried to call from home to preorder but they were too busy to take an order. I went there to order from take out, after long wait i got my order went home to finally eat it and got really disappointed, the food did taste good at all. Never again"}
{"text":"To my surprise they didn't allow me to get a chicken shawarma with no bread today. As I recently discovered my gluten sensitivity this was upsetting. Not accomodating at all. Even McDonalds will sell you a hamburger with lettuce wrap-no bread. 
The staff said they could not place it in a container- don't see what is wrong with a container, even when I buy the family meal  from there they give the food in containers. 
Hope they can come up with options for celiacs and gluten sensitivity clients"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Been my go-to Christmas Eve dinner for a few years now. 
Always busy, but the wait time goes by pretty quick.
Service is good, and they will change things (in your meal) how you want them to be. 
I would recommend the lemonada drink, the appetizer dip trio (the babaganouuuuuuush tho), shawarma platters, and salmon skewers. 
Great salads too."}
{"text":"This is a great Israeli/Mediterranean family restaurant. They have a good selection of food, although some menu items are definitely better than others. I highly recommend their beef or lamb skewers. Their baba ganoush is also seriously addictive! I get it for takeout sometimes next door at Me Va Me Express if I need to contribute something to a potluck and everyone always loves it. Restaurant is clean and comfortable and service is usually very good."}
{"text":"Worth the wait!  There's almost always a line up at lunch or dinner but let me tell you it's worth it!  The flat bread they bring to start is soft and made fresh.  My husband and I come here once a month for a kabob dish and we always have leftovers.  The marinade on the skewers is flavourful and not over salted and the mashed potatoes always consistent and done to perfection.  I highly recommend you order a lemon mint drink as well, very refreshing."}
{"text":"I visited Me Va Me the other night. We ordered drinks (one water, one pop) and schwarma. Our drinks arrived and then we were told they were out of schwarma. We told them we'd leave in that case as we really only came for the schwarma. The manager came out and tried to get us to drive all the way to their Rutherford location instead. We said no. I told her I'd pay for my pop if she brought me a to go container. She said they didn't have any containers and then BROUGHT US THE BILL TO PAY FOR THE POP! I'm sorry but she really should've just given me the two dollar pop for free for the inconvenience. I will not be back. Also the Me Va Me Express on Hilda and Steeles is AWFUL. I've had terrible food and incorrect orders several times there."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Huge portions.
We have been going to this place for the past 6~7 years.
My wife and I almost always order one Chicken Shawarma (ask upfront if they still has Chicken Shawarma left .. we sometimes leave if they have ran out for the day) and one delicious babaganush to share."}
{"text":"Great mix of food. I love to visit Toronto often, and this place is always welcoming. Their atmosphere is very elegant and hummos is amazing. I would defiantly recommend it"}
{"text":"We had a group of a dozen family members including young ones who were hungry and eager to try out the food. We had book a table a few days ahead of time with appointments recorded in our books.

However, when they got there (we were definitely on time), our reservation miraculously \"disappeared\". There were not reservations made under our names. How could that be??? This has never happened anywhere.

Angry. Never go there again."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service leaves something to be desired. Also, if you are having a birthday, they charge for the cake. They don't tell you they do. You just see a charge for $8 on your bill"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the service and food at this restaurant.  I was with a large party, and not all of us were extremely polite/easy customers.  The staff were professional, friendly, responsive, and helpful.  The food was delicious!  There were large portions and overall it was a good value for the meal.  Definitely should be tried!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma in greater toronto!

I grew up in the middle east so I know my shawarmas. When my bf recommeded this place from his old neighbourhood, I was skeptical and he was tense when he took me there for dinner. 

We ordered two chicken shawarma plates and I was stunned how good it was. Just how meat shawarma is supposed to be- simple, flavourful without all the fixings.  They also probably served  the best rice I've had outside my parent's place. The trio dip was ok but I just loved their dressing on the salad.

Tip: Ask for 'extra' hot sauce- its  tastes like no other hot sauce I've ever tried!

Highly recommended if want to know how 'real' shawarma tastes like."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Dark chicken on a skewer was amazing.  Tasty and cooked perfectly.  Great salads, apetisers as well.  Large portions.
Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch today.  First time in this location.  Chicken was amazing and the ceaser salad fantastic. Would definetly return"}
{"text":"Just average.  Shwarma can be either super greasy or dry.  Service is horrendous."}
{"text":"Awesome food Awesome service. Had just about every thing on the menu.  I drive from Etobicoke just to eat here. I 've been here over  100 times.  Always satisfied here."}
{"text":"This spot was recommended to me by someone at work. 
It's a little far north but if you live in the area or want to venture up town this place is definitely worth the drive.

They have a great Israeli salad (tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs) and their meals are massive!  If you love meat - this is the place to go. Amazing lamb, chicken, and steak kebobs. You can get one skewer or two. 

The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. 

The one drawback to this place is the wait! Every time I've been there I've had to wait at least 15 to 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars a year ago. I started going to this place more than 6 years ago and they were the best Mediterranean food you could find with huge portions and an amazing salad that accompanied each order. 

Now, every time I go back, I realize that the prices have gone up while the portions have become smaller. The food quality is still very good though.

The Lemonana is a drink to try.

Free onsite parking is available."}
{"text":"Good service, seating area roomy, food portion big, pleasant experience overall. 

Ordered chicken skewers and lamb skewers and both were tender and moist. Really enjoyed my first visit there. Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"It's been at least 5 years since I've eaten at this place and it's as if I was there last week.  
Food is same, service is same and it's not necessarily a bad thing. 
We had the fish and the mix plate and it was great.  The service was good too even though it was packed, it seems like they know how to deal with it. 
You can't go wrong with me VA me.  It's consistently good Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a small take out order for over 40min and was told it would take 10min. I've never been so unimpressed with an establishment. I have asked for a refund and was refused. 

Spend your money else where. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Order food from the website, upon arriving to pick up was informed that what I ordered from the web site is not the prices at this location, it is only for the downtown. Paid twice the amount for the food ordered. When told her about our displeasure at not indicating on the web that the costs are different at this location, she just ignored it. 
Food, falafal in pita was dry, had really no taste and the pita bread was tough and fell apart. Chicken was dry and oily. For the price they charge for this terrible food, you are better off driving 5 minutes to Young and go to Mr.Greek."}
{"text":"I love the food here this negative review is for the customer service. I have to drive half way across the city to pick up here. Last time I order the messed up my order. I called to let them know and the women working told me to come back and get my free laffa next time. I came back for it and they refused to honour the free Shwarma. Sloppy customer service and altogether a very off-putting experience."}
{"text":"K so It takes me a lot to write a review.

We're from out of town and we needed to grab a bite to eat late sunday and we found this place near our hotel. I went off the reviews and honestly people who reviewed this positively must have such a sad life.

I have never in my life had a worse meal. It was absolutely tasteless. I dont get it. I couldve cooked something in my hotel room off the dollar store that wouldve been a more decent meal than this.

Plain white rice, plain fries, chicken. White sauce that comes with it has no taste (it doesnr smell or taste like anything its just a white liquid.)

I can go on but seriously stay away. Legit feels like I threw my money in the garbage."}
{"text":"This is a takeout place with some tables inside. The food was really bad. I had a shawarma entree. Meat was ok but everything else tastes like preheated fast food. Use this place as one of your last choices for fast food."}
{"text":"Always a very satisfying meal. Staff is excellent and management goes above and beyond.  The laffa is insanely Deliscious, especially when paired with the baba."}
{"text":"I thought  it was a Thai place at first.. It is more of a mix of American/Canadian and Middle Eastern. We tried a grilled beef skewer in a a pita and chicken shawarma in a pita here tonight. The beef skewer pita was very good. The chicken tasted a bit dry, but still better than most other places. The toppings that you can put on the sandwich are excellent. The pitas also were fresh. They also seem to have a large menu worth exploring. Basically this is the best restaurant outside of McDonald's in this part of the city. Order time was about 10-15 minutes but worth it. If you call ahead you can get your order to go.  

They also have free parking."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at this place in years but when the name came up on my Yelp home page, I just had to put my two cents in.

This place is food poisoning in every bite.

Not surprised to see another reviewer had the same experience because after weird and wonderful stomach bug # 2, I decided to boycott the joint (despite it being one of my family's favourites). 

The shawarma isn't THAT good."}
{"text":"Great service, huge portion and great prices. Best hummus around.  There is a great vibe to the place which makes it enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ordered online through grub canada.  Was supposed to take 45 minutes, finally arrived after an hour and a half.  They added things to my order and made me pay for them, added extra delivery charges without telling me, staff I had to deal with were very rude, the delivery person didn't know what grub canada is, and the food made me sick for 3 days.  Do not order from or go here unless you enjoy being sick."}
{"text":"Very good food, love the humus grate texture!!! I got my food in less than 10 minutes this is a grate resturant love it"}
{"text":"Me Va Me is a standout. Chances are, no matter when you go there will be some sort of line-up... it's totally worth the wait.
To start, I recommend the hummus and baba ghanouj. It's served with fresh pita bread (the whole wheat ones are the softest!) and a plate of pickles and tasty banana peppers.
Then get the lamb kebab/skewer (order it medium, not rare or well-done) or the chicken shawarma (which usually sells out quickly). Both dishes come with a starter salad that is super fresh and so delicious, garnished with beautiful strings of beets and carrots.
You'll be stuffed after this (I always have to pack up half of my order) which is why I've never tried their dessert but one day I will... they all look so tempting!
Drinks are delicious too. I recommend the Lemon mint drink, the golden bellini and if you're in the mood for something hot then try the Nana tea.
There's plenty of free parking, a decent patio, the food will have you coming back again and again and the servers are very efficient. The only downside is the waiting in line."}
{"text":"They serve tasty middle eastern food in large portions. They're slightly over-priced. Also their service is relatively slow."}
{"text":"Portions and flavor!

Hummus and baba ganoush with dark chicken skewers, they always deliver a tasty plate. Careful with your order, you may get more food than you bargained for. 

Recently I have found the service at this location a bit shotty, but the food is still great. Best middle eastern in GTA for sure! 

Tip:
Order the lemonana in the summer for a refreshing thirst quencher."}
{"text":"I came here last night with a group of friends. One of my friends and I ordered the chicken shawarma and now we're both got a serious case of the stomach flu. FORGET about the fact that the servers are disorganized, we were consistently ignored or that the food was bland. I will never ever ever return to this place."}
{"text":"This place puts many expensive steakhouses to shame.

Seriously. Try the filet mignon skewers. They're truly delicious. And cheap!

Me Va Me is a casual dining spot with a nice terrace.  Every time I've been there, I've been greeted warmly by the staff and treated very well. They usually have good suggestions for drinks and food if you're lost. 

I've had their hummus, baba ganoush and __(something else)__ pita appetizer, and it's always been good. The baba ganoush is ADDICTIVE. Very smoky and well prepared. The __(something else)__ thing is this  red ...mash that's a bit too sweet for me. I wish I remember what it's called, but the other people I was with liked it, so maybe it's an acquired taste.

I've had their filet mignon skewers with mashed potatoes and salad several times, and every time I order it, it has been consistently flavourful and the meat always juicy. The salad is fresh and tasty, and the potatoes are pillowy clouds of garlic joy. I also recommend their lamb skewers! Very good. 

I haven't tried any of their drinks aside from the Lemonana but I can't see why I would; the Lemonana is really delicious mint-based lemonade and pairs well with the lamb skewers as a refreshing drink.


The skinny: It's friendly there, tasty and you'll get more value than you'd expect from their skewered meats."}
{"text":"I've been going for years.. portions are somewhat hit and miss, it gets the job done at best."}
{"text":"Well went to Me Va Me on a Friday night with a few friends...  We had 5 of us and surprisingly got a booth as soon as we walked in!!  So plus 1 for that... 

Ordered: (I apologize I'm advance for incorrect spelling) 

Dips:
Baba gnoush
Hummus 
fried eggplant 

Mains:
Chicken schnitzel
Lamb kefta 
Jerusalem dish

Dranks:
Lemonada their signature drink

Everything was delicious!!! I personally really liked the baba gnoush!!  I got the lamb which was more filling than it initially looked...  (looked like 3 little hotdogs) I got it with fries which were good crispy as fries should be! I would recommend this dish to anyone that goes! 

Service was good friendly man served us... The only downside was that the chicken shawarma was sold out which was very depressing... 

Overall I would definitely go back here and try the chicken shawarma!!!  

Sooo congrats Me Va Me you areeeeee TooTuff approved!!!"}
{"text":"Service-mediocre at best
Environment-decent, could use some better ventilating
Food-great! 

The price point is too good to be true, especially with the bread they provide. However, most of the times when you order a dip, the dip doesn't come with the bread at the same time, which is annoying. Otherwise, love it."}
{"text":"I eat there often and when I do a get an assortment of dips with a side of their homemade bread. So yummy. The swarma plate is so big I can't hardly finish it. Great food at a great price."}
{"text":"While the food and quantity and prices are acceptable, my group of friends and I were very disappointed and will not return.  I had placed reservations since we were a party of 8 (originally) and then 6.  Once we had started our appetizers and given in our dinner orders, we were informed that because we had reserved the table, we needed to order at least $20 per person.  This had not been explained to me when I made the reservations nor when I called to let them know the change in numbers and we might not have come had we known.  After much discussion, the staff felt it was okay for us to stay even though we wouldn't be spending the 'required' amount per person.  There is no warning about a minimum in the large menu.  Forewarned, etc........"}
{"text":"I used to come here for their shawarma, but not anymore after having a negative experience. Eaten over ten times prior. The last time I was there, it was getting pretty busy during dinner hrs and I was patiently waiting in line to order. Once I placed my order for a shawarma I had to wait more than 20 mins to be called to create my order. Long story short, they purposely served other customers who ordered after me with higher order numbers. Lame..."}
{"text":"I usually go to the York Mills location. Today I went to the Steeles Ave W location. The serviced is horrid. The staff are rude. Check your bill, the over charge.
The food is sub par compared to the York Mills location."}
{"text":"The food we had there was delicious. Their beef sandwich is awesome. Their chicken was a bit more dry but still very good nonetheless. The service was courteous. We went there relatively late so did not have to wait for place to sit or to be served. Their parking was a bit small so I can see it being a problem during peak hour. This place is one of the best choice in the area."}
{"text":"Really really good food! The hipe is real. Service is a hit or miss due to the high turn over of the servers. Must try! My fave is defnly the Falafel!!! Hands down the most flavourful ones I have ever had."}
{"text":"Terrible food, very expensive. I've got food poisoning from Friday noon. They ruined my birthday weekend.
That's ridiculous ."}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant. Like the meat skewers and nice humus. Service could be hit and miss, but that's not a big deal to me. We sometimes get take out from them and always find the food tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Best baba ghanoush and laffah bread hands down in the region. A bit on the expensive side but portion sizes are generous and the food quality rarely disappoints!"}
{"text":"We've been going here for years and the food is consistently amazing. The beef kebab is to die for and the falafel is the best I've had in a while."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer for large family orders.
One of my family likes the Tehina on the side as he does not like soggy pita for his shwarma sandwich.
They have always given it to me.
This time they said no, it had to go on sandwich.
Can you imagine saying this to a good customer. I would never go back based on principal.
If they have gotten this petty, they have lost a customer."}
{"text":"The food is good here specially the shawarma dinner but the staff and customer service is horrible. There is a boy behind bar that I highly doubt is even 18 years old and he serves alcohol. I assume he is the owners son. He has a big attitude and is extremely rude. Once you enter he restaurant and you have your seat there is a unsettling vibes to this place. All staff and waitresses are minding your business as if you are stealing something from them when you just giving them business. The place of this restaurant probably has something to do with the way these people act. Anyways I like the food but do NOT like the staff specially that young looking inexperienced boy behind the bar. He needs to go to school to learn how to treat customers and learn about customer service and customer care. That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before so nothing really surprised me; which is a good thing.  Anyways, dropped by this joint last night for some beef skewers and mashed potatoes and I was not disappointed; in fact, i was very satisfied.  

Like:
- plenty of parking
- plenty of outdoor patio seating  
- friendly and prompt service
- clean and comfortable seating
- gigantic servings

Dislike:
- heavy on dressing
- heavy on seasoning
- dehydrating recipe in general

Totally recommend this place if you have a huge party and you want to make sure everyone has something they'd like on the menu.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Pleasant restaurant. I visited on a busy dinner rush. The food was good and service was good. Kebabs were good. Falafel was a little heavy though with limited plenty of bread crumbs.... Would visit again if specifically in area minus the Falafel."}
{"text":"Walked in around mid-afternoon on a weekday looking forward to taking family visiting from overseas. Empty seats and booths, asked to wait until another seat to clearout at 3 pm? We were told by rude staff who were ignoring guests entering and saying \"we will be with you soon,\" meanwhile staff mentioned they have to save booths for larger group than 3. Ridiculous to watch an empty restaurant so busy pleasing the owner with one other person sitting in a booth apparently  \"intended for 3 people only,\" set the perfect example for poor service. What a shame...won't be going back or consider taking guests...far too many restaurants in this city to be treated with utter disrespect."}
{"text":"Had their grilled veggie pita today and it was terrific. So nice to have a vegetarian on-the-go option that's not always falafel. Had their shawarma in the past and it was quite good and the potatoes are great. This location is very small, mostly for take out but very limited seating (not recommended). Lunch rush can be a long wait. Their other express location on Rutherford is much larger with many tables and great staff."}
{"text":"Great food, big portions, hard to finish, very filling, good prices, small location, messy sandwiches. Overall a must try!"}
{"text":"To be honest I'm not a big fan of their shawarma. It's a bit bland and dry, but the hummus IS awesome, and I love that they serve Jerusalem mix (liver and hearts). It can get crazy busy here, but if people are willing to wait for food, it's usually a good sign that it's good."}
{"text":"Great food (kebabs, schnitzel, hummus)
Mediocre service (especially at the takeout)"}
{"text":"Yum!! We had the chicken kebab, schnitzel, and baba ganoush. Everything was delicious and well prepared. Schnitzel came with an interesting sauce I have not tried before, but it was tasty. Rice was fresh and fluffy. The highlight by far was the fresh warm laffa bread, with the baba ganoush! Delicious and we will definitely be returning!

We had it as takeout and it took about 25 min."}
{"text":"This restaurant is recommended to us.  I tried the one at Steeles and not this one on Rutherford.  When I call in for reservation, there is a minimum reservation charge of $20 per person.  I am told be ready to wait for 20 minutes on the weekday night.  I found it unreasonably, so I prepared to walk in and no minimum charge applied. When I arrived at 6:30p.m. the restaurant is only 25% full.  We go to the Bay view section and only has 3 tables seating with people.  

We order a Trio Dip Platter, Beef Shish Kebob, Lamb Shish Kebob Sandwiches, Humus, and Fried Squid.  My 2 friends like the Platter and Sandwiches.  The Fried Squid is very tender.  The Beef Shish Kebob is medium, tender and juicy.  But I found that the beef probably is not BBQ together with the steel rod, rather the beef is cooked and then pierce through the steel rod.  

It's around $30 pp tax and tips included.  It is not too expensive but not cheap.  I have not tried the Express they have next door but the Express does not have a full menu."}
{"text":"Home delivery is AWEFUL. I tried two different occasions and both times they said \"can you call back in 30m as we are too busy to take your order!\" REALLY?"}
{"text":"Large portions and delicious.  Excellent beef skewers.  The chicken schnitzel was amazing.  Great Laffa bread!"}
{"text":"What's unique this express location offers items in a pita, which the me va me sit down restaurants don't offer. 

The chicken breast pita and beef pita are my recommends here.

My advice is to go light on the toppings for your pita because before you know it the sandwich becomes mammoth, soaked with sauce and it falls apart.

note the washrooms are tiny, think airplane restroom. 

Most of the time me va me express is consistently good but there was one time the chicken almost tasted like it was boiled then grilled.. this was at rushhour dinner time on a weekday.."}
{"text":"Very good place to talk during a meal. The way the food is presented pushes for food sharing and tasting. I would say that the waiting time isn't as bad as others have seen, but we were also just ahead of the dinner rush. 

The serving sizes are massive, so definitely consider sharing the plate.

Group of three, ordered the baba ganouj, and three sets of hummus with chicken shawarma/minced lamb/ grilled mushrooms. I found that the grilled mushrooms were on the salty side and very oily. Water wasn't refilled very often, and pita bread had to be refilled by calling the server down (they didn't take notice/the initiative to check).

Might go again, but it was on the pricey side and the service is average to poor."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Usually order the falafel on a pita or the chicken schitzel.  The hummus is also great.  My friends always love whatever they order.  The ambiance is ok, and they have a small outdoor area in the summer.  As mentioned by others, the service is sometimes slow, and usually indifferent.  The food makes everything worthwhile.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I've passed by this location for over 10 years and finally made a visit. I heard so much good things about the food from family. 

The inside has tons of seating so my friends and I got seated quickly.

I believe this location has a different menu than the newer Me Va Me locations as I didn't see Laffa and mint lemonade that was posted on their website. 

The menu did offer many drinks, salads and mains like beef or lamb skewers with rice. 

The pickled hot peppers I got to start were super salty. Normally the ones I like are sour and spicy. 

I ordered the chicken shwarma plate with fries and paid an extra $1 for a Greek salad. In hindsight, I should have stuck with the garden salad which wasn't only pretty, there was spinach, tomatoes, onions and other veggies.

The portions were big and the chicken was tender. It was good but pretty standard to other Middle Eastern restaurants I've been to. 

The resto was good overall but didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"Yummy food at good price!!! Best chicken shiskabob in town, move out the Danforth. In fact everything on the menu is great. Including fish, humus, homemade lava bread."}
{"text":"I still remember when this restaurant first opened. It's amazing how far quality food, excellent service, and word of mouth can take an establishment such as this. 

The best middle eastern appetizers I've ever tasted. The baba ganoush and red fried egg plant are absolutely delicious. 

The quality of meat is outstanding, serving the best chicken shawarma in the GTA - hands down. 

My favourite place for middle eastern cuisine. Far greater than competition such as paramount. In comparison, me va me does it bigger, better - and most importantly, tastier."}
{"text":"Oh Me Va Me, I love you...I can tell that others do too because dinner lineups are longer than before and I am no longer the only non-Jewish person there!

I just got back from a big-ass late lunch at Me Va Me with a few buds and boy am I stuffed!! I am writing this now to prevent myself from having to take a nap on a full stomach! I do this to myself all the time... MVM is one of those places that gets it right each and every time. The place is big and bright, clean, service is always speedy and uber-friendly, and the food is pretty damn good, fresh, and plentiful. I've been going there for years and everyone I've ever brought there LOVEs it. It's  one of my many go-to places for some good ol' kosher food in massive portions (almost everyone who walks out of there does so carrying a take-out bag, including Jeanne Beker!) at excellent prices.

Along with your order, you get a wire basket of bread which they make on the premises. They used to serve thick pitas (white and whole wheat) with a small tray of kosher pickles and peperoncino (those little bright green-ish/yellow-y peppers that are kind of spicy but moreso bitter from the vinegar) but in recent months they've been serving up laffa (it's either or, depending on which bread guy is working) which is a welcome change. Their laffas are almost like naan when they're dough-y but today they were a little more thin and crispy. Either way, we loved it. 

We ordered an array of apps and dips which were decent but I am not a fan of their hummus. I find there's a bit too much tahini and it's kind of watery compared to thicker versions such as the kind you might get at Paramount or other places, but it's fine--everyone else enjoyed it. We all got various platters which come with a side and their house salad (you can upgrade to Caesar, Greek, or Israeli for an extra dollar), which, if you've never had it, TRY IT! It's made up of mixed greens, none of this lettuce and no spinach...sliced red onions, grated carrots and long, julienned ribbons of pickled beets which give the salad a nice colour and flavour along with their dressing. Their house salad is no regular salad, folks. I have male friends who HATE salad but they'll gobble theirs up at MVM, it's that good!

Most of us got the chicken breast skewers, one got the lamb, another had the tenderloin, while I got the basa Florentine (think eggs Florentine with fish). I often get the chicken breast which is very juicy for breast meat. I have not tried the lamb but I am told it is very good. Their beef option is a tenderloin cut which I am pretty sure used to be filet mignon, but anyway the tenderloin is my least favourite item on their menu. All their meat platters come with red onion piled on, and a red ketchup-y sauce--they used to serve tzatziki instead which I wish they would bring back! My fish dish hit the spot, and then some: two big pieces of basa with spinach and cheese. You might order this thinking it's a light dish but it's not. I don't think you can have a llght meal at MVM if you don't lay off the bread, dips, and salad which is kind of hard to do. The sides are all really good: fries are battered and crisp, roasted potatoes are perfectly seasoned and seem more fried than roasted which makes them even more tasty; mashed is also perfect, even their steamed vegetables are deelish (and not boiled, which some places do even though the menu says 'steamed'). The only one I never get is the rice because it's just plain, white rice and doesn't seem very fun. I would've thought they'd serve a pilaf since it's a kosher place but nope. 

Their serving plates are unecessarily big so you can end up with very little table space if you order a bunch of stuff, which I shan't steer you from doing as everything on their menu (a loooong list of options) that I've had is delicious (seabass was so-so the time I had it--overcooked and dry)! They offer mostly Mediterranean (kebabs, shawarma, the usual dips, etc.) but also have European dishes such as schnitzel which was alright. You can't go wrong with this place. Dinner time can mean a bit of a wait but it moves along at a fair pace and it's well worth it. In the warmer months, they open up the patio so there's more seating but still it can get quite busy. They have other locations, and also do take-out at their Express resto but I've only ever been to this one at the NW corner of Steeles and Bathurst."}
{"text":"Their food is very good. Definitely a good place for a more healthier food choice. Been going their for years !"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The food really taste so good. They have big portion and I sometimes keep the rest to myself to eat for dinner. It is So unfortunate that the restaurant does not do take out order and you have to go all the way down to Express place to get a take out. A little pricey but the portion makes it up to it. Enjoyed my lunch there before an appointment."}
{"text":"This restaurant is near my house so I have been there at least 10 times. The food is fantastic, but the service is TERRIBLE!!! The Russian girls who work there are clueless!!! They chat between themselves rather than serving customers. They are often borderline rude and extremely slow. Every time I go there they act like they are doing me such a huge favour by taking my order or serving me. The only reason I keep coming back is that I really like the food and there aren't many options in my area. I think the management should hire their staff not based on looks but based on work ethic."}
{"text":"Soooo good, soooo flavourful. I had the lamb and hummus appetizer with naan and pine nuts. It was enough for dinner (plus I had a few bites of a house salad with beets and a nice light dressing). Simple, clean and good."}
{"text":"So to start... I was very skeptical about coming to this location for the first time reading the reviews previously posted, but me and my friends decided to try out this new location at Jane and major mackenzie and to say the least, the reviews were a load of crap!! I was over the top impressed with the service I received from beginning to end! I ordered the Box Breast (16.95) with rice and a HOUSE SALAD, served with fresh lafa. The first time trying this meal and I was blown away! Everything was professionally laid out on the plate... I really felt like I was in a fine dining restaurant. The cashier was so sweet in helping me chose my meal, took her time to help me and I was later served by the manager who came back to my table and asked how my meal was... So sweet, goes to show how much costumers matter. Awesome service, I've been to the sit down location at Bathurst, and this tops its decor, food, customer service and much more. Awesome staff! Awesome location!!!! Definitely will be back to this location solely because of the service me and my friends received,  very very very impressed."}
{"text":"Food was nice and fresh, place is spacious and they bake their own bread! I like it for a quick lunch. Paid for half laffa, half soup and side of potato veggies 16$"}
{"text":"Great serving sizes, healthy house salads, tasty house made flat bread. Our server today was polite, quick and efficient. It's a fail safe place to eat when in the area."}
{"text":"Perfect !

Came here on a Friday noon. My boyfriend and I were hungry and yelp suggested I try this place out. It was great. The place is so comfortable, clean, and welcoming. The staff greeted us at the entrance and gave us a seat without a wait. 

We decided to start off with a calamari and hummus appetizer. I must say, the size of those, were a meal of its own. I ordered grilled chicken breast skewers, which came with a side and their house salad. I choose their mash potato as my side and it was smooth like it should be. Their salad came on its own big o' bowl. To be honest, by this time. I was quite full... calamari, hummus, and house salad. The chicken was moist and yummy, went great with the potato. Totally forgot, they also gave complimentary pita bread, freshly toasted. Not sure if they are freshly made there but it was nice and fluffy. 

Service... amazing. Loved my server, shes was great, she also knew her stuff and was just a great person. 

Ended up packing half our meals to go, food is worth the price. I HIGHLY recommend you all give this place a try, you won't regret it! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing AMAZING FOOD! From chicken Kebob to chicken Schnitzel. Food is absolutely amazing ! And I love how they have a patio ! 
Their drinks are also portioned properly ! 

This may not mean much: but they allow to bring your own cake for celebration. Which is a HUGE plus for us. 

My favourite place to be during summer evenings"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing AMAZING FOOD! From chicken Kebob to chicken Schnitzel. Food is absolutely amazing but the service is THE WORST  !!! I go there at least 3-4 times a week. Their waitresses all have attitude and hardly come to you when it's some-what busy (but they are always busy so they should know their flow of customers) I have never been served by a girl at the bathurst location who doesn't have attitude. At one point.. The bus boy was serving us more than our own waitress. So I ended up tipping him. The girl just took our order and brought the bill and this isn't the first time. That's why I only do take out now unless we are with the whole family. The steeles avenue location has by far better customer service. I would go there if it was close to my house."}
{"text":"Very consistent and good experience in terms of food quality, cleanliness, and service. This place is the safest bet in my opinion for middle eastern comfort food ar a decent value."}
{"text":"Great food, great portions. I love their dips (hummus, baba ganoush, etc).
They run out of shawarma pretty quickly so I haven't been able to order one for dinner yet."}
{"text":"Went there food good served flat diet coke from their fountain. Pop was flat server took it back. No problem We went back there about a month later ordered diet coke came still flat said to server why do they continue to serve flat pop.? he shrugged his shoulders .  I will never go there again."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food you can get, that good, price excellent friendly staff and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"much worse than the steeles location.  food is bland, place is noisy, service is below average.
portions are big, though, if you care about that."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times now and the food has been consistently awesome but I can't say the same about the service. 

Depending on your server, sometimes I can be waiting for over 15-minutes just waiting for her to refill my water and sometimes I get the nicest server who checks on our table every few seconds. 

The must-order items include:
1. Trio Dip - my choices are usually hummus, babaganoush & fried eggplant. Be careful with the unlimited pita bread that comes with the dips, otherwise you'd have no room to eat the main course!

2. Kefta Grill - I wouldn't call this a lamb sausage though it's shaped like it.. It tastes just a bit gamy but herbs used still hold a distinct flavor. The fries that come on the side are SO GOOD - super crispy and the kind that tastes amazing without any ketchup. 

3. Jerusalem Mix - a mix of chicken liver, chicken heart and chicken thighs. It's an interesting dish for first-timers who enjoy chicken parts you don't usually find on menus. 

4. Chicken Shawarma on Pita - large portions with tender chicken slices wrapped with super fluffy pita bread. This also comes with those amazing fries mentioned above. 

This place is really packed during peak dinner hours but when I visited during lunch time on weekends, it was relatively empty. So I will be back only for lunch!"}
{"text":"Pros:
-Chicken skewers, roasted potatoes, and regular salad were tasty.

Cons:
-Beef skewers were ordered as medium-well but were medium rare. Several pieces were bloody red!
-Side dishes were not served with the correct skewer. My sister's side dish was packaged with my skewer and vice versa."}
{"text":"Me Va Me gives very generous portions for the box dinner options. Came here to try the falafel dinner box, which came with 6 pieces of falafel, a side (you can choose from fries, roasted potatoes or rice), bread and a salad. The total came to about $16 and it was just enough to feed 2 people! They have a large variety of Mediterranean food so it's hard to choose just what to try. Some of the menu items include falafel, chicken schnitzel, shawarmas and skewers. The restaurant is geared towards take out so don't expect to go in there with a large party for a sit down meal, there is not much seating inside. Aside from that the staff is friendly, the food is good and affordable."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here with a couple of friends who are frequent visitors. We're huge fans of Mediterranean food so they suggested this place for lunch. The portions were so big we didn't need to eat dinner that night. The meals itself had a lot of flavour. Can't go wrong with any of the schnitzel or kabobs.

They are decently priced. With the amount you get you can't really complain. The restaurant was pretty busy, which is usually a good sign about its service and food. 

If you're ever in this area Me Va Ma is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I went for lunch today and ordered chicken shawarma on hummus and trio salad.
The shawarma smelled awful. Baba ghanoush taste good but not authentic and light. Tabbouleh was okay missing some ingredients and seasoning. The Turkish salad was so salty. I ate mediterranean food all my life and this is not a good presentation of tasty mediterranean food. I had chicken shawarma yesterday in Ottawa from a small shop and was much better tasting and authentic than this one. By the the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Food was great, i love there triple spinach triangle and falafel . 
Thanks guys and merry Christmas"}
{"text":"I visited this diner by coincidence when i was on vacation with my friends in toronto.. actually we got lost in thornhill and we were hungry so we stopped at this place and was a great experience.. we start with the dip appetizer mini combo ($6.99) which consists of pita bread served with your choice of three dipping items. We go for the hummus, beets and baba ganoush.

The pita (sourced it seems) is slightly cold but still soft and eager to accompany the velvety and slightly sweet hummus. The beets are almost preternaturally sweet, as is the baba ganoush, although the eggplant dish has some nice lemony zing to it. The diverse appetizer satisfies despite proving somewhat homogenous in flavour.

All entrees come with a \"side\" house salad that could easily be a light lunch. The greens are fresh and the lemon honey vinaigrette (either that, or it's a crazy sweet Italian dressing) is again more honey than lemon and vinegar. 

My lamb skewers ($18.99) arrive with rice on the side and a container of tzatziki. The two sticks of meat are perfectly cooked medium rare, tender and succulent. They are simply seasoned and the portions are heart-stopping, although I can't help but polish off my plate.

The chicken shawarma ($14.99) is served with a container of hot sauce and mashed potatoes on the side. The chicken is a little dry but otherwise par for the course for this popular dish. The mashed potatoes are unbelievably rich and taste like cream and butter with a dash of potato mixed in rather than the other way around. No complaints here, but be forewarned."}
{"text":"the food was delicious! however, i don't like restaurants that assign tables for designated server. That means, if your server is busy with another table, you don't get service and food until he/she's free! Other server would turn their back on you no matter what because that is not their table thus no tips or incentives for serving you. And, maybe I should give them 3 stars based on the service, but the food was just wow!.....
Just hope that you are not competing with the other larger groups when you go."}
{"text":"Rude staff, they were out of shawarma and could not serve us half of their menu items. Didn't have any menus to provide us. Wouldn't go there again"}
{"text":"3 of us shared the cold appetizer combo (10.99) - hummus, baba ganoush, mushroom salad, green eggplant and another salad, forget which.  All were delicious.  Add falafel (6 \"balls\"), pita and the complimentary pickles, and it was enough food.  With 2 of us having tea and coffee, this tasty lunch came to a grand total of 20 bucks...for 3!  Such a deal!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent value. Know that everything is relative and my ranking is from the perspective of price category or overal value. Also, I am writing about this particular location of Me Va Me at Bathurst and Rutheford (Thornhill/Vaughan area). We went for a sit down dinner and not their express which is the name for their take-out door.

I visited this place several times. This last visit was the best. Everything was cooked to perfection. My tenderloin skewers were medium exactly as I asked, tender and juicy. its $18 for 2 skewers including salad and a side (i picked the grilled vegetable but you can choose mashed potatoe,fries, rice). My wife ordered 2 skewers of Chiken breast with mashed potatoe for $16. We exchanged one skewer each to try both. The chicken breast was also cooked to perfection. tender and moist. i squeesed some fresh lemon juice on it. best tasting chicken breast i can recall. the food portion was too much and we took some home. you can save a couple of bucks or more by ordering the one skewer option which they offer but i will take the extra for lunch at the office tomorrow. 

I replaced the salad with Israeli salad which is chopped tomatoe, onion, and cucumber with fresh lemon juice. it is a fresh summer salad. their nomral house salad is very tasty too. they make their own dressing. it is a bit sweet which is delicious but I try to avoid any sugar in my diet. 

For appetizer we ordered their TRIO for less than $9. we choose Green Eggplant which is grilled and chopped and mixed with pepper and other greens. it was amazing. healthy and it doesnt make you feel heavy. the second pick of the trio was Tabuli. It was fresh made as far as i could tell. very good as well. the last of trio of Baba Ganoush. I love this dish but i contained myself to one spoon because it was a bit on the sweet side. I think it has something that has suggar. They also brought us pickled pepper and pickles. It also came with their fresh house made hot pitta bread. i dont eat bread either other then Spelt but tried a little piece of this. that was a mistake because i had to fight the temptation but the green eggplant kept me satisfied. 

Finally my son orderd their chicken schnitzel. it was a big portion and he loved it. i have included all the pictures. Finally, their house made lemonade is soooo good. Again, i stay away from anything with sugar my slim wife enjoyed every drop of it. This may not be for every ones taste as they add fresh grinded mint to it. I tried it once and i loved it. 

We made reservations before arrival and was seated within 2 minutes from arrival. The restaurant is a great atmospher for families. it is nice, pleasing, clean and has a modern decor. it is not formal to make us uncomfortable. It is perfect for a family dinner but i have gone there on dates also (with my wife of 20+ years).  service is genuine and friendly. You don't get any superficial smiles or overly complementing waiters. Just a simple honest service with a somewhat shy waitress in our case. they have an open kitchen and we were thanked for the visit on the way out too. 

This particular visit was perfect for Canada Day. they made us all feel at home and eat home-made quality food. 

My complements to the chef."}
{"text":"We are a regular here and every time they make some mistake on our orders because we order around 15 meals at a time... Today they did not make a mistake but had to fight over $1.73 of extra sauce on a $150 order... I can understand if I ordered one meal and asked for free sauce..."}
{"text":"I have to say that the quality of food in this restaurant is amazing and that is undeniable. However, not only the customer service is poor, but also they overcharge. I ordered two boxes one with beef and the falafel and we asked if we can get laffa bread the girl said she will try to substitute. She asked how many falafel pieces I said 12. Eventually when I arrived there I saw that on the bill she charged for 12 pieces. When I got home there were 6 pieces of falafel instead of 12, bread was not substituted and a salad was missing a dressing. Like, seriously? It was ridiculous I doubt that I am coming back and if I am I will check everything right on the spot next time!
BAD SERVICE. PLEASE CHECK YOUR ORDERS IF YOU GO THERE!"}
{"text":"The place is great. I got schnitzel and the size of that dish is huge. Me and my girlfriend shared one and wow definitely worth the money. Staff is great and atmosphere is very relaxing. They dim the lights making it seem romantic which my girlfriend appreciated and so did I. Overall great service and food. 5/5"}
{"text":"Great portions.  Great flavour.  The size of the skewers and the taste is phenomenal.  Order the mixed skewers."}
{"text":"Taste buds blown. We warned: hefty sizes. 

Started with taster plate of baba ganouj, hummus, fried eggplant. Homemade, rich, flavourful and comes with lovely flatbread. Fried eggplant was served cold (may have been the wrong order) but what we got was also lovely. Perfectly seasoned and in a red sauce. 

Ordered the lamb burger for my main. Most flavourful, juicy burger ever. Perfectly done lam, grilled eggplant, tomato, lettuce, and onion on a sturdy bun. Meant business. Amazing. Also, crunchy fries seasoned with salt and pepper with a nice soft potato inside. Amazing.

Edited for grammar."}
{"text":"The meats are done very here.  This was my first time here and it is an instant favourite for me.  They have several locations but this is their take out location.  I've been to both types and the food is on point.  I ordered the chicken on pita, baba ganoush, chicken schnitzel dinner.  This was ample for 2 people and it was delicious.  They were also generous with their toppings too."}
{"text":"Walking into Me Va Me was very underwhelming. Their entrance is not welcoming and could use some flowers or decor. I wasn't even sure I was walking through the right door.

However while you're being seated, you can see how nice, clean, and sleek the restaurant is on the inside. I love that it's at the corner of Bathurst and Steeles but the surrounding grass and bushes by the windows doesn't make it seem like you're in a busy spot in Thornhill/North York.

The service is quick and friendly, even during the busy lunch rush.

I ordered the Lunch Special #1, which came with your choice of (half) laffa, and the daily soup. I ordered the chicken shawarma, which was a bit dry and needed more toppings, but I enjoyed their delicious daily soup especially on a cold day like today.

Their falafel was really mushy on the inside, which is unusual since they're supposed to be crispy and grainy.

My friend enjoyed the kefta, but said the cumin was a little too overpowering.

I applaud the restaurant for their marketing, menus, and the success of the restaurant. It's been around for the longest time, and still doing well."}
{"text":"I was last at MVM a couple of months ago for a Sunday lunch and the experience has stuck with me long enough that I can accurately recount my experience even now after all this time. 

Located in the plaza at the north/west corner of Rutherford and Bathurst, Me Va Me brings Middle Eastern cooking with an Israeli flare to the Vaughan Richmond Hill border with great service, class and a little casual sophistication.

I began my brunch/lunch with a Mojito, the ingredients were very fresh, and the drink was extremely well made, with great presentation!

Shortly after to follow I shared the grilled mushroom hummus (with grilled onions) appetizer with my DC.Served with fresh made pita with was an excellent starter for us both and its generous portion size was a sign of things to come.

For my main course I had the Lamb Skewers served with basmati rice and an Israeli salad on the side (similar to a Greek salad it was made with, cucumber, red onion and tomato chopped very fine, topped with fresh squeezed lemon). I could barely get through the entire portion!

My DC was sold by our server on their apparently famous chicken schnitzel entree - she really sold it well and her description had us both drooling. That said, nothing could have prepared us for what arrived soon after. A HUGE (likely 15-20 inches end to end) breaded and thinly filleted chicken breast, cooked to a crisp on the edges while remaining moist and delicious throughout! Shocking and amazing!

Best of all was that they price did not reflect the portion size and overall was very reasonable considering everything that we got!. I'll be back again...maybe for dinner next time (Mojitos at brunch WAS a bit crazy).

Eat Crest OUT!"}
{"text":"Not sure how i should start my review. 
I have been there only once, the food was ok , above average I can say. 

I found a hair in my food, My hair is blond and long, that hair was black and short. Still they didnt accept it. Seriously?!  

And my problem wasnt the hair. I got sick after trying their food. I experienced something similar to allergic reaction. I did thousands allergic tests and  found that im actually not allergic to anything. 
what could probably be in their food that made me sick for more than a month?!"}
{"text":"I had the lamb kabob. It was really delicious and cooked well. The restaurant is not somewhere you should go to if you're looking for a fun time. It was very quiet, and more 'older crowd' feeling. Got a few dirty looks from customers who apparently just wanted to eat in silence instead of having to overhear me and my good friend laughing over dinner.  I am not considered loud by any standards, and was definitely using an indoor voice, so it was really the first time I've had this happen to me.

The waitress was also cold, and never checked up on us. Service was not good in this aspect.

Wouldn't go back, but would take out their food ;)"}
{"text":"Bad, bad. Service - awful. Food - bland, watered down Israeli food. Perfect for the middle of the road suburbia."}
{"text":"- was in the neighbourhood, and we drove by the storefront, and saw that it was rammed!!
- this is an 'express' version, so with only a handful of counter seats, EVERYONE else was getting to-go orders.
- decent middle eastern. have had better food off the grill in neighbouring places further west. 
- will come back if in the area, but not worth the trek from across the city"}
{"text":"3.5*s Good quality food. Side selections are a bit bland but it's likely to drive you to the appetizers that are quite good. I love their dips and chicken skewers. Side salads are always health and hearty. Food comes out slower than most places and service can be a little cold from time to time. I have been here quite a few times and overall a pretty good experience with a moderately priced menu.

One thing I noticed is all the service staff are of Eastern European ethnicity and the kitchen staff seem much more diverse. Not sure if that bothers you but at least if the owners read this they will notice that customers notice."}
{"text":"So....I ate lunch 8 hours ago and I'm still full.

Seeing as Me Va Me's relatively new location is located just a km away from my parents house in Richmond Hill, I decided to take them there for lunch. For years and years now I have heard countless praise for this establishment, the Bathurst/Steeles location. However, anytime I ventured anywhere near Bathurst & Steeles, I would have no choice but to eat at Szechuan Gourmet, by far my favourite hakka restaurant in the country. 

Me Va Me is a middle eastern restaurant boasting affordable prices,  sizable portions and most importantly boom flavour. 

I highly recommend starting with the trio of dips. A single order of dip will run you $5.99 and the trio $8.99, so really no one orders just one dip. The Baba Ghanoush (mashed eggplant dish commonly made with ingredients such as garlic, olive oil, lemon etc.) was outstanding, certainly the best I have ever had. The piercing flavour of lemon shot through above everything but was not overpowering, I was floored.  They truly praise hummus at Me Va Me where they actually have an entire page of the menu dedicated to the smooth blend of chick peas and tahini (sesame seed paste). The texture of their hummus was fluffy and sooo smooth however the flavour lacked. I would have liked more lemon, more garlic and more salt and white pepper, overall a good hummus but I've had and can make way better. Our third dip was the fried eggplant, a fire roasted eggplant dish sauteed with onions in a rich tomato sauce. This dip was borderline blinding, the smokiness and flavour was perfection. Between both eggplant dishes I was sold on this restaurant. In retrospect I could just order the dips, a greek salad and call it a day. 

We did however order mains but by the time they came we were so stuffed. Between the dips, the pita, the pickles, our falafel appetizer (slightly overcooked - too crunchy, good flavour), the hot peppers, and our salads which came as a part of our mains we were starting to reach capacity. 

I ordered the grill plate, a half skewer each of white chicken, dark chicken, lamb (med rare), and beef tenderloin (med rare) with fried and a greek salad. The meats were seasoned and cooked well but again I was so stuffed I was forcing the meat down, I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. The fries were cooked perfectly and the salad was great, ample dressing and a generous topping of feta. 

My Dad ordered the Chicken Schnitzel which was nothing shy of badass. A butterflied chicken breast breaded and topped with sesame seeds. This was the most perfectly cooked schnitzel I ever tried. If you held up a bite on your fork to your face you would see the juice from the chicken slowly appearing, cooked Perfectly. My Dad ordered his main with steamed vegetables and an Israeli Salad. The steamed vegetables were not your typical nonsense you get at most restaurants. A 1/3 of a red and yellow pepper and a whole head of baby bok choy. The israeli salad which is a mix of diced cucumber, tomato, onion, lemon juice and olive oil was seriously lacking flavour, it came off as bland but still very refreshing.

Between my parents and I we tried maybe 5% of the menu. I absolutely hate big menus when going to restaurants, but overall the food tastes very fresh and I had lots of good eats today. Between all the dips, salads, appetizers, wraps, burgers, seafood, kebabs etc. thre are tons of options and can be overwhelming. So I would suggest browsing the menu before going to the restaurant. 

Overall the meal was great, and I would certainly return. Our server Manny was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Well maintained washrooms and a simple high ceiling decor. Liquor license is in effect, I put a hurting on some good ol' Hoegaarden. My parents had a mint lemonade which was phenomenal, the kind of lemonade you want to go home and make - luckily for me I have mad mint in my backyard, among other herbs ;)

I would also recommend looking into their take out option Me Va Me express located just beside the restaurant. It would be a great idea to pop in their to pick up dips and countless other treats if you were having guests over, or needed an affordable and tasty quick fix for dinner. 

4 thumbs up."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Me Va Me last Saturday for dinner. The variety of food was good and it tasted well but the noise level was just terrible and and the service was very very slow. It took over 20 minutes to get appetizers and 40 min wait between the appetizers and the main dish. When we complained about long wait the waitress just shrugged her shoulders and said \"it's Saturday, what do you expect?\" Well, we expect adequate waiting time and to be able to talk to each other without shouting... We will not come back and don't recommend this place on weekends."}
{"text":"Given that my parents are vegetarian, we visit this place quite often, as middle eastern cuisine tends to offer some delicious vegetarian options.

We usually get the mazaa platter which includes a choice of 4 of their home made dips. Our favs are a) The baba ganoush - just absolutely AMAZING! Probably the best I've ever had -- highly recommend it to all BG / eggplant fans b) The hummus with mushrooms and c) Matbuha (an another eggplant dish in a red tomato gravy). They come with freshly prepared pitas and are just to die for! 

My parents usually get the Grilled Vegetarian wraps (between them to share as a main) and they enjoy them. Their potato latkes are delicious as well. They do come with salmon as default, so try and let them know beforehand if you do not want it. 

Their chicken shwarma is good, nothing special tho. Have also had their grilled kebab platters and I personally enjoy them more. They have good salads and the fries are crispy on the outside, tender on the inside -- GOOD!. I also really enjoy their house hot sauce (more like a paste). Their creme brulee desert is fantastic as well.

This place does get busy on weekends, so be prepared to wait if you don't have reservations. All reservations require a minimum spending of $20 per person (which is conveyed at the time  you call to make 'em) and honestly, the portions are so large that we never end up spending that much a head."}
{"text":"Actually....not bad. The typical fare are good quality and doesn't taste like it's been sitting in a cooler for a month, like the hummus. The eggplant dip is great too, but tastes like they added sugar

Overall, enjoyed the food way more than my other Mediterranean hang out, Jerusalem. The food is basically more fresher and better quality. Service was good and they have tons or staff, which is probably why.

It was busy for a Monday night, but we didn't have to wait for a table. I have heard it's a mad house on the weekend. Due to the novelty of it just opening a month ago, and the nature of it's location, I'd say it will be like this for some time. 

If you don't like crowds or screaming children, avoid the appropriate times. Hit it up as late as you can on a school week night."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner and was overwhelmed by how busy it was! After reviewing the menu I settled on a chicken /rice dish. It took a bit of time but when it did arrive, I found the food to be just okay. I kind of expected it to be steaming hot but it wasn't. The wait staff were not too attentaive, and I'm not sure if it was because they were so busy or what.. I've not been back but might try another location next time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the GTA. Excellent food and always great service! i do countless birthday celebrations here, and they always nail it!"}
{"text":"I went there with my Russian girlfriend and I didn't like an attitude of the waitress who was serving us. She was clearly showing me that I am not welcome in this place... Anyway, the food was ok but nothing to write home about. I certainly like Shishlix better."}
{"text":"I've been to the Leslie York Mills location plenty of times. So I know the food is food, the service great and fast. This particular location is named \"Express\"  and once you order you get told your wait time for two shawarma pitas is 20 minutes? Someone care to explain how that works to me please? Can't imagine ever coming here for a work lunch."}
{"text":"Good was good.   Best shwarma I've had sober.    OK, maybe the only one I've had sober ;-)

Good food, but don't go for the service.   They are Russian. ... And very Russian at that. 

Bread doesn't come with sandwiches, but it looked really good."}
{"text":"Can't say anything bad about this place. Service is excellent and above all the food is fresh and abundant for the price. Fresh pita bread comes with every sitting along with appetizer pickles and peppers. I recommend The chicken Snitzel ."}
{"text":"Honestly this place should be on the list of bad ass places to eat in Toronto. I guarantee anything you order out of this place will be so delicious it will have you drooling for more. 

My personal favourite has to be the Chicken Schnitzel. The sauce that accompanies it is so amazing you will want a bottle of it to take home lol! Lamb and Chicken kebabs here are cooked to perfection any way you want it and seasoned beautifully. For a side i'd go with the Rice or the Mashed Potatoes. You can't ever go wrong with their mashed ;) 

Make sure also to try their Nana Tea. It's served with about a quarter cup of mint leaves in boiling hot water with the tea bag on the side. It's so refreshing and pairs well with the dinner. The Hummous is a must have as well before you start off, be careful not to indulge to much on it too since its filling. 

Go now just don't even think! The waits on the weekends are brutal but so worth the time spent to eat the greatest food on earth!"}
{"text":"This seems to be a crazy popular spot for dinner, but don't fret - they take reservations. something I wish I had looked into before showing up and having to wait 40 minutes for a table :( The hummus here is divine, i suggest you get the appie trio starter to enjoy their large selection of dips. Don't worry, they'll top you off with extra pitas if you run out!

I ordered the lamb dinner the last time I was back, and it was fantastic. The prices are great for the amount of food you get, and it's always good. You can tell by the sheer number of people that are willing to wait it out. We usually order a bottle or two of wine as well. 

Overall, this place is great for a casual dinner, and perfect for sharing since the plates are so large. And yes - get the hummus!"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a friend for a decently-priced dinner gathering for 4. We reserved tables, which was a big help since the place was packed. Note: if you're making reservations, they require a $20 minimum per person.

The portions here are huge. We had so many leftovers, even though I split a meal with someone. A bottle of wine, a 3 dip starter, and a large dinner cost us about $25 per person. The hummus there is SO good. The lamb is fantastic, but I wish I had gotten something else for a side instead of the rice. The starter salad is crazy big too, so you'll definitely be full (a dinner meal costs $15 - $17!)

Our server was alright, he seemed pretty busy and was pretty sloppy with the wine serving - it dripped everywhere and into our dips. Otherwise, the place was a great choice for a casual foodie night out!"}
{"text":"Large portions, decent food.  I'd recommend the Baba ghanoush for an appetizer and something smaller for the main.  Oh... If you don't like battered fries, pick something else for the side dish with your main."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The chicken quinoa salad is my absolute favourite dish, and the laffa and hummus are great too. I would give it 4 stars but the servers always look miserable. They only smile to people they know or who speak their language. Everyone else is a burden. It kind of spoils the experience but the food is just too good to pass up."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and we had a really good time. We were in a bit of a rush so we ordered our entrees really quickly. 

I ordered a house salad and it was really good. It came with traditional vegetables and beets, which made it extra special. One of my friends ordered falafel's and a Greek salad. She really enjoyed her meal as well. Our other friend ordered a pita with Shawarma or falafel and she really enjoyed it. Her entree also came with a really big portion of fries. It's perfect if you want to satisfy your French-fry craving. 

On other occasions I have ordered the  chicken salad to-go and it is phenomenal. The portion is huge and the price is really reasonable. It's enough for two meals. I usually substitute the normal salad for the Israeli salad and it's to die for. It's so delicious. 

MeVaMe also has a great patio for warm weather. They have amazing alcoholic drinks. The limeade drink is phenomenal. 

This restaurant features excellent portions, great service, healthy food, delicious drinks and good prices. I highly recommend you check out MeVaMe."}
{"text":"Good food, met owner Benny who was behind the cash, very friendly. Small place."}
{"text":"This location of Me Va Me is an express location, which means the seating is much like a pizza pizza type like an earlier reviewer mentioned.

There aren't much seats in this location, but it is good for a quick meal or take out. It is pretty busy as well, I constantly see people coming in and out for take out or fast meal.

I liked their electronic ordering screens, it is easy to know whats available to order. I went today for lunch with some co-workers and had the lunch box Shawarma for $9.95

You get to choose a side of fries, steamed veggies or rice. I went with steamed veggies. When I got the meal, the portions were very generous, lots of chicken shawarma and a piece of bread, comes already with a salad, so I had plenty of veggies in my meal.

I liked it, it was pretty delicious. The tried the rice, it was a bit bland instead of flavorful, but overall it was still a pretty good meal. 

I think the portions could be enough for two people, so for couples going there or two friends who aren't starving entirely, ordering 1 lunch box or 1 dinner box might be enough for two.

For the price, this portion is a really good value and quality. I will definitely come back here for a meal or two when I am hungry for Shawarma!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, and yes you're going to be waiting.  But its definitely worth it.  The flatbread, hummus, baba ganush were all delicious starters.  We all got the great looking house salad - not sure what dressing they use but it was delicious and refreshing.

My friends got chicken kebobs and a lamb kebob - huge portion cooked just perfectly.  I sprung for the schnitzel... yummy.

The place has a simple, diner feel to it - people aren't coming for the atmosphere - its all about the food."}
{"text":"Although i have enjoyed the food at this restaurant i will never go back again.
I called twice on two different occasions to make a reservation. First time for party of 10 and second for party of 5 and both times i was informed that they will only take my reservation
If each person spends a minimum of $25.00
What BS! An extortion fee to get a reservation.
They lost me as a customer and i hope others will drop this place too. There are many other middle eastern restaurants in this city that are just as good if not better. Me va me shame on you!"}
{"text":"First and last time at Bathurst and Steels location. Restaurant prices, cafeteria service.  Food was ok with the exception of tabouli. Inedible. Drenched in lemon juice and nothing else. Will not be back because of horrible service."}
{"text":"First and last time here. Restaurant prices, cafeteria service.  Food was ok with the exception of tabouli. Inedible. Drenched in lemon juice and nothing else. Will not be back because of horrible service."}
{"text":"There are quite a few Me Va Mes in the city now, but this location is one of my favourites. Whether you go to the restaurant, or takeout, it's always quick, consistent and good tasting. I prefer the Shawarma, it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"seriously great prices for large portions. Meal starts off with their free pita bread which comes out fresh, hot, fluffy on the inside.  SO good.

two dips i love here are baba gonoush (eggplant) and matbuha (peppers and tomatoes) which go perfectly with their pita.  it would be great to just buy a tub of baba gonoush and eat it to myself.

most of their meals come with the house salad which is always fresh and comes with carrots, beets, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions.  I've been here a bunch of times but I normally order their filet mignon skewers which are usually cooked exactly to medium rare, what i ask for.  Or I'll order their veggie wrap which is great!

Some random notes.  The fried calamari to start is really good. The salmon skewers are dry, wouldn't order them again and they only give you three pieces on each skewer.  The  schnitzel is HUGE and can probably feed two regular eaters.  The shawarma is also a large portion. This place is always consistent."}
{"text":"THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MENU!!! I had to wait for the cashier to give me a pamphlet that was hidden to the side of the cashier. My food was undercooked and the service was disgusting. If only health and safety committees could inspect my mental safety this location would not be around, why? Because the staff drove me insane. As I called to complain and obtain contact of the owner the employees knew nothing. Also, they knew nothing about there own food. I would call this place terrible but it would be a compliment."}
{"text":"I love this location!  It is so clean and the food is always so good!  Can't go wrong with the chicken schnitzel!   Me va me house salad is my favorite as well.  I love the dressing and the salad is always so fresh.   I never get disappointed whenever I visit me va me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday night.   We love Me Va Me and this location does not disappoint.  The food is always made fresh and fast.   We love the salads and the customer service is always top notch.   If you are looking for tasty Mediterranean cuisine then stop by Me Va Me.  May I recommend the Chicken Schnizle platter?  It is so large that you are going to have to take some home!   It comes with your choice of a side dish and a salad as well. I always get the Me House Salad.  The dressing is so good and light.   I cannot say anything more.  Try this place for yourself you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"They served with dirty forks.. so I show it to the server and I asked to change it..  however, I never heard sorry from server or any one!  It seems like the worker s do not care about the customer..  also they pass items over the half wall.."}
{"text":"When it comes to Arab or Middle eastern food, I live in an area where you can find them left right and center. So I was reluctant to visit me VA me due to their higher     price. However, my curiosity got the best of me and I wanted to know what the hype was about. Their pita's were clay oven and as a man of Indian origin; I will go ahead and give it the approval to be called Naan. Clay oven and perfect texture. Ordered the shawarma plate and it was displayed amazingly. Circle of hummus sorrounding a pool of chicken flakes with a rich brown texture . Also ordered the mixed grill platter . Surfed and turfed beef, lamb and white and dark meat chicken. So so good. Their grill must be magical cuz medium rare was so tender. They also had pitchers to wash it all down with. Plus the waitresses marching up and down all the time. Great service . Great food. Worth the few extra dollars."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, clean restaurant, friendly staff , humus and bread was delish all appetizers were great as a matter of fact ,"}
{"text":"I was very happy with all the food we ordered. I think the food is better than Paramount, especially the hummus and chicken shawarma. Presentation is also nicer. Really loved the trio of dips as an appetizer. I got the mushroom hummus as a main course and couldn't even finish it. We also got falafels to share. Everyone at my table (party of 10) got something different and we were all happy with our selection. Ambiance is casual, clean and well lit. Seems to be a busy place. We came at 2:30pm and it was still very busy."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken shawarma on hummus but they didn't have any. The server recommended the chicken schnitzel. The dining room was full and customers are happy. I loved how they served mix green salad while you wait. Overall, will comeback here again because the service was good and food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Affordable, delicious, consistent. And they take large groups. This place is always buzzing and we're always happy to be here.

I've been coming here for years. I've been going to the original location at Bathurst and Steeles for maybe almost a decade now.

After all of this time, all I ever get is the schnitzel. Yes, other things on the menu look great, but the schnitzel is so delicious I never stray. It's a huge portion, so be prepared not to finish it/take some home. The house salad they serve along with it (and several other mains) is so delicious. 

Other yummy suggestions:
- Grilled calamari
- Trio of dips [baba ganoush, eggplant, and mushrooms] 
- Meat kebab

Don't pass up the flatbread [don't know the official name] that they bring to the table. It is so warm, crunchy, and overall amazing, and even better if you get a dip."}
{"text":"Busy, noisy, bad service and rude stuff, poor menu choice"}
{"text":"A good place for lunch or dinner. Fresh food, excellent hot pita bread, amazing humus. You can find healthy options of you keep on \"clean\" food diet: chicken skew with steamed broccoli along with big Israeli salad. In my healthy ranking of gets 5 stars. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten in for this location for years but we have ordered for take out to feed 12+ adults for special occasions numerous times this year.

We usually get a mix of sides which includes pickles, hummus, baba ganoush, eggplant, hot sauce, pita etc.

We usually get salad, potatoes, rice, chicken kebobs, chicken shawarma, beef and lamb.  Their chicken shawarma is my favorite dish.  They are very reasonably priced considering the quantity of food you get.  We always always order more so everybody can take some home and what doesn't get taken home lasts me for at least 2 more lunches to take to work.

The quality of food is really good for the value and take out is a great option if it's too busy in the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. One of the best, if not the best, Shwarma I've ever had. I wish they had takeout at this location."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for so long that I remember when the chicken Shwarma dinner plate used to be $9.99.  Fresh pickles on the side are great. Always fresh salad. The baba ganoush is the best in my opinion."}
{"text":"They should change the name from Me Va Me Express to Me Va Me rush hour on the 401. Total chaos. We waited over 30 minutes for our express order of falafel and salad. Food was decent, but nothing extraordinary. Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Loveeeee the shawarma pita here! 
Quality of chicken is the best I've tried in Toronto. Toppings are flavourful and the portion is most definitely generous!
Finger licking good! 

It's more of a eat real quick type place not many seats or really good for take out!

Service is quite speedy.
Staff is pleasant. 
Price is fair you can eat for under
$10! 

Def try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because I saw the location but had no idea what they served. If you're wondering, it's Mediterranean/Lebanese for an even bigger hint it's a Shawarma/Falafel house. If you have something pictured in your mind wipe it clear. This is a shawarma/falafel house upped. The restaurant is massive and the decor is very nice and bright. You will find the prices are higher than your standard shawarma/falafel houses but that's because their portion sizes are massive, the difference from Me Va Me and other places is they use (not sure if it's homemade or not but I think it is) Laffa bread instead of standard Pita Bread. The difference is noticeable and I believe it makes Ma Be Ma stand out from the rest. Not cheap but the Shawarma was excellent"}
{"text":"Had a terrific lunch today, choose a vegetarian option and it was delicious.  Huge portion of super fresh food for only $10.00.  Fantastic, will go back for sure.
And the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Food is terrific and prices great.  Nice and new establishment. Nicely decorated and very clean.  They are new and haven't gotten everything in order yet, example : They keep running out of Shawarma, it's Saturday at 7:30 pm and they have already run out.   Service good and staff friendly especially Sandra that went above and beyond in service !"}
{"text":"This restaurant has several locations.  This ones the best for a sit down meal, since they have full dining area.  Good thing is they have a separate take out section with its own entrance.  Great shawarma, if they don't run out.  I typically order the filet minion meal, which is very tender and good flavor, at least for the reasonable price."}
{"text":"Food is good but very frustrating people to deal with. There always seems to be confusion when placing order. Either they are not familiar with their own menu order from or there's a language breakdown. The last few times they forgot a pita and/or the tahini sauce. Glad I discovered Paramount around the corner. Good bye Me va me hopefully forever..."}
{"text":"Tried Me Va Me for take-out on a Saturday thinking I could grab a quick meal to eat at home while doing my Netflix thing that evening. Quick was the last thing I got!!!
Ordered a simple salad and some falafel with hummus thinking it would be a basic order and while I joined the few other patrons, I could sense that it would be a long wait. I sure got that, it took 30 minutes for my order, I could've ordered a pizza for a lot less time. I wasn't alone as the crowd of displeased people also waiting. kept growing!!
While the staff were running around not getting much accomplished I read previous reviews, had I only known. This newly opened location has become notorious for long waits and disorganized staff!! Where is the manager??
My comments in the food? The falafel was good, hummus was premade and okay. The salad was not worth the price, small amount and the mini chicken skewers not worth the $17!
Avoid if you are looking for a quick meal!!"}
{"text":"Two of us went for dinner last night and ordered the grilled chicken breast Greek salad and a Me salad with grilled lamb. 
Super expensive for 4 small piece or chicken and 4 pieces of grilled lamb.
Taste was ok but way too expensive.
Will not go back"}
{"text":"The food here is always good but the service can sometimes border on pushy. The serving size is pretty good!

I had the 1 skewer of chicken, dark, with Greek salad and fries and it was about $15 before gratuity, and it also came with a bowl of pickles and hot peppers and a pita which was great. Service can sometimes be a bit pushy but it really depends on the server and how busy they are. It can be a hit or miss. But otherwise the food is delicious and a pretty good value!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars out of 5.

I think this place has potential to be a great place but our visit was disappointing.  I expected more.

We ordered the dark chicken box with Rice and salad (2 skewers) and grilled beef with Rice and salad (2 skewers).

The Good:
The Chicken was quite good and I enjoyed the doing sauces provided (brown and white sauce).  The brown sauce is a bit tangy and spicy and the white sauce is a bit runny.

Good in general is tasty

The Bad:
We asked for the beef to be well done but instead got medium (my wife could not eat anything raw for health reasons).

The pita bread that comes with the box meal was cold.  It's as if they just bought it from No Frills across the street.  I expected them to at least heat/toast it up a bit.

The sitting space here isn't much.

Bring your own water or get your water from the nearby McDonald's.  Me Va Me charges 2.50 for water."}
{"text":"Went here with couple of friends , food was ok, liked the atmosphere classic and nice seats to sit on. The service was good.. But I am thinking that the food was not cooked.. When I went home the day after I had the runs, and I knew what place I ate at last.. Remind you guys don't have the kabob .... Anyways like I said it was good , yet over priced .. I would go for the atmosphere but sorry really for the food . Too bad this one was a lose..:("}
{"text":"The food here is okay, not the best for the price. Prices are high. In the photo you can see some lettuce that had gone bad and shouldn't have been in my salad. It's unfortunate. Their quality isn't as good as the main location used to be. No complaints about the service."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and delicious as it is in all locations but here you get a bit of a larger portion, and even extra pickles :-) the salad and their dressing is excellent! We also really enjoy their hot sauce very unique flavour its bare able and delicious!
But the place is starting to show its age quiet a bit, 
I used to come here over 10 years ago, and it looks like nothing has been changed or updated...."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We regularly get take out from this location, and had dat inn once for lunch. The portions are great, very generous. The food is fresh and very tasty. And have never had a problem with the service. I wouldn't say this place is gluten free, since I reacted to their fries and wedges, but that's simply due to the oil they share with other items. But the meat is awesome and even the house salad is amazing!
Well priced as well  there's a new location now coming to Woodbridge!! Can't wait"}
{"text":"Shawarma box has no toppings. Literally just chicken and a side (fries, Caesar salad). Calling it shawarma is misleading."}
{"text":"Good service, but always a line. It's ok tho Good but a lil bit over priced for that small ass shawarma blyat hahahaha."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious they all seem very homemade except for the bread. The dips and salad is really good. The entree portions are large. This is the place to come when your really hungry. The food is good so you have to expect to wait 15-30 mins. I don't see why people is complaining about it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Israeli salad, chicken shawarma on hummus and the lemonade. There is no wifi here. There is no electrical outlets to charge the cell phones here. Appetizer given is the dill pickle. It's not a very busy day. The Israeli salad was delicious. It's tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro and lemon juice. I like the warm pita bread that they serve. The chicken shawarma on hummus tastes great. Also, their French fries tastes awesome. :)"}
{"text":"Me Va Me Express occupies a corner spot and has almost a Pizza Pizza feel inside but with Mediterranean food.  I took a brief while to decided on the Lamb Shish Kebob(Pita, $6.75) but the cashier asked me about 3 times what else I wanted, maybe a drink?  2.5 *Star*

Nowhere on the Menu Board does it show you the cost of a can of Peach Juice($2.20) which I thought was a bit costly after the fact she rang it up.  You win this round Cashier Lady!

Lamb Pita as she said did take roughly 10 minutes as it was put into a Pita Pocket unlike the ones at Pita Pit or Pita Factory but has a bit thicker/chewy and smaller shape than the traditional ones.  I like it although looking at it makes me think they did that on purpose to lower the intake of ingredients that can fit inside.

The Lamb Kebob took a few more chews than I wished for but it's A-OK while the toppings options was very nice as I added Babaghanoush, Onion, Spicy item.  The Chicken Kebob I believe takes the same time as I noticed someone waiting for it and he was there before I was.  If you wish for fast then just stick with Shawarma."}

{"text":"A piece of advice - do not buy a plate from here as you will get ripped off! Bought a chicken plate and was disappointed to see no sauces besides tahini were provided. If you want eggplant, hummus etc. it's an additional cost. However if you buy a pita/laffa which is half the price of a plate, all sauces and toppings are available to you.
Although the  chicken was cooked well I felt too ripped off to enjoy it.
Take your $20 and buy two plates from another shawarma place."}
{"text":"100% agree with this review.

1.0 star rating 3/25/2017
So the food was really good at this place. Now they've dramatically raised their prices and the quality of the food has dropped. They've cut back on garnishes that really used to compliment the meal. Also, the girls working behind the counter at Bathurst and Rutherford location are rude and kind of dumb. Not impressed.

Was this review ...?"}
{"text":"The value-for-money (VFM) item here is their dips. For ~$13, you get to choose 3 decent-sized dips which come with 3 large pita bread.  

My top 3 dips would be:
1. Baba Ganoush (eggplants) - must try
2. Hummus 
3. Green Eggplant 

BUDGET TIP: For a party of four, you may consider the 3-dip per above plus three 2-skewers combo, this portion should be filling for 4 ppl. Each skewer combo includes a side dish. 

Also, when you order lamb skewers, make sure to order medium NOT medium-well like I did, as it was too cooked and a bit dry (still okay).  If you are undecided between beef and lamb skewers, go with the beef - it tastes better."}
{"text":"Me Va Me is so good! I have been to multiple locations, and everyone has impressed me! The Chicken Shawarma is so yummy. I also get the trio dip. The baba ganoush is to die for! Also I am not at all a fan of hummus, but Me Va Me's hummus is amazing. Smooth and Nutty-esque 
- I am in love.

Also ask for a side of their hot sauce. You will NOT regret!"}

{"text":"Second time ordering take out and I couldn't be more impressed.  

Initially ordered a falafel lunch box\" rice was so fresh and the falafel looked to be cooked made to order.  I know good falafel and they clearly know their stuff.

Today I ordered a chicken shawarma Laffa wrap, which was also pretty good.  Huge portion to save the other half for later as well.  
Again, fresh ingredients with some flavour it wasn't defined but it was still good.

I can also appreciate that the way they package the food is not to spill or drip all over the place.  Attention to detail is noticed.  

I do enjoy ordering and will again and still recommend it to this day."}
{"text":"The hummus is creamy and smooth, the smoothest I've ever had. It's definitely nothing like grocery store hummus *shudders*. It's delicious. It's even better if you add a touch of olive oil to smooth things out a tad, cuz the hummus is really thick. 

The fried eggplant is almost sweet and sour like, heavier on the sweet. For something with so much oil, it's incredibly fresh and almost light tasting. 

Their baba ganoush is delicious as well. It's creamy and it's a big hit at parties.

They also have a salad called a matbuha (sp?), I believe, that is almost like a not particularly chunky salsa, and is made with cooked tomatoes and sweet peppers with herbs and spices. I quite enjoyed this too.

I usually get the four in their four dip combo for $13.95 (for 32 oz).

The lady who served me this time was super friendly. It was my first time getting the matbuha and she explained to me what it was. She also let me sample things so that I could know what I was buying before I bought them.

The two most unfortunate things about this me va me express is that 1) they don't include pita with dip purchases (you can buy it at an additional charge), and 2) they don't have fresh laffa the way their restaurant does. 

(the part that comes next doesn't particularly apply to this particular location but is a shameless plug for their sit down restaurant).

Just down the street at Bathurst and Steeles is their sit down restaurant. They have the same dips (for a tad bit more, money-wise), but these come with fresh laffa. Laffa is a type of flatbread. They make the laffa in house and you can ask for more (they don't charge you for this). It's fresh and warm and delicious, and I wish the express locations would provide laffa with dip purchases. I wouldn't mind paying a bit more if they would include the laffa."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 5. Had the baba ganoush (not bad, but a tad too much mayo), the chicken shawarma hummus (hummus was absolutely amazing. super creamy texture, but not creamy as in left a taste of mayo or oil in my mouth, shawarma was flavorful), the fried calamari (tasted good, tender calamari, wish there was more for the price though), the lamb kefta (flavorful, lots of lamb taste), the mixed grill (all meats grilled perfectly tender and delicious. good quality meats. asked for medium rare. got medium rare). side salad that accompanies the meals is really big. also really tasty. the bread (laffa?) accompanying the dips was fresh (made in house), hot, and refillable. 

Service was a tad slow, but servers really polite and really attentive."}
{"text":"I've heard alot about this place, and when I finally got a chance to visit, I was ecstatic!

The decor at this location is really nice + classy. I defo felt underdressed because everyone around me was in suits and fancy clothes. Woops. Also, I was partially soaked because of the rain outside...so anyways.

We had (to share) 

1. The App Trio with Hummus, Tabouleh and Baba Ghanouj. I really liked the tabouleh, but the hummus could've used a bit of lemon (which we did add and made it so much better). I wasn't a fan of the BBG. It's not supposed to be so creamy..

2. The Lamb Skewers: They were my sister's favourite, but I wsan't the biggest fan. They were cooked well, not dry even though we asked for them medium well (my sister's pregnant and doesn't eat any raw meat). I thought they were a bit lacklustre. 

3. The Chicken Skewers: MY FAVOURITE. This was amazing. Perfectly cooked, and perfectly seasoned. YUM FREAKING OH.

4. THE PITA? NAAN? PITA-NAAN HYBRID? thing served as well was AMAzING. Even my little 3 year old niece couldn't get enough of it, and she spent most of the night sleeping in the booth!

All in all, it's an okay place. I've heard they do a mean steak though, so I might be back.

The only qualm is that it was a bit expensive. I could've gotten the same and more at Paramount (which I like better)"}
{"text":"The food here is good and fresh, never had a bad experience here so it's pretty solid. 
The service is fast and turnover too. 
Bottom line, solid Mediterranean food with the usual hummus, eggplant salads etc. 
Very easy for first timers to check it out"}
{"text":"Been going to MeVaMe, since the early days of a tiny shack on Steeles. 

As they've grown, branched out, and grown again, things really went downhill. 

But then, the Rutherford location got sold - that made things even worse (although I thought they couldn't be worse than they already are). 

The food is downright terrible, and the only saving grace of this place is the service. 

Won't repeat if I don't have to."}
{"text":"This place has some excellent food on their menu. The portions are more than adequate and the prices are very resonable. I had a Schnitzel sandwich ($9.99) on my last visit, and it was delicious.

There is a small patio outside, and the inside of the restaurant is decent. The servers and staff are nice, and service was prompt."}
{"text":"The food here is great and it's a place I frequently visit. The staff can occasionally have an attitude and act rude but I always take the food to go. It usually doesn't take too long to get your order. All in all its great food at a fair price and I would highly recommend giving it a try. 

UPDATE

The prices have gone up and they cut a few corners. Very unimpressed. I will return but I won't be running there any time soon."}
{"text":"I would say food quality wise, this place beats most shawarma houses in the area. Yeas, it's more expensive, but you pay for what you put inside you, right? My favourite is shawarma, but i am gluten intollerant, so I can't have the pita that I used to love so much. It's an express location, so you get the stuff to go, or quickly stuff your face there. really cannot go wrong with any of the choices. We ordered there severa times for a party, it is worth it, you really cannot compromise on the quality. They have several new locations all over the place, I like the Bathurst and Rutherford one and I also visited the one on Lesmill, they are really nice to sit down and have a meal."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Cashier was extremely rude and not very helpful at all. Waited for my food for more than 20 minutes and it was cold. My sister bought kettle chips and never got them, even ask for them and they said \"Oh sorry, we'll get them for you\" but they never did. So she wasted money.  Employees were very unfriendly and service was extremely slow."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there last night. You indeed have to wait even on a Sunday night after 8 p.m.

After a round of Draft Stellas, the table ordered some hummos and a fallalel appetizer. We were served the main course salads with the appetizer. We all upgraded to Israeli chopped salads. The hummos was delicious, but a bit too homogenized, creamy. It was also topped with Harissa, and lots of it. If you do not like hot spices, make sure you requested they omit it. The fallafel were freshly fried and were delicious. We also had a dish of mixed pickles (complimentary) which consisted of cucumber pickles, tomato pickles and pickled  peppers. Overall the appetizers and salads were good, the fallafel extremely good. The salad was made Israeli-style with no oil. A bit of Olive Oil would have helped.

For a main course we ordered the following: 2 chicken kebab plates, one Jerusalem Mix (chicken livers and chicken hearts), and salmon kebabs. The chicken kebabs were very good, and the Jerusalem mix very delicious. I wish they offered a charcoal-grilled version of the the Jerusalem mix. The salmon was also well prepared.

There was plenty of food, and we all took food home. Overall we all liked this restaurant, had a lot of food. These are not complex recipes but this place has such a following and turn-over that everything is very fresh. 

We will definitely return, but be prepared to wait. It appears that they have a policy of only accepting 1 reservation per night, just a token!

This establishment is riding a wave of popularity now. I wonder how long standards will be maintained, and how long it will stay popular. It is not popular because its trendy. In this case 'its the just the food....' .Time will tell."}
{"text":"I just came back from there, I had ordered chicken on pita, their chicken was very dry, it used to be good juicy before but not anymore.

Not sure what happened, maybe they forgot it on the grill for too long or didn't marinade it right or enough."}
{"text":"*take out spot review**Always delicious, fresh and relatively fast. I find the prices inflated but haven't been disappointed by the quality yet. There is also a sit down me va me right beside the take out spot."}
{"text":"Went there for my first time today for lunch with a few friends who have been raving about this place. 

Environment was very nice and clean. Staff were also very friendly and helpful. It was really busy and our waitress kept going around tables and back and forth from the kitchen but she was still very on top of our orders and requests (for extra pickles, water, hot sauce, and bread several times) and made a small friendly conversation with us.  

We all got the hummus plates, one minced lamb, one chicken shawarma, and one roasted mushrooms. Out of the three of them I liked the lamb the most which had pine nuts on them that added a great touch to the texture. Tried a bit of my friend's mushrooms plate and although it tasted fresh, it wasn't something as good as the lamb for the same price. All three hummus dishes were $10.99 which was very reasonable considering the portion and quality of the food.

On a side note, their hot sauce and pickles were sooo good! The hot sauce is home made and very different than regular hot sauce at most restaurants (which are mostly just Sriracha). Also, all their dishes were nicely decorated, even the ones I see others have at their tables which makes it more appetizing.

Just one tiny thing to end off. We were in a group of 4, all ordered hummus plates but we only got 2 pieces of bread (naan bread?) to start off. This was obviously not enough so we had to reorder (which was unlimited) several times because each time they only give you 2 pieces. I felt bad for our waitress for walking back and forth for us so many times. They should probably distribute the quantities according to the table size and/or the dishes ordered at the table.

But I'm ready to go back already to try other stuff on their menu :)"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch and Dinner
Specialty: Israeli Dinner
Menu items: Minced Lamb on Humus, Baba Ganoush, Chicken Shish Kebab, Jerusalem Mix and Famous Lemonade

Before I go on describing the beautiful dishes this Thornhill restaurant brings to our city, I am going to explain the meaning of its name first. One, because this seems to be a common question among people; and two, because its good to know, isn't it?
According to fellow bloggers, Me Va Me means \"who and whose\". Why would the Russian Jewish owners call their restaurant that way? bites me...but I thought we should get that out of the way first.

Now on to the food! Let's kick this off with my fave menu item, the Minced Lamb on Hummus. In my mind there is nothing better than meat covered in a sweet and silky chick pea spread. Add to that a strong meat such as lamb, seasoned with paprika, cinnamon, lemon and some...topped with pine nuts, and you got yourself one hell of a tasty appetizer!
I have yet to try a hummus this good. When I visit this Jewish diner, I already know what my two meat spreads will be. The former which I just described, and the Baba Ganoush, which I use on the rest of my entrees.

The Baba Ganoush is grilled eggplant mashed with garlic and other spices. Because of the texture and flavour, I often find this dip goes well on rice, chicken, beef and even potatoes. I highly recommend getting your dip-ready fingers on this one.

Me Va Me is well known for their fantastic Shawarma dishes as well as their Kebabs. Kebabs are simply pieces of meat on a skewer, seasoned and grilled. The making of this dish is nothing special; however what makes it special at Me Va Me is the tenderness of the meat, and in this case, the chicken. The juices are still running through the meat when it arrives at your table; on top of that the meat is so tender and light to chew that you almost wonder if they have a farm of chickens in the back...it tastes that fresh!

A recent find, and acquired taste for me, is the Jerusalem Mix. The Jerusalem Mix is traditionally a dish made with all kinds of chicken innards. Yes, you heard right, its all the insides of a chicken in a dish. At Me Va Me this dish has chicken liver, hearts and pieces of dark meat, all sauteed with caramelized onions, olive oil and parsley. Some find this dish unique, I find it quite delicious and tasty. You might also think of this as a delicacy; because of the addition of the hearts, this dish is amongst the most expensive ones found in the menu...think about it, how many hearts can a chef get from one chicken?
 
The last item on my review, and probably the first you should order, its Me Va Me's Famous Lemonade. This is no regular lemonade. What you get is a well blended mix of mint, lemonade mix and ice. I think there is more to this, but the menu (owners) does not share all. It's a phenomenal drink and a great accompaniment to any meal.

Note to Foodies: Portions are quite large so sharing is highly recommended. Also, the restaurant tends to be extremely busy on weekends and takes no reservations, be prepared to wait 30-45 mins for a table during peak times.

Until next time Foodies!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"There are few places I crave returning for a great meal. Me Va Me fits the description. I e been here twice, and both times I really enjoyed it. It has a modern clean decor, seating can be a bit tight, but the food is excellent. 

I start off with the Israeli Salad, which is really just diced cucumber, diced tomato, a bit of onion in a very simple dressing. It is incredibly refreshing!

For a main, I had the Grill Delight, with 2 skewers of impossibly tender chicken, and 2 skewers of beef. For the side I had grilled veggies, tossed in a pesto and still crisp and fresh. 

I didn't get to dessert, as much as I wanted to. Maybe the third time's the charm..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a beautiful, classic decor with clean lines and a sophisticated colour scheme. The use of natural materials, from the stone walls and wood pillars to the granite table tops provides an elegant yet casual dining area. It's bright, spacious and well laid out. There is also a large patio upstairs but it was closed the day we were there.

Our server was friendly but not overly helpful. I was glad one of my coworkers had provided me a list of her favourites, else I wouldn't have known where to start! I had been given the tip though, that one dish could definitely feed two people with ease! We ordered accordingly and with drinks (non-alcoholic), the bill still came out to $40 after tax!! Here's what we had...

Potato Latkes: Potato cakes stacked with thin slices of salmon, sour cream, red onions and capers - $9.99

I'm so glad that this was on the list of recommendations I came with. We were presented with two large potato latkes served over mixed greens. Sandwiched between the latkes were slices of salmon and big dollops of sour cream. If the salmon was smoked, it was ever so lightly. It had more of a sashimi texture and flavour and the sour cream was to die for! Definitely an item you can share but next time, I'm having one all to myself! Simply delicious.

Lamb Skewers with Seasoned Vegetables (and Greek Salad) - $18.99

The lamb was seasoned nicely and cooked to a perfect medium. Two large skewers with 5 or 6 pieces per skewer served with a barbecue sauce type dip. The vegetables were al denté and consisted of carrots, broccoli, sweet peppers and bok choy. There were other sides we could choose from but with the potato latkes, we figured we'd keep it on the lighter side.

Unfortunately, the Greek Salad that came with our meal failed in comparison. The lettuce looked as though it had seen better days and was not dressed evenly. With a sprinkling of feta cheese, tomato, cucumber and a few black olives this salad lacked creativity and was no different than what I could find at any family style diner.

I should note, there is also a Me Va Me Express for takeout and delivery. There are two locations, one is beside this restaurant and the other is located at Steels and Hilda Avenue. From what is noted on the Express menu, there is a $3.50 delivery charge. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"The food was so heavy with no taste at all. there were no olive oil or olive in the restaurant (which is a must in lebanese restaurant). the waiters were rude and overallI don't know how this restaurant got 4 stars in rating! Either people who go there don't know lebanese food is or it just got it's rating from the friends of the owner. I love middle eastern food and wherever i go i try this kind of food. The food was not good at all. It was just so big so maybe people who like quantity instead of quality like the place."}
{"text":"Tried to make reservations and they said a minimum $25/ person is required.   Nothing like trying to gouge their loyal customers.   I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Me Va Me has a wide selection of food. There is definitely something for each taste bud. The portions are large and well made. 

My highest recommendation is the hummus. It's such a simple thing, but they make it very well. It's even better when you are given fresh, warm pita for dipping. 

I am a big fan of the shawarma, however it has been out the past few times I've been. The times have been different: a Wednesday night at 8, a Friday night at 6, and a Tuesday at 5. I've been disappointed because it's a favorite of mine. So don't bank on getting it. 

The lamb burger is well prepared, as are the falafels. The chicken schnitzel is fantastic with a delicious cream sauce on the side! 

Always have a few options in mind while reviewing the menu, just in case your first choice is unavailable."}
{"text":"This place is huge and gorgeous.

It just opened up in the area and I was surprised by how modern yet cozy it was.

The food is really fresh and meticulously prepared. Because of that expect a bit of a wait but it's worth it.

Everything screams quality, the falafel wraps are amazing and the shwarma is very nice. It did have a spice blend that I'm not a fan of so I may not be back for it but thats just my personal take I'm sure many will love it."}
{"text":"Making my way along Steeles Ave West, I was craving some good bites in the area, and Me Va Me was right there! This small place certaintly has big flavor from your Meditterranean/ MIddle Eastern Favorites like baba ganoush, humus, and beef skewers to their falafels, Morrocan cigars and pitas. 

Coming here on a Good Friday, and not being able to consume any meat, I opted for their Falafels, and my oh my was it delicious! considering it was a small wait, it was totally worth it. You can't really put a price on FRESHLY made food, this Falafel was a perfect 5! and it was huge.  Thankfully the lovely lady decided to cut the falafel in half since I was unable to finish the other half.
In addition to the falafel, i ordered their creamy baba ganoush (mixed with mayo) though heavy, no signs of faults hence it was a 5! 
Their baba ganoush (without mayo) was another hit, mixed with cilantro, was a beauty.

without a doubt ill be back to this place! job well done Me VA mE"}
{"text":"Make sure to make a reservation, it's like impossible to get a seat at this place.

The food is good though. I don't know how they marinate this chicken breat skewers to be so tasty and moist. White meat shouldn't be so flavourful!

The sea bass, i was not blown away for the price difference compared to the meat skewers.

My favorite appetizer is the fried eggplant. it has pieces of eggplant to spread onto hot pitas. Definitely think this is best of all the spreads.

The Lemonda is really good too. I really like the mint and lemon flavor together. It keeps separating though.

The service, i'm thinking they are just not staffed enough. They try their best to get you what you need.

What i did not like is when I made a reservation, it was fine. But then I receive this phone call about having a minimum order of $20pp. Now this really isn't all that hard here cause the prices aren't all that cheap. But the issue is their portions are BIG, so I may one day choose to order less food because I just can't finish it all and perhaps I don't want a drink. I don't think they should be asking for a min charge."}
{"text":"Orderd lamb combo and I asked 3 time to be cooked well done. After 20 mins waiting I got my lamb with blood inside. My experience is mutual but compared the prices you can get a dinner in high end restaurant with better service and seating.  Price for lamb combo with 1 pop around $23. What an expensive meal for low ended restaurant. Note: this chain of restaurants are casual I mean they are similar to the fast food chains."}
{"text":"Great portions size and yummy taste. I would definitely recommend the baba ghanouch, which is served with tasty flatbread as an appetizer. We ordered the grill platter to try the different meats as well as the kefta, both of which exceeded my expectations in terms of taste!! Would definitely come again and bring friends."}
{"text":"So I was looking for something similar to skewers, roasted potatoes, and greek style food, I decided to check out this place that seemed to be the rave on Urban Spoon. Luckily around 8pm, there was not line up and the air conditioning was blasting inside.

The waitress, who seemed like a part-timer was patient as we looked through a very extensive menu. The beer list had 3 different prices, but I'm not sure if it was self explanatory where that the numbers represent domestic, import and premium because I had no idea what was what.
Frankly, I'm not super big on meat but was happy to share the assortment of meat skewers while I got the chicken schwarma plate.

There were complimentary hot peppers and pickles to start which is something new to me. Two large pieces of bread and a very fresh salad also came and I felt like I was full then and there.

Despite the courteous service and the huge variety this place offers, I can say that I've had better food. At least my plate was not that great. The chicken was not in strips which would add a bit of moisture, but rather small chopped up pieces of dry, lackless chicken. The rice was very bland, and you would have to combine all the sauces that were given to you to get some sort of decent bite.

Not going to lie, my friend's plate of skewers were cooked very well, with the meats tender and the potatoes well roasted. The portions seemed rather big, although the presentation was very empty and the plates looked very bare with just skewers and rice. I didn't think the price was that great as I could definitely get better food at this price elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been going here since way back in the early 2000's when most of you were too young to even wipe your own butts.  This place when it was just its own place was the best of the best.  Since its chained out it has become so below average.  

I call this place the lottery shwarma.  If you win you get good tasting, moist shwarma.  If you lose you get dry, salty, and chewy pieces of chicken that feel like i'm eating my grandmothers calluses.  Its 50/50.  Now i'm a gambler and I like putting my money in this place and half the time is good.  Go all in and try the Moroccan cigars.  They are Yummy."}
{"text":"I love me va me, but this location is not my favourite. They constantly don't have enough servers hence the service is slow, you have to really chase them for the bill etc. I feel like their menu is a bit smaller than the one on Rutherford, and the food tastes worse too even though they use the same recipes. Overall the food is still good, but If you have extra 10 minutes drive to Bathurst  and Rutherford location."}
{"text":"Omg that's delicious! I'm a big fan of Mediterranean food and Everything I tried here was delicious. So far my favourites are spinach salad with goat cheese, appetizers variety plate (baba ganoush, hummus and 2 others), chicken on a stick, lamb schnitzel.

TO THE OWNERS: 
PLEASE CHANGE THE GOAT CHEESE RECIPE BACK TO WHAT IT USED TO BE. This new recipe does NOT taste good."}
{"text":"Overall a great place to eat and normally extremely tasty food. 2nd time there.  Chicken Shawarma was extremely oily (more then typical shawarma) and I would NOT recommend this to anyone yuck !"}
{"text":"I used to love the chicken schnitzel dinner at your location and the sister location. slow service and bad food is what we got yesterday, it took 40 minutes for us to get the waitress to get the bill.  yikes what happened?.  things are definitely not the same as when they first opened. the house salad was OK still, but not enough to compensate the overall poor experience"}
{"text":"We used to eat here very frequently, the food was delicious about 8 years ago, that's why we used to return, the last 3 times we had OK food, quality has gone down, last night we were in the area and decided to pop in for lunch, waitress gave us attitude, we asked for a table away from the entrance because it smelt like sewage in the front, she mouthed off and rolled her eyes, she said I have to clean, in a Russian accent, about to faint from the sewage feces smell combined with her attitude, we walked out. You lost an entire family as repeat customers. Not to mention you also ruined my baby shower in 2009 by giving me 10 orders short and left 15/45 guests hungry, thanks for the bread though, at least we got the right count there!"}
{"text":"Have not got a chance to try some more dishes due to I ate before I came, but a can pop costed me 3.95 plus tax, you know what to expect when you are really dinning. Nothing wrong with the quality whatsoever, it is just about whether you are ready for it or not."}
{"text":"A big favourite.  They are usually very busy so we tend to avoid peak hours.  You must try the baba ganoush and the aged beef skewers!  The beef is better than most steakhouses.  The portions are quite large so I would recommend ordering an appetizer and sharing an entree."}
{"text":"Stopped by the restaurant to try it out for lunch. For starters, it is equipped with a full bar, which was surprising for a Mediterranean place! I ordered the chicken shawarma on top of hummus, which came with freshly baked saj bread. The hummus was whipped to perfection, and the chicken on top was fresh and nicely grilled, served with sliced red onions. The plate was also accompanied by a small side of pickles for the table. Asking for extra bread to finish the large plate was no problem, as our waiter was extremely pleasant (she kept topping off our water at any chance). For desert, I ordered the famous Knafeh, which was a Mediterranean cheese pie served with syrup. It was absolutely delicious and highly authentic. The menu was full with many other Mediterranean food options, including many Israeli dishes and salads, which is new and refreshing. 

TLDR; Great place for hummus/fresh bread and knafeh, and probably shawarma!"}
{"text":"3.8***

Love this place! Been coming here with the fam since it opened and it's remained our go to Israeli/Middle Eastern food resto. 

The house salad is delicious, the babaganouj is the best, and the complimentary pita bread is light and squishy. I love the sundried tomato pesto chicken wrap. They have great chicken shawarma  as well, seasoned and marinated to deliciousness. Make sure you don't come too late though if your heart is set on the shawarma. 

They're mashed potatoes as a side to your meal is a MUST try....they are that good.

Overall, you can't really go wrong with this place. There is something yummi on the menu for everyone. Some of the meat entrees though can get a tad pricey imo....and that DELICIOUS shrimp birds nest salad which is like $17!! ahah

Though I am a sucker for delicious food at a dirt cheap price, this place will give you your money's worth, and it's great for just about any occasion."}
{"text":"If you want fast food.. this isnt the place. Food was a bit on the pricier side.

Cashier was friendly..food took about 10-15min to come out. Thats ok was still fresh.

The laffa Wrap is huge. not as mucb filling to choose from but was still delicious. Portion is big..and you will get full on just the wrap alone.

I had the greek salad.. was delicious.. tomatoes juicy..gets expensive once u add the chicken.. honestly the piece of chicken was small.

I enjoyed the food.but wont come as often.. unless I get the wrap alone."}
{"text":"I thought the food was delicious! Loved the shawarma and hummus! Yum. The restaurant atmosphere was nice casual and inviting. Good for groups with children as well. Food presentation was nice. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"DO NOT bother going if you're not one of their VIP's.  How do you know you're a VIP?  When you walk in, somebody will immediately recognize and greet you with a huge smile, then immediately prepare your order no matter how many people were patiently waiting BEFORE you.

The server had good intentions and recommended that we order the quickest item on the menu: shawarma in pita, in order to avoid the 15-20 min wait if we were to order other types of meats.  Ironically, because we weren't one of their family and friends customers, we sat, and sat, and stood, FOR 35 MINUTES, waiting for our SHAWARMA pitas.  We were starving by that time, so any food would have tasted delicious.  Too bad it left us with a bitter aftertaste with their favouritism towards their customers."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 star. The only reason my rating is so low is because I've watched this company grow over the years and increase their prices by 49-50%. 

With that said - ordered the hummus and mushroom plate. Amazing. The presentation was nice but the taste was even better. 

Lamb for my main. The portion has drastically shrunk. I mean let's be honest. A few years ago you'd get nice, meaty chunks of lamb. Now, meh, not so much. Pea sized cubes of meat leaving you to ask the question...'where's the rest of it'. 

At $20+ dollars, these business owners need to re-deliver some value to their customers. The reason I say \"Re\" is because they had it down to a science a few years ago. I think their eyes got greedy and sold out and cut the quality by half. 

The extra .5 is thanks to our amazing server who made the night amazing."}
{"text":"Great space with lots of seating and great food. Large sized portions, delicious food and good service."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant, however the last 3 occasions, the chicken shwarma has tasted different and not very nice. Also, the humus recipe must have changed, as  I no longer enjoy it. The service has also gone down hug. Think I will rather try one of the many other restaurants in the area from now on"}
{"text":"We were not impressed. Dips were not to our liking. our booth was dirty , seats were riooed"}
{"text":"I've gotten takeout multiple times from several other locations. When I noticed that they had a sit-down more upscale option we decided to give it a shot.
The food was as usual good. We got a platter of dips, came with fresh Laffa bread which was fantastic. We also got an order of perogies and falafels. 
Here's what killed it: service. The waitress was so out of it that its inexcusable. Sure, I've been to hole in the wall places where they have good food & service is non existent but you go in with that expectation. When I'm walking into a fully done restaurant with a hostess greeting us & menu with prices to match that, I expect a whole lot more than \"what do you want\" and \"here's the bill\".
Not even once did she come in to ask if we needed anything or how the food was. It was a total let down. 
I'm not going back here to sit down & eat again..I'll stick to getting take out from their express location next door."}
{"text":"Read this is as 4.5 stars. Ordered a whole bunch of food on a very busy night and everything was smooth sailing. The food was delicious. The lamb on hummus was pure delight. So creamy and the lamb was amazing as a topping. My entree of lamb kebabs was outstanding. Cooked as ordered and juicy and tender. My date's salmon was good but nothing special. But I bet if we ordered something else, it would be just as good as my lamb. Service was on point and fast! I was surprised at how fast the food came out given how many tables were there that night. .5 stars off because it is kinda pricey. Just my opinion. 4.5 stars with me returning for sure!"}
{"text":"The area immediately West and North of Steeles and Yonge is chock full of various businesses, both retail and service oriented. Over the past month I found myself in the neighbourhood on several of occasions. Experienced shoppers know that this dreaded pastime to some and cherished amongst others typically costs more and takes longer than one anticipates,. So, a brief pause to relax and satiate your hunger takes on an even greater appeal. 

Mi ve Ami Express fits the bill if it's an Israeli / Middle Eastern dishes are what you're seeking. I had their signature falafel sandwich twice in the last month and was pleased on both occasions. First, let's start with the \"wrapping\" aka the pita. Typically pitas are round in profile. However, their whole-wheat rendition comes in the shape and size of a 6\" sub except it's closed on two sides. Which means less leakage of toppings and sauce. The other advantage is that it's also less prone to falling apart unlike most other whole-wheat pitas on offer. 

On both occasions I had to wait, which is good thing. Meaning that the falafel balls were fried immediately after my order was placed and not sitting under a heat lamp. Or G_d forbid heated in a microwave oven as I once experienced in a downtown Toronto food court. Indeed these were crisp and crunchy even after being surrounded by a mix of salads and sauce. My veggie choices included their red cabbage cut into manageable bite size pieces, terrific eggplant, onions and pickles all of which made for a great combination. My choice of dips/sauces were the classic hummus, tahini and topped off with a heart warming hot sauce.

The establishment was meticulously clean which is as it should be but not always the case."}
{"text":"We went there for the 3 dip tray (it's incredible, baba ghanoush, egg plant, hummus), but they only give you 2 pieces of bread, absolutely not enough, and they charge for more. At the very least they should give 4 pieces.  Also, the restaurant is way too bright. But other than that, great concept and the food is great. The servers are incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"The high praises from other reviewers are real.  My friends and I experienced pretty much all the positive things other reviewers mentioned, with very little of the negative.

We ordered a trio dip plate, 2 laffa wraps, a grilled beef skewer, a grilled kefta (minced lamb sticks) and a knafeh dessert.  There was way too much food.  We had to take home one whole wrap and some dips.  The food quality was outstanding.  From flat bread to meat to dessert, the food was all fresh, flavourful and made with care.  There is no doubt in my mind that we will return just for the value and quality of the food.  

Our server was efficient, polite and knowledgeable.  One friend commented that the server was a little impatient with him when he was deciding whether to order fries or salad as side.  Other than that, the server was professional, and respectful.  We were given ketchup and extra napkins without asking.  There was a line of people waiting for table near the end of our meal.  We took quite a while to finish the dessert.  No one rushed us to pay the bill.

The interior is spacious.  The ambiance is casual, pleasant and contemporary."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times and in the past we did not have the best experience due to poor service. Happy to say we had great service this time around. Food was good as usual and it came out quickly. We shared the 3 dip appetizer (their hummus and baba ganoush are must orders) and the chicken breat skewers with mashed potato and house salad."}
{"text":"The interior is really cushy! Lots of booths and comfy seating! You order at the front and you get a number and they come and bring it to you. 
I got the laffa falafel wrap and my boyfriend got the grilled chicken wrap. About 10 plus tax for each I was expecting just a regular wrap but it's the size of a small child . Really great you get to choose from a variety of toppings and sauces and they have great sauce options. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a place that is consistently busy. Great food, large portions, delicious hummus and baba ganush.  This place has been a my family's favorite for many years.  The only downside is the line up but they have a location that is dedicated to take out nearby if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Dropped by more recently and it seems to me that food quality has gone downhill. Shawarma was incredibly dry, chicken breast skewer was mediocre, and falafel bordered on the dry side as well. Not very impressed. The hummus and baba ganoush were still good though. And serving sizes are still as massive as ever.

Came by on a Saturday night and was subjected to a 30-minute wait. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Me Va Me location. At some point, the Bathurst/Steeles location was also good, but my recent experiences there have left a lot to be desired, so I come to the Rutherford location instead now.

Portion sizes seem to have decreased slightly from what I last remember, and prices might have gone up a tad too. All things considered, still not a bad deal by any means. The food in the restaurant is excellent, and I like that they have refreshed the menu with additional offerings. To purists, this might not be a good thing, as they seem to be branching out with offerings that are not authentically Middle Eastern. One redeeming thing though is the addition of freshly made laffa (in a proper oven). Very cool - sometimes it's served so fresh that it's too hot to eat. Note that the food in the restaurant, for whatever reason, seems to be much better than the food in the Express location nextdoor.

Service in the restaurant is terrific. Responsive, efficient, courteous, and attentive. Servers should be commended."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I have to say this place is so good! 

Pros:
- Food: The food here is great and fresh. They give you 
- Service: The servers here are so friendly and nice. They tend to you quickly and always come by during the meal to make sure everything is okay. Feel free to ask them for recommendations. 
- Price: I think the prices are fair considering the amount of food you get. When I get the lamb chops it is about $17, but you get 3 lamb chops, 1 side and a salad. The salad itself is very big and 
- Parking: Tons of parking in the lot no matter what time it is. 
- Consistency: The food is always consistent overtime I come.  
- Decor: The decor in the restaurant here is so nice. They renovated a little while back and the restaurant looks great. 
- Spacious: I never feel like I'm crammed at my seat with my friends. Always tons of space in the booth or 

Cons:
- Chicken Options: Usually I get the lamb chops, but at times I decide to stray and try some of the chicken options. Unfortunately, all of the chicken options I've tried have been very dry. I'll be sticking to the lamb chops. 

Foods I like:
- House Salad (The sauce on the salad is so good. You can even buy some to take home.)
- Lamb Chops
- Mushroom Hummus Dip (The hummus here is made in house and so fresh!)


Overall, I love this place! It's on my list as one of my favourite places for Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Lunch Tuesday June 8 - group of three - excellent food, great value-for-money - large servings, very tasty. Service good."}
{"text":"Great value for the money.  Chicken on a skewer is fabulous..always had chicken breast, but switched to dark meat here since it is fabulous.  Fish is awesome as well.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of friends last week - we were about 12 people, and ended up waiting more than half an hour (for obvious reasons). 

We ordered a ton of dishes - including the salads (baba ganoush, hummus, marinated mushrooms) that all went very well with fresh toasted pita bread.

For my main - I had a 2-skewer order of lamb kebobs with rice. The meal was delicious (both meat and rice) - though the first skewer was a little more rare than I ordered (which was medium-rare). 

All in all, we had a delicious meal, and some of our party may have overindulged in the pita and salad to start (since we were so hungry and had waited for so long). It ended up as many to-go boxes across the table.

Would not hesitate to come back again!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for some delicious falafel, but don't feel like making the trip to the holy land, I go to one of the many mini-holy lands in the GTA:  Thornhill.

Luckily, this take-out location of Me Va Me is just around the corner from my mum's house, making it easy to sneak by whenever we are in the neighborhood.   The wait is never too long, and the food is freakin' delicious.  I've tried various falafel places in the city, but none measure up.  The food is fresh and the services is fast and efficient.  If you a vegetarian be sure to sample some delicious and fried-to-perfection falafel, carnivores will appreciate the melt-in-your-mouth shwarma.  The babaganoush, hummus, and chewy soft pittas round out your middle eastern delight (not to mention rounding out your mid-section).  

If you don't feel like waiting at the main restaurant and happen to be in the area it's definitely worth swinging by to see how real falafel should taste!"}
{"text":"Food is great!  Always fresh and fast - staff is nice too.   I eat then when i'm in  rush and it's always good."}
{"text":"Wish I could get their goat cheese salad (without feta) and laffa to go. Delicious. The baba ghanouj is great too."}
{"text":"I had food here before and it was pretty alright, but today when I visited, I was told to call ahead next time to order a shawarma. They said the wait was 30 minutes for a small order and 45 min for a large order. So, we took our business elsewhere and was glad that I did."}
{"text":"I frequently go to Me va me.

The food is top notch, and very fresh.

I bring my business associates here for meals.

Service is very friendly.  Food us well prepared, seasoned, and moist.

We split the Kefta, and an Israeli salad, hummus, and a shawarma.  That's s lot of food!

This is my favourite place to go for middle eastern/Israeli food.

The kefta was just about a touch of heaven.  Very moist and delicious.  The shawarma was moist, and the veggies were grilled perfectly.

The hummus is the main reason I come here though: silky and smooth.  It is really that good.

And the place is very clean!!"}
{"text":"Judging from the outside (which one shouldn't do!), I was expecting to walk into a simple, no frills type of place. I was surprised to walk into a very clean, well lit, and inviting, modern looking restaurant. I love how the kitchen is completely open to the dining area! If you must, you can watch your food being prepared and cooked by the chefs. We were greeted by a friendly, older gentleman who seated us in a cozy booth. We couldn't decide what to order, and he gave us some suggestions, letting us know their chicken schnitzel is a top seller. We decided on that and also lamb chops. Both meals came with a fair sized salad, consisting of baby spinach, red leaf lettuce, tomatoes, shredded beets and carrots. I don't know what was in the salad dressing, but it was seriously good! I normally avoid carrots, but I finished my salad, thanks to the dressing. Now for the entrees. I could see why the chicken schnitzel was a top seller: a huge filet of white chicken, fried in a light batter with sesame seeds. Very tasty and filling! Lamb chops were cooked perfect to order and had some aromatic spices rubbed on them. A very pleasant and positive dining experience!  I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I went there with my Israeli girlfriend, she is a regular there. The menu was quite typical for a middle-eastern restaurant, yet the quality of food was very good. I didn't like the service though, we waited for our meals for a very long time and there was no apology whatsoever from the waiter, in fact the guy was quite obnoxious. I may come there again, hopefully the service will be better."}
{"text":"All 4 times I have ordered delivery from this place they have messed up the order or had me wait 45 min to an hour longer than the promised delivery time (45 min to and hour). Not once has the food arrived under one hour and 45 minutes.I don't understand how in a matter of 3 years they still don't understand the simple concept of food delivery. This time is the last time I will be ordering. Mistakes can happen but 4 bad experiences in a row just means poor management and they just don't care. They were never apologetic for forgetting our orders and drinks just annoyed that they had to come back again (another 30 min later).The food is sub par not even close to the quality of the original location."}
{"text":"This is there newest location.
Bright and warm interior.
Tasty and fresh.
Well presented."}
{"text":"We had the 3 dips for appetizer which were absolutely amazing and then the lentil soup, chicken livers and shawarma for main course. Food was fresh, tasty and delicious! Staff was very friendly and efficient and the atmosphere and decor was very nice and inviting.

It was worth the wait!! Cant wait to go again! My new favorite!"}
{"text":"So many good things to say about this place! Always fresh and delicious. Their hummus and baba ganush (sorry if I didn't spell it right) is to die for! I tried their schnitzel and their sauce was sooo good. Love this place"}
{"text":"Typical middle eastern food. Very consistent but nothing wow. 
If I want to impress on the menu I don't come here. 
But the atmosphere is nicer than most places in the area. 
Family friendly and for business meetings."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. The meat is great, falafel is very good too. Our favorite is the humus with mushrooms, very nice. The meals are huge. Also they have good draft beers, nice selection of wine and cocktails."}
{"text":"This is the better location of all the Me-Va-Me's I've been too. The restaurant is very big, parking is plentiful, and this location specifically has both restaurant and a take out hub right beside it, so if you're not there to sit and dine, you can walk next door to their take-out area and order something to go. Be weary this place does get very busy and wait times are very long during holidays and weekends, ranging from 1 hour queue times or longer. When a place is that packed and that busy, you know it has to be THAT good."}
{"text":"This location in particular I've only been to once or twice. I much prefer the Bathurst and Rutherford location. As a vegetarian I only order the fallafel pita, it was done exceptionally well."}
{"text":"Okay where do I start... of course food, yeah, about that, how the fuck a shawarma plate has less ingredients than the shawarma sandwich? I mean I ordered a CHICKEN SHAWARMA, besides the two sides that you can choose, how the fuck a SHAWARMA doesn't even come with turnips, pickles, onions, etc ???? But for a shawarma sandwich you can choose all those ingredients. You can't call it a chicken shawarma by just giving you the salad and fries or whatever the sides you chose. It's just a chicken salad then no? So I asked the waitress for some turnips and pickles - it became such a major disaster... the waitress said she would get into trouble to give me those stuff like are you f*cking me. The lack of proper on-boarding and training of the staff is just so lame."}
{"text":"Well they upped their prices from the original Bathurst and Steeles location and created a more upscale, modern Me Va Me
The portions are always quite large, which is normal and expected for a middle eastern restaurant (like in Yummy Grill, Sofra Grill, etc)
The main entrees come with a salad and side
I had the chicken breast skewers with rice. The meat was nice and tender . The thing that annoyed me is that I ordered a lamb burger to go. Instead of them bringing it to me wrapped up, I had to exit the restaurant (after paying) and go to the \"Express\" side, which is a separate entrance. I had to wait for about 2-3 people ahead of me (even though I ordered the burger and it was waiting). Then I got my burger... by this time the fries were gross and soggy because they had been ordered earlier and were just sitting in a closed container collecting moisture (from the heat and water bubbles that were forming). Considering it was an extra $5 for those fries, I was NOT impressed
They also used a whole wheat bun without asking me and the bun was quite a bit larger than the burger. The \"Express\" side was such an inconvience. Next time I know (and you'll know too!) if I am eating inside and want something to go, I'll just order it to the table (as a meal) and get a to-go container before I leave."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Ordered minced lamb hummus, lamb cigars and chicken shawarma.   The only dish I didn't care for were the cigars"}
{"text":"I order from mevame twice a week not only because the food is amazing but the service I get is outstanding. David is always helpful when Ben isn't there. Their schnitzel is the best. lamb chops are a must try. Hummus is the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went for delivery 
Pros:
+ large portions
+ friendly service

Cons:
- not made for eating in.


Atmosphere: (3/5)
This is not a sit down place, it is only for take out.  There are bars stools and tables, but it is more for a single person eating rather than a group.  The place is clean and well lit.  The sides you can order with the meal and the toppings are displayed in front you. The view of the kitchen is open, so you can see what they are doing there.  .  

Service: (4.5/5)
We interacted only with the server (who took us to another cashier since there was a line), and the person who filled in our pittas.  Both were friendly and helpful.  The person who was filling in the pitas suggested a different order.  We waited for around 10 minutes for the food to be made.

Food: (5/5 stars)
We ordered two shawarma and one felafel.  For every one they gave us a choice of which toppings we wanted.  On everything we put on tahini sauce, humus, babaganush, eggplant salad, lettuce and tomatoes. It cost $21 with tax. 
The portions were large and tasty.  Would recommend it when you want to eat a large portion for decent prices. 


I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a large tasty meal to eat at home.  I would not recommend to eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"***This location is Express, so it's mainly for takeout.  There is only counter seating, no tables or waiter service.***

After years of my last visit - it's definitely NOT in my 'hood - I was glad that I dropped by again!  Apparently the non-Express has changed owners a few times within the last few years and their dine-in service was hit 'n miss.  

(I had one server tell me that they didn't serve baguettes, but they had pitas due to Passover.  Obviously, I'm not a Jew, but if you're trying to keep Kosher by not serving baguettes, you wouldn't serve pitas either!  Another time, I observed that only certain diners would get the basket of pickles/pitas while my table was overlooked.)  

So if it's just for casual dining, I'd just prefer to skip the more 'miss' service than deal with any slightly discriminatory attitudes.

Onto the Express...
Me Va Me is Middle Eastern/Sephardic food with delicious sides + sauces.  I especially loved their hot sauce which you can get...on the side.

The Chicken Schnitzel itself was HUGE, slightly under seasoned, but beautifully fried.  Fries were good, very crispy, even as a takeout.  Dinner portion was enough for 2+ppl to share!  

I ordered a Lamb Burger, but they didn't have any, so I ordered the skewer in a baguette instead.  Baguette was the size of a foot long!  I dunno what it's called, but it's a topping that has chunks of eggplant in it, GET THAT FOR SURE!  It's delicious.

Lamb was a bit cold by the time I ate it.  Not sure if the cold, salad toppings cooled it off, but it wasn't the softest, but still good, especially due to the bread + yummy toppings.  If you're gonna order it, it may help to eat it ASAP!"}
{"text":"What stops me from giving this place a full 4*s that the food truly deserves is the inconsistent service.  Depending on who serves you, your experience will vary greatly.

On my most recent visit, the server was alright, but I had to ask her to give me ketchup - I was having a lamb burger + fries, so I expect condiments to arrive with the food.  Bf had to ask for more laffa.  Servers just seemed busy, rushing by tables, and didn't seem to have time to stop by, check-in, etc.  

So just expect that level of service if you're dining in.

Portions are on-par with price.  Lamb burger + side was just under $12, but pretty huge.  1 Chicken skewer seemed small when it arrived, but then I remembered that the salad it came with, arrived prior to the skewer, so plating wasn't that impressive.

The eggplant \"salad/dip/sauce\" whatever it is, is a MUST-ORDER!"}
{"text":"Super quick place to grab some lunch !! They have the basics : salads, sandwiches and Lafa wraps. Everything is fresh and delish!!"}
{"text":"Walking in... I thought for sure 2 stars maybe 3. But I was pleasantly surprised!!!! My table of 3 ordered the rainbow trout dinner with rice and a chicken shawarma dinner with rice. All were delicious tasty and FRESH!!! Also did I mention huge portions. Their house salad is meh... But their Laffa bread is soooooo fluffy and fresh! I'll be honest... Usually the service sucks and I swear I'd never come back but I swear there's an angel who works there her name is MARINA And she was incredible. I told her that we were in a rush and she was so diligent and polite. She kept checking on us and making sure we were good. Best service. I'll only come back if she is our server."}
{"text":"Definitely a good selection for Middle Eastern.

I usually end up getting their falafels and the selection of stuffing you can add to it is wide and delicious.

I haven't tried the rest of the menu but the falafels are great."}
{"text":"We just stumbled across this place happened to be in the area and popped in never been to one of them before. Really really enjoyed it had the chicken shawarma with grilled vegetables and Caesar salad everything tasted amazing also tried the falafels not to be disappointed I recommend it. And remember the portions are actually really big"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a tasty hummus.....this is the place for that! The dips are served with homemade, hot and fresh pita bread. I tried the lamb dinner that came with grilled veggies and salad. The soups and sandwiches are also very good."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The hummus tastes just as good as mine. Everything on the menu that I tried so far is very tasty. The service is great and its affordable. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Me Va Me is one of my go-to Middle Eastern spots. What keeps me coming back? The freshly-made laffa, best paired with their delicious dips! Baba ganoush and fried eggplant are my favourites. I usually get the combo dip platter (3 dips) which is enough to be considered a meal on it's own. 

Of course, they also have other dishes. The shawarma, kebab, and schnitzel dinners are safe options, though I find their mains to be hit or miss most times. Plus, their dinners come with the house salad. No need to upgrade this one, the house salad is great!"}
{"text":"About a 3.5 very close to a 4. 

The portions were a decent size and we were absolutely full after the meal. We didn't have any problems w/ service but that might be due to the waitress seeing I was on the smartphone looking at Yelp reviews. Hey if that helps with service go for it lol We got our dishes quite quickly. The line up during rush hour was definitely nutty. I believe we waited about 20 mins or so. Reservations is permitted but there was a minimum spending (which most will prob meet). 

We ordered the...

Falafel (app): nothing special but only because we are not huge herb fans.

Smoke salmon (app): loved this ... it was very nice and fresh. It was probably our favourite dish. 

Skewers platter (forgot the name): It had beef, lamb , chicken skewers. The meat was very tender with the exception of the beef (a little hard to chew). 

Bellini: my god.. don't even bother w/ this drink here. the size was so small and the drink was $ 8 smth !! 

Freebie: We got a dish of nan/pita bread (a bit dry... no sauce ? ) and a plate of pickles. No no... no pickles for me ! used to work at a pickle factory a decade + ago. As well as a plate of salad. 

We would definitely come back again though and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Chicks dark skewers r awesome. And also don't forgot pita w dips. My favorite is bubba ganush or just the hummus. Everything else is decent too. Service not the best but it's decent decor and fresh food."}
{"text":"This place is quite popular with my Toronto friends... with cheap prices, huge portions, and cute staff, it's no wonder this Israeli joint is a bright spot in the otherwise dull, suburban shtetl of Thornhill.

I highly recommend the schnitzel (it was enough for two), but the mashed potatoes are served cold (boo!). Otherwise, a good budget Mediterranean, with lean but up-to-date ambiance."}
{"text":"Food vice the place downgraded a lot for the past few years. Overall OK . Wouldn't recommend to order  there shish kabobs or lamb chops."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken shawarma in a laffa and it's super filling when a snack isn't enough but you're not quite ready for a meal yet. On the go, before a quick stop at a Timmy's drive thru down the street for a latte and BOoooOooom! Lunch is driving away the winter blues.

For $11, it's a little more pricey than your average shawarma but much more shazam with a variety of sauces, but definitely a treat whenever you feel you deserve one, so the question is.... do you? 
Now go do you and splurge on!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to this resto since TIIIMMEE!! AND I must say the reason is because of their amazing house salad drizzled in their heavenly home made italian dressing, with perfectly sliced swirls of carrots and beets. Unlimited pita bread (also available in whole wheat) which comes nice and warm while you wait for your main. I suggest you order it with hummus and chili. This mini entree usually comes along with the main dishes like pork or chicken $15) souvlaki with your choice of rice or fries, steam veggies etc. 
The rice is moist and cooked to perfection. Fries are crispy too and not like your normal stale restaurant onces, drenched in oil and almost no flavor.

Dad had the Basa Florentine which I think did not have enough of the fish, which was disappointing, however their souvlakis never fail to impress and fill a hungry tummy.
Their burger meat was tough and too much sauce, it literally soaked the bread and by the time we got home, my leftover was no longer edible!

Staff is always friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Having read the reviews of all locations, we opted for this one out of convenience.  I don't know why this location has lower reviews than the other locations, although I haven't been to the others yet.  This location was great, the service was quick, the food was hot and fresh.

Being Father's Day, we expected most places to be busy, this place seemed prepared for the onslaught of dinner patrons though.  We started with the hummus appetizer, it came out quick and was nice and creamy and had nice flavour. I did find it odd that the laffa seemed nice and doughy on the edges, but thin and over cooked in the middle, as they were all coming out this way i assume thats how it's supposed to be.  I ordered the chicken shawarma and the portion was huge, and the meat was juicy, and cooked perfectly, the roasted potatoes were slightly over seasoned for my preference, but good nonetheless.

The service was fast and friendly, we never had to ask for anything or try to catch the attention of servers, they were on top of everything, and made our visit a pleasant experience, which we look forward to."}
{"text":"So confused and kind of outraged... so many things went wrong here but the staff seem SO clueless that it feels like it would be a waste of time to even tell them about it. 

First off, when we saw on the menu that there were pitchers for beer, so we asked to have a pitcher. The cashier told us there were no pitchers... and that there were only \"pin-t\"s. So we ordered 4 pints (which costed much more than a pitcher). Later on after we were seated, we finished the beer and asked another waitress for a pitcher and got it. So we were basically ripped off the first time.

Now it gets even worse. The chicken shawarma wrap ($11), lets you pick from a variety of vegetable toppings and sauces. The chicken shawarma BOX ($16) apparently comes with just chicken, 2 sides and a little jar of tahini sauce. How is that possible, the boxes had pretty much no flavor (as you'd expect without any toppings).. and when we asked for some turnips and pickles the waitress was reluctant to give it to us. How is it possible you get all that with a wrap, but can't even ask for toppings for the more expensive shawarma box? Is it even a shawarma? It sucked. 

The service was unbelievably slow and the shawarma box with nothing on it was so disappointing. It was also awkward they were all pronouncing pints wrong and weren't all aware that they offered pitchers even though it was printed on their menu. 

We really should have went to McDonald's across the street..."}
{"text":"The Best place for Israeli/Middle Eastern Food FOR SURE!!!  Everything I had here was delicious.  Only bad rating is their French fries are not so good and the rice is plain.  I prefer more flavour and spice in my rice and if and when I order French fries, I like them less of a cardboard. ;) Tons of other side options though.

The meat - VERY GOOD!  Huge portions, great salads, great everything else."}
{"text":"Me Va Me is a great place for lunch or dinner. Prices for their lunch specials are good (~$10) and the portions are huge!

If you don't get the lunch specials, your meal might get a bit pricey for lunch (Think $16+tax/tip), but you do get a lot for what you paid for. I usually get the 2 chicken skewers with rice, and it comes with a decent sized salad, and I would have a whole skewer left with rice for another meal.

Decor-wise, I think they could definitely use some renos. Service can be hit or miss here.

Overall, Me Va Me is an OK place."}
{"text":"Wow what a great dinner. Food was excellent, service ok, and it has plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Love the decor of this new place.  I think the look of the restaurant is getting better and better with each update.

The food looked great and the garden salads that I saw people order were baby spinach mixes with a nice variety of veggies - everything look very fresh.

I had the chicken pesto wrap which was very fresh and tasty.. I upgraded to a greek salad as my side.. I wish that there was more salad that came with my wrap as the amount of salad was skimpy."}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel like the service is taking longer than expected but they deliver great value routinely. It's one of my favorite local places. 

I hope they partner with a delivery service so I can order in."}
{"text":"I hate writing this review as I love Me Va Me. It's just this particular location where I have been consistently disappointed. 

The first time I was here I ordered the lamb with a side of seasoned veg. I ordered the lamb rare. It came to the table beyond well done. I might be a bit of a food snob but I couldn't eat it. To add insult to injury the seasoned veg has pieces of thyme stem in it. I felt like I was eating wood. When I mentioned it to the manager she first seemed alarmed and after speaking with kitchen assured me that's how the dish was meant to be made. 

The second time I went I had a similar situation. I went in for a shawarma with my brother (they do make excellent shawarma) but they were sold out. I mentioned that last time I ordered the lamb it was over cooked. My server (who was genuinely amazing) assured me that it would be prepared to my taste. This time when it came out, the entire piece was well done aside from the very centre the size of my pinky finger which was completely raw. They clearly took that piece of meet right out of the freezer and slapped it directly onto the grill. 

They took back the lamb and substituted it for a shnitzel instead. I took two bites and couldn't eat it. I have never had chicken that actually was textured like rubber. I don't even know how they did that. 

My server was amazing about the entire thing and was extremely accomodating. They only charged me for the sides and drink I had rather than the full meal (granted I didn't eat it). I in turn tipped the rest of the cost of the meal to the server as shouldnt have to pay for the crap experience the kitchen provided.

I want to highlight that I've been to several other of their locations and they are all fabulous and would highly recommend them. Their shawrma is excellent"}
{"text":"Good food. Long waits.

Thank goodness they will deliver at some locations.

I enjoy the humus and shawarma.

This franchise is a favorite of the local Arab and Jewish communities.

Be prepared for a louder than normal atmosphere.

I would recommend take-out. Significantly less stressful."}
{"text":"Love this place. The portions are plentiful, the atmosphere is calm and cozy, the prices are just right. The Me Va Me on Queen street in downtown just isn't the same. The best part about Me Va Me is that they bring the pickles before you even order anything, and the laffa bread + their house salad shortly after you place the order. If you're starving, you'll be eating at least something within minutes of getting your seat.

My only disappointment with it lately is that they started to slowly change their menu to accommodate a broader clientele. This means that \"exotic\" menu items, like my favorite \"Jerusalem Mix\", were dropped from the menu.

Still, even with what's the menu, this place is still a go-to destination. Their chicken shawarma still rivals everything else in the city."}
{"text":"Great food, especially the vegetables! Been here twice. 

First time I had the chicken schnitzel dinner but felt it was okay, nothing special. 

This time I offered the Kefta dinner with a side of 1/2 fries and 1/2 rice. (My amount of fries was equal to the person in front of us who just got fries, I recommend asking for both!). I shared some of the chicken shawarma dinner and falafel dinner with my friends. They were all great but the falafels were the BEST. The side of grilled vegetables with the falafel was good but the fries were better. 

The salads that come with the dinner is amazing. It's different compared to most places. Also ordered a side of chicken shawarma on hummus and it was really good. Better than the regular hummus I got last time. It seems like it's not worth it for the price, but trust me, it is worth it. Very filling. 

Would have given it 5 stars if the waiter didn't take so long to take our orders. (They took two other guests' orders before taking ours). Also, had to ask to exchange my eating utensils for cleaner ones twice. 

Great ambiance indoors. Outdoors is okay with good company, view isn't that great.

Kefta dinner and 1/3 of chicken shawarma on hummus total was $28.09. (Chicken shawarma dinner was same price as Kefta. Falafel was cheaper.)"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  I usually get a hummus and something (chicken or mushroom or ...) as an entree.  The appetizer trio is also great because you can choose from a selection of hummus and it comes with some bread for dipping.  

The decor and ambience for this location is great but it can get busy in the evenings especially Thursdays thru Saturday."}
{"text":"It was my FIRST time ever here last night and I can say that the food is filling. Like SO FILLING!! I ordered a Greek salad with a side of chicken shawarma and it was filling to my stomach! I can definitely say that the food here is delicious and that the portion sizes are huge. It may be pricey but you come out leaving with food in your hands.

Lastly, the service was good! Our waiter kept coming by asking me if I wanted more water.  I guess water is very important haha."}
{"text":"Always a great go to place when you have friends/ family out of The GTA visiting.. Their menu selection is huge and there's something for everyone from vegetarians to the health conscious. I've probably introduced over 50people to Me va me.. The portions are good and the flavours are just amazing. I love their house salad and dressing which comes with most of their entrees. I also usually order the rainbow trout with rice. Their snitzels and kefta lamb dinners are also a few of my other favourites.. I wish they would allow for 1/2 and 1/2 sides again like they used to though, not sure of the reasoning for taking that option out, but I'm still a fan of their food and the pricing is very fair for their quality of food. 

They also serve fresh bread made from their special oven.. So order a dip and enjoy a shared appetizer to go with the bread!

Ps. They also have a few express kitchen locations that specialize in take out. I've been seeing more and more locations sprout up in the GTA but still love giving this specific location a visit due to menu differences.."}
{"text":"Food is still great here at Me Va Me. I've noticed portions have gotten smaller, as they are not so ridiculously large anymore. But they are still more generous than other restaurants & their good still tastes amazing! Waitstaff service is also still great as well.  Their red velvet cake makes me melt. LOL."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger (don't remember which type, it was months ago) with salad side dish. I got a super big plate, totally disproportionate to what was inside. They seemed to be out of plates... Burger was drenched in oil. As I picked it, oil drips onto the plate from bottom half of the bun. Taste was OK though, but having that much oil was not.

The restaurant appearance looks like a warehouse. Not good at all."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the original Me Va Me many many times until a few months ago. On my last visit I saw 2-3 small bugs (cockroach type) on the floor near my table. The eat-in location right at Steeles/Bathurst was finished for me. Despite my family's love of the place, I opt out when they decide they are going to eat there. The food was very good but I can't stomach eating a restaurant where I blatantly saw a bug infestation in the dining room. To top it off, the wait-staff is hit/miss. I still frequent the take-out location on Steeles for my shawarma fix (best I've had in the area) and await a chance to try their new eat-in/take-out location at Bathurst/Rutherford which is still (after several months) not open!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was extremely busy even tho we had no reservation on a wed night it was didnt have to wait too long, 10 mins maybe?
Nice decent portions! Like how all entrees come with a salad first followed by the main & potato/rice side! 
Awesome fresh naan bread! The dips were pretty amazing! Esp the eggplant ones! 
Will def come back to try their shawarma! 
Server was nice! She messed up on the trio dip and gave us hummus instead of this green eggplant (we got 3 Trios of eggplant dip) when she checked her notepad and realized she quickly went back to gave us the correct dip! So we ended up getting to try their hummus on the house! The hummus was heavy in tahini! Preferred the eggplant dip better! 
Had the salmon-a tad bit on the fishy side! Best stick with the meat dishes like the chicken schnitzel or meat skewers! 
Overall good price and good service!"}
{"text":"Good food, solid service, the portions are huge so our perfect order for 2 is: 
One main course which comes with a pretty big salad and a side order (you can order another side for a couple of dollars) and a combo of 4 salads (2 hummus, baba ganush and mushrooms).
Favourite main courses: Shawarma (only in lunch hours when its the freshest), Chicken dark meet and lamb chops. 
Will also recommend their Moroccan spicy cigars and their fruit smoothies are very refreshing although full of sugar."}
{"text":"The tasty chicken schnitzel with their awesome lemonana. Yummy!! NOTE to the owner: please bring back the Jerusalem Mix, pleaseeee."}
{"text":"In spite of a name that sounds like an ABBA song, Me Va Me is a super popular Israeli restaurant.

This place is so popular that on the Saturday night we visited, our party of four had about a 45 minute wait (despite being told it would be 30 minutes). Unfortunately, seats are few and far between in the waiting area so we ended up in the drafty alcove between the front door and the second door to the restaurant. The host didn't call names to our area so my mother in law had to stand by herself next to the host stand for 45 minutes while we stayed with my grandmother in law (is that even the correct term?) who needed to sit.

My husband's family is such a fan of this place that his grandfather's 90th birthday celebration with 50 people was held here.

We shared an appetizer combo ($11) with our choice of five apps. We chose hummus for two of those (who can go wrong with \"yummus\"?), baba ganoosh, fried eggplant, and a Turkish eggplant/roasted red pepper dish I'd never heard of (something like \"metahba\"). I wasn't a fan of the whipped texture of the hummus but it had good flavor. The baba g was only OK. The big winner was the fried eggplant, which didn't taste fried - more like a cold eggplant roasted red pepper dish. The metahba was very similar to the fried eggplant and was also good. My husband who previously was an eggplant scaredy-cat because of its texture was an eggplant convert after the appetizers.

Between the apps and complimentary plate of pickles, I was almost full by the time my entrée came. I had a simple plate of pierogies ($8) from the appetizer menu. They came with carmelized onions and sour cream (and maybe apple sauce?), and were tasty, though way too oily. My husband had a chicken skewer ($12?) that was ridiculously huge. He made his way through about 1/3 of it. I think he preferred the apps to his entree, as did I.

The portions were huge and I took half the remaining appetizers with me to our room. I ate them again many times for late night snacks and breakfasts."}
{"text":"Their quality started to decline about a year ago, every time it is worse than before. Yesterday we ordered delivery, not only it took more than an hour, but the food was a real disappointment. We got chicken sishkebob with their Israeli salad (cubed tomatoes and cucumbers with house dressing) and the combo of 4 Israeli favorites: baba ganoush, fried eggplants, humus and pickled mushrooms. Out of all that only the kebob was edible. The rice was too dry, they completely screwed up the salad dressing, it was ultra lemony and runny, Israeli combo was tasteless, baba ganoush was plain old. Finally lesson learned: never again!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I think that Bathurst Street should be re-named Shawarma Avenue for the sheer volume of Meditteranean restaurants along this stretch of road.

Me Va Me is a fine example of the genre. The menu features big, bold flavours, heavy on healthy salads and grilled items, and of course the spectacle of giant hunks of meat roasting on spits. 

Appetizers range from old school hummus and assorted mediterranean dips served with fresh-grilled pitas, to more esoteric and modern fare. Smoked salmon on potato pancake sounds intriguing, but unless you're an eggplant junkie you can skip them all. Mains come with a meal-sized garden salad slicked by an addictive, vaguely citrusy dressing. Spend a few bucks and upgrade to a greek salad that features briny olives and satisfying feta cubes. 

Is there anything more carnivorously appealing than a rotisserie? Is there a better site than watching one sabre off slivers of crisp roasted flesh off the pile, and hurry them to your plate still jumping from the heat? I speak of the chicken shawarma here; tender, marinated dark meat heavy on the cumin, sided with your choice of veg and starch. 

For health's sake, I usually split my sides between surprisingly capable and crunchy sauteed veg and fluffy basmati rice. French fries sound good, but they're the batter coated kind, which I view as cheating. Mixed with the meat and what I can only call Israeli chalet sauce, it gives the city's best poutine a run for its money. Mashed potatoes are not, to the best of my knowledge, a staple of the region. One one night, they're delicious thanks to the addition of tonnes of dairy. On another, they're at once soupy and chunky for want of more mashing and less cream. 

If the rotisserie makes your head spin, you can always order your protein skewered and grilled. It's a bit less consistent, and occasionally overdone, but salmon or chicken breast appeal to the most conservative diner. If you really feel naughty, choose the schnitzel; a pounded chicken breast the size of a baseball glove. Simple food, huge portions, decent value. I'm sure that the fancy stuff is good, too. I've never seen anyone order it.  

If you're a regular, and speak the language, service is warm and friendly. Until you get to that point, it can be brusque and occasionally rude. Think of it as a chance to practice your people skills. 

Coffee is decent, although they're pretty slow on the refills. 

Thornhill woods may be a wilderness, but at least there's some signs of civilization."}
{"text":"Nice place, abet pricey . But worth the try for the Middle East food lovers. And please clean your tables better ."}
{"text":"Great service, clean atmosphere, and most importantly, amazing food. 

We ordered Minced Lamb on Hummus, Chicken Shwarma wrap, and Lemonada.
Large portions for the value which will fill you up. 

Definitely my new favourite restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This Me Va Me is ok.  I actually expected more because I hear some good things about it but there are some things that are a bit lacking.

Not sure if it was the day we were there, but service was slow. The restaurant was busy but not full.  Despite four open tables that could seat a party of four, our party of three (two adults and one child) was made to wait a good ten minutes. I really have no idea why the wait was required as people who came in right after we were seated were taken to their tables immediately. 

Food wise, their cold dips/apps are ok.  We had the combo of three: the cold fried eggplant was the best as it was in a rich and flavourful sauce, the hummus was standard but the tabouli was pretty bad as it really lacked any flavour (wondering if they forgot to put in lemon juice of vinegar.)

My wife had the chicken shawarma in a pita.  It was ok, nothing to rave about. 

I had the lamb skewers with french fries.  The lamb was under seasoned and was accompanied by a weird bbq sauce that seemed very non-middle eastern.  The fries were limp and oily.  Oil temperature in the fryer was definitely too low.

Perhaps other locations are better, as I've had OMGOB.com deliver to the office a much better chicken shawarma in a pita that what we had here."}
{"text":"I came here about 2 years ago.  

The reason I am giving a 1 star is, when I tried to take a picture of the menu (that's for my food photography), the servers told me 'cameras are not allowed'.  So, where do all these pictures come from??

The food itself is good but I will not return because of this.  I did not have a chance to take any pictures of the food too.  Why do they allow other people to take pics then?"}
{"text":"Had to wait for 40 mins to have our food ready, bad service, two cooks who seems they have no clue what they are doing. Wont coming back"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent when we ordered take-out a few days ago. 

The three stars is mostly due to value for your money. We ordered a chicken skewer platter that came with rice and a side salad, as well as a greek salad with grilled salmon. Bill came to $38. Wayyyy too much for takeout imo. For this price I rather we go to a sit down dinner and we probably would have received more food for that price tag.

The greek salad was ok but not very greek. Fresh lettuce and veggies but they went really light on the veggies and the feta. Salmon portion was small and not enough dressing for the salad.

Chicken and rice were decent but dry and no sauce was included. Should come with a hummus or something as this dish greatly needed some moisture.

Won't go back. Food was good and fresh but small portions and big bill. There are way too many other alternatives that surpass this place."}
{"text":"Brig appetite breaker and delicious mideast food. Sometimes service runs in slow motion pace. Other times it faster than usual. Don't ask me why?"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to \"Me Va Me\" (\"Who's Who\" in Hebrew) in about two years and decided to have a Friday night meal there with my son and daughter-in law who was taking me out for an early Mother's day. We ate on the patio and because the sun was going down it was breezy and lovely to sit outside.
We all loved our meals.The chicken skewers were yummy and I loved the salad that came with it,although my daughter-in-law would have liked more greens. The chicken shwarma was enough for two people. Our server was friendly even though it was quite busy being Friday dinnertime. After having had very unpleasant eating experiences at the Pickle Barrel and even on the Danforth, it was a pleasure to have a delicious meal here with freshly made food,good service and reasonable prices. As my son jokingly said,this is our new \"go to eatery.\" Next time I will try the chicken schnitzel and some dips. By the way,the pita/flatbread served at every table is the best I have eaten anywhere,warm & soft inside & crispy outside..to die for. It is addictive so save room for the main meal."}
{"text":"Food is great here. We especially love their dips and grilled skewers. But service is pretty awful most of the time. I had once a server refusing to give more pita because we had a quarter slice left in our basket then she reluctantly throws one later into our basket, made our overall experience awful, who throws food at their customers. They need some serious training of their servers. However I give full credits to the cook behind the line who bring out amazing dishes. I keep coming back once in a while for their babgaboush."}
{"text":"A Persian coworker highly suggested this place so decided to check it out. Oh wow, the crowd in this place got me even more excited. However, after I tried the food I don't get the hype at all. We ordered their Moroccan Cigars, lamb chops, grilled beef pita and chicken pita. With the exception of the lamb chop which my friend found amazing because of the superior meat quality, we found the rest of the food a shame to Mediterranean cuisine. 
Spending most of my earlier years growing up in the Middle East, I know my Shawarma's and other middle eastern cuisine well and have enhanced taste buds for the same.  Given the size of their pita and generous fillings I had high hopes but we were all very, very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"This location of MeVaMe used to be pretty old and run down looking.  But to my surprise when I walked near the door, I saw they did some renovations, and was looking pretty good now.  Also to my surprise, they now have laffas!  I love laffas.  If you don't know what they are, the way that I would describe it would be that it's a cross between a pita and a roti.  I ordered a falafel laffa and the hubby ordered a chicken shawarma laffa.  I've had laffas before, but I forgot how big they actually are..... I was only able to eat half!  The laffa bread itself was delicious, freshly made.  The falafel, I actually prefer the ones from Sababa down the street more.  The falafel at MeVaMe was a bit too wet for my liking.  It wasn't wet as in soggy, because the outside was nice and crispy, but the inside was mushy like.  The chicken shawarma was delicious, the meat had the crispy bits from rotating on the grill.  I wish I had taken better pictures of the insides....."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss on both Quality and Service levels.
It's the only location that I go to, since it opened few years ago, because it is closer to me than the original location so it's very convenient to get to last minute.

The convenience of the express section is great for pick up quick orders,  and offering delivery in that area is definitely a plus.

But when it comes to quality, it really differs every time, sometimes you can tell that it is all fresh and perfectly cooked and taste simply delicious, where at some other times it is barely anything on the plate with blah taste and very mediocre quality.

That being said, consistency of taste and quality is key to any restaurant success.
I I usually get the chicken schnitzel, hummus with chicken Shawarma, bbq beef or lamb skewers and other classics from the Mediterranean cuisine.

Again, when they are on their A game, the delivery of the final product is superb, but when they are not, you are better off with a fast food wrap from anywhere else around and save yourself major dollars.

For all what it's worth, me va me is a good family restaurant, with friendly staff 'most of the time', and with some nice selections on the menu and good authentic flavors, when done correctly"}
{"text":"The food is good, however, when we wanted to have my birthday dinner there, they demanded every single person spend at least $24. As some people attending were kids, this is unreasonable. If you want to host a dinner party of more than 10, don't even bother. Apparently, they think every person who comes through the door is going to spend at least $24 a person - which is not true. They wouldn't even be reasonable on the issue. Totally stubborn. They are not the only food of it's kind in the area, we will be going to more hospitable locations from now on."}
{"text":"Great place, do takeout every couple of weeks and everything on their menu is delicious. Staff can be a bit rushed and rude, but comes with the busy territory I guess."}
{"text":"Whether you get something from their take-out store, or from the restaurant... you get the same quality, hot, fresh, tasty food choices and toppings... all fresh and tasty!  I tried so many things... from Moroccon Cigars, to falafels and shawarma, to the Jerusalem mix sandwich.. so darn tasty!!! to the schnitzel... NEVER been disappointed.  ALWAYS fresh, hot, tasty and generous portions.  Keep up the great work!  See you again soon."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I have ever gotten at this location!
Now I remember why I stopped coming here.
My mom and I came on a Tuesday night for a fast dinner at around 7pm. There was no hostess and the waitresses were running around like chickens with their head cut off.
There was only 1 chef and nobody at the bar making drinks.
Finally someone came and sat is down.. the place was jam packed!
Nobody brought us cutlery or napkins. 
Took 10 minutes to take our order and bring drinks ..
Took another 15 min to bring a salad and than finally my falafel came..
We had no service at all..
Nobody cared.
It was way to busy for them to even stop to check how we were doing.
I was fed up and packed everything to go..
Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Me Va Me for at least 5 years now and this is my favourite location!

The food is fresh, fast and delicious! 
If your in the mood for chicken or steak kabob this is the place to go! 
I love the falafel dinner with the house salad. Something about the dressing on the house salad is to die for! You can't eat Me Va Me with out getting the house salad and the hummus! 

Always order the hummus to start because they will be bringing your fresh Lafa bread all night long. They hand make it for every order so it's always hot!

Make sure you have reservations because it's always packed with locals. The wait could be anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here at this location for several years until the Markham VIP location opened up another franchise. For a year we been going to the new location and find the quality isn't the same as this one. But today we decided to come back to this location even it is a bit farther, just to find out that even this location the the quality and service was way off. Salad is going bad, service wasn't there for over 15mins until we ask for service (no water, no utensils).  We can see that our salad was at the serve counter for sometimes, and it wasn't brought to us until our main Course was ready. and they serve our main Course literally during salad. Do they expect us to eat our main course cold......it really was a favourite place before."}
{"text":"Very good place for middle eastern food. The plates are huge, worth for sharing. Food is very tasty, and they very an amazing pita bread for appetizer!! The chicken schnitzel is very good!!"}
{"text":"I really heard good things about this place, so perhaps my expectations were elevated, but I'll admit that all 3 of us who had a late lunch here were \"unimpressed\".
We arrived on a Sunday afternoon at 3. The place was quiet. We stood and perused the menu while trying to decide what to get. The cashier was friendly and explained items to us.
My niece opted for the shwarma box..with fries and a Caesar salad. $17.95
I opted for the shwarma box, with aged basmati rice and a Me salad. $16.95
The 3rd person opted for a hot sampler...3 different items that included 2 falafel, 2 Moroccon rolls and 2 items that looked like spanikopita. $8.95
The food, while expensive is just average. The two of us who ordered the shwarmas were given Tahini...a more logical choice would have been a garlic spread. The Tahini added nothing to the new. The chicken was VERY dry (I thought it was day old chicken it was so dry). My Me salad was good...basmati rice excellent.
The person who ordered the sampler wasn't too impressed either. He said it was good...just not $8.95 good.
All 3 of agreed that value for money is lacking. There's better places to go.
All 3 of us said we'd not return."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that this USED to be my most favourite Shawarma in the whole wide world.  What with their large dinner portion of chicken and rice which used to cost $12, now a ridiculous $18. What gives???  Nothing changed for the price increase!! Anyway, I gave it one more try and tried the chicken Laffa, a naan-like bread which they make in these two large ovens. It actually tasted good, except for the Shawarma inside. Nothing special.  I think the chicken tastes good only with the overpriced dinner, which I will never buy since there are a few options close to my house in Mississauga for $10-$12. Anyway, I would no longer recommend it, except that I used to go there when I was younger and lived nearby."}
{"text":"I love the food! Sadly this is where my enthusiasm ends. The prices are okay. But my real problem about this place is their service! Every single time I come here the service is horrible. Whenever I ask for more bread or pickles the servers always look annoyed and gives me dirty looks. The only reason I keep coming here is their food and it's only on certain occasions."}
{"text":"was waiting for my husband and saw a ton of people going in here. I thought it was vietnamese but it turns out its middle eastern. ordered two pita shwarmas. not sure what kind of meat it was but they offer a lot of toppings. not used to cold sandwiches but it was pretty good. warning it is a messy meal. grab plenty of napkins. A little on the pricy side that's why they didn't get a higher rating."}
{"text":"It's a long drive from my apartment in Buffalo to Me Va Me....but it's worth the drive for good food and my gf lives in the area. We stopped in late around 10pm and they were still serving dinner. We started with a hefty portion of the rich and creamy baba ganoush to go with the complimentary pita bread. We split the mixed beef and chicken kabobs and the delicious house salad that comes with. The kebabs were soft and moist...probably some of the best I've had. I didn't care much for the bbq dipping sauce. WARNING: their hot sauce is really REALLY hot! I ended up mixing that with the baba ganoush for dipping and it turned out really good. The rice was so good - it seemed to be a basmati rice which had a real clean buttery taste. 

Overall, the food was fantastic. And they also have a full bar with beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Enjoy going to Me Va Me often. Food and service at this location is consistently good!

We love the trio platter with three dips and fresh laffa."}
{"text":"0
Did not try the food. 
Maybe it is good but make sure you go by yourself! or Maybe one other person..

Tried to book a party for 8 and was told that it was 30$ minimum that we have to spend per person. 
wow.
I have never been forced to spend a certain amount per head in an a la carte restaurant. I mean BUFFET, I get it, its all you can eat. Prix Fixe, I get it. Tasting Menu, I get it. 
But do not ever tell me how much to spend at your establishment. Because then it would just be 0$. 
I even heard of minimum gratuity of a certain percent for a bigger group. 
But this?

For crying out loud we probably would have spent that much anyways, but these people do not welcome groups apparently. I even asked \"if I spend only 25$ are they going to force me to order a coffee?\" 
What if I broke up the party of 8 to two reservations party of 4 sitting beside each other? Or what if we came in as 4 couples and sat beside each other? It is hard to understand this ridiculous reasoning behind the rule.

I even called back to confirm that this is their \"rule\". So I cancelled. 

This is very unprofessional for a restaurant (yea yea its just a chain - but I wonder if this is the same for the whole chain of Me Va Me restos? Maybe thats why they focus on Express instead of the burden of having to wait on sit down customers and having wait staff ) It makes you wonder how this reflects on their customer service. 

No thanks."}
{"text":"I get takeout from me va me at least once a week during my stay in Toronto. Their chicken shawarma is the best I ever had and I wouldn't get it anywhere else. Good potions and good quality meat. It's not cheap, but you get what you paid for! The place is usually busy so there is always a line, but the staff do their best to accommodate and make sure everyone leaves satisfied. Overall, best place for
chicken shawarma and falafel :) the location is also convenient for me, which is a bonus since traffic time can be hectic!"}
{"text":"Excellent Middle Eastern food!  Their portions are huge and most comes with salad.  Definitely try their trio sauces; hummus, baba ganoush, and fried eggplant.  The food does take a while to come and their service is mediocre but the food is delicious.  Sometimes I just do take out to avoid the long line up and wait."}
{"text":"This location is ridiculous I wanted a box meal with A BIT of fries and rice and salad they said I couldn't do that and I had to buy the salad... ok why is that the other locations I go to do this ?? I got three box meals for the family and spent over $80... I guess it adds up when this location is so cheap charging for even to  sauce... i had to buy a bigger container. For the price you charge, offer better service. I rather drive up to Richmond hill then to return to this location."}
{"text":"I have never dined in there I have only ordered for take-out. They used to be good. I  ordered the chicken shintzel and it was burnt. It was like that a few times. The order taker was very rude to me when I called in to place an order to tell them not to burn the chicken because the last few times was burnt, she treated me like I wanted something for free, I didn't want anything for free it just wanted my chicken not burnt. Quality has dropped and will not be ordering from them ever again."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while.  Decided to just avoid driving through too much traffic on Steeles and just eat here watching the traffic die down.

At the time I was still on my diet, so I couldn't induldge in my usual: pita with a variety of dips (especially the roasted eggplant and babaganoush).

Instead, I chose something that is relatively compatible with my diet restrictions at the time.

Beef tenderloin skewers on a potato pancake and salad.  All I can say is that I wanted more, but I was actually satisfied (not stuffed) after eating it.  The portions are pretty much within reason in terms of calorie count I guess.

The beef was ooh so tender and the potato pancake reminded me of the ones I had in Winnipeg.  The salad is yucky (because I hate veggies) but the sauce they provided which I had to put in small moderation made up for the taste.

Their staff is still friendly as usual, and I really like coming here."}
{"text":"This location is the original full restaurant that was set up years ago.  The place has had a refresh and they continue to push out good mealsv - albeit, prices have risen quite steeply.

From a humble beginning on the strip mall at Hilda and Steeles, to opening this location and the first MeVaMe Express, the founders did a great job.  Serve good food at affordable prices and ensure that no one goes home hungry.  This strategy has worked so well, they have the MVM Kitchen all over the GTA.

The order is usually, the 3 dip platter, chicken breast shishkebob and that's it for two people.  Between the fresh baked Naan, the dip platter, the salad, the rice - we're full before we even get to the chicken.  I do not know what they do and how they do it, but the chicken is sooooooo juicy!  Unfortunately, these delicious nuggets of goodness turn into hard nuggets of coal once it cools so eat up as it hits the table!

Take out or dine in, I'm not usually disappointed.  I prefer this location over the one further up Bathurst but I only get here once in a while as this is not near my residence,

Usually in a food coma after a meal here.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been going to MeVaMe since they opened their first restaurant on Steeles, west of Yonge.  They then opened up the restaurant at Bathurst/Steeles and an Express eventually near their old location.  They are such a great success story, however, I think they have forgotten that making great food and at a good value made their company.
Over the years, they have upgraded their restaurants and expanded aggressively while raising prices...aggressively.
I used to be able to go to the express and get a soup and sandwich for about $12 bucks.  Now it's about $17 - before taxes!!!
It's not all bad news.  When we dine in, the chicken breast skewers are some of the best around - at this location and the original only, the others were not as good - and the addition of fresh tandoor naan is fantastic."}

3.5 stars

Parking: 
Plaza in the suburbs so yeah, lots of parking. It might be a bit stressful to get parking at the door, you may -gasp- have the walk 1-2 minutes. 

Decor:
So nice. There are tables. Table booth hybrids and booths. The seats are really push and comfortable. It's really nice actually, they didn't skimp on quality tables and seating!

Food:
Really good.
My last visit we got a hummas with chicken to share and a goat cheese salad and a beef tenderloin salad. 

The hummas was good. You really needed the chicken and onions to add flavour because I has some with just on its own and it tasted like it was just pureed chickpeas, nothing else. 

Goat cheese salad. I think it was good my friend refused to share it saying \" if I give you some it's less for me)

Tenderloin salad. Beef was perfect. Skewers served separate. The salad part. Good but lacking in stuff. Technically the things they listed in the menu were there but in very teeny quantities. The lettuce was puked on top so you couldn't really tell until partway through. But it was really good

Weird. There were two of us, we order hummas and got one pita. One. 

Service:
Or server was nice. Not around a lot, took a while to get our bill and to pay but not so bad. She was really nice. 

I want to point out we watched a waitress push straws into people's drinks using her fingers on open mouth parts. She handled money, and touched things people who were coughing touched. Talk about a typhoid Mary!"}
{"text":"We get take out here all the time. But beware if you go at peak times I can get VERY busy and you will wait a long time. Must try shawarma on laffa bread. It is delicious and huge portion. We also always get dips. Their fried eggplant and babaghanoush is delicious. It never lasts very long in our house!"}
{"text":"I went to the Express Me Va Me with my husband and I think you really do get your money's worth at this place. The schwarma was what we both ordered, where we both got to choose our topping. I had babaganoush, hummus, onions, sauerkraut, tomatoes, lettuce, cabbage in a chicken schwarma, which was huge!! I was able to eat half for lunch, and the other half for dinner because it was such a good deal, for around $7. The meat and ingredients are fresh, the toppings are very generous, staff are nice. I would recommend take out though because space is very limited."}
