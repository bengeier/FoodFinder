{"text":"\"El mejor\" means the best in spanish, perhaps a little unjustified.

Everything was bland, the beef was just plain old ground beef, maybe there was some salt in there? Add a package of grocery store taco seasoning at least.  The chicken was just plain shredded chicken.  The \"veggie\" taco was just taco toppings - not even some token grilled peppers or mushrooms.  The guacamole tasted okay but was a bit brown (a little lime will stop that) & I think it came out of a tub rather than fresh made in store.

I was encouraged initially because they really only had 3 kinds of taco/burrito/quesadilla - beef, chicken & veg.  If you only have 3 you should do them VERY well, not here.  A very meh copy of other burrito places, suggest going to them."}
{"text":"Very good first experince just A taco  noticed they had a tequila bar.  Will have to try a weekend or evening for that. Super to have  a good mexican resto in the hood."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, large portions and great service. All for a good price! I look forward to eating here again! :)"}
{"text":"There is a serious lack of decent quality, fairly priced restaurants in the beaches area but this place is well worth a visit! Attractive clean modern premises. Tried the chicken burrito here for the first time today and thought it was delish!
I noticed they sell tequilla, margarita and beer aswell. Next time, I'm gonna eat in and have a drink with my yummy buritto!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this restaurant got such high reviews on here. I went here with my wife this afternoon and I found it pretty bad. We both ordered burritos and the selection of toppings seemed pretty limited and the flavours were pretty bland. I made the mistake of assuming a beef burrito would have steak in it, but it was literally just ground beef. I've never eaten a ground beef burrito before and I don't think I ever will again. 

I suspect many of their ingredients are store bought and not actually homemade. The salsa tastes like it came straight out of a jar and I saw a huge bag of guacamole sitting in the back.

Maybe I've been spoiled by places like Burrito Boyz and Chipotles, but I definitely won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Lots of delicious food! You can't go wrong stopping in here.  It's not exactly fine dining but when you are chowing down scrumptious tacos with a cold beer who cares :)"}
