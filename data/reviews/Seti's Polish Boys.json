{"text":"I went out of my way to make sure I stopped at Seti's during this trip to Cleveland after seeing it mentioned on the Food Network by Michael Symon.  It was definitely delicious and worth going out of my way for, even if I ended up burning the roof of my mouth.  Very flavorful sauce covers the fries and slaw.  And it is perfectly messy at the same time.  I'll be back, that's for sure.  http://bit.ly/c4f3BC"}
{"text":"In general I couldn't be less interested in hot dogs. Normally I only eat them at places like backyard BBQs, NYC food trucks or baseball games - you know, because that's just what you do and there are really no other options.  But I do love trying new things so Seti's has been on my radar since it's a local CLE+ establishment with a good rep. Last Saturday some friends and I headed over to Seti's to check it out.  The menu is simple: hot dogs or sausages and french fries with various topping options. I had a chili dog and it was incredible; the dog was juicy with a rich meaty flavor and the chili had a nice kick but wasn't too spicy. The fries were crisp and fresh. It's not the healthiest lunch you'll ever have but as far as \"fast food\" goes, it's beyond fantastic. This is a great \"local flavor\" kind of place to take out of town guests or to grab lunch if you're downtown or headed from the West to East side (or back again).  Another nice thing about this truck is it's in the same place every day! No guesswork. Just FYI, there's really no place to sit (other than your car, that is)."}
{"text":"Goes without saying, delicious polish boy. Also really friendly service."}
{"text":"I LOVE the cheese fries and it was my first time here.  I went to Dean Supply to get bakery boxes and I saw the truck and I remembered the Food Network show that Symon talked about this place.  I don't eat meat,but the boyfriend (who was with me) did have the best Polish Boy and he was in love (don't tell his cardiologist!)  He gave me a fry with the BBQ sauce on it and all I have to say is next time, I'm getting cheese BBQ fries!"}
{"text":"The Polish Boy is Delonte West still dating Gloria James good! just the right combination; big dog, crispy fries, delicious BBQ sauce and fresh bun. The polish boy is good enough to make you smile just like you did when you heard the Dallas Mavericks won the NBA Championship"}
{"text":"FOOD TRUCKS IN CLE !!!! After reading about this in the PD, I just had to \"taste\" for myself !!!  I'm not a HUGE FOODIE, but do enjoy finding interesting/quirky eats around town & when we travel !!!! Seti's did not disappoint!!!! It was messy, but the flavor combo in the Polish Boys was really good. I think the Bar b Que sauce was the finishing touch !!! No need to order fries...they were on the Polish Boy too !!!!  Glad I checked it out at Deans parking lot...only 5-6 minute wait !!!!  And Deans is always a fun stop too !!!! From there we went to Gallucci's,  alother good food stop !!!!  Yummy afternoon !!!!!"}
{"text":"Literally the best polish boys. I just have to stop here whenever I'm in town. Especially since polish boys are pretty much not a thing in Columbus. Great, fast, friendly service too. Get all the napkins you can. I had sauce in my eyebrows lol."}
{"text":"So I travelled to the east side to get my mani pedi and OMGSH look who's posted up on the corner... Seti's Polish Boys. I don't eat polish boys but I had the sauce with fries and it was absolutely delicious! My sister and daughter tried the polish boy and said it was amazing. Great customer service and friendly peeps that run it. The food comes out piping hot so be careful if you're super hungry. Their address comes up as a west side establishment but hey they are a food Truck so I'm sure they travel! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Sitting here eating the best polish boy on the planet! We visit Seti's when we are in Cleveland. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Best Polish Boy in the area.  It beats Hot Sauce Williams hands down,  and their servers are NICE!!  Love the chili cheese dogs,  too!"}
{"text":"Their hotdogs are great and their chili cheese fries are just as good!  I'm not much of a fry fan but their fries make me want to eat them.  These dogs are loaded with toppings and very tasty.  They're a bit messy so make sure you're prepared.  The only issue with this food car is that they're not where you're expecting them to be.  I've always went to them when they're at dean supply but sometimes when I go to get my fix they're no where to be found and I leave hungry and let down."}
{"text":"I go here from time to time because I work across the street. The service is always friendly and fast, but I'm kinda so so on the dogs. The Polish Boy has too much going on and really is no better or worse than any other I've had. The other stuff is ok too- chili dog, chili cheese dog, big dog, etc., but nothing I can't do at home. The fries are not good... don't know what oil they use but they should try something else. Decent for a quick, cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Me and some friends pulled off the highway to try this place on our way to Boston.  We were not disappointed!  The two employees are the owners and are quite nice.  We all got polish boys.  They are hot dogs that are grilled, then fried (so they have that delicious snap), then they pile on coleslaw, french fries, and barbeque sauce.  It is so good.  It is a little messy, but it comes wrapped in foil so it is easy to take on the go, or eat it straight out of the wrapper while it is hot.  So if you are passing through Cleveland, don't miss the opportunity to stop at the cheap and awesome food truck!  We heard that some people wait for two hours to get a dog here, but when we pulled up at about 2 pm there was no line!  I think that if you go just after the lunch hour you won't have to wait in line."}
{"text":"Had to get the Polish Boy ($5)...Michael Symon mentioned Seti's variation on an episode of \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\" Basically, a Polish Boy is a deep fried hot dog or sausage, placed in a hot dog bun, topped with cole slaw, french fries, and a sweet BBQ sauce.  What an awesome Polish Boy this was. The fried sausage produced a slight snap on the outside, while remaining juicy on the inside. The bite of the predominantly onion-filled slaw worked well with the sweet, glazy BBQ sauce. The fries were also great, no complaints there! While I would have liked the bun toasted a bit (or a bit more), this was a great introduction to Cleveland's Polish Boy!  The winner here was that BBQ sauce. A great sauce can make all the difference between a good dish and a great dish, and Seti's came through with flying colors. The Iron Chef was spot-on in his assessment of this Polish Boy! Check Seti's out...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"HOT DOGS YOU NEED A FORK AND KNIFE TO EAT. I haven't been able to eat a hot dog from this place without a fork and knife yet. This place is hands down one of the best places in cleveland to get a polish boy and that says a lot considering cleveland invented the polish boy and there about over a hundred places in the city which sell them. The BBQ sauce they use is fantastic and very tasty. The hot dogs are cooked to perfection. I would suggest going during off hours like after lunch because it can get crowded check the pictures if you need an idea of what I'm talking about. I usually go around 1:30 pm and there is no wait. It is a little pricey if we are talking about the price of a hot dog but for a good lunch the price is cheap. It is easily one of the best things I ever ate."}
{"text":"I've had a Polish Boy at another famous Cleveland establishment. I'm not going to mention their name. Seti's version is the BEST.   Sure, I may have stood in line for 2 hours to get that frickin' thing at the C-Town Chow Down... but I still had a good time waiting. I wouldn't say it was worth 2 hours of my time ... but no food is REALLY worth that much time. (Shutup Melt fans).   I would have been happier on a warmer day where my stupid gloves didn't get in the way of mowing down on that Po' Boy.   I feel foolish because I could drive my silly ass down to Dean Supply parking lot and wait a fraction of that time. One day, I will. Probably soon. The Polish Boy was THAT good."}
{"text":"Was good. Tasted more like a deep fried hot dog (not necessarily a bad thing) and the sauce was a bit sweet for my taste. The whole experience is something not to be missed, bring your wet wipes."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  The polish boy is great - just enough cold slaw to prevent the roof of your mouth from melting when they hit the snap of the dog and gush of juice that follows.  Super crispy fries and just enough of that sweet bite from the bbq sauce.  Hard to get the whole thing in your mouth at once, but is well worth trying.  Can't wait to go back to Cleveland for another one."}
{"text":"Soooo good. I ordered the polish boy. I love that it wasn't actually a sausage like most polish boys filled with gristle but more so a jumbo style hotdog. The sauce was sweet but good. The slaw was tasty and the fries were perfectly crispy. My boyfriend doesn't like polish boys so he didn't order anything but I couldn't tell since he ate half of mine. *****Extra napkins are a must!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am fortunate enough to work down the street from Seti's. Or maybe it is not such a good thing as it may cause my body much harm if I eat there too often. If you live in the Cleveland are you must go to Seti's and have a polish boy. There is no other place to have the same experience. The lady who takes your order is super nice and the wait time is not long. The sauce is definitely what makes this polish boy the best."}
{"text":"Love Seti's! I'd given up on getting a good polish boy since Wilson's Hot Tamales disappeared the first time (over a decade ago). Other places don't use a very good quality polish sausage or their fries aren't as crisp or the sauce is a bit off, but Seti's is perfect on all fronts. I love my Polish Boys the \"best\" way- beef polish sausage, cole slaw, fries, and sauce in a thick bun- sweet, salty, crunchy, soft, tangy, meaty= yummy."}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally made it to Setis. I tried coming here 2 months ago when I was in town, and they mysteriously disappeared. I was worried for a second that they would be closed down for good. Fortunately, they aren't closed and I was able to try to perfectly made Polish Boy.   For $7 you get Polish kielbasa topped with fresh Cole slaw, very hot fries with bbq all over. Being a food truck with not outdoor tables, most people with take this bad boy back home or their office. I unfortunately didn't have that luxury and was forced to eat this messy delicious boy in my car. I will admit, it was challenging, but worth every bite.   I'm glad I came back and I'm glad they came back from wherever they came from. I would without a doubt return here for a Polish Boy maybe even their chili dog or C-town fries."}
{"text":"There are few things pure in this world anymore, and home is one of the few.  Upon returning from a gastronomic adventure to America's culinary capital (NYC), I was in much need of a palate cleanser. I've had my fill of regional favorites throughout each borough in New York City. Now I was craving a piece of home. More specifically, a unique Cleveland favorite: The Polish Boy from the Seti's food truck.  And yes Cleveland, there is a mobile food truck besides Dim and Den Sum. And they've been doing it longer. Seti's has been operating their food truck since before mobile food trucks were hip among social media goers. For over 10 years now actually. They park their truck in the Dean's Supply parking lot (restaurant supply store) on the corner of E. 34th and Woodland. Visit them.  Anyways, the menu doesn't consist of fancy crap like braised duck ass, cous cous or miso banana parfait's. What it does consist of is down and dirty blue collared hot dog and fry combinations. Polish Boys (dog w/ slaw, fries and bbq sauce) anchor the menu, along with Chili Dogs, Slaw Dogs, Cheese Dogs and fries with any combination of chili, cheese or bbq sauce.  The Polish Boy is sloppy, it's ugly but oh so good. I'm glad to be back Cleveland! I missed you."}
{"text":"Yes, I waited in line for over an hour for a Famous Polish Boy. I went through many moods during my experience at the C-Town Chow Down: elation, sorrow, anger, extreme hunger, and, finally, acceptance. At the end of the day, this is a sandwich that I would eat every day for lunch if my body could handle it. For five bucks, you get the amount of food a normal person would eat for both lunch AND dinner. They have normal cart/truck staples like regular dogs, cheese fries, and the like, but the Po Boy is where it's at."}
{"text":"I went back yesterday, just to make sure it was not a dream.    ...best chilidog I ever had.  And I discovered the hotdog cooking technique:  first, they are grilled, then they are \"finished\" in the deep fryer.  This gives the tube a bit if a \"snap\", similar to that of a natural casing."}
{"text":"Seti's is hands down on the list of things to try in Cleveland! They have been around for quite some time now, as I remember seeing it on the Food Network in high school. Determined to try it, my friend and I drove 40 minutes to find it. I normally wouldn't say I am a hotdog person, but this was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Be warned- it's a TON of food, but worth every last calorie! Topped with fries, slaw, and BBQ sauce, you may need a bib while you eat it!      I've visited Seti's twice now and have been so happy both times! The people are so friendly and it's definitely worth the trip no matter where you are coming from! Keep on mind, it's a food truck and there may be quite the line! Last time I visited, there was a short line but the service was quick. I found a parking spot on the street a few hundred feet ahead of the truck. Definitely a CLE must try!"}
{"text":"Once I arrived back in Cleveland,  I was on a mission to try a polish boy.  After a littler research,  I found that Setis was the best in town.   Was it \"the best\"?  Maybe....  But when you find out that the price has jumped from $3ish to $6ish, you start to subtract some points.   In the weeks following my Setis experience,  I quickly learned that most polish boys in the area taste about the same.   They are all pretty good for the most part.   This one,  may just be a little over priced with the hype."}
{"text":"Truth. You will need a fork and knife to finish a Best Polish Boy.  Messy and delicious and everything your would expect out of the best polish boy joint in Cleveland.  Bonus - they still sell Cherokee Red soda!"}
{"text":"It's not The Best Thing I Ever Ate, as Michael Symon would claim, but it is pretty good.  I had never had a Polish Boy until today, and I would definitely have one again.  Seti's is cheap and you get a filling lunch for about $4.  The food comes out messy and HOT and, on a 90 degree day like today, it might be a little much.  Other than that it was a good experience and I'd probably go back a lot sooner if it weren't such a schlep from Pepper Pike."}
{"text":"34th & Woodland.....nothing there.  I asked a Cleveland cop....never heard of it.  I searched my smartphone....nothing.  I called 411....nothing.  This tip was a bum steer.  It was pouring rain on the day we were in Cleveland to see the Indians.  \"the mistake by the lake\".  Yelp needs to monitor and update these."}
{"text":"I've tried Seti's famous polish boy twice. The sausage itself is incredibly good. Unfortunately, the slaw is just ok. And the fries, bun and sweet BBQ sauce combine into a hot mess. Not the best I've ever had. The truck should have a shower attached to wash down after taking on one of these."}
