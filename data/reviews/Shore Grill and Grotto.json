{"text":"Impressed! The food was great -- I had the stuffed sole which was nicely plated, broiled on the top, soft seafood filling, with a delicious roasted red pepper sauce. The rice it came with was mediocre but I didn't mind. The brownie dessert was pretty good, a bit too sweet for my liking though. I liked the service -- pretty fast, attentive and friendly waitress."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant to eat at in port credit. If you have a hot date or just want a nice place to have dinner with some good friends, this restaurant will not disappoint you. I had friends from South Florida visiting Ontario and I decided to bring them here to eat, he said that it was the best steak he's ever eaten in his whole life! I was amazed at the Cesar they brought to my table, as it had so much stuff in it that it was almost a meal in itself!"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant that i have been to. Ordered steak and another friend ordered fish. The steak was like a piece of rubber and fish had no taste. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very crowded and dim. When having having a chat with my friend, I could not hear them over the sound of a coffee machine and loud surrounding atmosphere. Food was mediocre. I had the seafood linguine that was overpriced for such an underwhelming meal. The service was not organized and I received the wrong order before getting my food. The glassware was cracked ex: my cup, the candleholder. They had no blinds, so the sun was hitting my friends face the whole time. I even heard a manager telling a lady with the same dilemma to just move over. In general the whole atmosphere is not very pleasant. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The back patio is my favourite. Love the fajitas, calamari, risotto balls, and often order the specials. The thing that keeps bringing me back are the friendly staff, the welcoming environment and simply the good times."}
{"text":"Have spent many summer evenings on the patio as well as some afternoons. Haven't had anything I didn't like so far as well as friends. They also have live music that has been great and a dance floor that gets quite crowded at times. My only negative situation was when a bat decided to land on a guy's neck and then the nearby wall making all of us a little uneasy and wondering what his next move would be. Obviously that was no fault of the restaurant. I would highly recommend this spot in lovely Port Credit. A great patio as well."}
{"text":"Great place. We had a party of 15. Server was amazing and friendly. No attitude whatsoever even for such a big party. Server gladly gave us recommendations according to our preferences. The bills came out nice and orderly, no calling out 'who ordered what' and sorting them on the spot. Same with food, they knew which plate was going to which seat. Very organized. Drinks were delivered in a timely manner.   We sat in their private party room. It was an intimate space.    The. Food. Was. Amazing.   None of us had any complaints about the food and we all ordered different entrees. The heavenly smell of the cooked seafood when it's coming is just absolutely divine.   Would definitely recommend.   Also, the caesars are aesthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, it was okay, service wasn't all that great though. Seems like once the dinner rush was over they stopped paying attention to our table. Don't even think our waters were ever topped off. Wouldn't specifically make a point of coming back."}
{"text":"Won't be back.  It's been years since we've visited this restaurant in our neighbourhood and thought we'd give it another try.  NOT! My partner and I decided to share a few plates.  We had 3 apps and split the fajita combo.  We order the caprese salad, encrusted goat cheese spread with crostini, and blackened scallops to try a variety.  Guess what - they all tasted the same and came with the same arugula with balsamic dressing salad!  While we were only half done the apps, the fajita appeared at the table.  Luckily we were seated at a big booth or there wouldn't have been room for all the plates at the same time.  What were they thinking!  We complained that we were working on the apps and they offered to take the fajita back into the kitchen to sit under the heat lamps.  The fajita was burnt and came with small amounts of fixings and only had 3 shrimps.  All this for $70 dinner for two.   Take my advice and go to the Pumphouse Grill or Papa Gueseppe across the street for both food and service.  It will be a long time before we cross the street again."}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staff. Their live music really boosts your spirits. And not to mention the patio - dog friendly, huge plus!"}
{"text":"Typically my husband and I will make the trek downtown Toronto for dinner out as a treat when we can. I thought we'd do something different and support a local business. I picked Shore Grotto and Grill b/c the menu looked decent and for  the proximity. We made reservations, the table they gave us was directly across from the open kitchen with their wood burning oven. THe room was quite hot as it was, the ceilings too low to accomodate the oven they had. The last thing we needed was a seat in front of a fire! We opted for a table outside.  We started with the Risotto Balls, they were crispy on the outside, however, quite bland and dry inside. My husband ordered the fajitas, I ordered a pizza. Both were not bad until I discovered..... a nail. And no, not a fingernail, a rusty, one and a 1/2 inch nail. I had already had three slices! We told our server who I might add was wonderful, she immediately informed the manager. The manager sent her back out to inform us that our pizza would be free. What??? That's it!!! We sent her back noting that we would not be paying for this meal. THe manager finally decided to show her face. Her explanation was priceless. I truly could not believe what she had to say. She told us that people pound nails in wood all the time, so when the wood burned,  out comes the nail!! I explain the gravity of the situation, that I could have swallowed this nail, and then what. Her repsonse, 'well do you expect us to check all of the wood for nails?!' Oh my goodness, clearly I was not getting through to her. She seemed annoyed and bothered and walked away from us. So we did exaclty the same. I would give this place a 0/5 however our server was good. I don't know why this place is using what I guess is just plain wood for the oven and not speciality wood, but if they are cutting corners with that, who knows where else they are cutting corners."}
{"text":"As locals, we've given this place a few fair tries. On our most recent visit we sat for 25 mins before we even received water. The food is mediocre at best - fajitas with a ton of filler and little meat, caprese salad with less than fresh vegetables, etc.   Location is great but will not be back with all the other dining options in Port Credit."}
{"text":"*this place isn't QUITE 5 stars because it's hard to be perfect, but they were more like 4.5 and I gave 5 because if anything they deserve to be rounded up!! * We were in port credit taking my mom to lunch, and our options were limited because we had our dog with us. Thankfully, Shore welcomes dogs- even providing water bowls at each table on the patio! Really great touch! The patio is gorgeous, and there's quite a bit of seating, plus they have a second patio in the back (presumably for overflow and for those that don't want to eat with a bunch of dogs). Food was basic, but pretty good and slightly elevated for lunch time bar fare. We had a calimary diavolo starter- really crispy (dusted with cornmeal), nice kick to the sauce. My mom had the spinach salad with chicken on top- looked great. Husband had fish and chips, the fish was perfect. Fries were oily, but not bad. I went for a Ceasar salad- it was great, but a bit too much dressing. It was really good otherwise, though. Wine list is decent. Menu is, as I said, basic but pretty big (fajitas, burgers, wood oven pizza, salads, etc; lots of apps too), and I really don't think you could go wrong with anything you choose. The server was fast and friendly, she was really pleasant to deal with. The main thing for me is still the dog bowls- it's so nice to be able to eat on a nice patio and not leave our little guy at home. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay (I give it a 2.5 and am rounding up) -- and that's about the best way for me to sum up the experience.   My husband and I wanted to go to another restaurant on the water but had to quickly come up with a plan B as the wait was well over 90 mins. We made our way to this restaurant with our kiddos. I will say I was a bit nervous to try it given the meh reviews, but see why so many patrons gave this establishment three stars.  On a positive note, we were immediately seated to a quiet booth with high-back seating. Both our hostess and server were pretty great.  The food, however, was just okay. (Though our server was nice, the amount of time we waited for our food was way too long.)  We ordered crab cakes as a starter that were definitely ... different than anything I tasted. I don't know if this is how Canada does crab cakes, but ours tasted like someone made the crab separate from the vegetable mix. It was dry, very crunchy, and a bit underwhelming. I've also never seen a crab cake shaved in a way that mimicked tuna that was also very ... interesting. The kids didn't even want to finish their crab cake bites. (My husband and I did on principle we paid money for them.)  My stuffed sole entree was just okay and small in size. Speaking of small, the itty bitty scallop pieces and shrimp stuffed inside were barely noticeable at times -- but the bright orange sauce it was engulfed in definitely was.  My husband got the gumbo that had a curry spice to it he wasn't expecting. Given we've eaten gumbo in a number of places -- including New Orleans -- he thought it was okay.  My children's pizza looked great and was tasty. As a note for parents, this restaurant (per our server) does not have a kid's menu but can turn items into a child option.  Given the price and other restaurant options nearby, I highly doubt we would come back here again."}
{"text":"I visited Shore with my wife for a group event where about 40 of us were present.  I found their quality control was very poor: our whole table ordered filet mignon steaks of the same temperature yet they were all quite different when they arrived, mine resembling more an overdone hamburger than a restaurant caliber steak.   My Caesar salad was missing the Parmesan and the baby spinach very bitter and barely edible.    Inattentive servers meant our drinks went empty and stayed that way for half an hour or more.   There's a slight chance their normal table service is an experience better than what we experienced, however we were extremely disappointed with our stay.   Our waitress didn't seem to care that my steak was untouched when she took my plate away...  If they don't care enough to ask then I can't be bothered to complain, especially not enough to make a scene of it when I'm with a large group."}
{"text":"Alright, so after reading the reviews of others here I feel it time that I step up to the plate and weigh in with my take on this little spot by the water in beautiful Port Credit. Some call me the eternal optimist, others maybe dumb but what I am is passionate about Italian food (heck I'm Italian after all) and a place with a little swank. Shore Girll and Grotto delivers both  I'm so glad I participated in the inaugural Dishcrawl Mississauga because they introduced me to a place that I had walked past a half a dozen times before and not realized what kind of a cool vibe this place was.  You enter into Shore G&G from the street and immediately are in their very swanky bar area (which if I'm not mistaken is called the Wave Room - although I can't be 100% sure that may be another area of the building altogether.) The bar is dimly lit, well decorated and has a gorgeous bar stretching the length of the area. Gents, certainly a first date place to come for a drink, and ladies this is a great spot for ladies night drinks. I didn't get a chance to see their cocktail menu and beer selection, so I will be back in the near future and report on my findings.  To the left and up 2 steps (careful, I'm clumsy and tripped on one on the way in), is the dining area. The elegant decor stretches into this area and while it shares a the same dim lighting as the bar area, the space is slightly brighter due to the open kitchen format which allows you to watch your food being prepared. The highlight to this area was the amazing stone pizza oven shaped like a turtle shell (see my pictures), pumping out pizza after pizza to hungry patrons.   Once seated we were treated to sampler plate with three items on it: an arinccini (risotto ball) sitting in a bed of arrabiata (spicy tomato sauce), a slice of pizza and a mini caprese salad.  A note that risotto balled, battered and deep fried is called Arinccini (a southern Italian treat normally done with bococcino cheese, rice and pea) and is common and a traditional manner in which this dish is served. Shore had a unique way in which the ball was dried a little more crispy but the result was equally as delicious. The difference maker for this dish was the sauce. Which in my opinion was ON POINT, with how we make it at home. Points for mastering this - as for me this is the difference maker between good and poor Italian food.   I only wished that there had been more caprese salad and pizza as the portions were small (I understand it was a sample) and I didn't get quite enough. It's hard to mess up caprese salad and I found Shores to be again on point. The pizza was the only thing I couldn't really get a taste for because the sample slice was so small. However the pizzas making their way to other tables looked piping hot, cheese and wonderful.  My recommendation, you who have judged this place so harshly, give them another shot. Take it from me your local Italian Yelp Community Manager friend, they've got something good cooking here.   SEASONAL UPDATE: The dining room will soon open up to the street with a massive sidewalk style patio. I cannot wait for the good weather to come dine here.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"This review is somewhat overdue because I've been enjoying meals at Shore Grill & Grotto for many years.   Without exception, I have always left feeling satisfied and have usually asked my server to pass compliments on to the chef. Occasionally I'll pop in for a cool one and then stick around to listen to live music for a while; on other visits I'll join friends for lunch or dinner. Always wonderful.   Today was no exception. I'd been out in the neighbourhood around the lunch hour and was getting a bit hungry. Wow. The chef made me a vegetarian curry dish which I enjoyed along with a well drawn double espresso. I'm not a food critic so I don't have the proper words to describe how good it all was. \"Amazing\" is so overused; but, it applies perfectly in this case. Somehow they've found the perfect balance between flavour and heat.    Please check them out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Poor services. I had reservation for dinner with my mom traveling from another country. As we were heading to there from Toronto downtown, we took Go Train and the Train was a little late. They did not contact us at all and cancelled our reservation. And when we arrived they did not show any apology and even a little arrogant. Well if the cancel-without-contacting-customer is your style, at least write down when people make reservation and I will call you if the train delay happend. But they did offer us another table. They had plenty vacant tables in normally busy Saturday evening (yes I totally understand if that is the service). And for food, I am a big fan of Italian food. But honestly, compared to tons of Italian restaurant in Toronto, the taste is not recommended. And if anyone is travelling Port Credit, there are many other better options to dine.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  And after I post the review above, I received their reaction about the complaint as below. Anyone wants to experience their \"beg me for a table\" customer services, could try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by admitting that we misread the vibe a little. We were three mid-20s ladies in casual clothing looking for a solid dinner. We were not looking for a celebratory Saturday night out.   So, imagine our server's visible disappointment when we didn't want alcoholic beverages!  And again, clear annoyance when two modifications were asked to be made to entrees. If it's a problem, just tell us \"no modifications\" and we will pick something else. C'est simple comme bonjour.   Waiter ignored us for the whole meal - was too busy sucking up to older couple next to us. Another waitress brings us our bill. She is much friendlier and efficient."}
{"text":"Great patio location in Port Credit Varied menu that offered something for each of us Fabulous Caesar complete with prawn Amazing fajitas  good service Fries were cold but they sent fresh ones with no problem"}
{"text":"PRO:  - pet friendly restaurant and will provide your doggy with a bowl of water - lots of patio space (both front and back) - good atmostphere with live music - friendly service  CONS: - service was slow. Servers constantly brought food to the wrong table - quality of the food - I ordered the scallop spaghetti and the scallops were way overcooked. The hubby ordered the filet mignon and was overcooked as well, sides were mediocre. Definitely not worth the $30 they charge."}
{"text":"Had a yummy meal here, highly recommend, the wait staff was attentive and friendly. If I am ever in the area I will definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"Don't have anything bad to say about my experience at Shore Grill. Was here for a girls night with some co-workers of mine. We were very happy with everything - food quality was top notch, it came out of the kitchen fast, and the service was great. Prices were reasonable, too!  Will likely return!"}
{"text":"This place looks and seems sexy.  It is small and stylish and I came here for drinks on Sunday night, while it was still light out. My gf and I had a ceaser and a gin and tonic.  THAT WAS ONE LOADED CEASER.  - jumbo shrimp, long beans, etc. looked fantastic. drinks were good. overpriced for port credit but nice. Cool location as you can walk around and see the lake.  I did not try the food. SIDENOTE: an older visibly ethnic man and his sons were at the table next to us and complained about not being served for over 30 minutes. I hope this is an isolated incident, and wasn't anything directly related to the fact he was a minority - I guess that is a  whole different topic not appropriate for yelp... but ya...  Next time I will come back to try some food. But they need to lose the paper menu's...come on, you have the word grotto in your name. be sexy!"}
{"text":"The bar looked great and they had some rocking live music but it was too packed to get in to so we had to take a seat in the restaurant. The decor was nice and it was great that the doors opened up on to the patio. They should crack down on smokers right outside though because the smoke blowing in is like eating at a smokers house--gross! The drinks were ok. Nothing special and they featured a big like up of slushy drinks. I was hoping for a Manhattan or an Old Fashioned but they were not to be found.   My friend ordered off menu for a whisky sour but it came in a mason jar and looked radioactive yellow. I had a sangria which was good and a Hendricks with tonic (hard to mess that up).   The food was unimpressive. The thin crust pizza was disappointing with a soggy crust and light on the toppings. The risotto balls were dry and tasteless rather than the delicious cheesy molten goo I was hoping for and even the flavourful tomato sauce with chorizo and capers couldn't revive it. The only good thing about the food was how fast it came out.  The service was good and our server was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Was taken out for dinner by my friend & roommate, and just had a bad experience.  A spider landed on our table and may have landed on my plate.  It was not my first time there, but first time there to have a meal. I ordered the  Caesar salad to start, Grilled chicken with Mango chutney and Lemon potatoes. The salad was nice but the Parmesan cheese was over powering... Must have a better way to add this at the table. I did not like the Lemon potatoes... They seemed too overpowering with the taste. The menu may need to offer some alternate sides. The chicken  was dry and was hard to chew. Really need to go back and try another menu item."}
{"text":"Okay I wanted to give a 4 or 5 star review. The food was good, the service was great but man oh man, the smoking happening there. Not great and we won't go back because of it. You can't sit inside or outside. While they try to segregate the smoking to one side, it goes everywhere. There are large windows (or maybe it was doors) open across for inside so that it's not safe in there either. Too bad.   For someone who doesn't mind eating smoke with their food, we ordered the risotto balls - which I loved, the pizza - okay not fantastic but I think largely because I started eating that when the heavy smoking started, veggie fajitas - good, and a pasta dish - a little oily but good. The frozen drinks were delicious and the patio was nice."}
{"text":"Where do I begin!  Poor food, poor service and major inconsistency. Stay away!!   I am an avid restaurant go-er who has been to my fair share of establishments in the GTA. I have never felt the need to write a poor public review about a restaurant until now.   Service: Shore Grill and Grotto has some of the worst service. The servers are always slow and uninterested in truly assisting you and making you feel comfortable. When they make a mistake on your order (which almost ALWAYS happens ), they BLAME YOU and try to cover themselves up for making the mistake.   Food; Food is subpar and prices are high for the quality of food you are receiving There are plenty of places you can better spend your hard earned money.   If you thought it ended here, you are wrong!  A few times I have ordered a simple salad for take-out. You would think that an easy to make salad would be hard to mess up... wrong! It is somehow always wrong. They either give me a half portion (not acceptable at all), completely forget to put dressing on the salad (i didn't order lettuce), or forget to tell me that the \"Kale\" to make a \"kale\" salad is unavailable yet still sell me that salad....  Even after I brought this stupidity to their attention... they tried to justify their actions. Completely ridiculous.   Moral of this review: Do NOT go to Shore Grill and Grotto."}
{"text":"Good quality, satisfying food with the choice of live music in the lounge. Lots of food and drink options. (Picture is of a baked chicken parmesan with spaghetti and vegetables)"}
{"text":"This place was our third stop on the Misssisauga Dish Crawl.  The interior was pretty nice. We got to sit right next to the wood burning pizza fire oven thingy. So cool.  THe service was really nice. We were served with everything on one plate.   We got to try:  1. The Risotto Ball. It was my first time, and I didn't really enjoy it. It just tasted like rice thrown into a ball shape smothered in marinara. My tablemates told me thats not what a risotto ball is supposed to be like.   2. The Slice of Pizza : It was dried out and didn't feel fresh. I couldn't really taste anything.  3. The Caprese salad : Just a slize of mozarella with a thin tomato. I didn't even have basil or balsamic. Kinda flat.   From what I've heard, this wasn't the best showcase of the menu.  I think they had a rough night because it was a dishcrawl, and they were kinda over prepared (you could tell the plates had been prepared waaaaaaaaaaay longer ago) I would definitely try it again, because from what I heard speaking to other people in the group, it is actually a pretty good place. So imma 2star fo nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the bad reviews - it's a decent joint, with decent burgers, and quick and friendly service.   While it's not high on my list of repeats, I don't mind doing so, if an opportunity will arise."}
{"text":"Went for Mothers Day with a group of 8.  First impression was good as the place has nice decor (if slightly generic) and the servers were friendly and attentive throughout the meal. The layout of the place is not the greatest as the walkway to the washroom passes directly by the kitchen doors in the centre of the restaurant. There were a few near misses as customers almost got taken out by someone exiting the kitchen.   Had a couple of Caesars to start and they were okay. They had a massive garnish with shrimp, olives, etc but the drink tasted a bit watered down and unseasoned. Someone else a my table ordered a virgin Caesar but did not get the garnish. Guess only vodka drinkers are graced with that which is odd considering the price difference is negligible.   The food is where the place really fails. Only the coconut shrimp was up to decent standard. The crab cakes were bland and full of filler. The wilted salad it came with did not look appetizing and wasn't touched.   The margherita pizza is an insult to anyone who enjoys pizza. The tomato sauce was extremely bland, the crust was soggy, and the cheese was like a bag of pre-shredded store bought mozzarella.  They put sliced tomatoes on it which is unnecessary if you actually make a decent sauce.  I've honestly had better frozen pizza.   I tried out some of the pasta on some other plates and it wasn't quite as bad but really nothing special and just obnoxious portion sizes.  If I want to stuff my face with as much penne as possible I'll just make it at home with a jar of no name sauce and it would be about on par with what we were served.   The place has potential and with their prime location (reflected in the overpricing) I'm sure they are not hurting for business.  They really just need a menu make over. It is overlong and all over the place which can't work well for managing the kitchen. I find it bizarre that along with the pizza and pasta the stars of the menu are the fajitas (?). Why not just focus on a few choice dishes or a select type of cuisine and do them well?"}
{"text":"We had the beef hogie sandwich and turkey and bacon avocado sandwich for lunch. Food was good, service was friendly and fast, and the location was perfect for a hot Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Went in around 10-00pm Saturday our waitress was awesome got us seated and drinks set up in no time We had the fajitas which were great and finished off with a latte. We enjoy the service and ambience we will be back"}
{"text":"Its never really busy when i dine here but its such a gem. The food and drink selection is amazing!!! Personally love the pastas and the fajitas, my husband got a beautiful steal with peppercorn sauce. He added on a shrimp skewer and it was surprisingly full of shrimp! We come here when in the port credit area. It has a high end feel with decor and especially with the food but the prices are so reasonable. They recently made it so you are unable to order their \"dinner\" options at lunch . Nothing on their lunch menu excited me but it was still good none the less. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was just ok -- nothing special I thought.. We had a sampler plate with risotto balls, caprese salad, and pizza. Ambience was nice, but really dark actually. Note to self: risotto shouldn't ever be in a ball, so don't order it again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the girlfriend a few months ago when we just started dating.  Ordered the steak with blue cheese and onions on the side for $26. Gf ordered seafood pasta. Shared an appetizer of crab cakes.  The crab cakes were good, tasty but are somewhat small for what you pay for.   The steak was ok, but it was pretty much pedestrian.   The pasta though was a disaster. Swimming in oil that my gf could barely touch it. It tasted good the next day after she DRAINED all of the oil.  What's worse, their card machine was not working and we had to run to the CIBC at the corner to get cash.   Will NOT be back"}
{"text":"This place is just alright. Their menu was pretty small and basic. The food tasted regular. The inside of the restaurant was dark and unwelcoming.   Living two minutes from Port Credit I know this place draws a crowd at night just because of its location. But other than that it doesn't really have a whole lot going for it other than the relatively low lunch prices."}
{"text":"The three of us decided to start our long weekend by having a seafood dining adventure. We arrived around 6:45 pm and the patio was full. They offered us the back patio which we agreed on as we were already hungry. The back patio is definitely not as nice as the front one. There's no view and we felt like the dumpster was probably close by.  We all started off with an appetizer that was shared amongst each other. We shared the mussels in white wine, scallops, and crab cakes. I was very disappointed with the scallops. For almost $13 there were only four scallops on the plate! That's ridiculously priced I must say. If I knew there would only be four scallops I definitely wouldn't have ordered it. Our server was good during our stay. However, we all felt that she should've written our orders down because it didn't come out right. My sister and friend both had changes to their original orders which weren't easy to remember. As soon as the server was summarizing our orders she already had it wrong. Our entrees came out quite fast which was nice as were hungry. However, my sister's order came out wrong so it was sent back. I enjoyed the seafood linguini that I ordered. They didn't cheap out on the seafood as there were plenty to eat. It came with shrimp, mussels, scallops, and clams. I definitely shouldn't have ordered the scallops to start off with.  Overall, it was an enjoyable dining experience! However, it is a bit pricey (it is seafood, after all). However, next time I'd prefer to sit in their main patio and not order the very pricey scallop appetizer."}
{"text":"None of the food was bad, but none of it really stood out. The bruschetta didn't really feel like bruschetta in anyway, but it tasted okay. Overall, the food is WAY overpriced for the quality that you get. Especially when you got something of high-caliber next door (Door Fifty Five)."}
{"text":"I am guessing Shore survives because they have a diverse menu. Not many spots serve, fajitas, pastas, pizzas and catch of the day all,at reasonable prices. Sadly that is the extent of my praise Spinach salad to start was fresh and tasty enough to warrant 3 stars. Mushroom bruschetta was a soggy 1.5 star mess. Veal Marcella was a gravy laden, shoe leather mess."}
{"text":"I adore their food.  Simple, upscale, tasty.  What else do you need? The prices are a little steep, but the food quality is awesome, so that's all that matters.  Hard to come by Italian/Canadian food influence in Port Credit"}
{"text":"Had the Cajun shrimp and the Gorgonzola pasta dishes. Both fantastic and came out fast. I brought my dog and we were able to sit outside. Very nice seating on the patio and the waitress was very nice. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place on great location in Mississauga!! Perfect for couple of drinks for unwinding and good food. Impressed with their drink menu and presentation. Little price but worth spending money. Spend wonderful evening with my wife!!!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch. When arriving the entrance way is kind of dark and bad feeling but there is also a dining lounge which is very nice. Older crowd. Pretty slow for a lunch service on a Friday.   Our service was just okay. Server Seemed a little bit distant and disorganized. Our whole dining experience took a bit longer than the usual lunch time bite.   Food was okay. Asked for no onions but got onions in my salad and not on my sandwich (does that make sense?). We both ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. Comes with salad or fries and is topped with guac, coleslaw, and sweet chilli sauce. The sandwich just tastes like honey. Definitely tastes better with hot sauce to neutralize how sweet it was.  Pricing is pretty low to average ($12 each)   Food 3/5 Service 3/5 Value 4/5  Overall experience 3/5  May be back to try again for dinner but probably not for a while."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food is good, waitresses have a bit of attitude I know it's not an easy job but when you have a customer who is actually being respectable don't give attitude. Service is pretty quick would go back"}
