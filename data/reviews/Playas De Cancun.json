{"text":"Food is tasty. Used to go here a lot when I was a kid. Really cool because the place holds local value as well as cinematic value... The backdoor beauty/pie scene for \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" was filmed here. Really cool."}
{"text":"This place lost my order then tells me i cant get a refund becuase they cant. What kind of bull is this? Not cool and not professional"}
{"text":"Good burges terrible bad customer services and it took 30 minutes to get a burger with no one waiting"}
{"text":"Ever since we've been frequenting their taco stand, Tacos Cancun, we had always been wanting to try their restaurant inside and try their Hamburguesas Mexicanas. Aside from Burgers, They also serve Tacos al Vapor, Tortas Ahogadas, Smoothies, Fresh squeezed juices, and Raspados. Lots to choose from, which is a good reason for a return visit!

We split a Hamburguesa Hawaiiana- burger patty, ham, cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato and (canned) pineapple, and avocadodefinitely a good change from your standard ketchup, mustard, pickle, and onion deal at Micky D's..They come with Papas Fritas and a Roasted Chili. This burger was hella good! It also brought wifey back to her childhood, like how the Hula Burgah from Shiro's in Hawaii does for me...if someone can evoke childhood memories from one bite, I'm instantly a fan!

Now the next thing to do is go down their list of burgers and try each and every one...after our burger, we thanked the ladies, stepped outside and ordered up some Tripas tacos and continued our street taco scramble...ALOHA!!!

{"text":"I used to come here when i was younger with my mom when she used to do laundry & i stopped coming, then 2 days ago i got on #BITESQUAD & saw a burger place that delivered & had sausage and beef in their burgers i said no way this cant be. So i ordered from here & i was NOT disappointed. So right now i started to look for the burger place because i didnt know where this was & once i started looking more into it i remembered this place & loved it. I will be ordering from here much more often!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers in town with a definite twist. Me and my college buddies ran into this place and decided to give it a shot. Be aware, the entire menu is in Spanish but any of the burgers are a fursure move."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night for dinner and decided to try one of their Mexican burgers. I ordered the Monterey burger and it was bombdiggity! Two thumbs up. They nailed that Mexican flavor. Hard to find that anywhere else. The flavors blended well together. Even the French fries were on point. You also get a chile toreado. 
Complementary chips and salsa were given while we waited for our order. The chips were freshly made so they were hot and tasted good. The salsa was delish but very salty. I still ate it because I was starving and it had a really good flavor to it. 
The people working there were not rude, but their also not very friendly. Very dry personalities. 
Our food took a while but it was worth the wait. And as long as it's piping hot, I don't mind. 
I will most definitely return in the future for the burgers. And maybe even try other items.

I dropped my star rating from 4 stars to 3 stars because this place says it closes a certain time and they actually start closing down an hour before and refuse to let you order even though they remain open. That is so stupid on their part. The lazy workers would rather turn customers away then make money. Their excuse was we turned off the grill. My response was why are you turning the grill off an hour before your suppose to close? Can't you turn it back on? Someone just ordered food a couple of minutes before I walked in. I was lit. I have been here twice and last time my French fries were on the skimpy side and they didn't give me chips and salsa."}

{"text":"Amazing they cook the meat for u right when u order so everything is fresh had the Asama tacos and La Monterrey burger it's bomb"}
{"text":"Great customer service, great food, good prices good portions, what more is needed love this place!! And the old man here is wonderful!! Very nice and funny!"}
{"text":"Best place ever just moved to the area and decided to try it out with my roomie the old man who is there taking the orders is hilarious!! And so friendly reminded me of my grandpa portions are great and great prices"}
{"text":"I just got a Carne Asada Torta. Had to spit out nearly all the meat due to the fat I could not chew. Nasty, just nasty! The bread, guac, lettuce, tomato, onion and jalapenos were great. But the meat is too fatty to chew and eat."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a long time and love it. Great Mexican burgers cooked to order. My favorite is Monterey comes with fries at a very affordable prices. They also serve other Mexican specialities."}
