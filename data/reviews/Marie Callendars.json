{"text":"Was greeted by and seated immediately, it wasn't extremely busy for a Monday night, clean restaurant, drinks kept filled by the wait staff!

Food portions not bad went for the 600 calorie entrees and left full."}
{"text":"Marie Callendars is well known for their frozen foods at your local groceries. Since my migration from SF to Las Vegas! I recently discover that their chain restaurants r also as popular. I had the pleasure of eatin there today. Kimberly was my waitress n I had a lengthy conversation with her. She was also from the bay area. She made my dinning experience at MC even more memorable! Thank u K! 

The chicken pot pie I order was huge n baked to perfection! The shrimp avocado appetiser was great as well. It came with the best chip I have ever tasted. I also finish my meal off with a slice of the famous MC pumpkin pie!"}
{"text":"I have never been a huge fan of Marie Calendars except for their pies. My family decided to come here on a Wednesday night which wasn't that busy at all. I haven't been to a Marie Calendars to eat either since the one on Decatur closed. Well, I am very happy we decided to come tonight. The food was just so so but Denise our server was phenomenal. I've been to fancy places to eat and don't even get the service that we got tonight. Denise was so attentive and made sure that we were always taken care of throughout the night and she was very sweet as well. If I decided to come here again it will be because of Denise."}
{"text":"Fair price with so so ambience.  Our waitress was nice and very attentive. I love their chicken pot pie, I think it's the best in the area so far. The strawberry  pie did not impressed me other that noting they use whole fresh fruit for it."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this MC in years as their food and service was past their prime. In other words boring and dull. Today I felt like some comfort food and thought of MC's. I wasn't expecting much. What a surprise to find great service (you rock Lee) and good food. I went with the traditional turkey dinner. The turkey and stuffing were spot on. Plenty of it too. The veggies were amazing. Crisp to perfection. Let's not forget the pie;  German Chocolate pie to die from! Someone at this MC is paying attention. Good food and great service allows you to charge more for a dinner out. It sure was worth it to me. Well done Marie Callender's!"}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars for the pies. The desserts were very good with a wide selection. The regular food menu has a quality only slightly better than Dennys or IHOP but the prices are MUCH higher. The cost isn't worth the quality."}
{"text":"Marie's pies are amazing let's face it. The lemon sour cream is amazing and any pie you get is going to be amazing. The tri-tip dinner looks really good on the picture but the tri-tip was soggy you could tell it wasn't cooked to order and the chicken that went with it was one of those cheap processed IQF chicken breasts. We decided to get a Caesar salad because it was happy hour. Worst mistake ever! It was already made so it was soggy with hardly had any dressing on it and like three croutons and barely any cheese. I could have gone to the grocery store and gotten the Dole Caesar salad kit and been happier with it. Then instead of getting macaroni and cheese or something else as a side I got this horrid coleslaw called almond coleslaw but there were no almonds to be found. It tasted nasty. They don't know how to do loaded mashed potatoes either they were very Bland mashed potatoes with a tiny bit of bacon and cheese and green onions on top of them. The waitress did a good job I didn't want to complain to her because the way the food tastes isn't her fault. It's the restaurant and these fly-by-night cooks that don't know what they're doing"}
{"text":"I'd never heard of this place before we pulled in here. Visiting from Seattle, we'd heard of Marie Callendars in grocery stores, but we had no idea she had her own restaurant. We were just looking for IHOP, haha. But we stumbled in here because IHOP was literally packed. We sat down tentatively and the waiter immediately asked us what we wanted to drink while we looked over the menu. So many options! And the prices weren't bad at all, either, which made me happy. When I ordered my French toast, I was given these huge slices. And my scrambled eggs were perfect. My mom ordered a muffin too, and literally couldn't finish it because it was so big. I think by price, portion size, and service, this place is fantastic. We did go on a Tuesday morning so maybe that helped us too, but I really enjoyed this place and am kinda bummed there is no place like this back
home."}
{"text":"Last night's meal came with a side of cockroach. As in there was literally a cockroach crawling on our table. Of course, we didn't see it until after we finished our dinner. Our waiter, Sergio, brought out the manager as he went to go charge the credit card that my boyfriend so kindly provided, despite the fact that we shouldn't have had to pay and we wouldn't have since the manager would have taken care of it had Sergio not been so efficient. 

I'm sure there are other health codes being violated. I am extremely grossed out and will never eat at this location again. Mark my words."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way home from an event tonight. I want to give accolades to the manager. He went above and beyond and made us feel welcomed. He personally serviced our table and as a special treat gave me a piece of pie to take home, gratis, because I told him how delicious it was!! What a great way to bring customers back !!! Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like to review national chains but since this was my first time ever visiting a MCs, I decided to make an exception.

This particular Marie Callendars is located in a pretty sketchy, old part of town surrounded by empty buildings and odd shops. I had no idea it was there. The restaurant needs a serious makeover. It just felt stale and almost dirty even though there was no noticeable dirt.

 I had my heart set on one of their famous pot pies but persuaded by our waitress to go for the meatloaf sliders, which I order with mashed potatoes. While we waited for a food, we were served complimentary \"cornbread.\" I hate cornbread. As a fat kid, I was often told cornbread tastes like cake, but their's actually does! It was pretty good.. for cornbread. Our food came out pretty fast. The bun, grilled onion and cheddar, and mashed potatoes were yummy. The meatloaf was nothing to write about.. bland, but not terrible. We couldn't leave MC without a slice of pie. I ordered warm peach pie, and I'm happy to report that it tastes just like the kind you get in the freezer at Walmart.

Would I return? If someone else was buying."}
{"text":"LEE is the best waitress I have ever been served by.  I hope the Manager knows how lucky he is to have her. The food was great, but I would return just for her.  She made my day.  I don't love Las Vegas, but I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but our service was TERRIBLE. Our server took at least 10 min to acknowledge us and ignored us most of the time. We had to ask her repeatedly for things and remind her what we had ordered. She was not friendly at all. We were going to order dessert but we we were too frustrated with our service that we had to leave. On a side note the ac was literally blowing is away. Which is good in a hot summer day, but it made for an ice cold lunch."}
{"text":"Not being able to decide exactly what we wanted to do for lunch, we opted for the ever consistent Marie Callender's. We were greeted with a smile and promptly shown to a booth. It's hard to beat their soup and salad bar lunch. The potato cheese soup is a meal in itself along with some warm cornbread. The salad bar offers fresh veggies and chunks of real turkey. My buddy decided on a Parmesan club that looked might tasty. It must have been, as he devoured it. The iced tea was fresh and the service was good. I haven't been to this location in a while and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this restaurant for dinner. The first time I ordered an entree but added the Salad Bar for $4.99. I found I liked the Salad Bar better than the entree itself.

When we (my mom and I) went tonight we got the salad bar, sodas and we each had a piece of pie. Just the salad bar itself was $12.99 per person. The piece of pie was close to $5 each.

Yes the food is good, but in my opinion it is not worth the cost. Will I go back? Eh, Maybe. Mom liked it so if she asked to meet there again I would probably do it. On our first visit the waitress was great, the second time -- well, not so much. I did not leave her a tip. 

Honest opinion from your average Nevadan. Hope it is helpful. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Wow. Never coming here again. Just went in to get a pie and (bebe? Says the receipt) gave cold shoulder and had POOR customer service while we decided on a pie. She acted irritated when we didn't know immediately which pie we wanted. Within 2-3 minutes we decided and she was semi cold/rude as she packaged our pie. Seriously could have gone to Costco and got a pie at half the price with better customer service. Disappointed in Marie calendars. Hire better employees, or you'll lose a lot of business.
1 additional star for the amazing pie."}
{"text":"My family's recent meal at Marie Callendar's came to about $15 per person.  Was it worth it?  Perhaps not.  Was it good though?  Yes.  I ordered beef stroganoff.  It was very good.  There was no shortage of mushrooms and the beef was very tender.  No complaints.  My dad ordered a soup and salad bar.  Fine.  Also ordered that night was hot wings and a side of fries, a turkey sandwich with avocado, and a chicken finger sandwich.  None of us had any complaints.  The corn bread and honey butter was fantastic as always.  The service was quick and friendly.  It was a nice evening out with my family.  However, for food that is just slightly better than a place like Denny's, the price is more than what I like to pay."}
{"text":"The food is great. I had the combo platter. The warm cornbread came out first it was sweet. The server was very attentive. Her name is Diamond I will ask for her again. The lemon pie is also on sale 7.99 for a whole one."}
{"text":"Sure isn't what it used to be. Ripped cushions, grimy looking and food was nothing spectacular. Personally I think their frozen foods are much better"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. I ordered the chili with corn bread and it was more then I could eat... Came out nice and hot and I didn't have to wait long for it. Thank you guys I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place just does not disappoint me. 
I like to come here with my Grandpa, because he loves the potpie, and everything else I tried has been good. 
This time I decided to try the Mahi Mahi tacos.  These were really good. I did ask for the pico on the side, since I'm not a fan of raw onions. They spiced them perfectly and even though when I first looked at them, I thought the pieces of fish were on the small side, the turned put to be the right balance of fish to taco ratio.  Any bigger would have overpowered the taco. 
They served tortilla chips on the side that were great, and a good (but nothing to write home about) rice pilaf. 
I was too full get pie, but Grandpa got pumpkin with extra whipped cream. 
Grandpa and I will be back!"}
{"text":"There is always quick and friendly service for all of the basic breakfast needs! Although they are near the strip, they never make you wait. The consistent food quality and service make them a great go-to."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with this restaurant in Oklahoma 4 years ago and had never been back until today, Mother's Day. I was pleased as punch with the food! Had the meatloaf slider, chocolate chocolate chip muffin and a salad. The service was extremely slow due to our waiter being new, but it was fine! Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Went here today about 11am. I love the retro sign out front and five stars for the food. 
Service was a lil clunky today from our server, Leo. He was sooooo sweaty it was grossing me out-like it was dripping off his face. I'm sure he can't help it but keep a towel with you or somethin bro before you drip that in somebody's food. 
They brought my husband the wrong order. He didn't say anything. ..he just ate it. I had to ask twice for ice cream and my pie was cold.  
The coffee cups were so dirty and while refilling our cups they spilled coffee on my husband's phone. 
If I ever go back it'll be for the pie-to go."}
{"text":"Marie Callendars! Ok...heres a story for ya! I took a few friends to dinner the other night. We went to Marie Callenders. I ordered my desert which was an Ice Cream Sunday of some kind. Took a spoonful..and YECH! Nasty nasty Nasty! Turns out when they made the whipped cream? They used SALT instead of sugar! Seriously! Talk about nasty! But wait thats not all! As one of my friends was eating their dinner? They found a surprise in their food. A human fingernail! Yep! A fingernail! Now we reported these issues to the manager. He did confirm that yes, ALL the whipped cream HAD in fact been made using SALT. In regards to how the manger wanted to resolve the issue? He threw up out of the restaurant! Seriously! That was his solution! And yes, he made me PAY for this food as well! Now how did someone confuse salt for sugar in their kitchen? Is beyond me. And why would someone be (apparently) trimming their fingernails in an open and operating kitchen? Is also beyond me! And to get confrontational with your customers because they complain about these things? Is also beyond me. Point to my story? Steer clear of Marie Callendars!"}
{"text":"For Vegas, this Marie Callender's Restaurant was not crowded at all. We sat down immediately. and had really great service. Food came out fast, and everything was delicious.

Our server was nice, wasn't as happy or as jolly as his colleague. lol  
When he took off on break, he came by to tell us who his back up was. She was such a lovely African American lady. Such full of life, respect, and love for her job. I felt so comfortable being there, we didn't want to leave."}
