{"text":"We had the tacos (chicken and fish). It was really good the rice and beans with it compliment Ed the meal very well. If I had one comment it would be that I wanted more of the sauce. The sauce on the tacos was very tasty just wish there was more lol. Definitely will look out for them wherever we go. They also had great customer service."}
{"text":"Even though these guys keep moving on me.  I'll keep following because the BBQ burger with waffle fries is amazing.  I've had the quesadilla and the Mexican burger as well, all delicious but the BBQ burger keeps me coming back.  If they could switch to doing this full time I'd eat there every day, haha!"}
{"text":"Good decent taco truck food.  Had Al Pastor and beef cheek tacos. Have had better, but still darn good and a godsend very late at night when nothing else was open!"}
{"text":"I have to say that DOS Brothers has some truly BOMB Mexican food. I tried the Al Pastor tacos which were nothing short of being absolutely phenomenal. Also, my sister decided to order the chicken nachos and I honestly couldn't stop stealing chips from her plate. Everything on their menu sounded so delicious that it was hard for me to make a selection at first, but trust me, their taco plate is the way to go. If you're not a fan of Al Pastor, you can choose a substitute meat selection such as chicken or carne asada. The plate also comes with a heaping portion of rice and a cup of beans with melted cheese. Simply put, your tummy will be so happy you ate here!"}
{"text":"They had a free food demo a week before they opened it and the food was delicious! You can get the fish tacos super spicy or without any spice, but either way they're amazing. The pulled pork sandwich is awesome too and everything comes out really quick. They also take credit card and Apple Pay, if you don't carry cash"}
