{"text":"Came here for a lovely dinner with husband  been a few weeks ago and it was a great dining experience.   We enjoyed the dim sum that we ordered. Obviously it is more expensive than the typical Chinatown restaurant however this was justified. Unique dishes, amazing flavours, reminded me of my experience dining in high end dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong a few years ago.   Highly recommend the shrimp rice rolls. Had we not ordered so many dishes we definitely would have ordered a second helping of this amazing dish. We also ordered the green beans, ha gow, the special of the day - a wonderful honey shrimp dish, and vermicelli.   Only disappointment was the desert that we had which was a chocolate steamed cake. The cake part was not that sweet a bit on the bland side.   All in all it was a very nice experience and we will visit again."}
{"text":"I love this place.   The five of us went there yesterday for dinner, we ordered A LOT of dishes: 2 pound lobster (special, not on menu); dim sum basket (special, not on menu); mushroom salad (special, not on menu); spicy fried lotus root & Chinese celery; fried green beans; steamed sea bass; and a shrimp dish which the waiter recommended and is not on the menu yet.  We were full and amazed by the taste. The food are all Chinese style but mixed with Western ingredients, to me it's very unique.   It's not a cheap place to dine in, but for the taste and service, no complaint from me."}
{"text":"Below average taste with premium pricing. What a rip off.   I ordered a wonton soup, with two wontons in there,  price is $14.   Will never go back again, recommend others to explore other wonderful Chinese restaurants in the area as well."}
{"text":"Great service, but I think food and esp dim sum has been modified to create a new fusion taste, wasn't impressive."}
{"text":"Love the Shrimp cheung-fung! A little on the pricy side, but the food is good. High in salt, you'll need to drink tons of water later.  Save your behind and don't sit at the bar! They've got the most uncomfortable bar stools in the city!  The staff is - meh.... Lots of attitude and seem unhappy with their management. Definitely not the same fun vibe as Senses!"}
{"text":"Ryan's review (the 10 year old): I love this restaurant, but not all kids would like it. EVERYTHING is great. They also have a Summerlicious menu! In all, this is a great restaurant.  The mom's review:  we loved Luckee!  Despite the limited dinner menu due to Summerlicious, we found options that appealed to the whole family.  They were very accommodating with our order, as we combined a prix fixe menu and assorted dim sum.  All the food was tasty, with the Luckee basket, the potstickers, and the rice balls in the dessert tasting being the standouts.  The kid has requested another meal there!"}
{"text":"The quality and taste of the food is average in comparison to those served in the greater Toronto or downtown Toronto.  While the decor and service is better than average Chinese restaurants, it is hard to justify for the prices that this restaurant charges.   Of note, the Luckee duck (peking duck) was a smallish dish that had duck pieces cut poorly (ie. instead of having mostly sliced crispy skin, its skin + fat + meat cut perpendicularly like at meat shops).  The sesame donut was not cooked properly and had areas that were rock hard solid.    Not impressed....  There are so many better choices at half the price."}
{"text":"Went twice to Luckee with groups and had most of their dishes.  The shrimp cheung fun is the best thing on the dim sum menu and should definitely be tried.  I would avoid the har gow and siu mia as they are no different from places in Chinatown which you can get for half the price.    As for main courses, the peking duck was very good as well as the squid.  The fried rice we had however, was not very good."}
{"text":"Come here for mom's birthday.  Very attentive service.  They even gave us free tarts and birthday candle.  The black cod is heaven, the duck is good but I still like the Peking duck a bit more.  Overall, we had a lovely evening there."}
{"text":"Average quality food, drinks expensive and very poorly executed, had the Manhattan and it was disgusting. Food was brought out in poor sequence and was actually cold. Can not recommend this restaurant. Service though was friendly."}
{"text":"Luckee offers a unique modern interpretation of dim sum and includes classics, too. We sampled many of the dim sum items and found them all to be delicious and inspired. The soba noodle salad, too, was distinct in its flavouring and highly recommended. We will return soon for more."}
{"text":"Luckee:  The new best restaurant in Toronto.  I have called them on a friday hoping for a table for 3 people for dinner. Instead of saying: Sorry we are fully booked, they said: We are pretty much booked tonight but I will see what I cant do. Can you see the difference from all of the other new \"trendy\" snob downtown restaurants ? Unfortunately they were not able to secure us a table in the dinning room, but they did their best to assist. This is what I call customer service. Anyways, on sunday, fathers day, we decided to walk in to book a table for my boyfriends birthday. Again, we had great customer service.  I called the restaurant a few nights before our reservation to find out if I could bring my own champagne and also a cake before the time of our dinner. And heard, yes, sure, not a problem at all. We just have to pay the 30 dollars corkage fee and the 3.00 per person for the cake which I wanted to be a surprise. So I came earlier to drop it off.  Since my first contact with Maya, I could tell how Luckee is the new best place to go in Toronto. The 7 of us arrived and we were very welcomed by the hostesses ( I remember Maya and Chelsea's name, but all of them were superb), our server Martin went above and beyond to make ourselves comfortable and attend our requests. The food was cooked to perfection and the flavour of every single dish we ordered were simply delicious. Every one from the staff were smiling and always ready for any request we had. We all had an amazing time and will be back soon. I have to say that I am not surprised about the excellent service, knowing the restaurant is owned by Susur Lee. He knows what he is doing and also how to treat his staff. I know one of his former sous chefs and always heard compliments about his personality.  I would definitely recommend Luckee to every person who likes to have a good time, great food, ambience and genuine service.  Thank you all for being so welcome and making our night just perfect!"}
{"text":"I didn't have a yelp account before this review but used yelp a lot for guidance. However, after eating at Luckee I had to make this account just to tell people to STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT as much as possible. Honestly, it's one of the worst fusion styles, if not the most restaurant, I have ever tasted. Ingredients were added that seems like it was for the sole purpose of raising the price to a ridiculous level and made traditional dim sum takes like dish soap. The Shrimp tangbao were added with something that even made the smell unappealing and almost revolting, and eating tangbao without given Guangdong style vinegar is unheard of. Quantity of the dishes were very suitable for dim sum, if the prices where 6 times lower of what they actually charge at this Chinese-wanna-be decorated place. $24 for one piece of sticky rice chicken with one piece of mushroom, one chestnut, and one tiny piece of chicken is ripe off at its finest. My girlfriend tasted one bit of the chicken and then there were none left for me. I'm so mind-blown by the fact that such a traditional type of food can be ruined to this kind of disgraceful level, with none of the good value of the food left, and mended into a pile of dish that I most certainly will never visit again."}
{"text":"Host - Millennial dude with short cropped beard...douche  Seating - tried to seat us near the galley where waiters are clanging dishes...told them to move us...fixed it.   Wine list - average   Amuse bouche - 2 cm of stale watermelon, some jicama, maybe a radish...and edible flowers. The waitress seemed embarrassed to offer it.  Hot and sour soup - the highlight (that's not a good thing)  Dim Sum - some of the worst I've had...I'm NYC, in Singapore, in Bangkok, in Markham, in God forsaken Columbus, Ohio....Susur, you are the Master Chef of nothing.   Dessert...mango pudding...wretched.   Dinner for Two...190 with tip. My retirement account is weeping.   Lame."}
{"text":"Went to Luckee last night with my girlfriends for a delicious dinner.  The food did not disappoint however the service was lacking.  Our initial bottle of wine took over ten minutes to arrive,  after our first dish of dumplings, in a mostly empty restaurant, and when I commented on the timing, our waitress explained the bartenders were standing around talking and she was unable to get the Antane Chianti.   While the server was informed on the offering, timing and attentiveness fell short. You will find similar dim sum and probably Susur himself dinning on it for a 1/3rd of the price just 5 blocks north.  Happy to pay for the delicious food here, but for the price... I expect a higher level of service, or what am i paying for?  I know i can walk up Spadina with no service expectations and be blown away, give me a reason to not walk past this otherwise delicious resto. The service staffs own conversations were only interupted by the manger stopping to flirt, I guess the guests take a back seat on Friday nights, as we didn't feel an important part of the experience."}
{"text":"3.5/5! My husband really liked this place but I personally prefer Lee or Bent. The atmosphere is chic and the staff is very friendly. We recommend 3 out of the 4 dishes we ordered: sui mai, shrimp cheung feun rolls and the bang bang chicken. The 4th dish was a shrimp special that was too sweet for our liking. The experience is very dependent on what you order so read reviews and ask for recommendations from the staff - otherwise, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you think this place has good dim sum, you're either new or one of those douchebags who shops at whole foods. Been (taken here) twice and both times were incredibly disappointing.   Dim sum should come hot and quick and flavorful. Luckee did not meet any of these requirements. Both times.  Do yourself a favor and go to Asian Legend where you'll get way better dim sum and service for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing ambience and is great for a date. The dishes are delicious with tasteful drinks menu. Overall I would recommend this place. Great lighting and music as well."}
{"text":"To start, I am Asian and have had Asian food my entire life, so I have a pretty discerning palate when it comes to Asian food. I didn't have high expectations for this place. I have been to susur and did enjoy the dishes although some items can be found cheaper at many Asian restaurants.   What was nice about the servers was that they didn't assume that just because we were Asian that we should know about all the dishes, so they explained all the dishes to us.   I went to this restaurant a while ago and cannot recall all the dishes we had. I do remember having $12 Cheung fun, shrimp rice roll. It was nicely presented over a candle to keep it warm. For $12 I  was expecting something amazing. It was mediocre and I could have the same or better value at a restaurant up north."}
{"text":"went back during TIFF2014 and had Susur's off-menu Singapore Slaw.  it was very good and refreshing.  had a few other things too but can't recall now.  overall, a solid enough choice if i feel like paying more to sit in someplace nicer than a Spadina Ave restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!   I went here for a lunch date with my husband about a month ago and it was such a treat!   It was a pricy dim sum experience, but well worth it.  The stand out item for us was the pork soup dumplings.  I still drool just thinking about that delicious broth.  We ended up ordering a couple more servings of it.  We also enjoyed sharing the Luckee Duck- a beautiful combination of flavours and textures.  The service and decor was lovely- as you should expect from a nice/expensive place,  and the atmosphere had a nice laid back vibe.    Overall a great date experience where the food is the star."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. I went here for a birthday and the food was just incredible. We pretty much ate the entire menu and there wasn't anything I didn't enjoy.  It was probably the best Chinese meal I've ever had. The Sangria was so good, perfect fruit/alcohol mixture. I wish I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"The food was alright.  The deep fried tofu with Spinach, the short ribs are okay,  and lobster hai gow.  The prices are def over priced. The peiking duck was super dry.  If you really want good dim sum, you need to go to real deal Chinese food places like uptown Markham.  If you are a foreigner and do not know about dim sum, then sure. Btw the tea is $3.50 PER PERSON... What madness is this hahah"}
{"text":"We went the second night after Luckee opened. Space was nice. Chairs not. Music was irritating.  Not sure what genre was playing. Server had some memory issues. Menu enticing. Noodle dish tasty and good value, Spring rolls good, Lamb meatball overpriced for 2 small balls. Some of the other  dishes were small in portion For the money, Deserts were an odd selection and average. We will try it one more time for the dim sun. If this doesn't WOW us we won't return."}
{"text":"I went there recently and the food was okay but the service was great. The food as expected is a bit more expensive than going to a chinese restaurant on Spadina. But it is not unreasonable. The portions are small so they recommend that each person orders from 3-4 dishes for dinner. We ordered two dim sums and four mains and we were very full. I don't exactly remember the price of each meal, but the dim sums are around $6-8 and the mains are $15-30ish.  The chrysanthemum fish (deep fried fish) was pretty good. But the best was General Tao beef and the chcolate dip roll.  The beef was deep fried to perfection. The chocolate roll was delicious. I didn't expect dipping steamed cake in chocolate sauce would be so divine.  Do not order the thin noodles with seafood or the mapo tofu. Not good at all.  Would I go again? Probably not. If I feel like chinese food, it would make my tastebuds much happier if I go to a real chinese restaurant nearby."}
{"text":"Went here for the dim-sum brunch on a Saturday morning. We were 4 people and shared 6 dishes. We went with the recommendations of the waiter, so had the items that he claimed were the best/most popular.  Most items were OK, I wasn't that huge a fan of any particular dish other than the Chicken Cheung-Fun Rice roll which I found delicious! The one item that I absolutely did not like was the Crispy House Made Spinach Tofu. It was absolutely not crispy and was not visually appealing, nor did it really taste like anything.  We also had the Har Gao (shrimp dumplings), Chicken Bao (chicken dumplings), XIao Long Bao (pork soup dumplings) and Luckee Duck. These were all OK.  The pricetag (which also included 2 mimosas) including tip & tax was approx $150, and we weren't particularly full, so it's pretty darn expensive for a satisfactory brunch. The cart service was beginning just as we left.  I am a huge fan of Lee Restaurant and was disappointed with this. Will likely not go again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Luckee restaurant twice now, once when it first opened and a second time today for brunch.  The restaurant has changed its menu a little, with a separate dim sum menu as well as the occasional dim sum cart/tray that came around offering items like curry squid, black bean short ribs, pan fried cake, and such. The curry squid was quite nice, with a deep curry flavour and spiced with lemongrass. It was tender and cooked perfectly, and is something I wish they offered on their regular dim sum menu.  On the recommendation of our waiter, we tried the cheung fun (rice noodle roll) - we ordered the vegetarian one which came stuffed with spinach and crispy chinese doughnut. It was delicious but if you order this, ask the waiter to allow you to pour the sauce yourself. Our waiter poured ours without asking, which made the crispy doughnut too soggy over time.  The deep fried beef baos were still as good as I remembered, and the bacon fried rice was a gem. The sui mai came with a scallop and truffle on top, a nice touch. The best dish was the dumpling with scallop inside; forgive me as the name escapes me but it comes with 3 per order and has a red gogi berry on it. The mango pudding dessert was delicious as was the ginger custard tart, not too sweet and small enough to allow a nice finish to the meal.  We sat in front of the glass enclosed kitchen with full view of the preparations and going-ons; a real treat to see your food being made by these expert dim sum chefs.  I wish I could give Luckee 5 stars but could not due to the following: - The hostess, while moving a high chair, banged it hard against the back of my mom's dining chair, which startled her. Nobody likes to be started like that during their dining experience, and it seemed to take her a minute to realize she should apologize for such a mistake.  - When we received fresh plates for our desserts, there was a curly short hair on my sister's plate. The busboy did not even notice and when my sister pointed it out, he did not apologize, took the plate away and came back way too quickly with another plate. We both wondered if he had actually gotten a new plate or had just wiped the hair off. It was pretty gross. - When we paid for our bill, I mentioned the above incident to our actual waiter, who was apologetic but didn't know that the above happened. In most establishments, there is good communication between all the wait staff so I'm surprised that the bus boy didn't tell him such (the bus boy was also incompetent; when I asked him about the white tea, he replied \"I don't know, I don't remember the name\", and then proceeded to stand there without bothering to find out the info). The waiter did want to comp our desserts but I had already paid so he said the next time I dine he'll ensure I'm taken care of. A nice gesture and a compliment to him for doing so.  Overall, I would go to Luckee again. It's a beautiful room to have dim sum in and the food is delicious and interesting. I would just wish for better service and attention to detail next time."}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience here! The service was wonderful. The dim sum was a bit pricey but amazing and in my view, 100% worth it. We had  4 dim sum dishes and 1 shrimp dish from the Chinese menu and we were stuffed. I have every intention of returning the next time I'm in TO. To quote my girlfriend: \"It's so good that it feels like it's giving my throat a hug\""}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this new Chinese fusion restaurant by Susur Lee. It was difficult to make reservations, at the time I called, they said there was only the chef's table area left but they were able to give us a table at the dinning room. When we got there, the place was pretty packed with people eating already and as we dined, more came to pack the room. The service was pretty quick, we got in and out within an hour ... very unusual for a downtown restaurant.  The decor was ancient China, with Chinese words, decorations, paintings. For appetizers, we all got the Luckee duck - it was 4 pieces of Peking style duck, wrappers and sauce. I was really surprised it had that many pieces of duck and wrappers. Usually in the Chinese setting, there is only 1-2 wrapper to go around. The duck skin was crispy and the meat was tender, very delicious. My only comment would be that I still like it served with cucumbers and parsley like the traditional way instead of with coleslaw.  Next came the mains, I got the 5 spice chicken with cauliflower purée, baby spinach, orange & lily bulb, honey miso dressing. There were 3 pieces of chicken wrapped with battered and fried. I didn't taste much of the 5 spice in the chicken, and with the cauliflower puree, the dish was quite blend, so if you like flavour on the light side, you would enjoy this more. The others got the baked black cod with pickled beets, crispy bean curd skin & lotus root, chipotle tartar sauce. The cod was very flavourful with the soya marinated and with the chipotle sauce, a much stronger taste compared to the chicken. I prefer the cod more in this category.  For dessert, we got the trio - Chocolate sponge roll, Sesame rice donut and vanilla ice cream. It was good we got all 3 desserts to eat as I couldn't decide which one I wanted. My favourite was the seasme rice donut, freshly prepared so the crust was not oily, filled with warm lotus paste and egg yolk, delicious! It is the best one I have eaten in my life, better than those I have at dim sum time, and yes, even the ones I've had in HK. I wish I got more of that. The chocolate sponge roll was good as well, layer of sponge cake with chocolate sauce spread and roll into a roll. The chocolate was not that sweet so it wasn't overpowering. The vanilla ice-cream was nothing out of the ordinary, thought the menu said it is drizzled with salted caramel sauce but we didn't get any of that on our ice-cream. Maybe that was what was missing to make it taste better.  Then our bill came with a bamboo basket of fortune cookies. It was a very cute presentation. Overall, it was worth the $35 dinner price, service was good, food was delicious."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced, but it's Susur so of course it would be: he's famous so, you need to pay for that.  He was there the day we went and he came around the dining room greeting the guests. Very elegant and nice man! We felt special.  The food was good, but as other reviewers pointed out it wasn't as special as I would have hoped it to be. There were as many disappointments as there were pleasant dishes, but overall I still somewhat enjoyed it. Service people were nice but clumsy, I had to assist them, often balancing heavy plates in my own hands to move them out of the way as they arrived with more dishes than could fit on the table. They should definitely clear tables before bringing new stuff.   I personally liked the decor, I thought it was vibrant and neat.   I may not return given all the other places on my to do list and that it was not as outstanding as I would have hoped. I still have a mildly positive impression of my experience there."}
{"text":"I've heard Susur Lee for many times. I always wanted to try.  Finally we had a girl's night out and went there!   This place does not disappoint me!! It has great interior and most importantly, great food!   Their service is unbeatable!  Although it's kind of pricey, it's totally worthy it! I highly suggest for their WUXI BRAISED PORK RIB. It was so good that I am going for it next week!  It's hard to get a group appointment, I suggest to book as early as you can!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful- really enjoyed the har gow, spicy squid and mango pudding. I am a huge fan of Susur so was expecting a lot. Fortunately Luckee delivered on the food side; however service was REALLY slow (waited 20 minutes for drinks, or even for the waiter to return to take our orders at various times).   Decor is very nice- Asian-modern fusion similar to Dailo. Cocktails are really yummy (Yuzu Mojito was my fave) but a tad expensive at $16 a pop. If you are looking for cheap eats, this isn't for you. If you are looking for slightly elevated Chinese food that is served in a really beautiful and sexy setting, check out Luckee.   Overall, I would return for the food but hope service is much improved next time!   Bonus:  Vij Vikram was dining at an adjacent table, just to say there's some serious good eats good going on at Luckee :-)x"}
{"text":"Very disappointed the worst dim sum I have eaten, bad service, dim sum was dried cold and lacking flavour. Over hyped restaurant, deco ok for a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"Unapologetically the worst service I've had in years. Our entire order was misinterpreted, much of the food came out late, and we had to re-order our meal over and over until they got it right. Getting all of our mains 15 minutes before our rice makes no sense (after reminding them several times). Terrible music. Cold dinner."}
{"text":"I went here for a three course summerlicious meal. I really enjoyed their hot and sour soup and would come back for this dish alone. It's one of the better hot and sour soups I've had. The main dish was lackluster, the cold soba salad with 21 local ingredients. It needed more flavour. I thought it would taste like the slaw at Bent, but I was sadly mistaken. Not even remotely close. The dessert was good- I liked the mango dish a lot. I was expecting much more flavour because of the hype."}
{"text":"Great decor in the lounge. Red chairs, dimly lit. The service was great in the lounge. The menu is the same in the restaurant as it is in the lounge. You don't have to make reservations for the lounge. There is a cucumber vodka lime drink that was very mild but wonderful tasting. The food was decent. All of Susur's restaurants pale in comparison to the original Susur. Here they have dumplings, soups and typical Chinese fare. The tofu and mushroom dishes were great. Lots of vegetarian options as well as Seafood and Meat. My stomach was extremely upset at the end of the meal and I had to rush home. Otherwise I would have given a higher rating"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Lee, so had to try this next. Wine, cocktail and draft beer selections are great. We tried the Luckee dim sum basket - my favourite is their har gow. We also had their lobster cheung fun, which was delicious. The Luckee duck is extremely well done and a must try. We think the food loses a star for value - portions are a little small given the price and style of food you're getting (pretty much ramped up Cantonese). The desserts were also average, but good cap-offs for the meal - prefer the gaidaanjai to the sesame balls. We'd probably come back for dim sum at the bar. Good service, good decor and good vibes at this place overall."}
{"text":"Love Susur spots, like to try them all!  Came by for dinner, the service was great and we were seated quickly. We had a bunch of different dietary restrictions across the table from my shellfish allergy to my wife's meat allergy (vegetarian). They were extremely accommodating and made a lot of good recommendations. Luckee Duck was awesome, Hot and Sour was great too."}
{"text":"Good traditional Chinese food with a little fancy twist. The service was great and fast."}
{"text":"When you come to this restaurant, you are paying through the nose for location and atmosphere. Very trendy. All of the staff seemed young and fit. Really noisy, loud music. My family and I had to practically yell at each other to be heard.   We were told by the waitress that each of us (there were 4 of us) should order 2 dishes for there to be enough food. That was a warning about small portions, and she was not kidding!! Normally, at a Chinese restaurant, I always have leftovers to take home. That was definitely not the case here.   The food was quite tasty, and yes, the portions were painfully small. I suspect our waitress forgot to put one of our items down because the item came much later than the rest and only after I asked if it would be coming soon.   It was definitely the first time I have had to pay $200 for a Chinese dinner for 4."}
{"text":"The best restaurant I had in a long time great service and fabulous food 5star restaurant.i ordered rainbow basket lobster chueng funn shrimp dumplings  Each dish just out do the last dish definitely will have to come back.the manager Eric was excellent in helping  with my order"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I would highly recommend to anyone who is craving some good quality authentic Chinese food. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Visited them for Winterlicious last week. This restaurant was on my list for a long time. Heard a lot about chef Susur Lee, so wanted to eat at one of his restaurants.   The food was pretty good but the portions were ridiculously tiny. For starter I had the sweet corn soup, it had 4-5 kernels of popped corn, 1 morsel of crab meat and about 30-40 ml soup. I ordered 5-spiced chicken dish for the mains as the waitress recommended that this would have the biggest portion size, but it was two spoonful rice and 3 wing sized chicken pieces. We had to eat elsewhere in an hour after a 3-course lunch. The service was good as you would expect in a fine dine restaurant. The location is convenient too.   Probably won't be back as the portions were too small."}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite places in the city. A great restaurant for a special occasion dinner or those looking to try dim sum for the first time.   Everything from their service to ambience is top notch.   I'm a simple guy but the har gow is mind blowing and a must have...just look at how good it looks in the picture! Do yourself a favour and make resos for this place quick."}
{"text":"I came here with family and we ordered many dishes. My favorite were the cheung fun rolls, peking duck wraps with foie gras, string beans, bang bang chicken wraps and mango almond pudding for dessert. I also tried three of their cocktails- Manhattan, mojito and yuzu martini. My cousin had their sangria and looked pretty good with different types of fruits inside. Great atmosphere and the kitchen bar seating looked like a cool spot if you come by yourself or with another person. The ambiance was upscale and cute. I believe Susur Lee's wife designed the layout of the restaurant and definitely fitting with his twist on traditional chinese food."}
{"text":"Went to Luckee for winterlicious but ended up ordering of the A la carte menu.  The food was really good with good portion size.  It's very different from Susur Lee's restaurant -Lee.  It's the perfect place to go for a \"good experience\"  The service was good and the food was good- drinks are a bit pricey but overall a good experience.  Recommend: the soy cod, it melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Not feeling so Luckee here. Not enough dim sum choices. Our server wasn't attentive or knowledgeable about their menu. For a half empty restaurant we had to wait a significant amount of time for our food.   What we had: - siu mai (can get better in Chinatown) - shrimp cheun feng (delicious) - sweet and sour cod (don't order)  I was very disappointed since we specifically went to try their xiao long bao and beef bao but they were both sold out!! On top of that we weren't blown away with what we had.   Go to Crown Princess instead!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The only thing out of almost the whole menu we ordered that we didn't love was Our favourite was the (not spelled right) Chung fun rice roll chicken and shrimp both fantastic. The black sesame tart dessert was great too. Happy to pay the prices they charge here."}
{"text":"Har gow for $9 seems steep, and most other dim sum were at that price level.  For that, I'm expecting some of the best I ever had.  It was good, but not *that* good.  Most of the other dim sum followed that trend as well.  However, my wife & parents really enjoyed the food here.  My wife says they use a lot of pepper in their food though.  Highlights: 1. Desserts.  Their lemon profiterole was fantastic; one of the better Toronto ones I've had.  Their tart wasn't bad either.  It was the opposite of the profiterole in that the flavour was subtle. 2. Siu Mai.  They had this coming around on the cart, and it was different from the one on the menu.  Very tasty as it had a sliver of liver, and truffle oil.  At $6 for 2, I actually found this to be reasonable.  I'd go back if I were in the area at the right time, etc.  Personally, I wouldn't go out of the way recommending or wanting to come back.  However, I'd be comfortable with coming back."}
{"text":"I agreed with the previous reviews that the restaurant is nice, it has trendy deco, cute presentation of dim sums but the food is just not impressive. We ordered 4pc dim sum basket (siu Mai is below average), crab meat soup dumpling (Not the authentic soup dumpling while dumpling was in soup?!), Abalone dumpling (interesting), and the house special soba noodle salad (soba was lack of flavor). It's quite pricey compared to the small portion and the quality of food. This is a nice place to hangout for Asian fusion food but not for good and authentic chinese dim sum."}
{"text":"This was a last minute pick on the long weekend. Kind of my approach towards all religious holidays (one should have Chinese food and stay neutral :)  My friends had already made reservations and all we needed to do was show up. The place was somewhat busy on the dinning side as they bar area was spartan (though it seems like it fills up being in a hotel etc.)  First off the dinning area had a very strong food smell so (maybe we felt it strongly as we were seated near the cooking area)  We were a group of 4 so decided to share some dim sum items and and ordered a few mains that could have been shared. The dim sum fared well  Har Gow a yardstick for dim sum IMO was done non traditionally. It was quite good. Nice crunch on the shrimps with a delicate wrapper.  Chicken Pot Stickers again decent IMO. I am not a fan of pot stickers but these were just fine STEAMED SPINACH & CHINESE CELERY DUMPLINGS. This was again quite good.  So far so good as the dim sum menu with a modern take on classics was worth a visit and recommended for sharing. Now on to the mains We decided to order mains for each of us though I did taste all the items SPICY SOYA BEAN CRUMBLE SHRIMP. Despite it being labeled hot it had a sweet finish. My friends even asked for hot pepper flakes to elevate the taste.  Sweet and sour chicken. Even for sweet and sour chicken this one was way too sweet. Nice presentation but the taste faltered. CHAR SIU BEEF SHORT RIBS. Cooked very well as was just falling apart. It could have been a home run if it wasn't for the overly sweet notes. The mains were all a generous portion.  A tricky rating for moi as the dim sum was quite good with the mains being the downer. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Had a great time at this place - Most of the disappointed reviewers here seemed to be expecting this to compete with run-of-the-mill Sunday morning dim sum, but that in itself is an unreasonable expectation.  Luckee is dim sum, Susur Lee style. Crafty edits to classic dishes. Excellent drinks. Impeccable service. Tasteful decor. Luckee is dim sum, elevated. If you're only interested in having dim sum on a Sunday at a traditional Cantonese style restaurant, then this isn't the place for you.  Favourite dish was the Cheung fan - great presentation and excellent texture, a novel twist on an already great dish."}
{"text":"Had a great time here on a Saturday night (it was a busy night but didn't seem crowded).  Overall, I think the dishes seem very \"traditional\" (from what I know), which could pose a challenge for the restaurant in that cheaper, delicious \"traditional\" dim sum can be found approximately 2 blocks north of this restaurant in Chinatown.  Having said that, the service here was amazing - servers were very friendly and attentive, which is not what you would get at a Chinatown dim sum restaurant.  - Chicken cheun feng - delicious. there is a crispy layer inside which was a surprise. - Duck pancake - also very good, and not as greasy as other ones I've had (big plus) - Shrimp har gow (dumplings) - also delicious, but portions are small for what you pay for   I ordered a few other dishes equating to about $40 a person, before gratuities. I recommend this place if you want the \"Susur Lee\" experience, and a high-quality meal. If you want equally as delicious dim sum without breaking the bank, go to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I would definite definitely come back here. For first timers I'd suggest a few dishes to try on just to get a feel for the fusion food. I tried the braised beef,  which was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"7$ charge for jasmine tea is ridiculous,  overpriced gimmicky food served in a dining room resembling a glorified ho-lee chow take away."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here very much and I would expect nothing less from chef Lee. The couple of times I have eaten here, its been in the lounge and service was friendly and attentive. The dumplings are absolutely delicious, but the wonton soup is my favorite! Nice atmosphere and music to add to the overall experience! Prices are on the high end, but that's to be expected from such a great restaurant in the lobby of a hotel.  Definitely recommend.."}
{"text":"Completely overpriced 1st and 2nd courses and it was the Winterlicious menu. Totally ordinary food. Desserts were surprisingly good as was the service which is the reason I give it 2 stars. Unfortunately the desserts and staff cannot make up for the absurd price charged."}
{"text":"From the decor to the service to the food, Luckee was amazing! The room is spacious with red walls adorned with Chinese art. The tables had charming printed paper tablecloths. The service was prompt and friendly. Our water glasses were never empty.   I came with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. I suggest making a reservation well in advance, as we made ours on Thursday and 6 pm or 10 pm were the only available time slots.   We had: Taro and turnip pancakes - 5/5 so unique and delicious.   Chicken cheung fun -5/5 - This dish is all about texture. Crispy chicken inside the rice roll-- a really interesting take on dim sum. *this is a really big appetizer, I recommend getting it with a larger group.*  General Tao Beef - 4/5 very tasty, nice and crispy, not at all spicy.   3-cup chicken clay pot - 5/5 OMG STANDOUT DISH. Chicken was cooked to perfection, the space was delicious and i loved the baked apricot.   Vermicelli noodles (the ones without crab) 5/5 - light, tasty noodles.  Spinach and chrysanthemum leaf salad - 5/5 if you like vegetable dishes, this is a great one. I loved the peanut sauce!  Dessert: - coconut rice balls 4/5 - Really interesting flavours and textures. Not overly sweet.   I highly recommend Luckee!"}
{"text":"Went for their Winterlicious menu and left with a good impression.  Unlike many other Susur Lee establishments,  Luckee has a muted fusion influence,  focusing mainly on reinterpreting traditional Chinese dishes.  I recommend ordering the soya marinated baked black cod for the entree for that buttery melt-in-the mouth fillet, and the umami kick from the soya marinade. The 5 spice chicken is also wonderfully seasoned and delicious. Full review here: https://nommynoms.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/winterlicious-2015-luckee-review/  :)"}
{"text":"The dim sum was seriously so good, but the truffle on the siu Mai was quite dry. Hak gao was the best I've ever eaten, I recommend that to anyone. The mushroom at the bottom of the Hak gao was cooked to perfection.   We didn't get a fortune cookie at the end tho :( where is my cheesy advice   Apparently there is \"discounted\" parking at the bottom of the Soho hotel, but parking across the street is actually half the price ($10). There is wifi available and they make raspberry mojitos that are off menu if you choose to request it.   Decor is on fleek, it's freaken beautiful"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try!  Came here with a friend for Dim Sum a few weeks back -- ordered the Siu Mai, Chicken Cheung Fun, Braised Black Pepper Beef Bao, and the Crispy and Taro Turnip Cake.  The standouts were the Cheung Fun (fried chicken, hard to go wrong) and the Bao (fried dough and beef -- again, hard to go wrong).  Reasonably priced, too -- Came to about $20/person, including tax and tip.  Overall, I'm still a fan of classic Dim Sum -- Rol San is the best I've had in the city -- and I wouldn't make Luckee a regular spot.  But absolutely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Came for Summerlicious 2017. Very clean restaurant. Lots of artwork and decor in general. I do like the design.  There's a hotel beside the restaurant, and they share the washroom space. It's not a particularly large washroom but it's nice and well-maintained.  Service in general is great. We came as a group of 14 under two separate reservations, and they were able to combine the two tables together. Water refills come frequently, your server checks up on you. If you're looking for the restrooms and you're walking the wrong way, they will ask you if you're looking for the restrooms and take you there (if they are not holding a platter of dishes)  I coordinated with the diner beside me to split two different apps and entrees so that we can try more options. Food was pretty hit-or-miss to me, but given that it's a licious event and the items were not on the regular menu, that might be why. Specifically, the crispy shrimp & lobster wontons and baked chicken were better than the saliva chicken salad and the soya glazed cod.  Portions seemed pretty small for the price, and it would not be a good experience if the dishes you chose weren't the better ones.  The dishes on the regular menu or dimsum menu may be more consistent in quality."}
{"text":"Nothing really shines out. You can definitely have some better food at traditional Chinese dim sum restaurants. the interior design is good tho."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum and food . Top quality  Service was very good as well  I strongly recommend"}
{"text":"I thought this place was bit over priced for the dim sum. An average piece was around $8... But they didn't seem to be worth the value.  I ordered the beef short ribs lunch bowl for $18. Now that was amazing!!! I loved every bite of the meat.   The place it self was upscale Chinese food. The service was outstanding. My water was always filled, and I was drinking  lots of it! The server recommended us some great choices.  There is the normal menu, then there is also speciality items that servers walk around in a cart with. I thought that was pretty cool.  I wouldn't recommend this place for the dim sum as it's not worth the value. I think it's just over priced because it's attached to a hotel. However, the place will get a 3 stars because the beef short ribs saved them."}
{"text":"I don't know how to start this review - Over priced, semi-authentic Chinese food? This isn't Lee's fusion cuisine we all have come to love, nor is it authentic, down to earth chinese food. I mean, the food was good but definitely overpriced. I think we paid like $25 bucks for fried calamari. Good, but again the value not there...Meh. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Interesting place to come. Its a bar-like dim sum. Food was good?especially for the roasted duck."}
{"text":"Quality food, mediocre service, and horrendous price. The food here would have to be much more delicious, or a bit cheaper, or at least served with a little more attention to bring me back. Meh all the way."}
{"text":"I came here for afternoon drinks and a snack during TIFF. We got two seats at the bar near the lounge and the bartenders were very friendly and attentive. Loved the vibe here. The atmosphere here is great with the decor and lighting. You wouldn't think you were in a lounge near a hotel entrance.   Onto the food: we got a double order of the Rainbow Gow to share between 2 people (you can get this for one person, too). It was delicious and I enjoyed trying all the flavors but I wouldn't say I would pay $26 for it again. We also got the spring roll which was tiny and underwhelming. Not the worst I've had, not the best I've had.   I enjoyed my time here but I think I would want to try other dishes if I were to come back. I think you're paying to be here and the ambiance more than the food (just judging on the small amount we had)."}
{"text":"Luckee is my fav for Chinese. Ordering your first time can be difficult, but all of the servers are super helpful. They are also very careful and accommodating with allergies which I appreciate. Dishes I get usually:  - Teanhouse Turnip Cake with Taro Rosti - Chicken Potstickers - Chicken Cheung Fun - Green Beans - Short Ribs (these are the best) - vegetable fried rice. The menu changed and now they dont technically have vegetable fried rice, but if you ask they will make it!"}
{"text":"Service was warm and gracious. We had the dim sum, an absolute delight, the chocolate desert was divine. We'll be back, with friends"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The overall yelp rating for this restaurant I believe is fair. My boyfriend and I ordered 4 dishes, 2 being great, while the other 2 disappointments.  Let's begin with the good. I thought the cheung fun was spot on. Various tastes in texture. It was soft, but then crunchy, and after spongey! It was all sorts of fun. I really enjoyed this dish. I thought Susur's fusion take on this dim sum dish was fantastic. Highly recommend ordering. Next, we had the butter nut squash skin hargow. I really loved the fusion take on this one as well. Very tasty.  Now the other 2 dishes were so sub par comparing to our first 2 dishes. I thought the duck was nothing special and the crispy tofu too. Both were lackluster in flavors, textures but presentation wise it was aesthetically pleasing. I think this restaurant is a hit or miss depending on  what you order. Overall, just ok."}
{"text":"Ironically, the only thing I did not enjoy at Luckee was their traditional dim sum. We got Luckee Baskets to start, which featured pieces of Har Gow (shrimp), Siu Mai (shrimp, chicken mix) and Long Xia Gow (lobster and asparagus). My friend and I agreed these were tasty, but not particularly remarkable. The fourth and final piece contained wagyu beef, and was (for a lack of a better words) \"meh\", bordering on \"ew\".   Aside from this one misstep, the food was great. To start the meal off, they provided edamame and a selection of condiments, including an interesting green onion sauce. The Chicken Cheung Fun blended textures and flavours beautifully. The signature duck (Peking style wraps - duck and the crispy skin served with relishes, garnishes such as green onion, green apple, and cilantro, and pancake paper on the side, so you can create your own \"wraps\") was superb. It did remind me heavily of Lee's duck dish at his eponymous restaurant however.  Service was efficient. Our waitress was nice enough to offer to bring us extra pancakes for our duck dish without us even asking (quite attentive), and recommend the house sake, which was quite smooth and not overly sweet.  I would probably come back to try the crispy prawn dish with \"golden sand\", which seemed popular. Even if it doesn't taste amazing, it would make a beautiful Instagram!"}
{"text":"For the price the food misses the mark more often then it should. The lobster dumpling really lacks flavor and texturally the lobster itself is subpar. A standard har gow from most of the dimsum places nearby taste much better. The worst dish I had here was the vermicelli with crab. The price for the dish was very steep and there was no flavor at all to the dish. There were a few lumps of crab scattered throughout but the dish was bland. If you took the crab out no one would notice and then it would be a 3$ dish.   The white fish and softshell crab dish is a neat idea and plates beautifully but eats rather poorly. The crab stuffed with fish already has a fried texture and so the accompaniments of an entire plate of fried things (egg, garlic, etc) adds flavour but just doesn't eat well.  It seems with Susur's restaurants you really can have a good meal IF you order the right dishes. Though for the price I don't think I'll experiment a 3rd time. Most everything I've had here is definitely sub-par and I'm embarrassed to say I took a friend here on her birthday .   The dimsum sauces brought to the table though interesting are unimpressive. The shrimp cheung fun and cocktails are the only highlights. I do believe Susur is a great chef with tremendous knowledge ( displayed in how well the meat is usually cooked ) but he really does need to start trying again because this just makes me sad."}
{"text":"Ohh so sad and angry at myself, I came here for a first time when they just opened abut a year ago the food was on point the sweet and sour chicken was incredible and the scallops were to die for I had dreams about it they were like butter and melted in your mouth I actually ordered twice that time they were seared to perfection and glazed with a beautiful amber sauce . So I decided to come back for my bday and what a disappointment the s&s chicken was dry and not crispy enough and the scallops were breaded !!!  What??? Doughy chewy and uncooked omg why did I have to erase such a beautiful memory fortunately the manager removed from the bill not coming back !! Forgettable"}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to tonight's dinner for a week since we waited that long for the reservation. Susur and his team did not disappoint. Food was amazing and staff / service was impeccable !!   Ordered a pot of wonderful jasmine tea which was so fragrant and fresh tasting.   This was likely the best Chinese dinner I've ever had in my life. That being said - it's not your everyday Spadina good Chinese food prices - it's expensive. Dinner, Sake, Tax and Tip came to $270. Truth be told the Sake came to $90 on its own ........A little pricey......but it sure was yummy. And I will certainly go back and try some other items like the duck.   We started with the \"lucky basket\" which had four dim sum appetizers inside ; a lobster and asparagus dumpling, chicken & shrimp dumpling topped with a scallop, a beef dumpling with maitake, and har gow (shrimp dumpling). When served explained all the ingredients as he opened the little steam basket and each one was absolutely wonderful - each one certain elevated from the typical dim sum and some flavour profiles nothing like anything I've had before.......Delicious    We had fried wok fried green beans which were just so wonderful and crispy with a garlic sauce that they were delicately fried in. Not greasy & truly very delicious.   Ordered Berkshire Sweet & Sour Pork that was served with fresh pineapple and the sauce was the best.   Kung Pao Chicken that was just amazing with peppers and your lips had a nice after mild heat sensation - just beautiful dish !!   Fried rice with scallops & bacon which was just so yummy.   We ordered too much food but thankfully we took the leftovers home.   Had warm Sake (which could have been a little warmer). But it was served very nicely in a container that had hot water bath and the warm sake resting in another container inside.  All in all the dinner was amazing. The restaurant was beautiful and relaxing from the decor to the table setting. Lots of beautiful details with nothing overlooked.   Can't wait to return for possibly a weekend brunch or another dinner. Just a wonderful restaurant to add to the many that you bookmark and return to. Would be great for groups or even a quite diner for two."}
{"text":"Great place for some amazing dim sum and Susur Lee's take on Chinese dishes. We had 3 dim sum items and 3 dinner plates and they were all great!"}
{"text":"After being up all night for good fun, I got up early to get Luckee.   The highlights:   Long Xia Gao ($9)- 2 x dumplings filled with lobster with asparagus. Susur added a very subtle, almost undetectable coconut flavour, making it one of the most unique Gaos I've had. Fun fact of the day, \"Long Xia\" in the title is Chinese for lobster. Pronounced like \"Noon Shia\" and not a \"Long Shia.\"  Shrimp Cheung Fun ($12)- I felt quite hesitant to get a plate of cheung fun for $12 when it can be had for $2.80 at a Middle-Aged-Chinese-Lady-Cart-Pushing dimsum place. And so, I looked at the waiter and said ...\"I'm quite hesitant to get a plate of cheung fun for $12 when it can be had for a quarter of the price at $2.80, at a Cart-Pushing-Middle-Aged-Chinese Lady dimsum place.\" Not amused, the waiter insisted that \"trust me, this is special.\" He was right. Filled with deep fried rice pieces surrounding the shrimp surrounding the cheung fun, it was the perfect chewy-crunchy -soft combo.  Almond and crab cake ($7)- Imagine a Haagen Daz bar. But salty. And not sweet. And crunchier. And hot. Okay fine. It tastes nothing like a Haagen Dazs bar. But it looks like one and that's just as cool!  The dessert with the most tang and flavour, the mango passion fruit pudding ($8)  Overall, a great spot for a slightly more unique, more upscale dim sum experience with no Middle Aged-Chinese-Lady pushing carts in sight."}
{"text":"The shrimp cheung fung just made my list of favourite dishes. The best interpretation of this popular Chinese dim sum plate I have ever had the pleasure to devour in my life. I will keep coming back for this even in my dreams. Yes, it's that good. The restaurant itself has is a cheeky play on Chinese food and culture. You can tell they had a lot of fun with the concept which gave it an upbeat vibe. I was served by one of the industry's standards for servers. Her name was Nakeesha or \"quiche\" like the food. I wish I could have her as my pocket server so she could make all my dining experiences as exceptional as the one she gave me the first time I dined at Luckee. Genuine, energetic, knowledgeable and very comfortable with her style she delivered a seamless evening and made a lasting impression. Bring your date, bring your friends, bring your family, kiddies and all. Go and get Luckee."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Toronto, dim sum at one of the many suburban Chinatown restaurants is generally on the menu. This time around, with afternoon activities planned at Rogers Centre and at Ripley's Aquarium, a nearby restaurant would be more convenient. And lucky for us, Luckee is that restaurant. Located on the ground level of the SoHo Metropolitan Hotel, Luckee offers a different take on the traditional dim sum. First off, instead of push carts, guests order from a well-curated menu, although servers do circulate with daily specials offered. Also, the open kitchen provides a view of chefs at work, while Plexiglass keeps heat and noise to a minimum. There are many spaces within the restaurant, all of them decorated with rich colors and Chinese-inspired designs. Rotating screens with the characters ??? proclaim the delicious meal to be had.  We shared numerous small plates, each with 2-4 pieces for sharing.  The good: * Har Gow - the flavorful dumplings included rough-chop shrimp in butternut squash skins and were served with wood ear mushrooms. * Shrimp Cheung Fun - served with a sweet soy sauce, the dish was simply outstanding, exceeding similar dishes that I had previously tasted. * Siu Mai - the Chicken and shrimp dumplings were topped with a thinly sliced scallop and shaved truffles were yummy. * Braised Black Pepper Beef Buns - were exquisite. Crispy but fluffy buns were filled with a peppery beef mixture. * Crispy Taro and Turnip Cakes - were in a word, amazing. I am so glad we ordered them. Typically, they look like a deck of cards and are filled with diced Chinese sausages and dried shrimp. Here, however, they bear little resemblance to other offerings.  The average: * Lobster and Asparagus Dumplings was topped with edamame was okay. * Spring Rolls - were similar to those found at other restaurants.  Did not care for: * Steamed Barbecue Buns - the diced barbecue pork (char siu) were steamed in a fluffy, though slightly dry, sweet bun. * Fried Rice - unfortunately, lacked flavor.  Too full to try:  * Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf - sticky rice filled with sliced Chinese sausages, chicken, shrimp, and mushrooms.  * Xiao Long Bao - dumplings filled with broth and pork.  The servers were attentive. Since we were a large group gathered around a long table, I appreciated that the restaurant split up the dishes so that there was minimal reaching (except for when I was taking pictures)."}
{"text":"If you want a true Chinese fusion dining experience with good service this is the right place. I have been thrice for dinner and waited to write the review and every time has been on the spot. I would highly recommend the Cheung Fun (white rice noodle wrapped shrimp or chicken with crispy bites inside with a yummy soy based sauce), Tofu and Seafood infused dishes. The menu changes slightly so I'm recommending the type of food we had rather than a specific dish. The menu is divided into sections so picking one/two under each heading is the best way to see what the restaurant has to offer. The Rice & Noodles section is a good idea for a reasonable sized sharing place - the vermicelli with crabs we had was amazing.  B/c all of the dishes are actually yummy and well presented, the traditional dim sum basket shined the least on our table.  Ambiance and service are both top notch. you can also see the inside of the kitchen. Since the place is at the lobby of the soho building, there is a discounted parking underground but i found its cheaper and easier to park across the street in the public lot."}
{"text":"Not what you'd expect from a dim sum place. I understand that the concept of this restaurant was to put a more modern twist on traditional dim sum, but it was so far off that I really couldn't convince myself to like it.   Came in on a Sunday morning around 11ish and the place wasn't too packed, so I got seated immediately. The hostess was a sweet gal. After that, I was asked if I wanted water and when I said yes, they brought out a bottle and poured me a glass. I didn't think anything of it, but little did I know... That water was going to cost me $5.50.   The menu didn't have many options, so don't expect any of your favorite dim sum dishes. Everything has its own twist, which is fine because I was looking to try something new anyway.   The 3 dishes that I ordered were mediocre at best. The waiter suggested their Cheun Fun, so I ordered the shrimp and was not impressed. The Shiu Mai also wasn't very good. For 3 dishes, a mimosa and water.. My bill came out to $55 for one person, which is a bit excessive for dim sum that wasn't even satisfying, so I really recommend saving your money and going to a more authentic spot."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious last night. I like the atmosphere and the design of the restaurant, the big clear glass overlooking the ingredients picking area. They must be so popular because the only reservation I can make for 5 people on a weekday night was at 9:30pm, and I made it 3days in advance.   For the price and the high class look of the restaurant, I expect the food to be fantastic. Top notch. I was left wondering why it didn't meet my expectations. My crispy shrimp wontons were made with bad shrimp. They were not fresh at all, when I bit into it, it almost feel like the texture of raw ground pork. Two out of three of my wontons were mushy like that. My boyfriend ordered their vegetable dumplings, which were only mediocre.   For entrées, I had the black cod fish,  and I thought that was fantastic, because I love cod fish. My boyfriend ordered their Singaporean fried noodles. I was surprised it came wrapped in egg. With mayo on the side. Props for creativity. Taste was not even there. Pretty disappointing.   My friends ordered their pricey dim sum, and they were fresh and delicious.   I don't know if I would go back. For the price I pay, obviously I would have high expectations. Especially when a friend also recommended the place. Last night did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"The food was great but the wine list and atsmophere were but a bit lacking for my taste. No wine list. And very loud background noise. OK for a single, but not great."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 dim sum dishes and one of them siu mai, har gow, spring rolls and turnip cake.  The spring rolls nothing special, the turnip cakes is savoury, nice textures and awesome flavours.  The siu mai is where things tanked due to a multiple sandy grains.  Could not figure if it from the garnish or in the dumpling.  It was disgusting and ruined my entire meal."}
{"text":"We ate here for Sunday lunch and it was nothing short of delicious. Friendly staff, nice decor/ambience and most importantly, food was A1! A few of my favourite dishes include Luckee Cheung Fun & Luckee Dim Sum Basket. Prices are on the expensive side for dim sum but with it being one of Susur Lee's restaurants, it's expected."}
{"text":"I went with the Luckee Har Gow, Luckee Shrimp Cheung Fun, Char Siu Beef Short Ribs, and the Cantonese Fried Rice.  Taste (5/5): The dumpling skin of the har gow was very delicious and unique compared to other chinese restaurants. The cheung fun was good as it seemed like a combination of cheung fun and fried shrimp dumplings which provided an interesting soft and crunchy taste. The main attraction was the char siu beef short ribs which if I had time to I can speak about all day. They are actually boneless and these literally melt in your mouth when you take the first bite, which is a pleasant change from the usual chewy short ribs at other restaurants  Service (5/5): The waiter visited a lot to see how the meal was and was entertaining to have around. Bonus points for the additional service on my birthday  Value (4/5): For a higher end restaurant the prices are reasonable as it is about $10 for dim sum and $20 for entrees. The portion sizes are a little smaller, but there is still enough food to fill you  The restaurant is large and has a classy atmosphere. This would definitely be a good place to visit for a date night or work event."}
{"text":"Another Winterlicious journey to one of Susur Lee's restaurants- Luckee! It's a Chinese restaurant and bar located near the Rogers Centre. When you walk in, the décor was amazing for Chinese New Years. Lots of nice decorations. It's quite the beautiful restaurant. The kitchen is open-concept so you can see through the class what the chefs are making for you. This was my second time here and here I am again for Winterlicious.. The menu this time around is pretty much the same when I went here a few years ago. We first started off ordering an appetizer and a main entrée. We ordered Chicken Cheung Fun (8PC) (rice roll with tofu, ginger, green onion & soya juice). It was beautifully presented and quite flavorful and delicious. This one cost $12. For the main entrée to share, we ordered Yunnan Fried Vermicelli with crab meat, black pepper & egg. For me, it tasted rather peppery but it was okay. There was nothing unique about the dish though. For the Winterlicious menu, my friends and I basically the order the same dishes. We started off with the Lucky basket which had long xia gow, siu mai, steamed spinach & chinese celery dumpling. I liked every dim sum in this basket but my favorite one was the Siu Mai with the scallop. It was quite good. For the entrée we ordered a Peking Duck. It was beautifully presented on the plate and it looked too good to eat. The duck was nicely cooked and quite delicious even though it was only a few pieces of it. To wrap up our meal, we got the Trio of Desserts Mango & Passion Fruit Panna Cotta, Coconut Foam, Chocolate Sponge Roll, Raspberry Coulis and Sesame Rice Donut, Dark Chocolate Sauce. You can never go wrong with dessert and I found all 3 of them good. Overall, a great dining experience at one of Susur Lee's restaurants. Nice décor and friendly staff. Food was awesome despite being on the upscale side of dim sum dishes. Would definitely highly recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Beautiful decor - love the modern take on traditional Chinese decor, especially the giant neon lucky character. Staff were very accommodating and there was even a coat check! We came in for Winterlicious and we found the food to be very good overall. The Luckee soba salad that I had for my appetizer was surprisingly filling! It was also my first time eating salad with edible flowers in it. Surprisingly, the fragrant flavour of the flowers actually compliment the more \"ordinary\" ingredients of the salad such as the soy sauce, soba noodles and parsley. As for the Peking duck, the pancakes were cooked perfectly as was the duck. Wish the portions for the main was bigger! The dessert trio was also really good - my favourite was the chocolate covered jin dui! Given the intimate vibes of the restaurant, the good service and the awesome food, I highly recommend Luckee for anyone who is craving for some Chinese fusion!"}
{"text":"Very unique and exceptionally prepared Dim Sum. If you're expecting the usual china town fair, this spot isn't for you.  But for a very unique take on Dim Sum, highly recommended.  The dumplings were unique, and the rice rolls were to die for.  More expensive than China Town, but also a much more upscale experience."}
{"text":"When I read that Susur Lee was opening up a new restaurant, the foodie inside me almost cried. Couldn't wait to check out his take on dim sum.   The ambiance was cool, upscale and popping on a Friday night. Susur was in the house enjoying dinner with a table next to us so we knew the food would be amazing. It did not disappoint.   The only issue is the service- it should NOT take 20 minutes to get a drink. Our server disappeared for a good portion of our dinner and he forgot drinks and food items that we ordered. They're new so I'm sure there are some kinks to work out so Im giving it a solid 4 stars.   Menu items Shrimp cheung fun- agreed with everyone. It was the bomb and a MUST TRY!  Luckee duck- have had a lot of duck in my life but his was top notch with its crispy exterior. Kept the Peking style recipe true to form with soft wraps, green onions and cucumber to compliment the duck. General Tao Crispy Sesame Beef- crispy and saucy on the outside and so tender on the inside.  Cantonese style fried rice- was pretty good but nothing over the top Siu Mai- pretty delicious with his take on the sauces Chicken and tofu skin dumpling- great and really different from anything I've tried in normal dim sum spots  All in all, great food and fun ambiance but the service could use some work."}
{"text":"I went here for winterlicious. I ordered the hot and sour soup as my appetizer and the soba noodle salad as my main. Some friends had warned me about the portion sizes so I was prepared to be underwhelmed but I would call this meal 'bite-sized'. The food was satisfactory overall but I would call the flavors mind-blowing by any means. Pretty ordinary I'd say. Maybe I'll have to try the regular menu to get a more accurate sense of what Luckee is all about.  On the plus side, the parking was super easy. I also loved the decor of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came to try out Susur Lee's restaurant in Toronto on Mother's Day.  The main dining room was full but the bar area had plenty of first-come, first-served seating available.  Our server was really terrific and clearly knowledgeable of the menu.  We ordered a few dim sum dishes, a fried rice dish, and a noodle dish.  The dim sum selection isn't quite as dynamic as I would have imagined, but the restaurant isn't dim sum only, that said, the selections were satisfactory - siu mei, shrimp balls, etc.  The dim sum carts didn't travel very fast, we only saw them twice during our 45 minutes or so in the restaurant, but I expect things to be slow during Mother's Day.  Everything we ate tasted very good, but I didn't get that 5-star dish that I can rave about here, thus the 4-star rating.  For a trip to a popular restaurant without a reservation on Mother's Day afternoon, Susur's joint delivered and left us very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday afternoon. The service is really slow and the food taste quite salty. The decoration is nice. But with the price point I expected better quality food"}
{"text":"First time trying Dim Sum.. I liked it! Our server was great, she gave us a bunch of recommendations on places to see and things to do in Toronto. Other staff members came to our table to tell us about other places to visit while in Toronto."}
{"text":"This was our last meal in Toronto during our vacation here and it definitely did not disappoint. After eating at one of Susur Lee's other restaurants, Fring's, earlier in the week we decided to try Luckee. We frequently eat traditional dim sum, and Luckee's take on dim sum was surprisingly delicious. Everything we ordered was delicious, but the Cheung Fun and the Short Rib Bowl were by far the two best things we ate. We would definitely order both of those things again."}
{"text":"Took a friend here for dinner. Food was delicious!! We had a few dim sum appetizers such as Har Gow, Turnip Cake and Shrimp Chung Fun  (apologies for the possible incorrect spelling) all were delicious!  For cocktails, we had the Sangria and a spicy cocktail which was so good. I love spicy cocktails!  For our mains, we had the Fried Rice and the 3 cup Chicken! Highly recommend! So delicious!!!!!!  I was not a fan so much of the dessert menu. We had the Chinese Profiteroles drizzled in Chocolate Sauce and had lemon cream custard filling inside served with a bit of raspberry sauce and a small scoop of ice cream. . Not a fan. Would love to see like a mango pudding though in the dessert menu. Overall great eats, great decor and lively atmosphere. Portions are for sharing for sure!"}
{"text":"Another Winterlicious meal, another opportunity to eat at a Susur Lee restaurant. And in the case of Luckee, it epitomizes that culinary world's cliche word \"elevated\" as applied to dim sum (and also a variation of cliche words used in Chinese restaurant names--feel free to ask me about it).   Heck, I even caught sight of the local celebrity chef himself on my way out--he was at the bar chatting with some folks. Luckee you.  The restaurant is divided into two areas: a very spacious lounge and bar that also serves the hotel it is in, and the dining room. Both with furniture choices and interior design evocative of old midcentury classic Chinese banquet hall-style restaurants (the work of wife Brenda Bent and her design firm, as with Lee's other Toronto restaurants), and yet modern and sexy. There is another bar area I wish I knew of earlier, where you can eat as you watch the kitchen staff at work from behind a glass wall, whilst stacks of dim sum bamboo steamer baskets pile up. Luckee you.  As loud chillout house music blares away and the light goes from dim to near-pitch-dark to dim again from time to time (do the staff have a habit of bumping into light switches or are they really trying for a nightclub ambiance?), it is impossible to overlook what you're getting into here: Susur Lee's take on dim sum and other Chinese dishes, at celebrity chef's prices--but only hints of the usual fusion influences of Lee. The stuff in the dim sum menu hovers around a median charge of $9, while meat and seafood dishes command at least $20. How Luckee.  The Winterlicious 2015 menu ($35) features some stuff from the usual menu and some new dishes too. The 'Luckee Duck'--Lee's version of the Peking duck--was at the right kind of soft and crispy, although the Singaporean Curry Noodles, which came unknowingly wrapped pita-style, sadly lacked that spicy curry punch I love about Singapore noodles like what you get at your usual Chinese mall food court stall lah.  We went off-course and tried their ha gow and siu mai ($9's), because what the hell is dim sum without those two? Both were... ah, very indescribably interesting, with the use of ingredients and flavours that makes them that (here's that word again) elevated kind of dim sum experience. Like creamed butternut squash, and... is that really a slice of truffle on top of my siu mai? They were fun to try, and delicious in its own way that makes them incomparable to any average restaurant out there--not Chinatown, not Richmond Hill nor Scarborough-land. Definitely in its own league, much like the whole idea of eating here in the first place.  Luckee is a hip and upscale, novel Chinese dining experience more suited for the King Street gwai lo yuppie crowd, where you dip your credit card in soy sauce and see if that ballooning check ever gets Chopped, as you listen to the equally hip servers try to pronounce names like \"har gow\" with whatever semblance of Cantonese they can muster. Absolutely not a place to take your frugal grandma for her birthday, but maybe a cute hip date. You Luckee bastard.  {TTC: the 504 to Peter Street/Blue Jays Way, or Spadina it to King. Either way, there's still the block walk to the Soho Metropolitan Hotel.}"}
{"text":"Coming from a city full of Chinese foods, Markham, it was hard for me to give an unbiased review of this place...came here for my friends birthday dinner as she wanted chinese food, we both worked downtown...so for the convenience of all...we chose Luckee..  I enjoyed the bar area as I was waiting for my friend...enjoyed 2 drinks...made reservations for 6pm. Was seated, coats were taken. The menu was quite limited to be honest so as I was reading the reviews on Yelp. We ordered the signature duck, chicken cheung fun, noodles..  The plating was very nice, taste was A-Ok, vermicelli noodles were also an A-Ok..nothing really screamed amazing in terms of the food...  Our server was attentive, checking up on us regularly..  All in all, this is an OK experience but nothing I am dying to come back for at the moment...."}
{"text":"Luckee is expensive (especially the \"family-style\" mains that are quite small to feed a family), so if you're going, go for the dim sum. It's better than any of the mains (that I had),  more affordable, and steamed perfectly. I would give them a better rating because the food (DIM SUM) was quite good, but the ambience and service suck at Luckee (sorry Susur.  But really, get some new wait staff to do your restaurant justice.)   I don't normally comment on this but the music was way too loud (and it was techno/dance/jazz... I don't quite understand.) The servers were not particularly attentive. They didn't clear the table at the appropriate time, reached in to take plates without asking the party, tried to up-sell dishes (HATE THAT), and didn't really give great food advice (ALSO HATE THAT).  Dim sum and appetizers -- relatively excellent  -  the har gow: very gingery, the texture was better than any other I've had  -  the shrimp cheung fun: I ordered the chicken one, but this was still amazing. Crisp, yet soft, and tasty  - the taro and turnip cake: really interesting textures of soft and crispy, the flavour was good but wasn't particularly enough to stand out by itself  - The hot and sour soup: the textures were really amazing: crisp, soft, smooth, crunchy.... ultimately, the soup was sweeter than I am used to, and maybe a bit thicker too. It was a small portion to share, which is what the waiter recommended  Mains--nothing to write home about  - the black pepper beef tenderloin: cooked excellently, but was over salted and had too much sauce!! That sauce really reminded me of cheap Chinese food. However, the added vegetables [lilly bulbs] were a very nice touch  - Sweet and sour chicken: was truly sweet and sour. It was fine--I expect more for a $20+ main. the chicken was OVERCOOKED  Finished off with a profiterole. Was fine. I liked the curd inside paired with the chocolate drizzle, but it wasn't the best dessert I've had, and was reminiscent of a doughnut..????"}
{"text":"This has to be my least favorite Susur Lee restaurant I have tried so far. I was only there with one other person so I didn't get to try too many dishes.  It wasn't bad but I really was underwhelmed.  The hot and sour soup was bland and probably the least flavorful hot and sour soup I have had in my life.  There was also a rice dish that we had that was very bland.  The other dishes were good, but honestly nothing special and didn't seem that much better than something you would get at PF Changs! (but obviously much more expensive!)  Bottom line, I wanted to like this place, but it really just underwhelmed me. Nothing made me want to go back and try it again a second time."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese restaurant for non-Asian cuisine/dimsum enthusiasts. If you're looking for authentic Chinese food, stick to Chinatown, Markham, or maybe even Pearl Harbourfront. Service was good, unique decor, good location, but dimsum menu was limited and overpriced. The chef puts unique twists on traditional Chinese food, but personally I preferred the real thing. Good for special occasions, but I liked Lee (the chef's other restaurant in Toronto) much better."}
{"text":"Came here for a Winterlicious dinner on February 6.  Another one of Susur Lee's restos (tried Lee last year during Winterlicious)... nothing that amazing or special about the dinner to be honest... the soba noodles were kind of reminiscent of the Singaporean slaw at Lee (but the slaw was much better).  It was odd how they folded the wrappings for the duck because they just fell apart when you finished adding the duck/sauce/watercress/apple to it.  The dessert seemed ok.  Overall, I was underwhelmed and I wasn't expecting much -- the food was ok, ambience was fine, I just wasn't really impressed or wowed since Luckee has gotten a lot of hype since it opened."}
{"text":"Came here a Summerlicious lunch with a few friends. Ordered the chicken salad for appetizer, and the baked chicken for the main course. The chicken was okay although it lacked flavor. The baked chicken was soft and tender and flavorful and came on top of some sticky rice. The dessert was a tea spoon of very flavorful ice cream (very good), a small piece of sponge cake and a small fried glutinous rice ball in chocolate sauce. The overall experience was so so. After spending close to $30 on a lunch ... I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Well, there are cheaper and more authentic places for dim sum in Toronto, but I don't mind paying a bit extra for Luckee's attentive service, modern atmosphere and creative twist on traditional dim sum dishes. I really like their crispy cheung fun and that's something that brought me back to Luckee again. It is not the typical \"ja leung\" that you have at a typical Chinese dim sum place, it is much more flavourful and more ingredients go into each bite. I prefer their dim sum brunch than their regular dinner. Even though the dim sum menu does not come with a lot of different selection, each item is well prepared and tasty. I would definitely recommend the cheung fun, the turnip cake, and the lobster fried dumpling."}
{"text":"The dining space at Luckee is casual and open. Nice for groups or families. The lighting is poor for photos as there were unflattering shadows cast down on the tables from above. I wasn't crazy about the music. It was some sort of ambient/house music thing going on. Finally, my chair had a crack in it and snagged my nylons. Kind of a no-no in a somewhat swanky restaurant.   But that's where the negativity ends. The service was great. Our servers were attentive and professional. Each dish came with a short description. Our orders came at a nice pace. We never felt rushed but neither were we kept waiting  very long between plates. We were given several useful recommendations when ordering.  The food was very good. Complex, creative combinations of flavours based on traditional Chinese dishes. Each one with that Susur Lee flair. I particularly liked that many of the dishes and even some of the cocktails were sprinkled with edible flower petals. It gives a common visual theme running through the meal that I found brilliant.   Our favourite selections were the chicken cheung fun, crispy squid and the lucky duck. All very tasty and satisfying portions. On the dessert menu, the sponge roll, although beautiful, fell a little flat. If you want something with a more intense flavour, try the mango passion fruit pudding."}
{"text":"Food is decent. The shrimp/lobster spring roll was great. Chicken with General Tso's sauce was also good without being syrupy or overly salty. The Shrimp Cheung Fun was really indeed fun. The highlight of the menu was surprisingly the desserts which were a perfectly delicate mango panna cotta, sesame ball was chewy and fun, and the ginger mango creme brûlée was heavenly.  Overall, the ambiance was dark and the food was mostly good. Service was quick and friendly though occasionally hard to hear over the music.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Four of us for just under $300 (not much booze) but we got really full and had a good time.  They serve food very fresh and hot -- oh so hot!  I yelled at the server for serving it too fresh and not letting the food cool for 20 to 30  like other restaurants :)  Their version of the 'Singapore Slaw' of Lee is back in season now. It's quite good.  The soup dumplings were too fragile and most broke pulling them out. Hmm... That wouldn't happen in Shanghai.  It's a fun place to go, pretty loud, easy going staff.  Pretty stressless.   Oh, the hotel washroom should be cleaner. It also is not funky. I personally think a restaurant's washroom should be 10x as whacky as the restaurant itself. This is the only place I was let down. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious with 14 friends on Sunday 1pm.  Was surprised at how many tables that were still available.  It was about 50% filled including our group.  The place looked modern with a lots of interesting art and decorations.  It looks much more high end than majority of dum sum/chinese restaurants. For appetizer I got the crispy shrimp & lobster wontons with sweet & sour sauce, exotic fruit salsa.  Its pretty much 2 fried wontons with some sauce on the side.  I liked how crispy it was and the flavours of the filling and sauces were good.  DIdn't like how finely ground up the shrimp and lobster were inside the wontons.   For entree I got the soya glazed cod with conpoy scallop rice, green & yellow zucchini. This dish was small for an entree and presentation was lacking.  The fish was a little overcooked and the sauce that came with it was plain and salty.  Was hoping for fresh scallops with the rice but it was few pieces of minced dried scallop mixed into the rice.   The best part of the was the dessert trio.  It included crispy sesame ball with chocolate sauce below and yellow custard inside, mango sorbet with raspberry, and sponge cake roll with strawberry sauce.  All three desserts were good especially the mango sorbet. After comparing notes with my friends, I'd recommend going with the wontons and baked chicken sticky rice."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner at Luckee last week while in Toronto. I had the Cantonese steamed fish with rice. It was delish, well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The dessert although sounded simple was breathtaking."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with Luckee. While the dishes were generally well-prepared, with good ingredients, the menu was very limited, and all the dishes were overpriced.   When it comes to dim sum, however, I'm more of a traditionalist. I don't need fancy crab dumplings topped with truffle. Also, $18 for a beef short rib lunch rice bowl??  Overall, while the flavors were pretty decent here, I'd recommend you head elsewhere to one of the many other great dim sum restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to Luckee today and I can't say I loved it. The reason for my visit was the article on BlogTO advising that the restaurant had excellent options for people on gluten free diet. I got very excited and decided to go there. I checked the menu and looked like that they have some nice dim sum options. I called Luckee to confirm that they carry gluten free dim sum. The lady on the phone told me that they indeed have gluten free options and a server will explain their gluten free items.   I went there and there were literally two gluten free dishes they could make for me. The menu also looked very different from the menu on their website. It was much smaller. My fiancé ordered regular dim sum and an entree. The portions were so tiny, but he seemed to like the food. My dim sum took a while and I thought oh wow they must be making the gluten free flour/dim sum from scratch.   When my food came I saw shrimp and chicken in cabbage leaves. They tasted okayish but I was pretty disappointed, especially given that I got 6 small cabbage leaves for $20. I was really expecting some nice dim sum and nice gluten free dough.  The place is very pretty but the portion sizes are quite small. I didn't eat non gluten dishes so it's hard for me to comment on all food in the restaurant. My bill was very expensive too. We were not full at all and went elsewhere for more food."}
{"text":"I went for my boyfriend's birthday, I expected it to be very crowded and expensive and it turned out to be neither of those things. The environment is fairly calm, and our bill ended up being very affordable. The dim sum was delicious, I especially liked chicken cheung fun - this may sound funny but it tasted like Sun Chips to me and it was amazing! The chrysanthemum salad was also pretty tasty and unique. Definitely worth checking out at least once."}
{"text":"I went with my partner to Luckee for brunch to try their take on dim sum. The menu can cater to many dietary preferences, with some solid veg and meat options. The interior design is delightful, especially the graffiti wall motifs and open kitchen. However, the tables are too close, forcing the neighbouring server's rear to be almost on our table throughout our meal. I'm a woman and I've had less intimate lap dances.   Susur normally delivers and then some. Unfortunately, our first item was black been beef short ribs from the dim sum cart, which were slightly on the side of lack-lustre, but was offset by a delicious leaf-wrapped pork sticky rice. We then shared the delicate order of shrimp dumplings and a two person Peaking duck pancake, which was amazing and is really hard to find in downtown Toronto. The duck was perfectly roasted with a crispy skin and tender inside, and the house made marmalade and hoisin was a perfect match.   We also ordered a 'fun' shrimp rice roll which was delicious, and a crab and tofu cake, which never came, although we were assured it was coming by several staff for a straight 30 minutes. For dessert, we had a chocolate ganache tart which was not sweet enough to justify its sea salt top. It was a finish too rich for such a subtle and aromatic coursing.  My only complaint about this place was our server, Alvaro. He looked more like an out of work boxing coach than a waiter and had an attitude to match, sporting an off-putting grimace and thick gold chain. He continually would disappear for 20 minute stints and lacked the excitement that a server should evoke at a newly opened restaurant. The food-runner we had was a very charming young man with great energy, we would have rather had him as a server as he fit the Luckee vibe more. Seeing all the other guests laughing with their friendly servers, we decided it just wasn't our lucky day."}
{"text":"Excellent- so much so that even my picky Chinese food expert Father sang his praises. We came here for a surprise birthday dinner for him, and we received great service and food. A dish that deserves explicit mentioning is the Shrimp Cheung Fan. It exceeded all our expectations amongst the top rated Chinese restaurants both in the city and in South East Asia. Truly delicious. We also recommend the Soya Scallops.  The price is also reasonable for its value.   Great place for celebrations but also great just for a nice Chinese meal."}
{"text":"Not cheap and a definite treat, but worth it in every way. The servers are super helpful and if you can't decide, they will pick a sampling of items from the menu for you inside a specific price range.   The cheung fun is probably the best thing on the menu - it's a soft dumpling filled with a crispy fried one with chicken. The char siu beef is also a must - it's marinated for 72 hours (!) and falls apart in your mouth. The green beans are delicious with hints of chili and... frankly, I didn't think it was possible to make beans taste that way. Prepare to share food. It's dim sum. Expensive, but still dim sum.   I went here with my best friend and while we were there, Susur was coming around asking people how their food was. This says a lot to me - the guy owns tons of restaurants and could be anywhere with his feet up, letting the staff do all the work and just raking in the dough. But he shows up and actually gives a shit, which I think says a lot about him and how devoted he is to his job - and how much he loves food.   Overall, really worth it.  The washroom situation is super confusing - they're actually in the lobby of the Soho Grand Hotel and are hidden behind about two corners. Washroom is flat entrance with a large stall that could fit a chair, but i don't believe it has an automatic door to the washroom itself or a grab bar in the stall."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, I think I would have to say that this place... is probably the best chinese food in Toronto :) Okay price wise it's probably one of the most expensive... but every dollar spent on this restaurant was totally worth it!  We ordered a prix fix menu, which had a variety of choices :)  Their dim sum are some of the best I'VE ever had. and lets just say i've had my fair share of dim sum in my days here on Earth lol. Anyway, even though it was just a sample, those flavours, omg, they just stay with you! I can't quite put into words how delish it is, but just all the flavours that Susur lee uses... Love his cooking!   the rice dish that came with our menu, was also super delicious. Again, it's more of an elegant twist to Chinese dishes, but certainly a delightful one, because I enjoyed every spoonful of that rice!  The desserts at the end... omg. a trio. and each one of them so unique and different that i just dind't have much to say at the end (i was just enjoying bites of the three different desserts!).  Anyway, yes I know the dishes offered at this restaurant isn't cheap, but if anyone is looking to spend some good money towards a top of the line chinese style dining, this is the place :)  This place is super busy though, so do make sure you reserve! They have some seats along the kitchen where you can also look at the chefs preparing the food :)"}
{"text":"Luckee has that Susur Lee magical draw that pulls people in to try anything he does. We went with much anticipation and I have to say we were underwhelmed.   As with most trendy new restaurants, there are actually two seating areas in the restaurant; one which is near the kitchen, behind the hostess stand and reserved for repeat customers (since if you go more than once and reserve a spot, you will always ask for the area near the open kitchen) and another area that would resemble a waiting area that is in front of the hostess stand and along the windows facing a bland stretch of Wellington. As a last minute reservation we were seating in the area \"in front\" of the hostess stand.  The host brought us to a table that was small and seemed uncomfortable and when we asked for the much cozier corner table, he said \"yes\" and brought us to that table even though it hadn't been cleared from the last group. When the waitress and probably front of house manager saw us sitting there, they were shocked and apologized profusely. Anyway, that was a novice mistake that you don't expect to find in a place like this.  The menu is divided into Dim Sum, Cheung Fun (also Dim Sum), Soup. Seafood, Meat, Vegetables and Tofu, Rice and Noodles, and Sides. We ordered the Lobster Cheung Fun which were flavorful but nowhere near the $24 price. The lobster was indeed well hidden and didn't add much sweetness to the saltiness of the soy. We then had the Crispy Seafood in 'Golden Sand' which was pretty to look at but failed in our estimation to capture the essence of tender seafood contrasting the crispy 'golden sand'. Finally we had the Luckee Duck, with high expectations that once again weren't meant. We know good duck is fatty but this serving seemed to take that a bit far. The wraps were paper thin and made it really hard to assemble the wraps. The fois-gras parfait and cranberry compote did little to save the dish.  In hindsight, we may have been better with the Dim Sum. We were looking forward to good asian fusion food which Luckee does present in its menu. Overall the food was OK and service was just that as well. I guess we expected much more from a restaurant with Susur Lee's name on it.  Finally, having three kids of my own, I am not against having well behaved kids in such a restaurant but that's where the front and back of the restaurant come into play. I don't believe small kids will ever be seated in the \"premium\" area near the kitchen. That is what the secondary area near the outer windows are reserved for.  If you plan on eating at Luckee and I think you should try it, ask for a table \"inside\" the restaurant near the kitchen, have a look at their menu online ahead of time so you spend less time in a dimly lit environment trying to read very small type on the menu and keep an eye out for a very small pepper near some of the dishes. They indicate a \"spicy\" dish which the wait staff don't seem to mention when you order. With less than perfect vision, you might interpret it as a bullet point."}
{"text":"Went to Luckee for a Sunday brunch. The selection is great between traditional dim sum items and the ones they've modified with that Susur Lee touch. The environment is great with prompt service and a traditional dim sum cart coming around with off the menu items. May be disappointing if you are craving that traditional flavour for all items, but their ingredients are definitely better than your typical Chinatown restaurant. Would definitely recommend shrimp cheung fun and deep fried black pepper beef bao, both had fantastic texture and tasted amazing."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that as a Chinese person, that I'll end up feeling like a minority here. Apparently, it is possible to be a minority Chinese person at a dim sum restaurant. The vast majority of patrons here are not Chinese people, and it's understandable on many levels. Let's talk first impressions.  Dim sum dishes that cost more than $5/dish, a fully stocked bar, a hugely sparse seating and glass cups are exactly things you would expect to find at a Chinese restaurant, once it has been run by a non-Chinese management.  But behind that superbly posh look, there is much to discover. The seating features a very relaxed and open concept.  It seems minimalistic, very reminiscent of the old style Chinese restaurants you see especially in Hong Kong television or movies.  There are a few lounge seats available, and a very well stocked.  I didn't quite go through the available teas, but, if you spend time looking through it, you'd be amazed too.  This is where things become, a little bit more interesting.  The original intention for the visit was to try out their black truffle menu.  It featured a few classic Hong Kong dishes, fused with a slight western twist, and then on top of that, was lit up with some black truffle.  Three of the dishes I remembered on the menu were the dim sum platter, with truffle, drunken crab with truffle, and their signature Cheung Fun but each one topped with a piece of truffle.  This menu wasn't made public to us, and upon talking to our server, who was ever so kind, offered to ask the chef about it.  The chef, was only too happy to allow us to order the Dim Sum Platter and the drunken Crab.  They claimed to make everything from scratch, so to keep us busy while we waited, we were offered the Cheung Fun.  This was fantastic, because we actually ordered one ourselves, and immediately, the server offered to switch the one we ordered from chicken to shrimp.  Two birds with one stone, we've got the chance to try both. Service deserves an A+ here.   Now the most important bit : the food.  The truffle is a really interesting mix.  This mix with black truffle is and should be labelled as fusion cuisine.  The execution is fantastic, but I think the most important bit behind it, was whether or not you'd develop a craving to come back and order the dish again.  On many levels, I believe the black truffle menu is fantastic. But there's one bit that bothers me, and it's really a matter of how quickly I managed to eat it.  I think to some extent, I'm the wasted end of the entire endeavour.  You see, I'm sure the chef must have spent hours on end sourcing the food and coming up with a fantastic menu, just for me to chew and swallow his creation in a manner of seconds.  It hooks the desire to have this dish in front of me again, but I don't know if I actually enjoyed it properly.  However, having said that, the fact that I absolutely enjoyed all of it, is merit to the fact that Luckee is hardly \"just another white-washed Chinese place trying to be Chinese while totally missing the mark\".  Sure, they offered a fortune cookie in the end really is pushing that previous remark about white-washing, but you can tell from the dim sum that the chef is truly passionate about Chinese food.  In fact, this is what makes it all so good in the end: passion.  Chinese food has traditionally always been about passion.  I think a lot of restaurants have had to give up passion in the sake of being economically feasible, especially in the downtown core.  This place though : well worth its price."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here.  The decor is really nice and the staff was really helpfull in navigating the long menu.  I started off with some Dim Sum that was very well crafted and freshly made.  The shrimp dumplings and crunchy chicken were outstanding.  The two highlights of the meal were the scallops and green beans.  I was too full for dessert, so that means I will have to head back.  You do get a fortune cookie!!  One tip... they charge $20 for 3 hours of parking... you can do better at a lot around the corner."}
{"text":"Asian Fusion - Awesome!!  Great tasting unique food with good menu selection. Good selection of complementary sauces.  Beautiful Asian bistro decor.  Dessert menu is somewhat lacking though and could use improvement to match the other menus.  Overall great experience though."}
{"text":"This a very cute and trendy Chinese fusion restaurant located in the Soho hotel. The decor is unique with a slightly old school, Chinese twist. There is a lounge area and a separate dining area.   The food tasted great and I especially liked their take on a few classic dim sum dishes. Every table was provided with some complimentary shrimp chips and a assortment of dipping sauces to try. We ordered the Luckee Har Gow ($9), Luckee Cheung Fun with Shrimp ($9) and Turnip Cake with Taro Rosti ($9). Our favourite was the Shrimp Cheung Fun, the rice roll was wrapped around a crunchy Chinese cruller.   For the mains, we got the duck ($33) and the Fried Vermicelli with Dungeness Crab ($20). The duck was good but not as unique as other dishes we had. The vermicelli had a lot of crab in it and although fried, was not oily at all. The cocktails were very unique and tasted great as well.   This is a great fusion Asian restaurant and the ambiance is very cosey. Would definitely recommend dinner here for a nice date night, when we went it was mostly filled with couples."}
{"text":"As many people have already mentioned how overpriced their food is, I was not here to comment on how absurd the price is.  It was the service. During our entire dining time, they cleared out dishes multiple times before we were finished with them. We had to stop them quite a few time. For a restaurant that intended to situated themselves as a \"classic\" restaurant, the service is beyond subpar.   No wonder it was quite empty during dinner time on a long weekend."}
{"text":"It's like soaking a hundred dollar bill in soy sauce and then setting it on fire.    Surprisingly not good.    It's a poor photocopy of great Chinese food.    I really wanted to love this place.  On paper it sounds like exactly the type of thing that I'd really be into.  A modern celeb-chef take on Dim Sum seems like it would be awesome.   I was really excited to go.  Alas.      The physical space feels like an Urban Outfitters store.   Even down to the stick-insect greeters and faux-asian-propeganda-murals.  That should have been the first warning.    But honestly...how hard is it to take the passion and flavour out of such vibrant cuisine?     This restaurant effectively does it on multiple levels.    First, it dillutes all of the spicy flavour elements to an un-offensive bland hum.    Then, it removes all elements of personalization and flair by making all the presentations corporate-kitchen-chic.   Then, it has the audacity to charge you ten times the price of what these same items would cost, much better prepared, three streets up the block.    It all comes down to the food.   It doesn't even feel like it's trying.     It doesn't have the radical flair that you'd expect.    Or the random surprises that you want.    Please don't get me wrong... It's not BAD, but it's nothing special at all.    You get better Chinese food at the take-out place on the corner.   Hardly the sort of thing that you'd want to slap a 'name brand' chef on.  Also...  it's stupidly expensive.       Caveat Emptor."}
{"text":"Food is fusion-type, not quite pure Chinese style. I went there for summerlicious 3-course lunch for $23. For me, the taste was quite too salty. And the portion of entree was so small! After completing the whole meal, I still felt hungry (I am a little girl). The dessert trip was ok. Mango sorbet was so good! For the quality of food, I would say the regular price on the menu is over-priced."}
{"text":"We went during winterlicious but ordered off of the al la carte, we definitely had some yummy dishes. The  LUCKEE CHICKEN CHEUNG FUN (rice roll with tofu, ginger, green onion & soya juice) and  CANTONESE STYLE GINGER FRIED RICE (with egg white, dried conpoy, asparagus & bacon) were my favourites, don't order the veggie spring rolls it was bland at best, tasted generic like you picked it up from the freezer section but pay for 2 what you could get 20 frozen for. Decent service and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was ok, 21 ingredient soba salad was nice and refreshing. Main course of shrimp scallops and octopus was not good, seafood was way over cooked, rice with veg was bland. My companions dish of General Tso chicken was much better. Dessert trio was nice, although despite telling the server I was allergic to milk, was served a milk based panacotta. Overall rating was ok, but deffinitley not overly impressed."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriends for dinner because I am a fan of Susur Lee's. It's a great spot to experience the vibes and food."}
{"text":"Based on Winterlicious, I would give this place 5 stars for the taste but 2.5 stars for the quantity served. I do not have a big appetite (honestly) but after the \"3-course\" meal here, I still had to eat a big churros portion to fill myself.   The food was so fresh, unique flavours, very innovative combinations and yet delicious food. The starter was a noodle bowl which a loto f different ingredients which were going well with each other, for the mains I had a cauliflower curry with a small piece of bread, I wish there was more bread as it was good as well as I was still hungry. Desserts were standard but really in portion. Cream Brulee was so good which that kick of ginger it really was outstanding.   I am gonna go there and try their regular menu soon. They can also improve on their sitting arrangments, the place was really congested, for a fine dining I would love some nice seats and more private, not bump myself into other tables all the time."}
{"text":"Came here last week for Winterlicious lunch and was not disappointed. Let's start at the beginning, shall we! Lunch during Winterlicious is $28 per person, for a three-course meal. You get a sampling of what is on the normal Luckee menu.   I ordered the Sweet Corn soup as my appetizer. The soup was delightful, with large chunks of crab. Plus it was the perfect starter for a cold winter day. For the main, I went with Susur's very own 5 spice baked chicken, which is sweet and spicy and all sorts of good.   The restaurant during the day is bright and airy. The servers are super knowledgeable and friendly, which is helpful if you're undecided on what to order. But I think one of the highlights from the lunch for me had to be the open kitchen. It was great to watch the kitchen staff making and preparing different dumplings and other items for that day's lunch service.   If you're a bit tight on funds, come here for Winterlicious and you won't regret it. Otherwise, make a reservation and come for their dim sum on Sunday's. It is pretty legit."}
{"text":"Luckee by celebrated chef Susur Lee is traditional chinese at heart with a modern twist. There is a dim sum bar area where you can sit and watch the chefs. The vibe is very casual for a Lee outpost. Susur himself was in the house and the kitchen directing his staff. He also stepped out from time to time to survey the patrons although he did not stop by our table :(  In addition to the dim sum menu, there is seafood, vegetarian and meat dishes on the menu along with the customary noodle and fried rice options.  We started off with the signature sangria which was very refreshing. I must admit for 16 bucks it was a tad too on the expensive end.   From the dim sum menu, we shared the chicken and shrimp sui mai and chicken cheun feng which is essentially a rice noodle roll that is served as an alternative to traditional dim sum options. The texture of the soft rice roll contrasted really well with the crunchy noodle inside the rice wrapper. All dim sums are served with a trio of sauces - green onion, mustard and hot sauce, soy sauce with sesame.   We also shared a couple of mains - Fried cod chrysanthemum which had a nice sweet and sour sauce and the cantonese style fried rice with egg whites and fried shallots. The cod had all the juiciness inside of it and the sauce perfectly complemented it.   For desserts, we had the mango passionfruit panna cotta which was delectable balance of sweetness from the mango juxtaposed with the sourness from the passion fruit. The fried egg custard rice rolls were a bit of a flavor letdown but if you prefer a savory dessert to end your meal, this should fit the bill.  I am sure the word on the street will pick up in the no time and this will be the new hotspot in town. Go there before it gets too busy, I will definitely be back. They plan to open for lunch/brunch next week."}
{"text":"I am not usually one to go for dim sum our Chinese food in general, because I feel like the quality and taste is so hit and miss. But seriously, luckee does it right. The chef special appetizer that night was a cold noodle and tofu salad that was the best tofu I every had.. Gobbled it right up. The dumplings were, of course, divine. In fact, there was nothing we had there that wasn't good. If I'm ever in the mood to splurge and for Chinese at the same time, I know where I'm going."}
{"text":"Ambiance: a little bit confusing and that is why I can't give this restaurant a 5 star. As you enter there's two ambiances the main bar big and empty not cozy .. resembles one of many bars in vegas .. clubby feel.. however the restaurant part only opens at 6:00pm so it was frustrating as we reserved our seats for 17:00 , we expected the restaurant would be open at the time we reserved our seats.  At 18:00 no one told us we could head to the restaurant so it was a little misleading   Service: mediocre at first they told us we have a 2 hour window limit ... hmm very arrogant staff.  As the night went by, the staff started to cater us better maybe because we were ordering almost everything on their menu .. very hypocritical. Unfortunately, they screwed up the order, my husband has an allergy to Scallops and we told them no scallops they ended up sending out scallops 3 times .. the last time they put the scallops on the side of the plate.. wow how genius -.-  Food: I have to admit if it was for the food alone I would rate it 5 stars . It was DEEEELICIOUS! Their black cod was to die for ! Dim sums were amazinggg , they had it with lobsters and chicken and salmon yummy!   Overall, food is amazing , service terrible , they should improve on their service and cater to the customers needs."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by people who come here shocked that it's going to be more expensive than the whole in the wall up the street.  This is Toronto, where people are more than happy to pay $15 for bacon and eggs because it's called brunch.   Here's what you get for the slightly elevated price:  1. A chance to see Susur and tell all your foodie friends. 2. The ability to have a burnt orange manhattan with a spring roll. 3.  Dim sum served both traditionally and in contemporary fashion.  The best dish was the Shrimp Cheung Fun (which I didn't order initially but the waiter highly recommended).  The Char Siu Bao (pork buns) were pretty disappointing.  Otherwise, most of the dishes were average to above average.  The layout is really not conducive to Dim Sum as there are a number of tables the cart can't reach.  Other than that, it is a clean and pleasant atmosphere with solid service.  Yes, I'm sure you can get cheaper and probably better Dim Sum at many places just up the road but I'd have no issues coming here again. It's easy to remember."}
{"text":"great! the food is really good but expensive! I would say that the lunch bowls are worth the price...the short rib bowl is out of this world  cheung fun shrimp is out of this world too! the rest of the dim sum is good but nothing different from the china town dim sum restuarants"}
{"text":"Susser Lee's newest addition to the family, this is a great dim sum spot that blows Lei Wah Heen out of the water in my opinion.   Great flavours - the dishes stay true to their original form but elevated to a modern level. It's the Susser twists that we've all come to enjoy.  Space wise, it's right in the Soho hotel, and a great choice. Interior wise, it feels like an NYC hotel restaurant. Price wise, i think it's really reasonable. Obviously, if you compare it to a dim sum spot in markham, this is x3 to x5 the price, but compared to restaurants of this caliber, it's really modest."}
{"text":"I was taken here for my birthday two weeks ago and had an amazing time. Not your typical dim sum place. This place lives up to its reputation.   Environment: great ambience which helps set an intimate vibe but not too dim. Very nice decor. It also has large tables if you are here with a group. if you plan on taking photos you definitely will need a decent camera with a flash.   Service: helpful, fast and on point (Particularly with respect to the dim sum items).  Food: myself and my fiancé enjoyed everything we ordered which was recommended by our wait staff. There is a great selection of meat and vegetarian items. The dim sum came out very fast. I had the chicken CHEUNG FUN which was delicious and I would highly recommend ordering it. Alsop since it was my birthday the waiter gave us a complimentary desert (no questions asked). The deserts at this place are not as good as the food.  Price: I believe the prices are reasonable given the portion size and the quality of the food.   Overall I had a good experience and I would come back  Tip: Get the Chicken Cheung Fun!"}
{"text":"Every time you go to a celebrity chef's restaurant for the first time, you're hoping that the hype is worth it, and it isn't an overpriced taste of some fusion type of food. Unfortunately, my experience at Luckee was definitely of the former; overpriced and completely average.   I and two others had the Dim Sum for four, which added to about $210 all in with tax and tip. With three people eating the portion size for four, we were still hungry at the end of the meal. While not objectively bad, the dim sum was completely average; in fact, I would argue that there are numerous places in Chinatown that have better dim sum. The fried rice was dry and lacked any real flavor. The offerings might be a creative take on traditional Chinese dim sum, but the dishes just don't taste GOOD.   For the price, I feel like you're paying more for the service and the environment as opposed to the food. Service is top-notch and very attentive, and the atmosphere is fancy without making you feel stuffy. However, it won't make it for the thoroughly disappoint food. Maybe I, as a Chinese person growing up on my dad's cooking (and the local family-run restaurant), just don't understand the uniqueness of the dishes. I won't be back in the future."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've only spent time in the bar end rather than the full restaurant.  This place is the definition of 'alright'. The setting is not bad. While there's a great mix of different kinds of relaxing seating, it's a bit of a cold atmosphere (there's a giant painting of an old naked lady with an oddly tight body staring down at you and you're surrounded by spray-painted cement walls/cinder blocks).   But while the atmosphere may not totally be for everyone (perhaps I'm ignorant), the food is fantastic. Their chicken Cheung Fun is to die for!! I don't think anyone can criticize the amazing food concoctions of Susur Lee, I think you'd be surprised by how often he walks around and how friendly he is. It's a real treat to have the chance to see such a talented chef.  The drinks themselves are pretty tasty. The service is... well they all look very pretty and wear great clothes. Sometimes it's attentive and friendly, and at other times I have to work a little to grab attention.   All and all if you want to stop by at a spot to grab nice drinks, this is a nice place to start. I wouldn't grab too many though."}
{"text":"Went for winterliscious dinner; seen Lee numerous times on various cooking shows/competitions, so you would think the food would be outstanding.  Overall, was not impressed, especially considering the price point.  Food is decent enough, but nothing special. Not much different than what you would find in a restaurant in China town, for probably a quarter of the price.  Would not go back"}
{"text":"Super overpriced dimsum that's nothing special compared to what you'd get at a standard Chinese restaurant. I'm open to spending extra for something unique but my friends and I found this to be very lacklustre. There were 10 of us so we tried a bunch of things on the menu. The portions were very small and eventually we gave up ordering enough to be full and opted to go elsewhere for equally tasty asian food. The duck was $33 for some small pieces and the fried rice was around $22! There is definitely better value elsewhere.   The ambiance is nice and the service was friendly but I won't be coming back here anytime soon. However, the food is tasty enough that I can see people bringing clients to a dimsum experience here without the yelling Chinese ladies / atmosphere / suspicious cleanliness of a normal Chinese restaurant. Otherwise, opt for somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I went for Winterlicious, and my friend and I split one Winterlicious menu and another that was $10 more.   To drink I got the house sake. It's brewed in the distillery district specifically for Susur Lee restaurants. It was light, crisp, fresh, and had pretty good flavours. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was because \"sake on tap\" just doesn't sound all that great, but it was.   Lobster soup was the starter. The broth was very lobstery, and there were 2 lobster dumplings. The soup was delicious.   Luckee also had a different version of Susur Lee's famous Singapore slaw--this one had less greens and was on a bed of soba. Pretty great flavours, but not as fresh as the original, but I really liked how the sauce complemented the soba noodles.   The mains were very aromatic. The cod was in a sweet and savoury sauce. The short ribs were also in a completely different sweet and savoury sauce. Both were very delicious. The short ribs were probably the highlight, though its accompaniments were forgettable. The cod was great too, but the zucchini that looked like pickle was pretty tasteless.   The dessert was quite traditional: sorbet, mango and passion fruit gelatinous stuff they called panna cotta, and a sesame donut filled with a sweet filling. Everything was pretty good, and the fruity stuff was pretty fresh.   I would definitely go back! They have a lot of different tasting menus, from $38 Winterlicious to $108 year of the rooster."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is confused. It tries to be fusion, but is not creative enough to create amazing dishes, and it is not authentic enough for been a good Chinese restaurant.   Atmosphere is dark and moody, like back of alleyway Chinatown vibe going on there.  Went with friend and got Luckee basket, Xiao Long Baos and Gold Sand Seafood. The Luckee basket taste bland, honestly you can get better dimsum at Szechuan Express. The Xiao Long Bao I was excited to try but feel like I want to spit out the food, trust me, there are better places with Xiao Long Baos. And the Gold Sand mixed seafood - again, I think I had the exact same thing from Szechuan Express when they are closing down at end of day for like $5, not $26 like this was here. They brought out dessert menu but we quickly went no thanks and left. If you want authentic dimsum, this isn't it. Chinatown and uptown places are better. If you want unique dimsum, try Crown Princess or Casa Impérial, not this. With this price, I could have eaten very well at those places.  We ended up with dessert at Phoenix Cafe downtown, clean, bright and better portion size and it taste better."}
{"text":"I want to give this restaurant 5 stars because of the amazing service and the deliciousness of *some* of the dishes. But the disappointment of other dishes and the price, has led me to give this restaurant 3 stars.  Firstly, the service - wonderful, fast and super helpful. The ambiance was also great.  Secondly, the food. Some dishes were incredible. The quick fry scallops were amazing. Put in a batter and deep fried, served with delicious asparagus, cashews and pearl onions. They were so delicious that we fought over them. The luckee har gow shrimp dumplings and teahouse turnip cake were also incredible.   The wokked garlic broccoli, rainbow gow and yunnan fried vermicelli with Dungeness crab were fine. Not great and not bad, but 20$ for not great noodles was kind of hard to swallow (pun intended).  The luckee dim sum of basket and xiao long bao were SO disappointing. No flavour, not interesting at all. Bland dough and bland fillings. I was especially disappointed to pay 6$ for 1 dumpling and have it so tasteless.   Overall, I still enjoyed my experience, but would hesitate to recommend the place to anyone else or to go again."}
{"text":"Looking forward to try Chef Susur Lee's elevated dim sum. However, disappointed with our dim sum experience. We were surprised that the XIAO LONG BAO only came in 2 pieces with this $9 price tag and literally no soup broth inside. No worth it! Everyone raved about this Chicken Cheung Fun and I ordered it but only have 4 pieces at $12. The quantities that they presented at our dine in is totally different from their online menu when I checked just now. They were short-changed us. I don't mind paying high price with great food but I feel that the typical dim sum is better than we have had at Luckee. We are lucky after all.   Nothing outstanding here with their dim sum. You can judge by yourself by going to Luckee."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time and was blown away by the excellent service, modern décor, and most of all the food. You definitely get what you pay for, and this restaurant has the 'wow' factor on all 3 levels. I honestly don't understand the negative reviews here. We came here to celebrate Chinese New Years. You can't go wrong with any of the dim sum menu here, the dumplings are fresh and the sauces that they come with  compliments them perfectly. This restaurant may be pricier  than some other similar places downtown but I never have an issue with paying more, as along as the food and service can match the pricing levels. At this restaurant, it did, and more."}
{"text":"Luckee serves iconic Chinese foods served in perfect sizes inside the Soho hotel. I am a fan! Getting there from the downtown core might require a cab ride ($ 10 from Yonge and King) or you can walk to it using the Path system. The place is cozy - check out their decors! If you're looking for a place to meet your friends or clients, this place will do it. There are two sections: a bar with few seats closer to the hotel lobby and the main seating area.   I tried the dim sum basket, siu mai, Luckee duck and beef - they're all very delicious. If you were to pick only one dish, it would unquestionably be the duck; it has the right amount of moisture, and it's flavourful without being overwhelming. I've tried the same dish in other restaurants and found them salty - but not at Luckee.   Will I go back? Definitely."}
{"text":"Honestly, unimpressed. Was looking forward to my first SuSur lee experience but it ended in a flop. I came here with a large group of co-workers so we had a set meal organized for us.  The dishes I tried were Lobster wonton, har gow, siu mai, mixed beans, fried scallop, fried mushrooms, beef short ribs, passionfruit mousse.  Dim sum wise, it was pretty bad. I get that it's an attempt to be fusion but it didn't fuse very well. Just the execution of the har gow and siu mai is worst than the standard dim sum restaurant in richmond hill. I don't blame it since I doubt they have an actually dim sum chef there and is probably a side item on their menu (i hope at least). Lobster wonton is good though so that is worth trying.  The rest was supposed to be family style. It's super small dishes. It's been 2 weeks since I was there and truthfully I don't remember anything special about them. I think the main theme that it's slightly different than the standard Canton dish but not in a way that improves it.   The best was the passionfruit mousse (probably because it isn't a fusion attempt). Strong hit of the flavor with a really soft texture. Best part of the meal.  For people who don't eat Cantonese food (like daily), I can see the appeal, especially with the celebrity brand name. I would likely not go back and give the other restaurants a second thought.  P.S. the shirts that say \"Great Food, Taste Food\" or whatever is sorta cheesy for the restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Food was very good tasting.  Don't think it merits the prices being paid for these dim sum items.  Portions are super small for what you pay - just dont see the value really."}
{"text":"Went here for a bday dinner on a Friday night. Place is very expensive. The dim sim and entrees is nothing special compared to going to Chinatown. If anything, I've had much better  food in Mississauga or Markham Chinese restaurants at 30-40% of the price. Staff is friendly but not knowledgeable and told us to order more food than was required (there was only two of us). I asked her to give us an idea of what a veggie mushroom dish was but she failed to tell us it was deep-fried. After a few bites, we told her it was not what we expected, she didn't even flinch and did nothing even though we said it wasn't what she desribed to us. Complete apathy and  no care for customer satisfaction. Won't be going here again or recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"Luckee, Luckee!  Went here at 2pm on a Saturday for dimsum.  The dim sum menu itself has about 20 items ranging in price from $5-$9.   The main menu had larger dishes in the $15 range.  There is also a dessert menu with 6 items, most also shareable ranging $4-$6.  We stuck with the dim sum and sampled:  Chicken Cheung Fun Har Gaw Beef Bao Turnip Cakes  The chicken cheung fun was the star dish here, crispy chicken on the inside and delicious soft noodle roll on the outside. I was also impressed with the beef bao and turnip cakes, both were unique and upgraded from regular dim sum. The har gaw seemed same-same as most dim sum restaurants.  We also had the sesame ball dessert which were smaller than usual but more delicious with a hot custard filling.  I really enjoyed having dim sum in a more trendy and upscale modern environment.   I was also impressed that our meal only came to $22 each including tax and tip. I was expecting to shell out more. Mind you, we only ordered off the dim sum menu but still, I've paid $20 eating at Rol San so this was quite excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place. Usually go here after comiccon or fan expos.  Mood is relaxed, calm and collected. Dim, but a good dim (ie you can see). Clean place, usually see all kinds of nice people and friendly staff.   Food: DIM SUM! Love the har gow and the shu mai. It is qualiTy (emphasis on the T :D ). You have to have it with their mustard wasabi = I dont know what they do, but its good.... or it may kill you....  Everything else s pretty awesome, I have not had a bad time at this place yet. I guess I was Luckee ;) ;) ;)"}
{"text":"If this is the best Asian restaurant in Toronto, then I suggest it needs more.  This is a name meets location meets.....declining standards story.  Grumpy service and waiter, even in a mostly empty restaurant mid week, one would expect he would be nicer, perhaps cordial and even, pleasant given we must have been 1 of maybe 3 covers he had that evening. I didnt like the service nor the attitude this old guy gave off. You dont like your job? Get another. Dont get grumpy on me when we are spending $400 on dinner and having a nice time.  As for the location, its in the SoHo hotel and right downtown, so easy. Thats the highlight - the decor and location.   The food was quite average. Luckee needs to offer more. They need better, higher quality ingredients and prep. I didnt find the dumplings, seared or otherwise - as anything to mention to friends, let alone celebrate. And the crispy beef, meh. Shrimp Cheung fun? Not for me. The glass noodle salad thing was just a complete write off.   And when compared to another Canadian place I have enjoyed that has a similar focus - Dim Sum, Asian Chinese Fusion, etc....I think Bao Bei in Vancouver is probably half the price yet on another level in terms of quality, prep and experience when compared to the 'famous' Mr Lee.   And also, trendy.   Speaking of which - after hearing all the name dropping, it appears Mr Lee needs to spend a little more time on what is eaten here, and a little less on who eats here.  Oh, and a waiter that isn't a complete dick."}
{"text":"well... ok... nothing more...   I think I probably should not got to such fusion Asian places when I want dumplings. I like to have Asian waiters and nice relaxing Chinese music in the background, rather than hip hop music and young Canadian student as waiters, who need some more training on what are the dim sum they have on the tray.  The food was Ok with, again, some interesting items such as the dumpling rice rolls with crispy chicken and even the lobster asparagus dumpling or har gow. Other items were less to my taste, often too large in size for a bite or clearly nothing special... Bao were tasteless to me, and the tiny portions of sauce at the table didn't help to enhance them (no one offered to refill the small sauce cups on my table when they turn empty, thus I guess what you get is all what you'll get....).  It is worth to try, but ultimately, this turns out to be this kind of place you all want/have to go... but only once. Likely the policy of all such places... good enough to get overall positive reviews, but not enough to give customers the will to become regular."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I came here with my family on a sunny Sunday morning for some delicious dim sum. I showed up with my parents and didn't know where to park. We parked across the street in the giant parking lot for $25. DON'T DO THIS. They have parking underground for $10. That automatically pissed me off as soon as I saw the sign at the entrance and put me into a really lousy mood. I was ready to leave.   Then I walked in and was immediately greeted by some friendly, young, good-looking staff members. I looked around, and it was beautiful. Clean, modern, chic, towering high ceilings, lots of Chinese art and decor. Fine, so far so good, but how's the food. They sat us immediately in a comfy corner table that seated five. Then we ordered a bunch of stuff, all of it delicious to varying degrees.  Har Gow Char Siu Bao Braised Black Pepper Beef Bao Shrimp with Tofu Skin Dumpling Shrimp Cheung Fun Chicken Cheung Fun Crispy Taro and Turnip Cake Luckee Duck for 2 with 5 spice torchon of foie gras Cantonese Style Ginger Fried Rice Yunnan Fried Garlic Rice Noodles  By far, hands down, no question, the best dish was the shrimp cheung fun. I will never go to this place without ordering it from now on. Other dishes that stood out to me we're the luckee duck, shrimp with tofu skin dumpling, and the crispy taro and turnip cake. Most of the items had very unique flavours not seen at your typical dimsum places, but some were pretty standard flavours just done better. The har gow comes to mind. The char siu bao  was also delicious, but not spectacularly so. The BBQ pork wasn't the normal red hue I'm used to, but more a darker tone and not as sweet and the cantonese style ginger fried rice was also above average, but nothing that will blow your mind away.  Given the price point, this isn't somewhere you'd go every weekend for dim sum. But if you really love dim sum, definitely give this place a shot. The food varies from unbelievably delicious to slightly above average, and with plenty of items on the menu there is plenty to try. I came here in a sour mood (remember not to park across the street!) but ended up leaving more than satisfied. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a unique feeling and the food is great, if you like Chinese food this would be a place to visit in Toronto. The service was personal and fantastic. Our main order took more than 40 minutes to arrive,so we had to wait for sometime. Last but not least be prepared for the bill, it's expensive."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious dinner and I was super underwhelmed by their food.   We got the chilled soba noodle salad, dim sum basket, luckee duck (Beijing duck wraps), cod wrap and their trio of desserts (mango panna cotta, chocolate sponge roll and sesame rice donut). The soba salad tasted pretty bland except for a tiny bit of spiciness. The cod was crispy but the lettuce wasn't big enough to serve as a wrap so trying to eat it became this messy ordeal. I tried a bit of the luckee duck and it was on par with most other duck wraps I've had, with just a little extra tartness from the apple. I was hoping the dessert trio would be the one saving grace but it was just as mediocre as the rest of the meal. I also don't think the dark chocolate sauce paired well with the sesame rice ball.   The servers were nice enough but I don't think the food warrants a return visit, especially considering the prices."}
{"text":"Good service but food was just okay. We got some dim sum items (truffle sui mai was the best) and the lobster lo mein (not good). For some expensive and Over priced Chinese food, I was expecting way more! Definitely would've preferred dim sum at a dodgier restaurant. Cute decor though.."}
{"text":"Exquisite.  Every bite was perfection.  Service is extremely attentive and knowledgeable. Really lovely space too.  Dim sum at its finest.  Order a bunch of dishes and wait to be blown away! They have seasonal specials that I would highly recommend.    It's pricey, but worth it for a special occasion.  (We went for my birthday and they gave us a complimentary dessert!)"}
{"text":"Just stopping in the city for a day or two during a road trip. New age dimsum with wonderful service! We had the shrimp cheung fan, chicken cheung fan, Luckee duck and the broccoli and green bean sides. All great dishes--especially the foie gras and green apple that came with the Luckee Duck."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for dimsum with a friend and I was impressed with the variety and interesting spins they had on the traditional dishes. We went early so the restaurant wasn't too packed and the restaurant had $10 parking on weekends. The decor was interesting - asian fusion but old fashioned. It wasn't really to my taste as I thought it felt too cold and eclectic for dimsum.   The food was pretty good, I remember the braised park over lentils and the tiger shrimp being particularly well done. We also had some classic dishes like their rice noodle and steamed dumplings which I thought were good but I had definitely had better. We had a couple other things such as a fusion fried rice and some sweet dishes that weren't very memorable.   Might come here again if a friend wanted to try something different as the quality of the food was good and the dishes were interesting but this isn't a staple for me."}
{"text":"Chinese food done well. I suggest the duck, Chen Fung dumplings either in chicken or shrimp. The duck is served with mini pancakes, apple slices and green onions to make your own dish. These were my favourite from the 12 dishes we tried. The food was overall quite delicious and the service was on point. The ambiance was nice as well and I would hope to return again for these dishes I described above."}
{"text":"This place is all about the environment, but not the food. Décor is nice and morden with high ceiling, open kitchen, dim light and ambient background music. Service is great - almost a bit overly staffed. There are different persons for taking you to the table, taking the order, filling water, delivering dishes,  etc. When it comes to food, I have to say it is a disappointment. We ordered  not quite remember the names exactly: shrimp dumplings or har gow, steamed bun, duck, Golden sand mushroom, kungpow shrimp, tso beef (?). They are traditional Cantonese dishes with minor Western twist. Not so much of wow at all. I feel like, especially the mushroom and tso beef dishes, are the sweet sour deep fried version of cheap stereotypical fake Chinese food and pub food but with better materials to cook. The duck is really below the average compared to what you can find in Toronto. It may be a good one time experience, especially if you prefer fancier environment and great service which most Chinese restaurants lack rather than the Chinese food itself."}
{"text":"Luckee is a great dining experience.  The decor is simplistic chic, as are most of Susur Lee's restaurants. It is a beautiful atmosphere, & great menu.  The dishes are made for sharing, so it's great to go with a few people. I highly recommend the chicken cheung fun - it was delicious! The bang bang chick was also a fun dish with a variation of textures. The only disappointing dish we ordered was the vegetable vermicelli noodles, it was very bland with little to no flavour. Otherwise overall, great experience & nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place and have to try it out. Quite frankly, it was a disappointing experience.  I've had way better dimsum at half the price plus the service was terrible!"}
{"text":"As we were staying at the Soho and love Chinese food we decided to eat at \"Luckee\".   The setting is very hip and stylish, service impeccable and friendly.  We order some dim sum, the green beans, scallops and brisket.  Everything tasted fine and we enjoyed the meal.  Unfortunately, I didn't care for what happened a few hours later. I woke up in the middle of the night suffering from total dehydration. My mouth tasted as though I had just eaten a salt lick. I am not on a restricted diet and don't drink alcohol, I can only attribute this to a (MSG?) sodium overdose from this meal, which made me ill.  If you are the least bit health conscious, eat elsewhere. I would expect this from a cheap takeaway not a \"celebrity\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Came with a group for Summerlicious Lunch at Luckee. We enjoyed  ourselves. The  service was without a fault  I went with what i thought would give me  a unique experience and  had the crispy shrimp & lobster wontons to start, baked chicken as my  main,  & finished off with the dessert trio ( Its always an enjoyable surprise so just enjoy  it when it comes)  The others  with me  got the Hot &  Sour Soup, and the spicy 'mouth-watering' chicken salad as the starters , and  the luckee soba salad & the soya glazed cod  as their mains.  The wontons were very tasty and the  fruit salsa helped balance the seafood . The hot and sour soup was quite good  and the pancake that came with it was a bit too small  , perhaps because it was a lunch portion.  The baked chicken entree was fresh and juicy and  every bite was to be enjoyed from the chicken itself to  the bites of chicken with other items on  the plate.  The luckee soba salad was  very nice . My guest said it was like a  mini  version of the Singapore Slaw you get at  Lee but nothing close to that. Its like comparing apples to oranges. Both r fruits but thats as similar as they get  The dessert trio was fantastic because Susur Lee takes ordinary desserts and transforms them into something great.  For example the sesame ball is usually fillled with lotus seed. Here the sesame ball was stuffed with custard and topped with chocolate sauce .  The sponge roll was softer than what you get at stores and was well  complemented by the rasberry coulis.  Lastly the Mango Sorbet felt sweet and natural instead of the artificial stuff you get  elsewhere.   The one  issue I had today was the cod  entree and has been pictured. My guest  received a tiny piece of cod  on  his plate and we were a bit disappointed.   Please do not give uneven portions for some entrees  as it can potentially ruin a persons dining experience. My  guest was not happy.  Aside from  that I will be back  for more liciouses  and to try the dimsum"}
{"text":"Shrimp cracker and edamame paste (starter, complimentary) - we enjoyed this dish as it was unique and it led us to have high hopes for our next dishes.   Peking duck - pancake wrappers were the right consistency. Not too thick and not too thin. The foie gras and green apple was a nice addition to its traditional toppings. The duck was juicy though I wish the skin was crispier.   Assorted dim sum - liked the har gow with the mushroom base. The veggie dumpling and char siu dumpling were nice, and my favorite was the siu mai. However, there as a piece of bone in my siu mai and at this price point I don't feel like that was acceptable.  Service was attentive and the decor was beautiful.   For two dishes we paid close to $80 and can't say we were very impressed! I don't think we will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Probably the best dim sum I have ever had. The quality of the ingredients was superb. Great variety of flavors and textures. Not your typical venue. Obviously reflects the celebrity chef owner. Prices reflects the location and surroundings. Expensive."}
{"text":"Toronto version of Buddakan and Hakkasan , if you have been to.  Great vibe, cool interior, active music, you feel ppl are looking and you feel good, and great fusion food. Good for Birthday, couple friends gathering ~   Almost wish the menu can be a bit bigger, since it's sharing, the portion isn't big enough and there isn't enough choice to order 2nd round.    All the food are delicious ~ not a dish is dissatisfied yet sth is missing !"}
