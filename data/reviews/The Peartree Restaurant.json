{"text":"I use to regularly go to the Peartree beacuse I live close  by. The waiter is very Polite and nice(I dont remember his name). The owner NOT SO NIce. My husband recently ordered and paid for 2 take out breakfast and returned shortly after to ask if I had picked up the food. The owner rudely interrupted the waiter and yelled \"YOU STUPID\".  My husband immediately left the restaurant as he felt disrespected and didn't  want to get into a confrontation with the owner.
The owner was trying to provoke him in front of paying customers. 
If you want a peaceful meal I would suggest not going to this restaurant because the owner doesn't deserve your hard earned MONEY!!"}
{"text":"I was here for brunch and sat on the patio. The patio is tucked in behind with a large tree providing shade, very pleasant. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Sunday morning but there were several groups on the patio. It was still possible to have private conversations. I had the Creole eggs Benjamin, which were really good. The meal came with a side of fruit, which had more than just your typical melons and oranges. The coffee is good but not special.  The homefries came with sautéd onions and the potatoes were very light but a little dry, pretty good with the creole sauce though. The service was prompt and attentive without hovering. Nice little spot for weekend brunch with friends."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience today at lunch. The white napkins all were stained, one water glass had a full dried lipstick mark, and there was a a lot of hair on the smoked salmon. 
We should have left and we regret not doing so. We did not receive an apology or proper discount. 
We work in the area and enjoy going out for lunch but we will never return here!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from there for the first time. Charged us for our full order but didn't include everything in the order. Ended up paying full price for half the actual amount of food. Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Always yummy!! Never a bad meal! Great decor, LOVE the sunroom in the back. The service here can be 50/50 depending, but still worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Saturday. This is one of those places where you expect a good experience by looking at it from outside: seems cozy, serene, welcoming. Well, the welcoming is true ... as long as you are white. We were lucky, got in early enough to get a fine seat in the brighter part of the back room, and our party had the host come over and chat and make nice. *However*, I watched as parties of Indians (? I think ... by accent and colour) and Asians were led to tables in the back. One of them tried to get the host's attention and was rudely brushed off. 

The food? The dishes we ordered were average, nothing to write home about. The coffee cake looked good, though, but I didn't try it. For the neighbourhood, this was a slightly pricey resto ... but given the quality of the food, it was quite overpriced.

By the time we left (I'm a people watcher), the host had schmoozed with every table with white folks, and made a point of blatantly ignoring the other tables (they were well served by a cute Asian waitress, so they probably had no complaints). The icing on that racism cake? The host himself was brown, presumably either Indian or Sri Lankan by his accent! 

Bottom line, unless you enjoy watching people be treated differently for no reason *and* want average food, avoid this one."}
{"text":"The Peartree is a really lovely little restaurant tucked away on Cabbagetown's busy Parliament Street.  If you're looking for a sedate brunch or slightly more upscale lunch, this is a great stop.

With a beautiful atrium in the rear that is lovely all year round, you can enjoy a patio-like experience without freezing in March.  I have been here for lunch meetings, office holiday dinners and regular lunches, and the food always stands up to the challenge.  The calm atmosphere remains formal without being stiff, and the walls serve as gallery space for local artists.

Their salads are particularly popular, possibly because their tarragon salad dressing is super delcious.  But really, most of the menu is tasty and you will find something for everyone.  It's not an every day kind of place but it certainly is nice!"}
{"text":"The Peartree is a cute & quaint restaurant tucked away in the \"town of cabbages\" neighborhood, on Parliament. You would walk right by it, if you didn't know it was there, it is that obscure. The store front is quite plain and doesn't really catch one's eye. 

I've only been to the Peartree for brunch, mostly on weekends. I've never had to wait for a table, which is nice. And you would never know that they had more seating in the back, if you were not offered to be sat there, or asked to be seated there, which is quite lovely on a sunny day. You can enjoy the sunshine within the enclosed atrium during your dining experience, or actually go outside the atrium, to their rear patio, where I have begun many a weekend brunch with a bloody caesar, num-num. It's a lovely setting, the rear patio, feeling the sunshine, warm on your skin, and enjoying your brunch. 

One of the Peartree's treasures, I think, is on weekends, they make the most delicious and scrumptious blueberry cake! I'm fearful when I go for brunch that I may have arrived to late, and all the cake is gone (oh how dreadful!) Each customer is served a square while mulling over the menu. Yum-o! I'll confess, I've only ever had their Eggs Benny, because it is SO good, and when I find something I like somewhere, it takes a crowbar to move me. However, my dining companions have had their waffles, salads and a few pasta dishes with no complaints. 

Service is always reasonable. When you're having a leisurely brunch, you don't want service to be too prompt, now do you? Well I sure don't. Makes me feel rushed. Prices are manageable. I can always rely on the Peartree for a enjoyable brunch, with no speed-bumps or hiccups, in short, reliable. I guess that's what keeps me going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem!! My boyfriend randomly came across it and fell in love with everything. The restaurant is quaint looking, and the food tastes great! Definitely a great spot for a date or just to hang out with a few friends.

{"text":"My parents, boyfriend and I were looking for a nice sit-down meal that wouldn't be too pricey and chose The Peartree solely based on location. It ended up being a wonderful spot to which we will definitely return. 

The biscuits that were brought out to start were unbelievable and we ended up asking for a second basket. I had the veggie stirfry with jasmine rice and it was fantastic - there were enough for leftovers the next day, which is always nice. My dad had the butternut squash soup (not cream-based) to start and it was amazing- I will be ordering this next time! My boyfriend had one of the specials - the butter chicken - and my mom had the fish with potatoes and veggies. They both enjoyed their meals.

The atmosphere was very nice and I will be back! I'm looking forward to trying brunch next time, as well as the other items on the very diverse menu. There is definitely something for everybody at this place!"}
{"text":"New Years Eve fixed menu was fair for the cost, $70 for 2; the soup - Mushroom/Brie was a hit with most if not all those that ordered it, delicious deserts too, coffee was weak and the main - surf & turf was overflowing in garlic butter, great for lobster tail, not so great on the alleged angus steak - too fatty & chewy but had great flavour. Willing to try this place one more time but then again maybe not."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friends going away party. Got the back patio which is a great space for larger parties and gives a private party lots of space to chat.
The service was great with our waitress being amazingly patient and accurate with our group of 12. 
We ordered a bunch of French onion soups for appies which were rich and worth ordering. 
We ordered a mix of sandwiches and salads, personally I loved my Cajun shrimp avocado and mango salad. They were very generous with the described toppings and the raspberry vinaigrette paired very well. 
Definitely would go again for a party or date!"}
{"text":"I'm mostly here for brunch and recommend it.  Nothing on the menu will blow your mind, but it's good standard fare, big portions, and a low cost.  The service can be a little slow, but not bad.  Bonus: they have blueberry coffee cake that comes with brunch and is delicious."}
{"text":"Had an absolute horrible first experience at this restaurant.  Firstly, when my wife and I walked in, we had to get the hosts attention, he came over and muttered something and walked away.  Well, we weren't sure what was happening and he was taking a really long time, so we started to sit at another table (the place was only about half full). He came over and moved us to another table - right next to the kitchen serving window.

We both ordered brunch, the service was not very attentive (we had to constantly ask for things, including the free bread). The wait time was going on about 20 minutes and when I finally flagged the waiter down, he didn't seem too concerned.  He talked to the cook staff and told us that it was taking long because they had to make the hollandaise sauce, even though they have 20 different kinds of eggs benny on their menu, to which they were serving without issue to other patrons - some of whom, arrived after us and left before our food came.

After about 30 minutes, we got our food (minus one item, which we again had to get on top of them for).  I told the waiter that I thought that everything was totally unacceptable, he offered no apology and his solution was to go over to his co-workers and from the looks and pointing, we assume he was talking about us.

Blasé food, horrible and unprofessional service, I'm amazed that this place is actually still in business.  I will never return."}
{"text":"Where the pears at? I had a good time here but not a great time. A group of six was able to get table here smack dab in the middle of a Friday night so I guess that's good to know. 

The bread basket is... biscuits. Not what I was expecting and while they were ok, they were not what I was looking for pre-meal. My meal was salmon with a lemon dill sauce, steamed veggies and French fries. The French fries were the best part. They were good! Browned nicely, crisp and I liked alternating between dipping them in ketchup AND the lemon dill sauce. 

K, the salmon though. It says something if fries are my favourite part of a meal. It was a bit overdone for my liking and that was shown with it's harder crust. The sauce was a bit overpowering, leaving no room for the salmon to breathe or be eaten without it. The vegetables were steamed: two carrots, one cauliflower, one broccoli. They didn't taste so fresh and had an odd aftertaste that I would cover up with the ample sauce. 

Our server was very nice though and our water glasses were never low. When it came to the bills, he gave us no trouble when we asked to split the bill up. It seemed like a good place to bring a family and the room was nice enough, just a bit dated."}
{"text":"I really like the brunch here. 

For dinner I've only ever tried the curry pasta - it was a bit heavy but not bad. I'd try something else next time. 

It's not as formal as you might think from outside - it's a fairly casual brunch atmosphere, a step up from a greasy spoon though. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Had the beef liver with rice and caramelized onions. Medium-rare was done nicely and the onions were great. Not too bad for the $15 price."}
{"text":"The entire experience was fairly average, I regret not walking further north to some of the other food & drink locations."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city! Here's why:
- comfort food at its finest
- everything that kitchen pumps out is delicious 
- excellent portion sizes - they don't skimp on anything
- great service and friendly staff
- comfortable seating and cozy atmosphere (none of this modern, industrial-chic-sitting-on-metal-box type atmosphere)
- delicious cakes for dessert, I recommend the chocolate mousse... Yum!

This is not your hip king street joint, in fact, it feels like a place to bring your grandmother, but Pear Tree is a hidden gem in Toronto that is reminiscent of a really good 90's restaurant that serves delicious food with sizable portions at a reasonable price. Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've never had anything I didn't like at the Peartree. The spinach & goat cheese salad is really delicious (and I can't by any means call myself a salad person). The goat cheese is plentiful, unlike some other places where a tiny dollop on the side is all you might expect. This was the first salad I ever really, really enjoyed. I also had the sweet potato fries which were appreciated both by me and my colleagues! 

Now, for the real winner - the linguine pesto cream pasta bowl is DELICIOUS (if you value healthy, un-oily eats don't do this to yourself, but if you like a nice creamy Italian dish every now and then and consider yourself to be a fan of alfredo / pesto sauces more so than marinara, this is a must-try). Cherry tomatoes are a beautiful touch, and the spinach is more than bearable! (As you can see I am not the healthiest eater..)The roasted butternut squash soup is not bad at all. I should also add that whenever I've called to clarify something about the menu (more than once..), the restaurant has been gracious and patient.

I have been coming again and again :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is lovely. 
There is us a nice patio area at the back.
Food is not bad. Not bad for a brunch."}
{"text":"Beautiful little place in Cabbagetown.  Great brunch place.  Definitely go for brunch.
Nicely done poached eggs.

The food is a little on the salty end- actually very on the salty end.  So ask for all sauces and everything on the side until you can try it.  But there's a reason for this.  You walk in on a nice afternoon ready to hanker down for a good hangover breakfast at 3pm.  And you look around and it looks like a cruise ship.  And old person cruise ship.  So expect the design, food and waitstaff to be much like a cruise ship experience.  This place rocks, old people and all.

And the service is excellent so tip them well.  Unlike a cruise ship."}
{"text":"An update of sorts but still sort of the same: 

I have been going to The Peartree for years. Many years in fact, as I find it a sunny oasis, and by this I refer specifically to their sunroom at the back. In fact I mostly only sit there. 

To be honest, I hardly if ever eat on the inside of the restaurant, where at times is a bit too dark and full of locals, older locals or couples with the odd kid. 

Generally speaking I come for the brunch and although sufficient, I must admit that I have had better. The strange thing with this place is that for example, their eggs benny always look the same. I mean, like, really the same. I little waayyy to alike. Which is a negative note since their eggs benny somehow always seems to be smaller than the same dish I have had in other brunch places. 

Price is not on the cheap end but definitely not overpriced, however at that price point you might get better taste from the eggs Benny at say Flo's dinner up in Yorkville. 

Now why do I keep coming back here? My usual server is very nice, the aforementioned sunroom at the back is a big bonus PLUS the single fact that they can take large groups, which on its own is worth at least one star above average.

Now that I live within walking distance I am bound to drop by a few more times since that sunroom in Winter is always welcome. You should give it a try."}
{"text":"First time dining here ever and food was quite acceptable, maybe above average.  I personally had the lemon dill salmon with steamed vegetables...moist and lemon dill gave it a nice kick.  Rest of the family opted for the Mother's Day 3-course menu option, seemed like the prime rib entrees were well enjoyed.  Nice ambiance in a quaint neighbourhood.  Only comment would be the service left us a bit wanting.  At times we felt like our waiter perceived us as imposing too much...while really our requests were standard of what we make at any other restaurant (even in top-notch fine dining!).  Understandable if it were super busy but it was not.  Could've used a bit more genuine customer service.  Overall, deserving of 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"What an interesting selection! The menu has all sorts of options from regular brunch fare to salads and sandwiches, quesedillas. 
It's very reasonably priced, too! I went with a voucher for $35 for two of us and the waiter kept making us order more than we wanted to get the full money's worth. I found it a bit odd actually, but we stuffed ourselves. We had amongst us:
an appetizer of fried calamari rings, I had a chicken quesidilla and mushroom/bree soup, she had 2 poached eggs on chicken breasts and toast with hollandaise sauce, a plate of melons and fries with fried onions (yum!), that only adding up to $29 he insisted we order dessert so we shared a pecan pie (big piece!). Even then we were only at $34 plus tax. 

Yummy food, nice environment. I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"if anyone would tell me in advance that it's so hard to find a place to have decent diner in the east end of the city my stress level would be significantly lower.... but this place proved to be great!

I booked a spot for 15ppl for dinner on saturday night and was told that it's easy to accommodate even though they already had two groups of 10ppl booked for the same time.

the original table they set up for us would only fit 8ppl. and then we had an additional table for the rest of the group that wasn't set up yet by the time I came (15min late) we squeezed in and asked for few additional tables that eventually fit all 15 of us. so the minus point is that we were supposed to be separated in two groups and one table wasn't set up by the agreed time. but the plus point is that they finally accommodated us at one single table on our request.

the menu is aaaaaamazing for both carnivores and veg'ns. with different menus from all around the world. and they have a long wine list and full bar. veg thai stir fry was delicious! people around me had some great dishes too.

also great decorations and the ambiance is very cozy. 

if in the east end this place is definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Yum!  I went here with a group of friends for dinner, and this place is great!   The food was wonderful (particularly the hamburger with swiss cheese), and the pie was entirely amazing.  If I may descend to internet parlance for a minute, OMG the pie!

Service was friendly, efficient, and accommodating, and the restaurant has a quiet, intimate feel (which I'm afraid my large group compromised a bit).  They didn't hustle us out the door, either.  I'd love to go back."}
{"text":"I found the food average and would go back if my usual places weren't open, BUT the owner is miserable. He was awful to our waitress who was LOVELY. Her name was Amanda. We overheard him tell her to clean the table beside ours off before putting our order in that she'd already taken from us."}
{"text":"Good deal on the set menu, solid food but nothing spectacular and the decor a bit dated."}
{"text":"I ordered eggs Benedict, there were only 2 poached eggs, which were overcooked, i ordered them medium, the English muffin was stale, the peameal bacon was overcooked, stiff as a board.  The side of fresh fruit was not fresh, it was several days old, slimy, disgusting.  The home fries were good, but the potatoes lacked consistency in the size of their cut and therefore some were cooked perfectly and some were under-cooked.  The portions are small, and the prices are too high for the size and lack of quality.  I also ordered a hamburger with fries, the burger was bland, and tasted like it had been frozen, the fries were poorly seasoned."}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions and the food and service was okay. 

Today I met a friend for lunch at the Pear Tree. The only unoccupied and unreserved table was the one right beside the kitchen service window. Needles to say during our lunch, none of those \"reserved tables\" were used...ODD.

We were only given the BRUNCH menu, and my friend and I both ordered the same thing; Chicken Fingers with Fries and a side of Gravy. It also came with a small Caesar salad. 


Fries and Chicken was good. However, the salad tasted of mould. Which to say the least was not very pleasant at all and due to this fact alone, I do not think I will be returning any time in the future."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Pear Tree with my pal for the second time this afternoon. The stretch of Parliament from Gerrard up to Wellesley has become a pretty 'happening' area for restaurants; 20 years ago, I remember visiting my pediatrician in this area and thinking of how gross this area was. Pear Tree seems to be quite busy on Sunday's; a lot of locals of Cabbagetown dine here as it's reasonably priced. Additionally, they offer both a Lunch and Brunch menu, which have a variety of dishes for all tastes. The food is a-ok; I had the quesadilla today and it was a 'meh' but I liked the apple toffee cheesecake. Service is pretty good.

Good for: brunch, dessert, breakfast"}
{"text":"I came here for Brunch with D and two other friends. It was a weekday in which we came here for Brunch. I have to say, I have always walked by this place and on weekends quite busy for Brunch. But I have to say, I was kind of disappointed. Why? For one the service was a bit lacking in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, the servers were all nice, but the level of attention we received was on the low end. Secondly, the food quality was below average. I ordered one of the egg benny and I have to say, it wasn't bad but I wouldn't say it was good either. It was satisfactory. Even though the prices were en par with the Brunch places in the area, I have to say the food quality, service, and interior decor needs improvements."}
{"text":"Solid experience at the Peartree restaurant.  Truth be told, we were ready to eat after a night of partying. This place was way better than a greasy spoon and we were glad to have had their brunch in our tummies.

The star attraction of their brunch menu is the offerings of eggs benedict or benjamins.  It's hearty, tasty, and also filling.

The service was attentive, fast, and friendly.  The restaurant feels comfy for brunch and it was quiet because we were one of the first people through the door.

This seems like a good neighbourhood spot to come back to."}
{"text":"Lovely back patio on a summer day. Nice place to have a pint with friends. Simple food, tasty. Had a chicken avocado melt that was tasty."}
{"text":"This place has turned into one of our local \"go to\" places for a quick dinner when in the mood for a hearty but unpretentious meal. Bonus points for their reasonably priced wine and beer, nice patio out back, and never having to wait for a table.

Food is affordable in that I think everything on the menu is under $20 for a main with roasted potatoes (sometimes baked or mashed for that matter) and veggies, and usually have specials which also get you a side of soup or salad too. Either way you also get their amazing home made bread rolls to kick off the dining experience.

We've been probably over a dozen times and only 2 times ever had a bad experience, exclusively due to the same non-attentive waitress who never checked on us, leaving us with empty glasses and one time not even getting the bread to the table.  Otherwise we've always been treated right, including when we held a special event for 20+ people here when we were very happy with the experience including the service. So based on the odds of disappointment, this place is still a pretty sure thing for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"- Lots of variety on the menu (coconut curry pasta - yum! AAA prime rib that melts in your mouth)  
- Good portions of food 
- Nice environment 
- Good service"}
{"text":"It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I write this update.  This place used to be one of my favourite brunch spots.  However, after a recent visit here for brunch with a friend, I felt the need..nay, responsibility, to change my review.

I met my friend here early afternoon on a Sunday for a nice little brunch.  She arrived first and tried to get us a nice table.  She was told that ALL THE OTHER tables were reserved and was sat next to the kitchen serving window...squeezed into the furthest recesses of the restaurant.  Our view you ask?  Why a sea of EMPTY, white linen covered tables...one by the window even.  

We ordered our food...chicken fingers with Caesar salad...I know, not terribly adventurous, but I did order a mimosa to go with :)  The food took what seemed like forever to arrive.  The chicken fingers were meh, but the salad was an absolute train wreck!  The lettuce was wilted and drenched in a dressing that can best be described as mouldy in both colour and flavour.

I ate my chicken fingers, but when I told our server that the salad tasted mouldy, he kind of nodded, shrugged his shoulders, took my plate and walked away. WTF?  No effusive \"I'm so sorry...how can we make it up to you?\" or, even so much as a \"we won't charge you for it.\"  Hmpff!  

We got our check, paid our bill and left...never to darken it's doorstep again.

FYI, we were there for over an hour and a half and not a single person was ever seated at their precious \"reserved\" tables."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and ordered the rocky mountain french toast and english breakfast tea with milk. I requested fresh milk and the server accommodated me and brought me a small jug. I am not a fan of those single serving 'creamers' and prefer fresh cream/milk.

I have no idea why the french toast is called rocky mountain, but they use egg bread (2 thick slices cut in half) and it was quite tasty. The bacon on the side did not look appetizing. Fresh fruit bowl on the side is very welcomed.

I sat in the indoor patio, which on a sunny, beautiful day, was not needed. All in all, okay."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I came here from brunch and was pleasantly surprised.  They offered a big breakfast and lunch menu.  

I ordered the strawberry pancakes.  They were delicious.  They came with a side of bacon, sausage or home fries, which I was happy about b/c most places they come alone and I have to order a side of bacon.  I opted for bacon, though was disappointed that it was overdone.  

While we waited for our food, the friendly waiter brought over from blueberry coffee cake on the house.  It was warm, moist, fluffy and really tasty.  

The decor was about as good as their coffee, which wasn't tasty.  

Apparently there is a patio out back.  We didn't check it out b/c it was really hot out, but will do so in the future!"}
{"text":"Yeah, not bad. Not great, but not bad. It's a fine place in a hit-and-miss area of town. Service was very friendly and efficient, even though he said he had only been working there a couple months. 

The coconut curry seafood linguine was very tasty. Ordered it spicy hot and it was, so that's a plus. Linguine was done just right. Shrimp and scallops were a bit overcooked and tough/rubbery. 

The teriyaki chicken was tasty, but maybe a bit less traditional in the interpretation of teriyaki. Lots of yummy veggies, though.

Bruschetta was tasty and fresh. 

Overall, pretty good. If we were local we would try it again."}
{"text":"I came for brunch with friends but was quite disappointed. Toast is too dark. Pancake is also dark."}
{"text":"Always good food and appropriate service; not hovering but not ignoring. Favourites are Teriyaki Stir Fry and customizing of spice level is offered. The Ravioli is a large and tasty choice too. Not a big wine list but an attractive cooler full of yummy desserts, which is a rarity these days. Try to sit in the covered patio with a gas fireplace going on cold days."}
{"text":"came here for brunch. lots of space to sit in a comfortable and calm environment. i have a small child and there is lots of room for a stroller and high chair. the staff are very polite and the venue is low-key. i feel like this restaurant attracts more of an older crowd (50's and 60's), but it was still nice. 

the blueberry coffee cake was amazing. keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I'm still discovering the new restaurants in my new hood and was about to go and settle for Ginger but while walking around discovered this restaurant.  It's definitely a hidden gem of the area.  I've never heard of it and it was completely random that I stumbled upon this place with a friend.

The menu posted on the door attracted us in with the very reasonable prices and specials but upon entering the place was just what we were looking for; a nice place to catch-up with a friend.  They had a bar with draft beer, but we sat at a table and the noise level was moderately quiet, which was perfect for chatting.

The waitress was attentive and they had a nice display of what looked like La Roc cakes in a display case, which looked very tempting.  The food was perfectly cooked.  We had the salmon and steak dinners specials with an appetizer and it was a very good portion size.  They also served some biscuits with butter at the beginning of the meal that I didn't care too much for.

I will definitely be back for more now that I am in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a fixture in C-town.  When I moved here 12 years ago, it seemed to be more of \"THE place to go\" than it is now.  Restaurants have their days in the sun.  But it still thrives, with an older clientele mostly.  The food is consistently very good.  It's not quite FINE dining.  More like really good home-cooked food.  But the menu is extensive.  In summer, they regularly have gazpacho that's very good.  The shrimp cocktail is refreshing.  The salad bowls are amazing and filling.  The steak is not as good as The Keg's, but still excellent.

@Liz M....wasps ain't the restaurant's problem.  It's not like there are wasps at The Peartree, but not next door.  It's an environmental thing.  Yes, wasps can be bad.  Everywhere.  I'm terrified by the buggers (bad childhood experience).  

The patio is delightful, except for the noticeably loud fan on the roof.  The solarium in the back is great for parties and winter brunches.

Extensive dessert menu, cakes and cobblers.

Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars because even the leftover food that I had taken home still tasted really good the day after... It was a medium rare steak and ravioli. Hmmmm."}
{"text":"Order ground beef burger medium rare made fresh with soup and salad... 

Got seated quickly and food was hot and fresh... I had to run out to see a friend on the street and server went as far as warming up my food for me again...

Will surely go back!"}
{"text":"While as a vegetarian this place would not be on my list of places to eat (only a few vegetarian options and one vegan option on the menu) I would say that it accommodates a large group of meat eaters/vegetarians pretty well. I was here for a birthday dinner and the food was decent and the service was great. A varied menu with something for everyone.  Everyone was happy with their meals.

I had the veg quesadilla with side salad. The quessdilla was definitely a step or two above the ones that you get at pubs and they don't skimp on the veggies (even the red pepper!!!). Also top notch side salad (not lame iceburg lettuce with celery or some crap). 

A lot of the vegetarian options at this place had goat cheese....and as a vegetarian that hates goat cheese, I weep.....goat cheese you are ruining my life!!!!

I would definitely consider this place for a large group."}
{"text":"Had dinner delivered a few times, I enjoyed the Fisherman's Fettuccine, consisted of tiger shrimps, scallops, mussels, and calamari in white wine cream sauce.  The Quiche with Caesar Salad, on the other hand, was a miss for me.  The crust was too hard and the romaine lettuce was not fresh.  Most of the food I have tried so far was alright, and I do like the varieties this restaurant has to offer.  Would like to visit this place for brunch and try the Crab Eggs Benedict someday."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice for breakfast but each time the breakfast has been really, really good and affordable and the service was also very good ! In opinion it one of the best breakfast spots on this side of town."}

{"text":"We came hear for a girl's day out brunch. The back room was lovely and the food was quiet nice. It is standard brunch fare but very nice. We had a lovely time. Not to loud so we could catch up with one another while enjoying our food. I recommend it."}

Oh the lip-smacking food! Oh the lustrous creamy mushroom soup! I can't describe how delicious the food was, will I visit this place again? Absolutely!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late afternoon visit on a Tuesday as a visitor to your city. We chose the Pear Tree after reviewing its online menu. We were the only ones dining and found the food spectacular. I had the seafood quesadilla,my sons had the chicken quesadilla and chicken ravioli and my wife a chicken salad. All meals were presented well and very good. We marveled at the taste and sampled each other's. Also they had on display desserts and we had this too. Family of 4 plus dessert and out the door for under $80.00. Great hope they don't change."}
{"text":"My brother and I stopped at Peartree for an impromptu brunch and were super satisfied with our experience. I ordered the Eggs Florentine - yummy, poached eggs done perfectly with a zesty/lemony hollandaise sauce on top and a small fruit salad - and my brother ordered the Chicken Creole Eggs Benedict. Quite a meal to have so early in the morning but make no mistake - it was devoured in its entirety. Quaint little spot in Cabbagetown that is clearly a favourite with the locals!"}
