{"text":"OMG. Price for freshness, can't be beat.  Yes, there are better Viet subs in the world, but this, so far, is the best value for dollar that I've found in Calgary."}
{"text":"Friendly service, fresh sandwiches and great won ton soup. Great place for a quick, delicious and healthy meal."}
{"text":"$4 a Sub, can you get any better value than that?  Seriously these guys make the freshest and meanest Vietnamese sub, I love their chicken sauté subs. Please give these ladies a try, trust me you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was craving a Vietnamese sub last weekend while I was out in the NE and spotted this little joint in a strip mall. Thought I'd give it a try. I should know better when the price is really low, the quality most likely will be low too. Thus my disappointment in the chicken satay sub I had here. The lady put this gooey sauce on it that almost looked like honey, not your regular darker soya type sub sauce. Really, thanks for ruining a what could have been a decent sub. I tried to eat it but that awful sauce just about made me sick. What the hell was it? Not sure but recommend NEVER putting on a sub. That's just so wrong. I guess it could have been ok but I never got to really taste it. I threw the sub out at my first chance. Don't go here. Calgary has better places to get a Vietnamese sub."}
{"text":"Very reasonable price good Vietnamese subs place. Every sub is $5, veggie sub $4 each. Taste very good. Recommend to try out."}
{"text":"This is my preferred place for Vietnamese Sub in the area.  $4 gets you one of the 4-5 types of subs they make.  There is even a Veggie sub for vegetarian.  My favourite is the Beef Sate Sub.  I usually go there for take outs, since it is so quick (around 5 minutes if there is not a big order in front of you).  I think the this place is owned by or is associated with Pho Xuan in the same strip mall... not a bad thing if this is the case."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much inside, but for a $6 Bahn Mi you can't complain. The menu is quite simple: chicken, beef or mixed meat subs, wonton soup and salad rolls. On this visit, I went with the chicken sate sub. It was exactly what I expected and wanted: a big fresh roll, chopped chicken, mayo, sate sauce, carrots, cucumber cilantro and jalapeno. In particular, I liked the use of fresh jalapeno over the spicier thai chilis that you get at other restaurants."}
{"text":"If you like vietnamese subs come here.  Sweet baby Jesus it's Christmas in my mouth.   $9. 50 for soup, salad and a drink Or  $10.50 for salad rolls, sub and drink.   I'm impressed."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese subs so how have I not discovered this place until now?!  I stopped by here as I was craving a good sandwich and luckily Yelpers directed me here.  I had the assorted sub, which is my favourite, and it was delicious - there was a generous amount of pate on the sub, which in my opinion, really elevates the sub to the next level.  Veggies were crunchy and the bread was perfect.  Staff was nice and friendly.  This restaurant is in a strip mall right across from Pacific Place Mall in the NE.  There's ample parking.  It also accepts credit card, which is really handy."}
{"text":"I was craving for a good sandwich for lunch one day and found La Cay.  Their salad roll combo with any sub you want is a good deal for $11.50. It comes with 3 salad rolls and they don't water down the hoisin sauce until its it's bland. The sub was fresh and tasty.  I saw them making homemade wontons so I might try that next time. I like that local restaurants like this that make things from scratch.  I'll definitely try La Cay again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"$4 for a Banh Mi.  I had the veggie ham and it was great.  Quick service.  Tasty.  cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Their subs are fantastic their spring rolls are excellent never tried the wonton soup or the chicken wrap it's a small quaint place with great service some pop Pepsi products and bottled water but they are out today! My husband says the chicken sub is very good as well I would highly recommend this place for Vietnamese subs"}
{"text":"Ordered a beef sauté and an assorted sub. Both flavorful and good portions. Quick service. Price per sub was $5 plus tax. Can't go wrong. They stick with the basics, don't try to do anything fancy like having a special sauce or adding cheese, but for $5 you can't complain. They are tasty at a great value."}
