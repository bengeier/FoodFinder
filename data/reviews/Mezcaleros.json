{"text":"Great new inexpensive spot with a terrasse On Parc for a drink and tasty Mexican snacks. They currently have a promotion of $1 oysters on Sundays if you get a cocktail (El Pepino is refreshing). Service was very accommodating and friendly!"}
{"text":"New Restaurant Alert! 4.5 stars  The boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat thursday night and we came across this hidden cove on yelp. Good but few ratings, enough pictures to interest us, 5 minutes from my house and a supposed 4.95$ food menu; we were sold!   Watch out because the sign is barely notieable. We walked by twice before realizing it was right under our noses. I'd say this is something that could be improved, but I did take a picture of the entrance anyway.  The decor actually reminds me of a sushi buffet. It's super funky and mordern with a woodsy twist (Woodland creature on their water bottles). It's also very clean. They don't have AC and so it does feel a bit stuffy on a warm summer night (also the reason I knocked down a half star)  Staff was great, super knowledgeable about their product and friendly.  We ordered the Tacos Dorados with chicken (the chicken was a bit dry but I think that's how it is supposed to be), the chorizo sliders, and the quesitos. Everything was delcious! I especially liked the quesitos which were cheese sticks with bacon and jalapeno mayo (not spicy at all!)   Very satisfied with my visit and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"*Update: THERE WAS A RAT IN THE BATHROOM! and the bartender told us to go away if we were not patient to wait for them* Do not come here on a Friday evening, there is not enough staff for all the people that come in. It took them one hour to get us our drinks and they had to \"double check\" our order! We had to call our waitress twice and remind her that we still haven't gotten our food. We order 5 shots to start and they arrived way later than the first entree. They really need to hire more people and improve a lot their service. Coming here felt like a waste of time, didn't enjoy my experience here at all. Not worth it!!!"}
