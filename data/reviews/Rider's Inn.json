{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had!

I went there for lunch with my wife.  We were hoping for a nice local experience based on the appearance and history of the building.

I tried to eat a meal consisting of meatballs, vegetables, and mashed potatoes.

The potatoes were made from instant powder (not real potatoes)
The vegetables were canned and then overcooked
By the taste of the meatballs, they appeared to be reheated frozen ones.

After a few bites of each and I was unable to finish.

My wife did not have luck either with her salad.  It certainly wasn't made that same day.  Limp and wilted greens, awful dressing.

The service did not fare any better.  Although we were one of two tables in the entire dining room, the server was unable to get a soft drink out before we asked for the check.

We complained about the food and service, the response was a blank stare.  Clearly, this is not a place that takes pride in anything they do.

We promptly payed, and as we were leaving smiled and said thank you only to receive an odd stare from both the waitress and the hostess on duty.

Save yourself the trouble unless you like reheated, non-fresh frozen food and sub-par service.  The silver lining is I doubt a place like this can't stay open very long without a major overhaul."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a week during a business trip last December. The owner was very friendly and often chatted with her in the evenings. The rest of the staff was cheerful and friendly but the rooms need some upgrading... My bed wasn't very comfortable...The faucets and shower heads needed replacing. There was also a burglary in the room across from me while I was staying there...

It was nice having a pub and a restaurant in the same building downstairs. However, the live music on Fridays and weekends could get a bit loud for those staying in the rooms above!"}
{"text":"Stayed overnight and had breakfast which was included in the room price. There were 7-8 breakfast entrees to choose from, oddly written with pen on a sheet of notebook paper carried by the waiter/host. Strange but ok. My standard eggs-toast-potatoes were fine as were my wife's poached eggs. 

Ambiance:  deserted inn, struggling to survive. We were going to eat lunch there the day before when we arrived, but when we got there at prime lunch time at 1:30 on a Saturday, there was no one there. I generally make it a point not to be a kitchens only customer. Not a good sign. 

Kind of a crazy goofy place that trades on some ghost stories. But we wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Nice place, great staff and great atmosphere. They were a stop on the Underground Railroad and they used to give tours of the basement but some idiot hot their head, sued the inn for their stupidity and ruined it for the rest of us so no longer can you see that important piece of history. It's still  a neat, different experience."}
{"text":"It's been many years since we last visited Rider's, but the food and atmosphere was very good. We were in town with family and friends for New Years weekend and decided to visit.  I called to request a reservation and spoke with the owner.  She said no need because the weather was so bad, just come in  and she would have a special table by the fireplace for us.  Didn't happen.  The food was terrible, service mediocre and the owner was way over the top basically forcing us to drink some free hot cider to make up for the bad service.  We had to beg for our checks.  They were handwritten and took forever to get.  Won't visit again."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Elaine, the greeter seemed half in the bag at 8 pm (that means drunk). They have a house dog named snukki, we loved hem.  We heard rumors of ghosts.  We did get many \"uncomfortable\" feelings while in the hotel but never saw a ghost. The food was good but the water tasted funny. Bring your own pillows.


Update: the breakfast in bed was late."}
{"text":"I was in town with friends and was excited to dine at this charming Inn.  So many times I had driven by this historic home and B and B and thought just how wonderful it must be.  The service was slow and the food was subpar.  We had fruit flys buzzing around our table, the rice was crunchy on everyone's plate and service was slow.  When I mentioned to the waitress about the annoying fruit flys she said she would tell the manager.  When she came out the waitress was very apologetic but said the kitchen staff was laughing.  Not what a paying patron would expect to hear.  At this point the entire party just wanted to leave the owner came out and offered a free cup of hot cider, when we declined she forced us all to take a sip.  Again super strange behavior.  In a nut shell this place was in need of TLC and a good cleaning, a new chef and a waitress with some training.  We will never visit again."}
{"text":"Cozy place, friendly staff. We stayed here three nights while attending a wedding weekend. The rooms are on the small side but we fit four adults, one child and two infants into two rooms connected by a bath. The rooms were clean and well equipped. Breakfast was generously portioned and delicious. Our rehearsal dinner was good too, save room for the bread pudding, even if you have to share. The rooms are quiet during the well but they do have music downstairs on the weekend. The volume wasn't more than a radio playing in our room and it ends at 11 pm. We would definitely stay again."}
{"text":"Father's 75th Surprise Birthday Party-Owner took advantage of a joyous occasion. 

Months of planning to create a surprise party for my Dad. There was myself and my mother working with the venue to help plan the event. Overall the event went well, but not because of the owner. Family and friends made the event great.

Upon arrival we were expecting a private room for 31 people. We were placed in the main dining hall with portable 6 foot dividers to separate us from others. I inquired about a private dining space and was told by the owner the private space could only hold 30 and she decided this was the best fit. She told me she would waive the $50 room rental fee. Which is ridiculous to charge anyways because we had a section, not a private room.(charged anyways)

My brother also told her that we would like only 2 bottles of wine placed on the tables for a toast. She insisted on pouring everyone's glass and then charged us $7 a glass(30 glasses) to equal over $200 of wine(4 bottles). We asked for 2 bottles since it was a cash bar and guests had their own drinks already.

Also, the owner decided that it was her right to make their traditional toast and then let us make a toast. Thank you for forcing yourself into our event.

We also had a table of 3 that was served last after other tables had already completed their dinner.

We brought in a professional chocolate cake and were charged $15 to cut the cake. We asked to cut it ourselves and were told they have to cut it and charge us for liability reasons. My mother asked for a slice of White cake since she was allergic to Chocolate(oversight by us). The owner brought out an 8\" cake and then charged us $24 for that cake as well, after she told us she would be able to find a slice in the back.

When the final bill was due, the owner pulled my mother to the side to settle up. As I watched the transaction, she kept her left arm over a majority of the bill and showed the final price at the bottom of $1300+. 

Upon further inspection after the check was written, we noticed the wine issue and she charged us $50 for the room fee, even though she said it was going to be waived. 

Upon inquiring with her about the charges she immediately took offense and said \"Don't try and nickel/dime me\". Really? We verify the bill and catch you over charging and we are somehow in the wrong?

The venue was not very busy on a Saturday night and we brought in a majority of their revenue that evening.

It was a great event for our Dad to share with family and friends, but to witness my 75 old mother being taken advantage by the owner was very disappointing. Fortunately, my brother and myself were able to step in and have the owner cut us a check for $200 to cover the over charging. 

There was another person named Gary who was excellent that night. Very helpful that evening and was able to find us a speaker to play music for the evening. Gary was a pleasure to work with.

Fortunately my Dad was not aware of the drama behind the scenes which is the most important thing.

The front of the building also needs a good cleaning or a paint job. Very depressed looking building upon arrival.

We spent another hour or so in the bar after the dinner, which was also a highlight of the evening. Cool little bar with live music and the bartender was great!

I applaud the staff who worked very hard that night.

I wish I could give a better review of the venue, but people make the difference.

Their ambiance is fine, but if you want to host a private event I suggest you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a very, very old bed and breakfast. A brief history available in the lobby indicates that it was involved in the Underground Railroad, and is currently haunted.
At 6 PM on a Friday night this place was dead (maybe ghostly handy work?) For a time, we were the only people there. All things considered, it's a bit pricey.  The food is pretty good.  They had a very interesting garlic vinaigrette salad dressing, unusual but very good.  The Steak Suzanne (similar to Steak Diane) was very tender and the mushroom sauce was flavorful. The rack of lamb looked great. The Connecticut Yankee Pot Roast was okay, nothing spectacular. The fresh veggies served with each dish were excellent, but the mashed potatoes were not very good. I'm not sure if it was a lack of butter or milk, but they weren't very creamy and had little to no flavor.
Their choice of dinning music was atrocious; the greatest hits from the 60s, 70s, and 80s in an eclectic mix might work in a waffle house or other greasy spoon, but not in dining room with table cloths, cloth napkins, and $20 to $30 entrees.
Overall, the food is good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"An interesting old B&B that has some history and is supposedly haunted too. The bar has some patine to it. If the walls could talk they'd have some stories I'm sure.  The main dining area was cozy. When we arrived there were some ladies playing cards at one table adding to the charm of this establishment.

On this visit I had the French dip sandwich. It was served with a side of au jus and lightly battered steak fries.  The sandwich fantastic. The roll was fresh with ample portion of thinly carved roast beef, grilled onions and melted provolone cheese. The au jus was steaming hot and rich with beef flavor.  Perfect for dipping into.

Ive been here a few times for lunch and enjoy their good service. The food quality is high and the dining area is clean and tidy."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Rider's Inn for their Easter Brunch and it was certainly NOT worth the cost of $29.99 per person. The restaurant was not very busy during our time there at 11:30 am. But yet, we were crammed in like sardines against a back wall and very uncomfortable. There was hardly enough room to really sit comfortably. Getting out of seats to actually get to the buffet was navigating people like the game of Tetris. The buffet was definitely not laid out well at all and lacked any sort of side dish. If you were a vegetarian, you were out of luck (we were not fortunately). There were no veggies at all. When I had asked for ketchup, I was given a small cup of ketchup. Then the cost of any drink whether it be coffee, soda or iced tea was an additional $3.00, ridiculous! Good luck finding any sugar! For a drink refill, I had to track down a server which I could always locate at the bar area. My bill with tip was $200 and needless to say I could have spent this kind of money at a much better and more comfortable restaurant. Our first and last time at Riders Inn."}
{"text":"What an off the beaten path place. To me. In actuality it has been a place for 206 years, which in itself is impressive. When they use words like quaint, I feel like people mean something else sometimes. Quaint is how I would describe this little B&B. The room was cute and comfortable, and our breakfast was great. Elaine (the owner) is an interesting, accomplished, and hospitable lady who tried her best to make us feel welcome, although I don't agree with ANY and I mean ANY of her political opinions, which she decided to disclose over breakfast. However, it lead to an interesting morning. Would probably stay here again if ever in the area. It's a great halfway point from Columbus to Buffalo NY."}
{"text":"I googled romantic restaurants near me and this popped at #13, Why, I'm not sure! It looks very nice and quaint from the outside but inside is anything but romantic.  

The lighting is bright and the decor could use an update.  No music,  no candles,  nothing romantic about it. 

I figures i could forego that if the food was good but that wasn't the case either.  We ordered fried dumplings and an spinach squares as an appetizer and both were the frozen kind that had no flavor.
I offered the potato leak soup instead of a salad and again it tasted like it came straight out of a can.

For the entrees she ordered the prime rib and I got the rib steak. Maybe they forgot to season those as well but both had absolutely no flavor.  The mashed potatoes tasted like the kind you get at a buffet. 

The service was ok but there were only 6 people in the restaurant at 7:30 on a Saturday night. (SWEETEST DAY)

I now understand why on Thursday when I called for a reservation i was told \" We are wide open Saturday night \"

The only high points were the drinks.

I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"We gambled on this B&B early in our bike ride cross country and were pleasantly surprised.  Nice old inn, decent size rooms, great service (allowed us to use a separate room for our bikes), and had great food.  The Potato leek soup was fantastic."}
{"text":"Really good food good pub menu I liked the French dip full of flavor the stuffed mushrooms where a treat and bread pudding was amazing."}
