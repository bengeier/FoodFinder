{"text":"It is the oldest Korean restaurant in Toronto, if not in Canada.  My dad remembers coming here in the early 70's...  Most of the foods are fairly good.  They recently raised the price by ~$3 per dish.  So that'a my beef.  Hahaha.  Service is hit and miss.  When the so is there, he actually does a good job of waiting on tables..."}
{"text":"Korea House is the best ethnic restaurant in Cleveland. Don't be fooled by the exterior, this place is a gem and the kitchen is immaculate. It is true Korean food but there is something for everyone on the menu. I am a picky eater and I loved everything I tried. However, I was lucky enough to sit with someone who knew the cuisine. I would recommend just talking to the workers to see what fits your preferences. Also a great place to have fun if you like sake/soju. Beef lettuce wraps, dumplings, cucumbers and kimbap are my favorites. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, I was disappointed with the quality of the food at Korea House. The service was only okay, and the area is a bit small for my taste. The atmosphere is comfortable and warm. However, for a Korean restaurant in the middle of cold and windy Cleveland, Ohio, it was fine. 

What bothered me the most was the price. The portions are quite small and I expected more for what I was paying. But I guess it can't be helped. There is too little competition between the Korean restaurants to warrant a price decrease. Service, food, and price were just okay, so I'll give the place three stars.

For a Korean restaurant in Cleveland, this is probably as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Food is very good but service is pretty slow. The server was not organized. We were asked to change table twice."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean place. Great food, friendly servers, good price, good portions, etc. Can't ask for more. Unquestionably strange decor but that is half the appeal. Don't let the place sketch you out. Very great place."}
{"text":"the best galbee in the world yes I said in the world not just cleveland!

the barbeque with galbeesal or if you are a fan of pork samgyupemsal is way to go 

they come with verity of banchan(side diahes)and also special green onion salad for barbecue and also dipping sauce made by soybean and sometimes garlic or jalapeno pepper 

what you need to is put many different ingredients on lettuce with meat and wrap it to eat and you will fall in love with korea house 

go there and try galbee and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Like most Korean restaurants, the decor was quite lacking, but for me it's all about the food anyway so it didn't bother me as much.  

The service was extremely slow.  Just one waitress for the entire place.  I'm not sure if that's normal, but for 6-8 full tables, they needed another person to help.

I ordered bi bim bap which is my standard first order at any Korean restaurant.  It was good.  Not great.  The 8 or so banchan were also fine. 

Sadly, I don't know if I would return.  There's just nothing exciting to bring me back.  If I happen to return, I may try the soon dubu (that's my standard 2nd order).   :)"}
{"text":"It was a Friday night I went Korea House with my fiance she is crazy about ddubbokki which is Korean spicy rice cake with fish cake I ordered them all the time with mandu and seafood pancake which is a lot already for two but I can't resist to order one more dish  among galbee spicy squid and dolsot Bibimbab I believe these are classic Korean food that everybody can enjoy casually 

Seafood pancake is so yummy with all over crispy surrounded there are lots of seafood and veges I eat them with spicy ddubbokki sauce which makes it extra tasty many only me? 

And also mandu is good combination with ddubbokki sauce as well I've heard that is a common way to eat in Korea I invented a way to eat like that though 

Galbee is extremely tender I don't know what they are doing I have never had left over for galbee it's so delicious perfection of balanced garlicky soy sauce and grilled cook it's a must try meat 

I wouldn't go weekend usually they don't even have tables at busy time around 6 to 8pm they have pretty big parking lot and next to door Korean grocery is fun to shop as well"}
{"text":"3 out of 5!  great authentic korean food; order mandu dumplings and the beef stew (so yum!)"}
{"text":"Hidden in a non-descrepant red brick building on the corner of Superior Avenue & East 38th Street is truly one of Cleveland's best hole in the wall restaurants. Korea House is hands down the BEST Korean Restaurant in Cleveland. 

I came here on a Friday night with 2 friends, neither of whom have ever had Korean food and had their doubts if they would enjoy the experience. We were greeted in a timely fashion and seated. The restaurant was crowded as it was 7:30 on a Friday evening, but our experience was pleasant from start to finish. 

We started with a large order of Mandu dumplings for the table. Hot, crispy, and extremely enjoyable. Basically a korean version of friend chinese dumplings. I ordered the Galbi aka Korean Beef Short Ribs with steamed rice. My friends split an order of Galbi Sal aka Korean Beef Short Ribs off the bone and sliced. The beef was extremely tender and precisely cooked. I could have gone for another order if I wasn't a college student on a college budget. 

We met some CWRU Medical School students that said they come every Friday as a group. They were friendly enough and bought our table a round of Soju drink. This drink (I'm told 20% alcohol) is no joke. We took it into a shot glass and dropped it into a pint of Cass Beer for what they called a \"Paktanju\", which is essentially a Sake Bomb. 

Korea House provided me one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking to go outside of the box and seeking a great meal. 

Warning: This is not your typical asian-american restaurant. However, there is something for everyone on this menu. Black, White, Asian, Etc. Don't be scared away! If you need help ordering, the staff is very helpful!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food. We enjoyed everything we tried and the recommendations of the staff were great. They were friendly and knowledgable. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"A delicious Korean restaurant! The food is (from what I understand as a non-Korean) fairly authentic and a delight! The spicy tofu was soft and spicy, while the vegetable dolsot bibimbap (rice with vegetables) came out hot in a stone bowl. As with any good Korean restaurant, complimentary cold appetizer-bites (pickled vegetables, kim chi) and white rice came with the food.

The atmosphere is bare - but saved by posters of super-cute Korean girls (beer ads) on the wall. The place itself seems to be in a run-down warehouse area. The service is OK. Bottom line - come for the food."}
{"text":"Korea House Alert! We went for lunch yesterday; we have been going regularly for years. Usually get kalbi or BBQ chicken or Tofu Jim or big bowl of tofu soup. And two glasses of wine. The check was always around $25 for two. Which includes soup, vegetable side dishes, fried rice, and usually a dumpling or two. There is a newly printed menu, and they have raised the prices on everything almost 30%. Our lunch yesterday was $45! Come on! We could go anywhere downtown for those prices. And the portions are a little smaller, too, not that it bothers me because I like smaller size portions, but they were noticeably smaller (half the amount of soup, less rice, thinner slices of tofu, one dumpling instead of two). So if you're looking for a cheap lunch, I would count out Korea House. The kalbi is $10 at lunch now. The food at Korea House is good, but it's not like home cookin' Korean. Not like Mom makes (and I mean Mrs. Cho and Ms. Son)."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous review. Its a nice place for Korean food.  However, I like to add the side dishes could be better. The service can be a little slow, but the food is pretty good. The interior is better than any other Korean restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The meal was rather meh...our first time in my husband and I ordered the bi bimbap without looking at the menu because we consider it standard fare on a Korean menu... We see others being delivered in a hot stone pot...ours came out, no hot stone pot, :-( that's part of the yumminess is the frying of the egg and sizzling of the rice...we eat it anyway along with the variety of banchan. It was all ok, nothing outstanding...

I ask about at the end of the menu if bi bimbap comes in a hot stone pot, she says \"yes\" indifferently, it's a different number...umm ok, since we didn't even order by number or have the menu open...we will be trying a different Korean restaurant next time..."}
{"text":"Yes the service may be a little gruff. Yeah, the ambiance may leave a little something to be desired, but this place is DELICIOUS.

The kalbi and hot pot are my go to winter favourites. Warming, flavourful, fresh and filling. It's really good value (three-four very hungry people can eat well for $20 each.) And I kind of enjoy the charm of it taking several reminders to get your diet coke."}
{"text":"The decor is suspect, but the food and service definitely make up for any deficiency in ambiance. My girlfriend and I eat here at least once and a month and have never been disappointed. Ssam bab is the our favorite - thin slices of pork in a gochujang based sauce that you use to make lettuce wraps. We have tried about half the menu and have yet to dislike anything."}
{"text":"There are 3 Korean restaurants that I go in Toronto, and this one is one of them in downtown area. They don't put MSG (I am allergic to MSG); they don't recycle side dishes (the owner rather wants me to take it home). 
I love their spicy fish soup and chicken tang-soo-yook! 
I also love their own version of 'rice fermented alcohol', which it is actually way better than the one they sell in a bottle."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here a couple of times and found that it's pretty good but I never felt the urge to recommend the place to friends. 

I had tofu soup and spicy rice cakes first time then seafood pancake and bibimbop the other night. The shrimps in the seafood pancake was cold when it came out and I think it was actually still slightly frozen... 

Everything else was just average. I don't think I will go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food is reasonably priced. LOTS of oil and salt for Korean food.
I had the kimchi/pork stir fry which was super oily but tasty. Though, I couldn't finish it because it was drenched in oil. 
The BiBimBap is average I'd say, nothing speical about it
Ddukboki DO NOT GET IT. It's watery and has no flavour. I'm Korean so I know what I'm talking about.
JaJangMyun is o-kay. A little on the salty side though. 
Other then that, the service was great, and price is great. The menu has typical Korean food great for first timers."}
{"text":"This is my go to Korean place, even though I don't live nearby. I've been going to Korea House for 10+ years. I first discovered it after coming back from traveling in Asia, including many months in Seoul.  I generally have mandu and kimchi jegae, but sometimes I have the stone bowl BibBimBap, which always results in me taking home leftovers to enjoy later. The pricing is very reasonable. The side dishes are varied and plentiful. I don't mind the service - never have found it to be terribly slow as others have commented on. I don't know, I just really like this place, enjoy my food and for the $ it is a very good deal. I've tried other places, but I always go back to Korea House."}
{"text":"I lived in Korea for four years and Korean food is my favourite.  I'm a regular at Korea House as I do find the food here to be tasty, authentic, and very reasonably priced.

I usually get the pork bone soup (gamja tang) and my wife will get the spicy tofu soup (soon dubu chigae).  I leave a drop or to in my bowl.  The side dishes are good and change from day to day.  One Yelper commented that the \"kimchi tasted funny.\" This restaurant serves new kimchi that has not been fermented.  The fish sauce taste is slightly more prominent but this is the style of southern Korean food.  I think it's delicious.

The menu is worth exploring as there are many good dishes here. Service can be hit and miss because they often need just one more server."}
{"text":"They have great bibimbap. ...But that's the only great dish they have.
They also have quasi-Asian style karaoke, with an authentic Korean-language system and input console. 

If I were that desperate for Korean food or Asian-style karaoke in Cleveland, I might go to this family-owned Korean restaurant, but there are alternatives in town for both offerings with comparable prices and better service.


In regards to food, the dol sot (clay bowl) bibimbap is the highlight here. The jigae (soft tofu stews) are tasty, and are probably the only other dishes on the menu that aren't overpriced. The pork noodle soup, on the other hand, has been very underwhelming and unnecessarily expensive, and comes with only a single piece of pork. The small side dishes have nice variety.

Now for the karaoke. It's in a room that you have to reserve in advance. It's recommended to book for 6 or more people, because otherwise they get mad. They also get mad if you don't order dinner with karaoke, which is fair, as the karaoke is discounted with dinner (which cancels out the discount). The song selection is decent; good selection of Korean music, okay but kind of random selection of Japanese music, and limited selection of English music. Not all of the books are up to date with the most recently added tracks. There are also Chinese, Vietnamese, and other more obscure language tracks which you can only access through the Korean-language console, so either bring someone who can read Korean or prepare to memorize symbols on buttons. Of note, the video that goes along with the sound recycles through old Korean tragedy movies and is often hilariously incongruent with the music. As an extreme Asian karaoke buff, this place gets 3/5 for the karaoke.

Overall this would make for a 3-star place if not for generally bad service and the many times we've run into billing drama. The management tends to be incompetent and rather grudging when we try to divide the bill for a group, and will charge gratuity on the tax, which is shady to put it mildly. After several times arguing and leaving with glares all around, it's just not worth it to come here anymore.


As a note, Miega BBQ is several blocks down, has similar prices, a bigger menu selection, better food, better service, and free karaoke. Follow the logic."}
{"text":"This place deserves more compliments. I have tried quite a number of Korean restaurants in Toronto and this is still my no. 1 favourite. I like their seafood pancake and especially the sauce that comes with it. The kimchi fried rice is the best I have had. Even the side dishes are unbeatable. Unlike other Korean restaurants that often play the Kpop music with cute Korean girls singing and showing their long legs, this place plays the 80s Korean karaoke that makes me feel more \"Korean\""}
{"text":"Food was ok. Unfortunately, the female bathroom was broken on the day we went there. Somebody had a bowel moment and the toilet was not flushed. Lots of flies! Yes , they flew around in the restaurant and of course  infected the food. The bathroom is right behind the cashier counter. I felt horrible from what I saw and wished we didn't eat there. We will never go back to this place again though the food was ok."}
{"text":"1 of the better Korean restaurants in Toronto. Came here for dinner with some friends while visiting from NYC. The Service was good and the food was surprisingly tasty.  The kalbi and Meng myun combo really hit the spot. I will definitely go again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Korean place and it was a bit of an interesting experience but the food was fabulous! My friends and I ordered the meal for 4 and a bottle of wine. We were pretty confident that they don't sell many bottles of wine because our waitress was relieved we picked a twist top. 

We weren't quite sure what we were ordering or if we were ordering the right things but I can tell you the food was delicious! The amount of food you get is amazing for the price."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my work group. 

The food was amazing, nice array of flavorful appetizers (kimchi, radish, egg, potato)!

Don't let the bland exterior of the building mislead you - nicely appointed and comfortable inside!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal with good friends (who are friends of the owners).  This couple has been coming to Korea House for years, and now it was our turn to sample what they'd known all this time...this spot is legit!

We let them do most of the ordering, except for the main dishes.  We started out by splitting a couple of bottles of their favorite beer called \"The Premier OB\" and the appetizers began to flow.  We had a delicate egg souffle and an order of kimbob (Korean seaweed roll wrapped with rice, vegetables, beef and egg).  The owner also brought out a vegetable-based dish that looked similar to a quiche (I think it may have been the bindaeduk?), boy was it tasty!

As the main dishes were almost ready, the table began to fill up with an assortment of small vegetable dishes to accompany our meal.  Many of them were pickled and/or spicy, each with a unique flavor and presentation.  I ordered the Kalbee gui beef short ribs, marinated in their \"special sauce\" and grilled to perfection.  The meat with flavorful and slightly sweet from the charred sauce, really unique and great to chew on.

We basically had to roll out of the place from eating so many excellent dishes.  Can't wait for our next time back!"}
{"text":"This Korea House offers a limited variety of Korean food but it is indeed offering a homemade taste for each of its cuisine."}
{"text":"I went during dinner time with 3 friends and we were all pretty underwhelmed. We had to wait about 30 minutes before we could be seated and service was mediocre. They need to hire more employees especially those that can understand English. When we asked them to explain a dish we were confused about, they answered that the food would be raw but when it came it was cooked. They also take forever to bring the food out and they barely came around to my table because they're so busy and understaffed. I ordered the kimchi soup and for $10 I think I've tasted better and the portions were lacking compared to other restaurants.It also says they have wifi but it doesn't work. Verdict is, it's all right but I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is not that fancy, but the circumstance is very special. The food is soooo good! Definitely I will try other food on the menu. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I enjoyed coming here on a whim. The food was delicious and the service was great. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Moved away from Cleveland and miss Korea house more than maybe any other spot.  Great staff and great food.  The bilgogi and Kim bob are staples and the Kalbi spare ribs are amazing.  

Check this place out and you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"The dish doesn't worth the price 
It is too spicy
There are only very cheap hotdog and chinese cabbage noodles in it"}
{"text":"Came here late at night and had not many options and it was also raining. Ordered their seafood pancake and the spicy fried chicken. Both were probably the worst I've had.. seafood pancake was so oily and soggy, having barely any seafood in it. It only had squid, no shrimp, no clams. Not even crabstick!!! The spicy chicken was also soggy, it looked like a stir fry from the heavy amount of the sauce they put. The sauce was SUPER spicy. My friends and I only ate 2-3 pieces and we all couldn't handle it. Btw, we can all eat spicy food. Would never come back."}
{"text":"I have eaten out there with friends and family. The food there are on the Americanized side. They don't serve a lot on their dishes."}
{"text":"Their food isn't anything special from the other Korean restaurants and their staff is inattentive at times.  Don't get me wrong their food is still pretty decent but given their pricing there are better options out there like Miega across the street in Asian Town Center or Seoul Garden in Parma.  This is an average restaurant  with average staff nothing that sets them apart from others."}
{"text":"Dans la jungle des restaurants coréens de Koreatown celui-ci est à éviter. 
La nourriture est certes bonne mais le service beaucoup trop long.
Pour couronner le tout un de mes amis a attendu sa monnaie en vain.... 
Préférez les restos en face ou les gens font la queue vous ne serez pas déçus."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a place to eat and found this place accidentally. Very happy that we found it. Big variety of food choices. Loved the veritable pancakes. Would definitely recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Had the soft tofu soup and it was delicious! Will go here again soon!"}
{"text":"Had we not gone to the Museum of Art and popped into the museum store on the way out, I might never have glanced thru a book on ethnic eats in Cleveland and found this little place. We are always up for Korean, so off we went, heading towards downtown.

It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the staff inside is welcoming and attentive. The Mandu was plump and perfectly fried. Husband raved about the dol sot bibimbap, daughter almost managed to finish her chicken fried rice, and I gave up after devouring half of my Dak qui....completely satisfying meal! More than made up for the train wreck of a dinner at an Asian chain the night before.

We don't make it to Cleveland more than once a year, but we'll be trying all the Korean places we find. This one will stay on the rotation!"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean food places in Toronto. I love going to this place if I'm in the area. The bulgogi is always delicious and pork bone soup is great too!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of happy accidents. 
My wife and I were going to another Yelp event, and happened across this restaurant just across the way. 
When we went in, the place had a very worn appearance, old carpets, and a very \"lived in\" look. I was skeptical...however...
On the walls was...graffiti. Messages left by many, MANY happy customers over the lifetime of this little place. That got me interested, so Patty and I checked out the menu, full of Korean delicacies, and...we were not disappointed. 

Any meal starts out with a tray of pickled an cured veggies, from kimchi to wonderful sesame broccoli, spinach and a variety of amazing tasty treats. There is also what amounts to a tasty egg dish cooked in a mild broth and served in an iron bowl. All refreshing and delightful (just have lots of water on hand for the hotter stuff:)

As for our meals, I had a dish reminiscent of General Tso's chicken in a wonderful sauce with accompanying rice and miso soup. My wife had a tempura plate with HUGE shrimp and veggies. We loved it all. The prices won't break your wallet and they also do a lot of carry out (we had it suggested next time to get the \"#2 meal for two\" which looked very good!) 

There is ample parking on the side lot, and the neighborhood is a bit sparse for other things to do, but as a destination for original and amazing Korean cuisine, there's only ONE house to visit; Korea House!"}
{"text":"Korea House is decent.  Its a hole in the wall place, but if you get past that aspect, you can come out with a pretty pleasurable dining experience.  Service is slow, and food can be a little cheaper, but some of their dishes are tasty.  Their large stews are great for 2+ people and are great for a cold winter day.  Everything else I've tried on the menu is very good, including their dumpling soup and their bi bim bap.  Their Korean pancakes are great and so is their kim bap sushi.

Their dishes can be a little salty at times.  I do get the feeling that they sometimes put a lot of MSG in their dishes."}
{"text":"I know Korean Food.  I can honestly tell you  Galbi (beef ribs) I ate at this restaurant is one of the best.  The light meat sweetness, the garlic, and the texture is better than my Moms.  We made a quick stop from Chicago on the way to Niagara, and I'm really glad we found this place using Yelp.  I also found their parking sign quite comical.  The lady is nice and friendly..... well she could be friendlier but I find her interesting.  She immigrated to USA in 1972-1973 similar to my wife and I.  Must have been difficult living in Cleveland in those early days.  I plan to visit this place again.  I highly recommend Korea House."}
{"text":"Everytime I get a craving for something spicy, I think of Korean food. And given that I've been a little under the weather lately, I could think of nothing better than a hot spicy jigae to clear the sinuses and wake me up! 

I've been to Korea house many times and with varying numbers of people. They have a small room in the back for Karaoke too. It's not as big of a room as Miega has, but few restaurants have that kind of space. 

The number of small dishes that they bring you is definitely more than some of the other Korean restaurants! Whereas other places may give you 5-6 dishes, Korean house TREATS you with like 10! It is AMAZING. Especially the potatoe slices. If you ask for more, they are super accomodating and always bring out extras. The owner is super nice and will give you a free steamed egg appetizer if enough people are in your group. 

As for the actual quality of the food, super yums, but not my favorite. For example, the classic soonduboo here is not quite as flavorful or as full of seafood as I've had before. It has all the right ingredients, but you don't necessarily get the depth of flavor you see at other places. However, the bibiimbap is seriously phenomenal. I really like this place a lot and would definitely be coming back, but for a little more money, I'd probably head to Miega."}
{"text":"Delicious food and the waitress was awesome. Made a great suggestion for dinner for 2 which was enough to feed me hubby and 2 toddlers"}
{"text":"Recently I've been on the hunt for really good Dolset Bibim Bap because my old favorite place for that dish closed. While Korea House isn't my top pick for this dish and I'm still on the hunt, I can say that Korea House is a darn good Korean restaurant that I will definitely go back to again.

When my wife and I first walked into the place, it was mostly empty with one table of older gentlemen chatting the night away. We were a bit skeptical but decided to give it a shot because friends of our had suggested it.

My wife had a big stew that she loved. I had a Dolset Bibim Bap and when I go back, I'll make a point of trying other dishes to see what they are like. That being said, you can't go wrong coming here.

They also had some Banchan that I had not found anywhere else; a couple of which were absolutely SUPER tasty!

I've recently been giving a bunch of 3-star ratings because 4 just seems a bit too much. I feel like a 3.5 option need to be made available to us reviewers! :)"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of friends based on a recommendation.  Of course I checked out what yelp had to say before going and I agree with most of the reviews on this place.  There was a ton of delicious food being delivered to our table and all the other tables we were spying on (to see what they ordered).  We ordered the family meal for 4 which got us a choice of 4 main dishes, soup, and a bunch of appetizers.  This was so much food we all got to take some home.

We had two servers helping us out, one really nice and explained everything we were getting and the other was kind of grumpy and didn't really talk to us.  This was also one of the least fancy/decorated restaurants I have ever been to.  I'm glad the other reviews mentioned this otherwise I might have changed my mind on eating here and would have totally missed out on an awesome meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We have been here twice.  The first time everything was fine.  The second time it was not good.  

The place is under staffed.  They had only one person to wait on everyone.

They foisted the most expensive item on us as a recommended item.  It is the beef short rib.  It was mostly gristle and not good.

We arrived about 5 pm on weekday and there was only one other table occupied.  Soon after the place started filling up and the server could not keep up.

We had to wait about 15 minutes at the end for our check.  When we received  the check the sever just waited there at the table for us to pay.  Also the server cleared our dishes and reset the table while we were still sitting there.  It was not like they needed the table because there were other tables free.

The location is not good.  I would have felt uneasy going to that location after dark.

This was not a good experience."}
{"text":"I've had Korean Food in South Korea and Korean Food here in Cleveland, Ohio and this is still my favorite. I think Korea House is superior to Seoul Garden, Seoul Hot Pot, or Miega. 

It ranks in my top 10 favorite restaurants in Cleveland, hands down. 

1) The Restaurant itself is set in a non-discrepant red brick building on the corner of East 38th and Superior in Asia Town. Ample parking and enter where the blue awning is. 

2) The restaurant is small. There is a private room in the back for Karaoke and large groups. It's kind of awesome. It's not fancy or showy at all. Just like many authentic Asian restaurants with Mom and Son cooking in the back are. You'll see a mix of White, Asian, and sometimes Black in the restaurant at any given time. 

3) They do not have liquor here. But you can indulge in beer, wine, sake, and soju. I suggest going with a bottle of Soju for your table. 

4) Banchan: These are the tiny sides that come with everyones dinner. Kimchi, Cucumbers, Pickles, Spicy Radish, Salad, Fish Cake, Potatoes. All amazing! 

5) Appetizers: The Kimbop Rolls are amazing. This is one of my favorite Korean appetizers and this is the best one I've ever had anywhere in the world. We also shared a Haemul Panjeon Pancake (Seafood Pancake). Perfectly doughy and excellent with some dipping sauce. Finally, we got an order of Mandu (Fried Dumplings). These were okay. I think they changed their recipe or something. 

6) Dinner Entrees: Hands down the best item on the menu is the Kalbi (Korean Short Ribs). They are so tender. You will not be disappointed! We also got a Dakqui (Grilled Chicken Breast). That too was tender and had great smoky and light spicy flavor to it. Btw, we asked our waitress (Shiroko) to cut the Kalbi and the Dakqui for the table so we could share easily. We also got the Japchae Noodles. I had never had Japchae before but these noodles were fantastic. Somewhat of a different texture to them (Almost slimy) but so good with the stir fried beef, onions, peppers, sesame seeds. Our final entrée was an order of Kalbi Sal. My understanding is this is sliced ribeye that comes out raw. You are given a portable grill and cook your meat table side. Pair it down with a lettuce wrap and a spicy garnish and it's one of the best lettuce wraps I've eaten. 10/10 if you ask anyone from our group. 

It's affordable, it's no frills, but it is such a unique dining experience that you'll be sure to remember!"}
{"text":"The lady serving us was very sweet and soft spoken. She gave us great service and was very attentive to our needs. I'm from California and I've had very good Korean food before, and I have to say this place definitely meets up to standard! Loved the seafood pancake and the kalbi! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"other ppl have said it already, selection is good but it takes a while to get your food, service is horendous, i have been here often because of the choice of food and relative good quality but after waiting more than 30 min for the bill last time, i left my money at the table and left - won't be coming back as i barely left any tip"}
{"text":"We went here to try restaurant-made Korean for the first time. We opted for the $35 dinner for 2 and took home leftovers. 

The accompaniments that went with our selection were brought out before the appetizer. We weren't sure what they were all about, I jut sat there and ate the kimchi until my husband asked the waiter. 

The waiter was very polite and attentive. The food was AMAZING. Everything was cooked so well. No heavy grease on the fried items, the lettuce and extras were fresh. 

And miso soup has always been utter crap to me. But this place took it to a whole new level. I think they used smoked tofu. I would actually order it again, and allow me to reiterate that I DON'T LIKE MISO SOUP. Unreal. 

I look forward to sneaking the leftovers out in my lunch tomorrow. I am not too generous with 5-Stars. I am picky. I will return."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you, Korea House will blow your taste buds out of this world! 

I came here on a weekday night with a large group, and we reserved the back room with the karaoke machine. Korea House charges by the hour for reserving this room. The first hour is $20, and the next hours are $5 or $10 each, depending on whether you get alcohol or not. Although this is the only restaurant in Cleveland that charges for using the karaoke machine, it is so worth it! The karaoke machine is very new and the song list is updated! They had Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and American songs! The only downside about the karaoke was the controller. It was all in Korean, so we struggled to make it work. Just ask the waiter for help if you have any questions! 

Okay now, on to the more important stuff: FOOD! We ordered: 
- Seafood pancake: definitely the BEST one I've had in Cleveland! The outside was very crispy, with a soft center. There was also a decent amount of seafood in it.
- Steamed squid: OH MY GOODNESS. This dish is seriously bomb!! It has a sweet sauce that pairs very well with the texture of the squid! This is a MUST-TRY! 
- Dukbokki: this is also a great dish! The rice noodles were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was a little spicy but not at all overwhelming. 
- Tofu bowl with seafood and kimchi:  Always a great dish to get! The tofu was soft and the flavor was amazing. 
- Bibimbap: I didn't really like this dish, unfortunately. It had no flavor. 

The waiters were extremely nice and attentive. Best part is that they spoke English very well! 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be coming back again :)"}
{"text":"I love korean food and this place has a really solid selection. However, with the great selection in general in this neighborhood, its hard to give this place a rave review.  The service here isn't great and the layout is cramped and uncomfortable.  We waited a while to get out order taken, a while to get our food.  We had to ask for water multiple times and when they finally brought a jug there were no accompanying glasses.  These poor service aspects wouldn't prevent me from goof back, but it probably wont be my first choice."}
{"text":"came here for lunch. got the kalbi special. meat was flavorful and tender. fried rice was a bit greasy for my taste. next time i'll be sure to ask for steamed rice. complimentary banchan was awesome. steamed egg! decently priced. will be back! (anyone know where i can get soon dubu in cleveland?)"}
{"text":"I came here twice after my first review. Service is very slow. Servers did not take our order. We waited for 30 minutes and tried to wave a few times. It was only when we were about to stand up to leave was when we got our orders taken. When I asked to change something in the vegetable soup and rice cake, I got weird looks from two different servers. The change was not an issue the first time I came here. Don't expect many vegetables in the soup. Half the bowl is filled with rice cake. Not the best fried dumplings in Koreatown either. Least friendly service out of all restaurants I've been to in koreatown."}
{"text":"Korea House is delicioussss!!! We came with a group of people and were able to order several different things. We tried several appetizers and unfortunately can't remember exact names of everything. The vegetable pancake was so crispy on the outside. We got the rice sausage (very mild flavor but nice). The best was the different banchan. There was a great selection (kimchi, potato, and radish, and sprouts were sooo good but there was a gingery salad which I haven't had before and had the best balance of sweet, savory, and sourness). We cooked bolgoki, beef, and pork belly at the table. I liked that it was gas powered and got super hot so we could get good seat on the meats. Everyone there was super friendly and helpful. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. 
Ambiance - 2 stars - it's pretty drab in there. We sat down at a table and were the only ones in the place!
Service - 4 stars - our server was very helpful and sweet. She was able to answer a lot of our questions, which was great, because we are so far from being Korean food experts, it isn't even funny. 
Food - 4 stars. The food was tasty! Nothing fancy about it, but the meal was generous. We ordered a sweet potato noodle dish and bi bim bap. They came with small plates of accompaniments. Kimchi, pickled veggies, bean sprouts, miso soup. Yum!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the cleanliness and great customer service. 
I didn't quite know what to expect, as this was my first time having Korean food. I was pleasantly surprised at how fantastic the food was!! Everything was delicious! Don't be intimidated, there is something here for everyone. I recommend Korea House to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"The whole family loves this place and we always go there when we are in downtown.
We do have some history with this restaurant. My mother in law worked there 24 years ago for a short period of time and she's still telling stories on how clean the kitchen was.
So what's good here? Everything .
If you afraid to try new things beef kalbi is a safe choice. Nicely marinated charbroiled short ribs. 
Don't expect your meat to melt in your mouth. This meat is chewy.
This was our first time since they renovated the restaurant. We had big party 10 people with 3 kids.
Service was quick to bring water, drinks and took our order. Everything was exceptionally good.
Over the time we had almost everything on the menu but yesterday we enjoyed 2 different soups - Kalbi Tang and Yuk Gae Jang which can be shared if you ask a waiter, mandu gui which are much better than any other Asian dumplings, dukboki - don't be afraid of fish cakes in that meal and it doesn't taste fishy at all, bulgogi. My wife also had japchae which was excellent.
If the menu said its spicy then it is spicy"}
{"text":"Have been coming to this restaurant for years. Was underwhelmed last night. Quality is diminishing. Service slow and inattentive. They may have been the first Korean in Toronto (their claim), but they have lots of competition now. Shall be trying other Korean in the future."}
{"text":"We will be returning again. . . and again. . . and again. 

This place is amazing, despite all the bile leading to an average 3 star rating. My husband and I were told about it at a beer dinner and we finally made it over there this afternoon. 

It's a hole in the wall but I always prefer hole in the wall places. So I would not expect 5 star atmosphere. You can expect 5 star service and 5 star food. 

This being our first time there, my husband and I asked what was good. The server suggested a dinner for two which included 4 fried dumplings, miso soup, 2 entrees and side dishes. For our entrees we ordered the Kalbi Gui Jungsik and the Tangsuyuk which translate to grilled beef and spicy pork with vegetables. We also on recommendation of  some acquaintances ordered a seafood pancake.

The appetizers were delicious. The dumplings were crispy tasty bites filled with delicious beef. The seafood pancake was the size of a small pizza and was equally tasty. The side dishes came out in small plates but there were a lot of side dishes. Potatoes, broccoli, string beans, bean sprouts, kim chi and radish kim chi. There were jalapenos but I abstained. 

The entrees were amazing. The beef. . .ZOMG the beef. Sweet savory and tender it's no wonder it's their biggest seller. The pork was spicy but not overpoweringly so. The veggies were without exception still crunchy and definitely fresh. 

The rice was meh but honesty the rice only served as a sauce delivery mechanism for the pork. 

Best part of all. . . the whole meal was 55 dollars and we ended up taking 3 boxes of food home. So it definitely is worth the expense. 

Like I said we will be returning again and again and again as should you."}
{"text":"Having lived in Korea for two years,  and being a complete bibimbap addict,  this place delivers the real deal. While dining there, I felt that I could very well be back in Seoul with the authentic tastes that permeated the meal. As well, their bancheon  (korean side dishes) were the best I've had in Toronto.

I also like how they exclusively serve Korean, and don't offer any Japanese or Chinese food like many of the places in Korea town. Just the real deal, Korean cuisine.

Definitely check this place out if you're in Korea town."}
{"text":"First time ever eating Korean. The fried tofu appetizer was delicious. Reminded me of sweet and sour chicken. I also got a noodle dish. I believe it was number 13. The noodles were good. Could have done with a different meat though. It was very chewy. My mom got a steak dish that was flavorful. It was chopped steak and melted in your mouth. I wish it would be the meat in the noodle dish. However I've never had Korean before so I'm unsure what these dishes should taste like. 

They also give 7 little dishes of vegetables prepared free as an appetizer. Good and interesting."}
{"text":"Good and authentic korean food. A bit pricy. Their lunch menu is good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious my parents had been coming here forever and my mom showed me this place when I was 14 and since then I've fallen in love with it. the Bim bab bowl is too dye for and all the pickled appetizers they give you are delicious. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I went to Korea House with a friend of mine who is an American last week. My friend and I were there about a year ago, and we wanted to re-visit this place. This restaurant is my favorite place in Cleveland, and if I am in the mood for Korean food, this is where I go.   Service is always pretty fast and nice also. 
We ordered Haemulpajon(seafood pancake), Kalbi(beef rib barbecue), and Dukgook(Korean Rice Cake Soup).
 As usual, they were excellent except that Kalbi this time had a little too much fatty portion.  But the seasoning for Kalbi is just great at this restaurant and is very good even when compared to restaurants in Los Angeles and San Francisco I visited. Haemulpajon had a right proportion of seafood and pancake and cooked nice and crispy.
Dukgook was very delicious and seasoned perfectly.
Every dish at this restaurant usually tastes clean and to the right combination of genuine Korean flavors. I think side dishes can be better, but, for the price of the food, I think they put  a lot of different side dishes compared to some other Korean restaurants that I visited. Overall I was pretty satisfied with the food I got, and since there are so many other dishes of my favorite, I will return soon, and review them as well. I highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for checking out Korean food, or if you are visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"I ordered a takeout for a kimchi fried rice, I specially ask for more rice in the fried rice. They said ok and when I paid for my food, they charged $3.50 more and said $2 is for the extra fried rice and $1 for extra kimchi. Turns out the portion is even smaller than usual, there are no extra anything. Cmon Korea House. Not coming here ever again"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the service, food, and atmosphere of this gem in Chinatown. It barely looks like a restaurant from the outside, but don't judge a book from it's cover. It was warm inside, and very welcoming. The servers were pleasant and helpful with pointing out some dishes we would enjoy. 

There were 5 of us dining that night for dinner around 6pm on a Sunday. It's a fairly small place, and there were a couple of other people dining when we got there. By the time we left it had almost filled up with people. I can see why. It was great. We all had different entrees including Bibimbap, Kimchee Jigae, bulgogi, spicy beef soup, and a peppered steak dish.  Mine was the Kimchee Jigae, a favorite Korean dish I always order at each new Korean restaurant I try. This was definitely one of the best. It was served in a hot pot and it was spicy, which I love. Would definitely recommend that dish if you enjoy Kimchee. 
They also served the korean side dishes that I love. We had 8 different vegetables including potato, broccoli, cucumber, two different radishes, bean sprouts, etc. All were great.  They also asked if we needed any more of the sides and we requested 4 second servings. Another plus to this place was that they didn't charge us extra for the extra sides. 

Parking is plentiful right outside the door on the side of the building. 

I will definitely come back next time I'm in the mood for Korean food."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem!

I truly enjoy their Korean food.. probably the best in Asia town. Most recently, my family came here to share the dinner for 4 special. There are 3 options to choose from- the one we went with includes fried dumplings (8 pieces), sweet and sour pork, spicy octopus, and kalbi (2 plates!). We all left PLENTY full and satisfied. Their side dishes are nice and fresh too! Wonderful service, food quick to come out. 

I don't know why they don't have more customers. 

P.S. I have come with large groups a couple times and rented out the karoake room.... SO much fun!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing addition to CLE!  So happy with the quality of the food and pleasant atmosphere.  Some of the other eateries around the area are not so clean and nice."}
{"text":"As you walk in, you can tell that there was no money spent on design or decorations. So if you are looking for romantic ambience, this is more like a local BBQ dive. Oh, there's a karaoke room in case you are wondering who is singing horrible imitation of K-pop.

Taste is very good for the three dishes we ordered, and I'm sure other dishes may have equally authentic flavors. But portion size is rather skimpy as compared to other Korean joints. Bonchons are also slim with only half a dozen plates. They are kind of cheap on rice and soup that come with the entrees. Rice bowl was half filled and soup was barely filled half way. 

Service was fine but I dont like walking away hungry."}
{"text":"MSG overload. The spicy kimchi pork belly (kimchi jeyuk bokkeum) was so spicy from too much pepper flakes. The black bean noodles (jjajangmyun) was from MICROWAVE INSTANT PACKET!!! OMG IT TASTES EXACTLY THE SAME AS OTTUGI (3minute jjajangmyun sauce). The side dishes tasted horrible too. Never again. The only good dish here was the watermelon slice they give out for free at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"A little gem in the Asia area of Cleveland.  We shared the family meal.  Everything was fantastic.  Food- awesome, Services - great.  Atmosphere - quaint, bathrooms- clean."}
{"text":"Ordered Samgaetang ( Ginseng Chicken ), half chicken, 13 dollars. I went there during lunch time, waited for 40 mins. She brought Samgaetang to me and placed on my right hand side, and then brought side dishes to me and placed in the end of the table then walked away to serve other table. I arranged all dishes myself. They didn't use fresh gingseng to cook the chicken but used very cheap fake gingseng that you can buy in chinatown supermarket. Korea house is my first korean restaurant I visited in Toronot and this will be my last time to visit. It took me 20 mins to finish my lunch but 40 mins to wait for my food. Service is getting worst and waiting time is getting longer and price is getting more expensive now. There are too many restaurants you can visit in korean town. Don't waste your time and money there."}
{"text":"About as authentic as it gets in Cleveland. They always seem to be open too. There's Korean beer posters and autographs written all over the walls and a separate room for events. I've gotten so much at this point, I can't list everything I've had, but the tofu appetizer, the bibimbap are very good. I highly recommend Korea House."}
{"text":"Had my first fling with Korean food at this place and I must say-it was a pleasant fling.  I doubt it will be a one night stand.  We loved the vegetables and things that came out before the meal-they were delicious, and the server was willing to refill things that we ate all of.  I got the Japchae aand really enjoyed it.  It filled me up quickly.  I am (SLOWLY) learning to eat with chopsticks, and while I can't give the restaurant credit for this, I ate my noodly dish with chopsticks while I watched another guy (of Asian descent) eat his meal with a fork.  It was a truly victorious moment, and may or may not have gone into my positive feeling towards my meal here.  Overall, I'd recommend this place.  Great food, large portions, and decent service."}
{"text":"To be honest we only stumbled across this place after being turned away at Miega aka Miga Restaurant which closes their kitchen an hour before close, does not make sense but sure.

Korea house was a very pleasant surprise and glad we were able to dine here. This was a no frills kind of place and felt pretty cozy walking in. It does not look like much from the outside but the food was delicious. I have a sweet spot for Korean but we ordered the Haemul Pajun, 2x Ssam Bab, Bulgogi, and Dukboki as well as ban chan. Between 3 people this was more than enough. Would definitely recommend the Ssam Bab a lettuce wrap with pork belly which with 2 orders for dinner you can cook at your own table. Pajun was good, maybe a bit on the starchy side. Dukboki is a must as well, can't go wrong with saucy rice and fish cakes."}
{"text":"Got the house pork and ja jung myung. Both were ok. Definitely better Korean cuisine nearby being little Korea. 

Thought the pork was not tender enough and slightly rough.

Theres is a large selection of foods. Will go back to try something else and maybe ill upgrade the rating to 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is a find! The restaurant is clean but it's not much to look at. The food however was outstanding. We were there on a weekday around 4 PM so we were the only customers. The service was great with a great description of some of the items. We ordered a seafood pancake, bibim bap, and a pork dish that was suggested to us. Everything tasted like it was made in house down to the sauces. Some of the herbs are grown in the chef's own garden! The bibim bap was the best we've had. The seafood pancake kind of tasted like my mom's onion pakora but with seafood. THe pork dish was very flavorful. Flavors I've never tasted before. We were also served soup with tofu and a steamed omlette that was really good. Our whole meal was $50 with tip."}
{"text":"This food will make everything right again what has been wrong in your life. 
Best kept secret in this town, very popular with, well, Korean people, for good reason. 
The food is delicious, beef is amazing. Some reviewers seem to have objections to the decor, but that is one of things why I feel incredibly comfortable here. Nobody mentioned what exactly bothered them, so I'll explain why I love it: warm light, calm feeling, soft music and NO TV, no people who go for dinner with their cellphone and have loud explanations what they are eating either. Luckily YELP offers a category for that that helps me: \"romantic ambience\", there you go!
Plenty of side dishes, various pickles, and to mention that: for me the portions tend to be too big to eat all at once, but for fairness I have been just once here for lunch and it's a while ago so I can't recall if the portions were any smaller or not or if there was a long wait, nothing of that sort some to mind, evenings are without any issues for what I require.
Staff is polite, friendly and professional (don't take that for granted in this city!) and prices are very reasonable for what you get.
Oh, huge parking place is there too, and yes it is in Cleveland's China town, someone mentioned he or she felt not safe, well dear, if that worries you then never go at night down on Coltman Road in Little Italy, your chances of getting mugged are probably twice as high there, at Korea House all you need to do is go straight from the door right to your car on a well lit parking place, I hope you'll be fine, I think you'll be."}
{"text":"The bulgolgi is so good! Ever so slightly too salty, but really great overall. You get a decent amount of meat I definitely had leftovers! My friend got a soup and liked it but all of the meat was really chewy and had big bones. I have definitely heard about that being an intentional thing in Chinese cultures, that they want a myriad of textures and often prefer things to be chewy (see Ugly Delicious w/ David Chang), and I'm wondering if there is crossover between that and Korean food. It was almost like you made a stock and didn't remove the bones afterwards. She said it was delicious, but I would definitely be forewarned if that isn't what you're used to or expecting. 

I've eaten Korean food since I was 2 and went to a Korean day care, and this food reminded me so much of home. I'm glad I stopped in! The pickled vegetables and kimchi are always favorites as well!"}
{"text":"I went here cause my other go too was closed. 

The service was great, waitress was very helpful. The banchan was really good and plentiful at least 8 different types.

 My friend got the bibimbop. He enjoyed it.
I ordered the stir fried squid.  It was very sweet, I am not sure if they did that cause I'm not Korean, but I never had this dish so sweet. I told the waitress and she took it back and it returned just as sweet. It was not bad but just strange."}
{"text":"My friend told me to try out this place. I've never been to Korea Town, so Why not eat there too. There was alot of people on saturday night! 20mins wait. But... the service was so good! The owner was amazing and so funny! The food was great! The side dishes, our dumplings, etc. Everything had so much flavor! And the Bulgogi.. wow! Oh and if you speak french, make the owner say a few words to you! He was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Korea House tends to be a popular place for my friends and I to frequent, as we often take advantage of the karaoke offered.  The restaurant has a back room for large parties, with a karaoke machine offering an assortment of English, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese songs to sing.  Since karaoke is a popular pastime for us, we end up coming to Korea house fairly often.  The food here unfortunately is not fantastic, with the only reliably good dish being the bi bim bop.  The banchan are fairly good, with various forms of kim chi and other vegetables offered.  The service is reasonable, although the language barrier can sometimes make it quite difficult while splitting a large bill.  Overall, I think the food experience is not especially good, but the karaoke ends up being its main redeeming factor."}
{"text":"It's been here forever and that says a lot.  Great place for the Korean beginner and vets alike.  This is a fun night out with a group too.  If looking for a legit and fun place to go, then come here.  Ditch the trendy Tremont spots for a bit and come to some down home ethnic and cultural treats."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for many years, although inconsistently. I have always enjoyed the food and the service is always good! In the greater Cleveland are,there are few places that one finds where the Korean food is as good as it is in Korea, or L.A. but they sure do a good job. I've never been disappointed with a selection from their menu and always enjoy my time in the restaurant! This is mine and my friends go to place for Korean. A must try indeed. (Reason for 4/5, I've had better, but that does not mean this isn't good food, it's excellent.)"}
{"text":"The Korea House is a wonderfully authentic Korean restaurants with fabulous meals well-priced wonderful service 11 37kimbon roll.  5."}
{"text":"Although far from one of best examples of Korean meals, the food here is fine for what it is - a relatively inexpensive fare where service and ambience leave room for improvement.

++
Food came out relatively quickly

Chapchae: the sauce for this potato noodle dish tastes like mild soy sauce, and it typically comes stir fried with veggies and beef strips, although both were a rare commodity in this case. It's decent, just not great. I enjoyed the multigrain rice, though

Side dishes: not the best assortment I've seen, but it's always good to try different combos 

- -
The staff didn't come around once the entire time, and didn't ask us either when we went up to the register to pay

All in all: we came, we ate, we went home."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I got the BBQ beef ribs and it was better than other places in the area.

The side dishes are also very good and various.

The service is good and I like the decoration of the restaurant.

I would recommend it and will definitively come back."}
{"text":"This is truly one of Cleveland's hidden gems. Although it is a plain jane type atmosphere (white walls with signatures of celebs who have dined there - Shin Soo Choo, Yu Darvish, Grady Sizemore), the food packs a lot of punch.

I have been there 3 times, each time getting the pre-fixe meal for 2. This is a ton of food and has a lot of combinations to choose from. You can substitute other items if need be. All of the food is amazing and comes with 8-10 pickeled items to mix with the meats.

ALSO: Gangnam Style has played each time over the PA while I was eating. Enough said."}
{"text":"This place looks really nice thought I never went before it was remodeled. Their is only one waitress for lunch on a Thursday, so service was slow....even though when we got there their were two people sitting together with their food. Some guy came in 10 mins after us and was served first. I ordered the Tempura dinner that came with the side dishes and the steamed egg. I LOVE steamed egg, but this one tasted like they threw a ramen flavor packet in it soon was very disappointed. The tempura was cooked crispy but it was bland. Even the tempura sauce was tooo salty. My companion ordered the grilled chicken lunch and he let me try it and it was delicious. It comes with fried rice that looks extra shinny."}
{"text":"This is the other well know Korean restaurant in Korea town (the first one being Korean Village) and just like the other one is of mediocre quality but people (out of hood) keep pouring in since they don't know any better. 

We had pork bone soup and bulgogi and the best thing about the dishes was that they were quite large in quantity.  In quality things were quite mediocre ,both in flavor and quality of the ingredients, especially the meat. The beer is $6 which is cheaper than most downtown Toronto. The service was quite good and attentive but for true quality Korean food some of the much smaller and less know restaurants in the area are much better."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Korean food. 

As I looked through the menu I came across a plate called bimbimbop. Apparently a typical dish in the Korean culture. 

I debated on getting the regular plate vs the hot plate. 
Well I wish I had paid the extra $2 to get it in the hot plate because I think it would of been a more authentic feel than a cold steel bowl. 

The side toppings were a really nice addition to adding extra flavor to your food. 

Service was prompt, food was fresh. 

I really enjoyed my experience here. The atmosphere was nice with several locals coming and going. 
The decor was a bit outdated but we are here for the fast service of the food. 

Would I return? Most definitely! And this time I'm ordering the hot plate! 

Oh as for parking, its primarily street parking so if your lucky then you can park out front, otherwise take your chance on a side street."}
{"text":"I can understand kalbi coming in tiny portions but paying 50 $ for 6 ouces or so of very cheap unmarinated cuts is shity. Just skip this place unless you're absolutely stuck in Cleveland and can't make it to other kbbq places."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for months and I have yet to be disappointed, everyone there is always so nice and they always making conversation with me, the samgyeopsal is delicious, but the kimchi Jjigae is what I always seem to crave. Mul naengmyeon is okay, the duk mandu guk is absolutely delicious and the kimchi is always on point. I have yet to try another Korean restaurant, I always find myself coming here."}
{"text":"Bibimbop was excellent. Service was a 7 out of 10.The servers were too busy to check on me without me flagging them down. They were not attentive, but busy. The Korean sides were good and the kimvhi was too spicy for me. I enjoyed the red chilli sauce, but they kept taking it from me to give to other tables. I had to share, lol. But the food was spot on what I expected."}
{"text":"This is such a awesome place!! I took my father and son on our recent trip to Cleveland . It was so authentic and was a great family experience. Sang our waiter made our soju cocktails with a bang. You can taste the quality of the ingredients in every bite . Highly recommend it !!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!!! The hot tea is great! The korean bbq is awesome! And so is the #13 and kilby beef"}
{"text":"My Korean gf's go to place for pork bone soup on the Bloor strip. Specifically, I think it's because they'll turn it into fried rice with the remnants if you ask (in Korean only?? *shrug*)

Here's how it works: You're already stuffed beyond reasonable means on certainly tasty, though perhaps not extraordinary, pork bone soup. Then, when the time comes, the Korean mom will come and get things going. She'll scoop out any leftover soup until a small amount remains, de-bone any bones, and add in some extra fresh veg/kimchi. In goes the rice, and it gets fried up in the same soup pot.

Of course at this point I'm in shock that my gf can still cram this delectable but  superfluous second-round down her throat...

But she doesn't care what I think."}
{"text":"it was my first Korean food in Cleveland and i ordered korean sausage and soft tofu soup with seafood, sausage was plain and bland and soup had maybe 1 oz of seafood mix you buy from frozen section of market. side dish tasted it was made days ago and too much sugar even kimchee was too sweet i can't say i will go again in near future."}
{"text":"Nestled in Cleveland's Asia Town, Korea House is one of those restaurants you might not stumble into if you weren't looking for it.

The parking at Korea House is super easy and there's a free lot directly in front of the restaurant.  You'll be seated right away once inside, and they will bring you Banchan (small dishes of food) almost immediately. The menu is generous in terms of options, providing options for both vegetarians and carnivores, and no one can dispute the authenticity of this local restaurant. 

My review rounds out to 3 stars for two big reasons: portion size and ambiance. The lunch portions are very small for the price, and the restaurant is very plain in creating any type of atmosphere. They also always seemed to be understaffed given how popular they are. If you're journeying here on a lunch hour, be sure to give yourself more than one hour! Yet, if Korean food is your jam, I think you'll appreciate Korea House, regardless of wait time."}
{"text":"I thought it was quite good. It's more like a 3.5 but I will upgrade to a 4. I really enjoyed the Tangsooyook. The JapChae was average-I could have made something similar. I liked all of the side dishes and we got 6, I think. For the price, it was fair. I saw other people with the hot pot to share and that looked really good.

The service was fine, nothing to write home over but it was fast (within 15 minutes, maybe 10?)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was disappointing to both me and my friend last night. On a Friday night I do expect it to be busy but service was just beyond horrible. We waited at least 25~30 minutes and got our ddubboki appetizer (7.95$). I was expecting decent ban chan but everything was extremely bland or lacking flavours. Even the kimchi tasted odd. 

My friend and I each ordered a typical Korean dish, she got the pork bone soup (8.95$) and I got the soon tofu with seafood (8.95$). We both agreed it was spicy, hot in temperature but besides that there was no flavours again it was bland and extremely disappointing. The pork bone soup had mostly bones and very little meat. The soon tofu had minced tofu and minimal seafood. I do not understand how this place can have such awful food. The menu also was limited to mostly spicy food items. 

Overall, if you're looking for a Korean restaurant don't bother coming here. The service was bad also because there was 1~2 ladies running around. It was also hard to get their attention when we wanted the bill. Sorry Korea house, you are on my list of never again will I eat here. Such a waste of money seriously. We left here equally hungry."}
{"text":"Yum! I always like visiting Korean restaurants around Bloor area but this place I have stumbled upon may became my new favorite place! I have ordered LA Kalbi combo with soft tofu soup and all the side dishes, all was fabulously delicious and what a great deal! I'll be back soon to try the grilled fish combo soon! :)"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous. Loved the appetizer flour pancakes w/ seafood.  Would recommend the fried squid entree. The flavors were beyond amazing."}
{"text":"I can't believe that nobody has mentioned the KARAOKE here!  THIS PLACE HAS KARAOKE!  ASIAN-STYLE KARAOKE!

This is the only place in all of Cleveland that I am aware of with Asian-style karaoke. By Asian-style karaoke, I mean singing among a group of friends surrounding a single TV - not performing in front of a bar full of strangers.  You enter the code for whatever song you want to sing on a remote control, and a karaoke video will come up on the TV and you and your friends can sing to your heart's content.  Basically, this restaurant has a back room that can be rented out for a night for such karaoke parties.  The room has one large table and a fairly sizable TV.  There are two microphones.  They have song selections in English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean, and they update their music selection on a regular basis.  The one issue I have with their karaoke is that they close at 11, so at around 10 or 10:30 pm they start trying to shoo you out.

Karaoke is cheaper if you order food from them.  The food leaves a lot to be desired, unfortunately.  They also skimp on the portions for some of their dishes, like their bi bim bop.  The service is not very good either.  I would give this restaurant a 2 for their food, 2 for their service, but a 5 for their karaoke."}
{"text":"I keep coming here when I crave korean food. It's homestead taste and lots of options on the menu keeps bringing me back. Yum!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant in Cleveland! The food tastes good, the prices are actually slightly cheaper than average, portion sizes are big, and the service is personable and friendly. The place itself is very clean and quiet. 

I particularly like that they don't skimp on the ban chan, which unfortunately a lot of Korean places in Cleveland do by just giving you kimchi and a few vegetables. It rotates, but the times that I have come, there's always a good variety and at least one notable item such as the jap chae, steamed egg, perilla leaves, or fish cakes. The place is family owned and the food can take a while to be prepared, but I don't mind waiting while eating the ban chan.

I usually order the gal bi tang, duk mandu guk, or yuk gae jang, and have come multiple times and never had a bad meal. It's not expensive at all given how much food they actually give you, and sometimes the guilt of asking for the third serving of ban chan makes me give them an extra large tip."}
{"text":"As a Korean American who loves to eat, I can say without hesitation that when the dishes shine, they are excellent. The kalbi (beef rib barbeque) is always tasty. The naeng myun goes well with same kalbi. The stews are okay to excellent. The ban chan is acceptable -very hard to keep large, fresh variety when traffic variable  and on busier nights its better. Only complaint are the NYC prices in a place in need of some upgrading. This is the sort of place I feel comfortable bringing my parents when they are in town."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I haven't had Korean food in Cleveland yet I adored. Thank you Korea House for changing that. I am going back here as soon as possible! This place has reminded me why Korean cuisine is one of my favorites. 

The seafood pancake (appetizer #7) was great. Not some flimsy, limpdick pancake weighed down by the seafood. It had substance! And the kimbop (appetizer #5) was a good balance of filling and rice, with a nice sesame seed flavor. The bugolgi the lunch special (lunch special #2) was hugeeeeeee. My brother, who is a blackhole for food, shared it with my mom. Broth for the soondubu (soup #11) and duk mandu guk (rice cake & noodles #37) was ah-mazing and was perfect comfort food."}
{"text":"This place give me the worst experience in recent ten years. The service is horrible. The waitress is very rude and I feel very disrespected. We wait for 20 minutes to order the food and 20 mins for check out. I ask to refill a small plate of kimchi and she looked at me with contempt. Then the worst thing happened is the lady gave me the check and she wrote the 15% tips for me. This never happened in my life. And I asked her. She told me that's the rule. For 3-5 people, tips is 15% 6-8 people 20% more than 10 people 25%. Since we have three people so she wrote the 15% tips for us. For 15% tips I think it is regular tips, but I feel very offended someone forced you to do so. I used to like this restaurant. And now I won't go anymore and I will encourage all of my friends not going. How can you treat your customers like this?"}
{"text":"I always take people here who have not tried Korean food.  Kind of a soft landing in terms of spiciness, etc.  Personally, I find the food there borderline-bland.  But they have a lot of choices for people who don't care for spice and who have not had Korean food before.  Personally, I need a barrage of flavours - gochu, pa, yangpa, gaenip, etc., (red pepper, scallion, onions, perilla (shiso) leaf, etc)., to wake up my tastebuds.  Not a terrible place, but not a place I would go out of my way to frequent.  Nice lady owns the place - very friendly and courteous to her guests.  They've been around for a long time and one of the original Korean restaurants in Korean-town."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance's to go place when it comes to Korean food. We have a Korean place closer to us but we always are willing to drive to Cleveland for Korea House! We have gone many times and plan on going more. I'd tell you my favorite dish but I try something new every time and enjoy it all!"}
{"text":"I agree with Sung J, there are not that many Korean restaurant in Cleveland. When I was trying to find it I could find only four of them, and it was hard to find address information for that restaurant.
This place serves Korean and Korean style Chinese food.
Food tastes so so too me, but It was best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Really excellent Korean food that is truly home made. After delicious scallion pancakes and dukboki, we had the Kalbi and the pork. The Kalbi Sal was fresh and outstanding. The pork was fine but frozen so could not compare. Stick with the Kalbi Sal. Soups are also all awesome."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the waitress was a sweetheart. It was pricey but it's totally worth it. They had Soju which is very nice because it's nearly impossible to find in Cleveland. Not sure if I will be back to this city soon, but if I am, I will get a nice Korean dinner here."}
{"text":"Love their seafood pancake and side dishes. Great service and a good place to dine in."}
{"text":"To the other reviewers (especially the ones that gave bad reviews):  haters gonna hate, but this place is AWESOME!

First:  I am NOT an expert in Korean food, or Korean barbeque.  Second:  I am NOT a cheap SOB who only uses this place as a karaoke bar.  Third:  I was served a delicious meal by a friendly staff, and the experience was well worth what I paid for it.

My wife and I stopped by this establishment on the recommendation of an acquaintance, and am I oh-so-glad that we did!  We went  for a late lunch, and had a broad assortment of items from an extensive, but well organized menu.  Despite being big fans of several \"ethnic\" restaurants in the area (as well as across Cleveland) we are newbies when it comes to Korean food.

We were greeted by a woman who I assume was the proprietor.  She was friendly and had us seated at a table and had our drink orders taken promptly.  Being n00bs, we took a long time to pore over the menu and drink in our options.  We asked for help, and the jack-of-all-trades proprietor made some great recommendations.

As an appetizer, our acquaintances recommended the \"Korean pancakes,\" and we chose the seafood variety.  These pancakes, oh my god, these pancakes, oh my god!  Our waitress listened intently as I described my love for all things spicy, and recommended one of the family-style \"Dinner for 2\" options that included \"Kalbi Gui Jungsik\" (read: deliciously awesome charcoal broiled short rib steak marinated in a sauce that could only be described as \"angels dancing on your tongue goodness\") and the \"Tangsuyuk\" (read: spicy stir-fry pork (though not spicy enough for a guy who uses Sriracha instead of ketchup on his hot dogs) delicious with crisp and crunchy vegetables concoction).  On top of the entrees, the dinner included miso soup, a set of fried dumplings, and a number of delicious sides including two varieties of kim chee, and garlic string beans.

The food just... kept... coming...  Though pricey, there was so much food that I cannot imagine someone thinking that they were not getting their money's worth.  For less than $60 we both ate (more than) our fill and had three large boxes of leftovers to take home.

Is it good Korean food?  I don't know.  Is it a good karaoke bar?  Who cares?  The food is awesomely delicious, and the staff friendly and fun.  We will be going back to this hidden gem in Cleveland over and over."}
{"text":"The new Korea House restaurant opened on March 24th, after undergoing several months of remodeling.  The new restaurant looks totally transformed and was hard to recognize.  It was clean, modern, new furniture, industrial details, high celings and the food remains great as ever."}
{"text":"Adequate in all respects.  The food is good.  I especially liked the glass noodle dish (sorry the Korean name escapes me).  The fried mackerel was kinda greasy and better to share than to eat by yourself.  All the little dishes of kimchi, pickled stuff and snacky things came out in good time.

There is a GIANT flat screen TV at the back of the restaurant.  Last time I was there it was playing Dancing with the Stars, I presume because Margaret Cho was on representing."}
{"text":"This was my first exposure to Korean food. We had the fried squid as an appetizer, which was very well cooked in a light tempura-style batter. The small plates of seasoned vegetables were also very delicious. For entrees, we both had different styles of Bibimbap. They were served in hot stone bowls, which essentially cook the meat and vegetables while you're eating. Everything was exceptionally flavored.  I'd definitely recommend this for anyone looking to expand their palettes."}
{"text":"If you're following your gps to find this restaurant, you could easily miss it. There's just a small sign above a door on a side of the building. The interior decor is not much more appealing. However, the food is pretty good. My friend and I shared the kalbee and ojingabokkum. Both were delicious. The marinade on the kalbee was really good. The squid was seasoned well. They also went well together and with the numerous sides they provide. This was the third Korean place I've tried since moving to cleveland, and it wasn't a disappointment! I'll definitely come back for some bbq!"}
{"text":"Horrible staff and miscommunication - We made a reservation for karaoke for 2 hours, and they failed to tell us some important information in advance. We arrived shortly after dinner, and were unpleasantly surprised to find out that ordering food and drinks are mandatory, and also $150 minimum to be allowed to karaoke at all. They said they would be losing money otherwise on the room, and refused to let us stay even for half an hour, even though we offered to pay the room fare and order some food (though not $150's worth), despite no one else being able to come in during the time we had reserved. We were too full to order $150's worth, but even if we were starving, it would've been hard for 3 people to order $150's worth.

Please notify your potential guests of such strict limitations, and please consider the money you'll be losing when you turn away misinformed guests."}
{"text":"This place probably is one of the best korean restaurants in Cleveland. I had this ojingeo-bokkeum dish in Chicago and it was the best I have had in my life, so I have been desperately looking for a restaurant that has a similar quality of the same dish. I was disappointed by many restaurants here - they either don't have it  or they cooked it completely wrong, until I met this place. They didn't cook it with rice cake, but it was very well made - the sauce was just about right and the squid was chewy and yummy. Highly recommend it!

This place is also very clean and quiet. It doesn't take like home-made food - it's more like a restaurant style food. It is also a little bit pricey but I wouldn't mind going there again for the quality food I had in the past 3 times!"}
{"text":"I visited this place few times and I like it.
I always order beer combo(4 bottle of beer, budae Jeongol and pajeon) because it's reasonable price and taste is good.
Why I don't give 5 stars is servers work kind of slow to compare other similar place.EX. to bring water, to take order...
But I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I used to go to Seoul garden in Parma for Korean food but the taste there was too salty. I recently discovered this hidden gem in Chinatown and the food we ordered are very authentic and delicious! There is even a karaoke room inside the restaurant. This will be my place for Korean food in the future!"}
{"text":"The kimchi pork I ordered was delicious! It comes with a bunch of plain soft tofu, which is super delicious when you break it up and let it soak up all the death juice (ie, the pork fat pooled at the bottom of the plate). My friend ordered the haejunguk (hangover stew), which looked pretty good, and we shared a kimbap appetizer, which was very pretty.

Service is friendly, and there is plenty of parking. There isn't much atmosphere to speak of, but I hear the karaoke rooms are fun.

I just don't understand why Korea House is so expensive. My lunch (not a huge portion) was $18, before a tip....for lunch. I really hate to sound like a cheapskate, but... my splurging on a $20+ lunch is generally reserved for really amazing places, on special occasions. 

To be fair - there IS a $10 lunch menu, but the selection is rather limited. I wish they would add a daeji bulgogi option to the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Slowest. Service. Ever. 
It takes a long time to be seated.
It takes a long time to place your order. 
It takes a long time for your order to arrive. 
It takes a long time for the place to get you your check. 
It takes a long time for you to get them to take your money. 
and
It takes a long time for you to accept that you wasted your time and money there (... again).

This place needs to hire more people or something (been saying this for years). But maybe they shouldn't bother because as I recall the food is not that great. It is less than meh. The mandoo is meh the banchan is just ok, the jjajangmyun is bad, the portion sizes are generally sad for the price.

If you want Korean food VERY badly and you have all the time in the world (say, you are with the most engaging and patient companion on the planet or have brought along text books,) then okay. maaaybe. 

Otherwise, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This could have been a 4 star but instead I'm going to have to give it 3 star for two main reasons:

1) service. It took them 30 minutes just to bring water and starter dishes - at other restaurants it's almost immediate. It took another 15 minutes for the food to come. And when one of us asked for the bill, they kept forgetting to bring it.

2) food was not warm. One person ordered the seafood stew in those black bowls and usually it comes steaming or boiling. This time it came with a raw egg that is sitting in warm stew hence it was not cooking properly. It has to be returned to be heated. 

All in all, not worth the buzz. And there's plenty of great Korean restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"veg-friendly: Barely.
stroller-friendly: Yes, when it's about 3 pm on a weekday.  The older female server seemed sympathetic/kind as my baby woke up and I had to console her.

~~~
Came here with a family member on Friday around 3 pm.  Not too busy inside.

Food was o.k., but as a vegetarian-sometimes-vegan, I was very limited by what I could order for lunch.  I had what I usually have at Korean establishments: BiBimBap, without the beef.  

It said fried egg, so I agreed to that - but it was fried on one side and runny on the other.

Service was kind.  

Our meal not too long arrived after small Korean nibblies arrived in five small dishes: some nice kimchi, sweet potatoes, weak tasting seaweed, mung beans, and fried tofu.  

Lunch prices were reasonable.  Mostly around $9.  

I can't see myself coming here again, only because I have no desire to eat any of their meaty entrees.  Would I recommend it to my omnivorous friends?  Yes, if you're not especially picky about what you eat.  Options might be kind of tasty, but definitely not healthy."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to do private room karaoke. We drove for 45 minutes to get here after making a reservation. They told us we had to buy $150 worth of food in order to use the karaoke room so we left. Terrible service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"First, I had high expectations based on the reviews that I read. I have had Korean before, and it was great!  But something about this experience, left little to be desired.
Table service and atmosphere were fine, just the entrees were a bit on the sweet side.  The dumplings, felt like rocks in our stomachs for hours afterward.  And my \"beef\", was completely different than my friends. Not a different cut, but definitely a different part of the animal, or a different animal all together!  Not appetizing. 
We both have decided to shelf Korean for awhile.  Maybe we will revisit again."}
{"text":"Wow...I have not been down to Korea Town in so long, I don't remember anything about it anymore.  Sure some of the restaurants have been replaced with others.  Some have reno'd and have new signage, but one thing is for sure, nothing beats K-Town for K-Food.

I didn't go to Korea House that much as a youngster but it was close to where I parked and didn't feel like walking that much.  Popped in and I swear that not much has changed in years.  Like stepping back in time!  Hope that the food quality and recipe hasn't changed either.

It was well past the dinner hours and the clientele at that time of night seems to be University crowd having some food before they head out to the clubs or a house party.  Wow - does bring back distant memories.

Had the Dduk-Man-Du-Gook (dumpling and rice cakes), LA-Kalbi, and a stew.  The food was almost like I remember it.  The Kalbi was sweet and tasty.  The dumplings were well stuffed and the broth was a bit salty.  Maybe as the day comes to an end, they add a little more salt and water as their broth supplies dwindles - not an uncommon practice as the restaurant closes.  Nonetheless, still better than a lot of pretenders up in the 905.

Service is ok - if you are looking for prompt professional service, then go elsewhere.  The young gals do a good job overall.  Trust me, they rather be k-popping somewhere else but they still manage to be courteous and polite to us old folks.

Parking is road or Green-P.  Lots of them around.  Use the Green P app so you don't overpay for parking - you can add time by blocks of mins - Nice!

An almost 4 star!

Cheers."}
