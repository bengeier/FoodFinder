{"text":"The prepared foods used to be at super kolbasa down the street. Same great stuff at the whole plate. The soups are some of the best I've ever had, especially the pickle, and the tomato. Also their rye bread is excellent; crispy outside, soft and fresh inside. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious if you want a really hearty meal. Love the coleslaw. When will the smoothies be back? The signs can be misleading. Love you!"}
{"text":"I was sad when Super Kielbasa or whatever it was closed but stoke to find out they continued to serve their delicious food inside of The Whole Plate. I love their potato salad. Obsessed. The only thing stopping me from eating it everyday is their awful customer service. Some of the ladies are quite rude and make me feel bad for not knowing the proper names of the foods I'm ordering. They're all not like that though.  I haven't tasted anything there I don't like. Super tasty. Double check your bags before you leave because they've forgotten to put items I've paid for in with my other contents few times too many."}
{"text":"So here's my take on this place.  The staff was friendly, offered to let me taste the hot plate food before I ordered it. They were extremely informative and knew what was in each dish.  I ordered the Mediterranean chicken stew, with the Greek salad and roasted veggies as my sides. I'm not sure what the other reviewer had ordered but the stew was delicious super flavourful and not incredibly salty. The Greek salad was great because there wasn't actually any cheese in it and the veggies were also not super salted and nicely cooked. Keep in mind the food here is a hot table not a gourmet sit down restaurant.  The staff there was talking about that they were trying to cook healthier but now raw foods just less sodium and crap that a lot of hot table places put in their foods.  I personally didn't experience the \"premium salad\" problem the other reviewer had talked about but for 10$ if the salad was 2$ extra no big whoop. You cannot get a meal this size in the TO anymore for 10$.  They have a small seating area with stools and a bar.  Check them out for yourselves to each their own, but I had a great experience there!!! Would have loved more hot side options I think is the only thing I would say."}
{"text":"I like this place, I like what they're doing, but they desperately need to season their food and make the ordering a little more customer friendly.   The whole plate ($10) is a good deal with 1 main and 2 sides but for some reason some of the salads are considered premium salads so there's an extra charge for those. I've had it a few times and I can't seem to figure out any rhyme or reason to which salads are premium. Seems kind of arbitrary but all the salads have been really good.   I've had the chicken salad sandwich a couple times and it's been great each time! The hot items could really use some seasoning, especially the potatoes (mashed and roasted) and the soup. Smoothies are nice too."}
{"text":"Friendly polish shop with a selection of groceries and hot food. Their cooked food selection is wide and impressive. We sampled three different dishes and they were all very tasty. Initially we ordered them (assuming that it was a take out order) but when the employee saw me reaching for cutlery and napkins, she offered to heat everything up.   Really friendly staff, great food and I'll certainly be back to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Mushroom soup. To die for. Amidst all the fancy on Roncesvalles these days sits this soulful gem of affordable prepared foods to take home. No pretense. Refreshing."}
{"text":"Exactly where Super Kielbassa left off. Same food (decent basic oily Polish dishes) same snarky communist service (every word out of the non Polish customer's mouth  is an eye roll inducing chore). Seriously why have a hot table and stools if you are going to make your customers completely unwelcome? Good if you love meat and being treated like you smell funny."}
