{"text":"My Sausage Buddy made an appearance for the Sixth Anniversary at Birdsong. It's a one man show with the efficiency of a two man show. I literally placed my order, he went in the back and before I could ask how long it would be - Ding! There was my order.  The Chicken and waffle stick was really creative (chicken on the inside) and left you scratching your head, which came first the chicken or the waffle. NO matter, it was delicious and served with some fresh fruit. My kids dug their dogs and next go round I've got my eye on the Brat covered with Birdsong Jalapeno Ale Mustard!"}
{"text":"My sausage buddy can be your sausage buddy too!  I noticed these folks on the foodtruck list for birdsong brewing 6th anniversary party and was excited to try a new truck based on one of my favorite things, all the sausage.  I made my way to their truck and not only was it snowing but the poor girl taking the orders was standing out in the snow!  This is a small truck that would be perfect for any spot, they could fit in almost anywhere.  Now, to the food.  I got a chicken and waffles sausage which is a chicken sausage with a waffle cooked around it.  Yes, you read that right, a waffle with a chicken sausage in the middle.  It is then drizzled with syrup and garnished with fresh sliced strawberries.  I am a huge fan!  The waffle was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the sausage was perfectly done and tasty!  I also got a cup of their \"killer chili\" and killer it was.  Nice flavor with a little heat and they add cheese and onions free of charge!  The waffle, the chili and a bag of fritos all for only $10!  Go find these folks, they better be ready because the chicken and waffle masterpiece is going to take this city by storm!"}
{"text":"They were at my work today for lunch and it was awesome! I got the brownie waffle which was a brownie encased with a waffle on a stick. Delicious and decadent. Everyone else really loved what they got as well. Fast and very clean. Staff is on point. Sadly no pictures this time as I consumed it too quickly."}
{"text":"Haven't reviewed too many food trucks but this one deserves to be recognized!  Quality ingredients that taste great..   I had The Bird which was a chicken sausage with buffalo sauce. Tasty. Even better was the potatoes salad.   Prices fair considering there are not store bought sausages. Also excellent service!  Will be back."}
