{"text":"Ordered a pizza for pickup last Friday, it was a thin crust with two toppings - mushroom and mushroom - pretty basic but a good pizza and it was ready on the time promised."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza and best service we've ever had in Calgary. Frank, who is always there to take your order, is one if the best people I've ever met. If you're not eating pizza here, you're eating it wrong!"}
{"text":"Great service! Loaded with toppings. All around a very good pizza. Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with quality fresh ingredients. The customer service is always above and beyond. They are very friendly!"}
{"text":"I almost forgot about this last-minute dandy on my most recent work trip out there in early Dec.

But after leaving Bally's just less than a kilometre away, on my way back to my hotel, I stumbled upon this dandy, impressed by their awning---see owners, it does matter, is what I keep on telling them.

Seriously, this has got to be one of the best combinations of North American pizza and neopolitan: you get the awesome Italian crust, yet also the generous, heavy toppings.  And so happy that I came here on my very last night here, otherwise, I'd be here every other nite!  They don't open lunch, thank goodness.

Like most things in life, I go for their signature name:  pepperoni, ham, italian sausage, mushrooms, green pepper, red onions & black olives.  But I warn you, you better open up your wallet, even the smallest pizza 10\" will cost you a very pretty penny: $19!

They also offer salads, ribs and wings...

While not open long, think he said about 2 years or so, the owner has lots of experience.

Definitely more of a takeout than dine-in, no tables.

Located in a residential area but on the main road."}
{"text":"This would get 4.5 if I could . 5s are rarely handed out. This pizza was the godfather of Marda Za. Amazing toppings, chewy and yummy crust top it all off with a sassy tomato sauce and you have yourself one hell of a pizza pie. Frank is the owner and I just might pay him to come cook for us at home"}
{"text":"Great pizza wings and service! If you live in Marda Loop definitely try this before the usual major chains"}
{"text":"This place is a little different in that you get two pizzas with one order. It is a little pricey to reflect that, with one order it cost $34 plus $6 delivery (even though we only live 6 blocks away). Will do puck up in the future to save on cash. The pizzas themselves were loaded with toppings and very flavorful. The only bummer was the jerk chicken pizza, neither my husband or I liked the jerk seasoning they used. Or maybe jerk chicken doesn't really belong on a pizza? I'll stick to Simply Irie down the street for my Jamaican fix. On the other hand, the Greek pizza was great and I'm looking forward to trying others on the menu!"}
