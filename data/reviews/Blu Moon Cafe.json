{"text":"This business is now called Bibis!  I got a coupon for them from Restaurant.com and decided to check them out. This restaurant is in a quitensential location in downtown Monroe.   Our expectations were meh when my fiance , her sister and i decided to go there. They have a very well rounded menu with a really good combination of Drinks and Food. and not only that if you are a vegatarian, you actually have a lot of options out here.   The cuisine is excusite. I would give it very high ratings. We were sharing all our food and enjoying it. the mashed potatoes is to die for and the steak and mashed potatoes combination is heavenly. They have a pretty good selection of deserts too.  I would highly recommend this place. Cant wait to go back agains  Feedback for the owner;- If you have a website it would be great :)!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great patio where you can bring your dog or your bike.  The menu is creative and fun but also includes some fan favorites.  Stop by for some great casual fare and a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, they were playing retro 90's music when I was there. They seem to focus on relatively healthy, fresh (and delicious) food, but they have enough variety to please everyone, ie organic steaks for those meat eaters. So far I loved everything I have gotten, and its in a great, downtown Monroe location. Eat outside as soon as it cools down on their patio too"}
{"text":"Now called Bibis!!  I had dinner here tonight while in town for business and was so surprised! It was awesome! Amazing beer selection and eclectic well prepared food. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!!"}
{"text":"My family and I are big fans of Blue Moon Cafe.  It's one of the best places to eat in Monroe.  We love the atmosphere and menu.  Check out their daily specials for great, unique entrees.  My favorite is the sesame crusted tuna served with risotto (you can choose your favorite side).  Check out Blue Moon Cafe and you'll be a fan too."}
{"text":"Came to town to visit relatives and was concerned when some of the highest rated restaurants in Monroe were fast food joints. Then I happened accross Bi Bi's.  This is the the quintessential place that Yelp was made for. Small, local, modest, inspired. I truly felt like Bi Bi's is the owner's dream coming to fruition. Friendly service, small but well-crafted drink menu, nice local art, clean. And great food! The menu didn't break the bank and offered everything from some southern classics for more traditional palates to more eclectic offerings for the adventuresome.  The chef (owner?) makes pretty much everything in-house and has taken some well-thought-out creative turns with his offerings. Also a  nice touch, that he came by all the tables personally to check on the patrons.  I'm looking forward to a repeat visit next time I'm down for a visit!"}
{"text":"This no longer The Blue Moon but Bi Bi's. Same location. Eclectic menu I must say, great beer selection and hospitality was great. The other half had \"The Orb\"...enough for three people and vgood (although a traditional Shepherds Pie is with lamb not beef)....I had the Cajun chicken pasta which was excellent. Entrees are $$$ at least.... We were staying over in Monroe and came here by accident (expecting the Blue Moon, started by a previous chef), but will be back some time in the future."}
{"text":"Nice surprise in town! Food was excellent and very high quality.  Ice cold beer and awesome artichoke and crab dip with homemade pita chips. Huge salads with great dressings and great homemade chips. Burger was also fantastic.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here on our trip to NC, it's his moms favorite place and I was excited to try it. It's a small joint but perfect environment. I enjoyed their wine and food. I had a grilled cheese w/ham and one of their tomato soups - amazing!! I can't wait to visit again and come back. It's just lovely :)"}
