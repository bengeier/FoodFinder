{"text":"Treehouse is great fun for kids and adults.  My son has a blast there. It is super busy most of the time and the wear and tear is showing on the game equipment.  It is a bit expensive compared to the other place down the street but the variety at Treehouse is fantastic. The plasma cars are a huge draw for my son but the \"track\" needs a slipperier surface as it seems to be getting a bit sticky. There is an interesting variety of beverages and the usual selection of foods and snacks. The individual pizzas are quite good. I would recommend it to anyone as a fun place to visit."}
{"text":"This place is the best,my kids never want to leave everytime i take them.They have a jumgle gym,toddler zone,toy room ,rock climbing,ball shooting station,arcade and more.They sell food,lots of variety...you must try the fries!!!

{"text":"This is bigger than any other indoor play area I've been to in Calgary. In no particular order, there's  A massive jungle gym with a slide A toddler play zone 3 Party rooms Video games (tokens needed) A shooting gallery  Seating area with tables and booths for ~100 Fair assortment of snacks, food and drinks  Tons of other games and play areas  I came here on what I thought was a normal Sunday and it was so crowded we couldn't get parking.  Once we got in, it was super crowded with screaming kids everywhere. The one thing I didn't like was that there were a lot of adults/parents in the jungle gym with the kids (helicopter parenting at its finest). No visible presence of staff members overseeing the activities.  This definitely is a fun place to be for the intended demographic. When it was all over -after a gruelling 122 minutes- I could safely say that my kids had a fabulous time and I needed a stiff drink."}
{"text":"Our kids love this place, lot's of activities and clean. Disappointed that food is expensive and took well over an hour for our food to arrive."}
{"text":"Well this place sucks. I have called a few times and always get sent to voicemail. Says hours may be affected on holidays but doesn't specify what the hours have changed to. Even phoned to get more information and get sent to voicemail. Left message and still waiting. Lost my support, I won't be booking parties or going there, not worth my time."}
{"text":"This is my favourite indoor playplace to bring my 6 month old and 2.5 year old. A large variety of age appropriate equipment and toys.. Play ground, toy room, arcade, toddler area. The admission price is also reasonable at about $8 per child (no charge for children under 12 months). There's also an admission discount on certain days."}
{"text":"Seriously one fun place. Way better than chuck cheese. You get plenty of tokens for toys without worry.  Games worked great.  Kids always have a good time. You can easily stay for a few hours. Order decent food n drink. Five star in my books. Been there twice on the south east.  Close to the keg and other places for a good eat if you don't want to eat there at tree house."}
{"text":"PROS: Really nice and clean! Lots to do for 0-4 year olds. The staff is super friendly. Many food options from pre-packaged to freshly made (some are a little pricey) but everything tasted fresh and good (we ordered: fruit salad, hot dog, fries, tuna sandwich, and milk). CONS: washrooms are not very baby/toddler friendly (ex. a high chair in the washroom would help this as there's no where to put a baby down when you're using the toilet and strollers are not permitted); more 0-4 year old type of games in the game area would go a long way; and lockers are a one time use for $1 (I'd rather pay $2-$3 for a locker I could open and close multiple times); lastly, a small private nursing area would be a great bonus (maybe in the toy room?)."}
{"text":"It is a fun place to be for Kids, Some of the equipment needs to be maintained or replaced, other than that, I recommend the place to anyone with Kids.  I thought the price is reasonable too"}
{"text":"I went to this place today to let my son play and when we went to check in they told us we couldn't go in as we (the parents) did not have socks on. I am not playing in the gym I am sitting at a table watching and I am not going to walk around without my shoes as that is unsanitary.  Parents should be allowed to keep their shoes on and sit at the tables. I will not be returning and have taken my business to Chuck E Cheese instead."}
{"text":"Took our 18 month old son here today, he had such a fun time! There was a toddler room that he went into first but my kid thinks he's bigger than he is and wanted to go out and play where the bigger kids were. There were lots of different things he could play on... he liked the 20 ft slide the best. The place was pretty big! But there were lots of kids there. Overall, it was pretty clean. The only reason I knock a star off is bcs there were a bunch of teenagers there that weren't that careful w the little kids around (especially in the bouncy house)... and I thought a staff member should have talked to them to tone it down bcs I thought they weren't really being that safe. And I thought it was weird that a bunch of 15 year olds were hanging out there too? But overall, my son loves it and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being a holiday, it was busy. Mainly hung out in the toddler zone. The kid had fun! Besides other parents not watching their own kids and running into mine. Not cool!  Getting ready to leave, husbands coat ended up on the floor. Like comeon people have the tendency to pick up something you dropped.  Thought 12 months and under was free?"}
{"text":"I've been taking my sons here for over a year and I can't say enough about how great the place is. I booked my son's birthday party here about 4 months in advance and got the biggest room available (blue room.) $60 deposit is all you need to make sure your date and time is booked; an extra $150 for an additional hour. Their food menu is so great. I ordered a couple of pizza, a sandwich platter, a fruit platter, several hot dogs, jugs of drinks, a carafe of coffee, and bottles of water. The staff was constantly checking on us making sure everything that we needed was taken care of. When we checked in they helped us out with bringing in our cake and balloons. Because their previous party was done an hour before ours started they even allowed us to use the room 20 minutes earlier than booked once they finished cleaning it. We weren't rushed out once our time was done. They offered to help us carry out gifts. When checking out to pay they confirmed all charges and gave me the benefit of the doubt when I told them only 8 bottles of water were served instead of the 9 written down. They even went by the honor system asking me how many guests ages 1-13 attended. Basically it covered the entrance fee plus the tokens included. There's a tip option on the pin pad, so I left them a 10% tip. It's not a cheap party by any means, but to have all the food available with tonnes of entertainment for the guests is totally worth it. They do all the clean up. All you have to bring is the cake.   This is probably one of the best indoor playgrounds in Calgary. The arcade is great for the older kids. The playground is great for ages 4+. The toddler area is a safe place to play for babies to age 3. The cafeteria is so great and they offer an extensive menu. Best not to come on the weekend because it gets really packed."}
{"text":"Took my one year old to this indoor playground and she had so much fun! They had two ball pits, kitchen sets, plush toys, and tons of room to play around! Big food variety and lots of tables to sit down. The different sections for older kids looked like lots of fun too. I would like to see staff monitoring larger kids coming into the toddler section, but overall we enjoyed ourselves and would come back again!"}
{"text":"This place stinks ! Overpriced and they make u wear socks for hygiene reasons !!!!! Yuck every time myself or my kids used the bathroom their socks were wet from pee on the floor ! Need to clean those washrooms !"}
{"text":"Does get over crowded and not enough seating for the parents to wait for the kids. Place is very dirty and lack of staff to clean it up."}
{"text":"Love this place! I took my 2 year old son to play here. It was a Wednesday so half price exactly like their website said.. I think it was around $4 something with tax, totally reasonable price . It was awesome! Lots of variety of climbing structures and toys for the little ones to play with. We will definitely be coming back here.. often! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's clean and they have great menu options! It's one of my favourite play places!!"}
