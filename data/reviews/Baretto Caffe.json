{"text":"This is such a wonderful little cafe, tucked inside a medical building! The food is good and the coffee is amazing. Service was excellent as both owners came check on us a few times, without being pushy. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We went on a sunny saturday afternoon, very pleasantly surprised.  Pasta, salad, and toast were excellent - felt like chef put great care into food.  The coffee was really great.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  They explained that their establishment is related to a café in Rome - then it all made sense why the food at this quaint little café was delicious.  Will definitely return again.  Strange location, but really worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Delicious Latte!! I'm truly impressed. And it didn't break the bank! 

It's difficult to find because it's tucked in the back of a medical building but its worth the search.  There are only a few tables but it doesn't seem to be busy on weekends. My table is facing a very calming wall-fountain and the sun is beaming across my laptop. Its not exactly a comfy lounge style coffee shop but its very clean and stylish
 
The service is friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was prepared with a lot of care. Capuccino was excellent! Chef explained that his equipments and a lot of his ingredients come straight from Italy. Will definitely be frequenting this interesting little place."}
{"text":"Took the kids and family to lunch there.
We ordered pizza, prosciutto and chicken panini, and pasta Alfredo.   The owners cooked everything to order and they were very willing to customize to your liking.   
The Owners were wonderful and brought food to our tables.  Everything was hot, fresh and tasty. 
The adults ordered lattes as well.    Their latte is one once of the best that I have had.  Smooth, creamy and just perfect!
We will definitely be back!  
To bad they aren't open for weekends as I can imagine myself hanging out there after a bike or a run!"}
{"text":"It's been a while I wanted to try this cafe. Hidden gem, very nice and quiet spot. The cappuccino was delicious and the art on the foam very cute. I also had a croissant, which was crispy and soft, just the way I like it. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Superb cappuccino & latte. Excellent food. Everything are fresh and tasty. Lasagna & Caprese salad - must try. Attentive and friendly service."}
{"text":"First time dining here with my wife on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The owners were extremely friendly and attentive. 

My wife and I decided to order the panini, pepperoni pizza, and the ginseng latte (after seeing the photos on Yelp). All the items were fresh and made with extreme care. The owners came by several times to check if our food was excellent.

The establishment and atmosphere was extremely well lit with modern deco. I asked the owner more about the cafe and was surprised to find out that it had roots in Rome, Italy. The owner is Italian and started the cafe in Rome (there are two locations - Rome and Toronto). Having grown up in an Italian community, I could tell that the food was very authentic.

Overall, my wife and I would definitely come back to support this business. We love supporting local businesses and appreciate when owners make an effort to connect with their customers.

The only caveat is that this establishment is literally a hidden gem. It's actually located near the back of a medical building (I.e Alpha Tech)."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and fresh.  My husband, children and I all loved the meal.  We ordered the pizza, chicken panini, beef and vegetable soup, pasta, and a latte.  We would order all of it again!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly owner. We weren't sure whether to pay when we put our order but the owner assured us that we 'didn't need to pay if we didn't like the food'. 

We ordered a brownie, a latte, and a cappucino - they were great!

Like previous yelp reviews have mentioned, be on the lookout for where to turn into the parking lot...it's RIGHT AFTER the lights!

Tldr; Extremely friendly. Very fair priced. Great food. Amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing coffee. Amazing service. You can always count on Manuel and his staff to give you a great eating experience."}
{"text":"Hidden gem, finally had opportunity to visit and had great experience. Service was excellent, for drinks we had the Italian hot chocolate and the ginseng cappuccino. The pizza was made fresh as well. Definitely worth repeating!"}
{"text":"A hearty warm meal on a rainy day. The hot chocolates were rich,creamy and most importantly,delicious. 

The pastas were customized for us as we wanted vegetarian options. The silky sauce and perfectly done pasta served with salad and bread was perfect in quantity as well. 

Staff were very courteous and warm. It's a bit out of the way but definitely would go back !"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of small gems. This place is the epitome of a gem, it's tucked away and hard to find but worth the effort. 

Creamy cappuccino with hazelnut was heavenly similar with the food. 

I will recommend it to anyone near the area, it's like visiting Italy."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The coffee is created with tasteful style and the service is beyond welcoming. Will definitely visit again the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Extremely welcoming staff. Tried the proscuitto panini, chicken panini, latte and cappuccino. Drinks and food are delicious and reasonably priced. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Finally had a chance to check out this neighbourhood cafe. It's in a medical building but they have a clean quiet environment to grab coffee breakfast lunch. Their latte art is so cute. Came here to work and the service is fantastic. Happy and will return again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the latte was also very good. The service was exceptional. My only issue is the ambiance. I do understand that it's in a medical mall however the area we sat in had no music, and it's minimalistic design made me feel as if I was going in for surgery. 

The food definitely made up for the deafening silence."}
{"text":"Finally found a decent indie cafe in North York. They have a wide selection of coffee and specialty drink with decent price and friendly service. I've tried their cafe al cioccolate bianco and caffe alle nocciole and loved it. I was also very impressed with their latte art.

Nice decor and ambience, good place to enjoy a cup of coffee and chat with friends. Definitely will go back again and recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Visited Baretto for lunch on a weekday. The cafe is located on the main floor of a medical office building. The owners and workers were very friendly and accommodating. 

My girlfriend and I ordered a chicken pizza and lasagna. The food was delicious and the portions were fairly large for the price. We were both very full and packed a couple of slices to go. We finished our meals with a cappuccino and latte. Overall a great first experience."}
{"text":"Best cafe in Don Mills!  Delicious food & drinks, and lovely people.  Don't go in a hurry - relax and enjoy the unique space, food and community.  Building is being  redeveloped - check out washrooms...very cool."}
{"text":"Owner and staff of the restaurant are friendly, and food is good and but too expensive.  Patterned latte and cappuccino are a special treat, free with order over $13.
Environment is nice and quiet as well, a nice place to hangout with friends or do you work quietly."}
{"text":"Cute cafe. Excellent pizza and latte. Great service and amazing latte art. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A little hard to find, and the chairs could be a little more comfortable. But a lovely place otherwise.

Great coffees, although the flavoured lattes are a tad sweet. Very affordable as well, and the owner and staff are wonderful. 

Am usually here earlier in the mornings where it's nice and quiet, but will come by for lunch some day to try their pastas. Been here once on a weekend afternoon and it was busy."}
{"text":"Looked for a quick lunch with salad and bread near Edwards Garden and found this little caffe in a medical building. Really delicious for both coffee and food. The owner and waitress are very friendly. My son loved their toast. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent pasta and pizza. Real italian owner. Cappuchino is also very good. Not a luxury place but still good place for a date."}
{"text":"A hidden gem with amazing food and service! Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and the place was packed. Their rossa pasta is a must-try as well as their prosciutto bruschetta. I also had their cappuccino which was bold and rich in flavour, and perfect for a chilly day. 5/5 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Here's something you don't expect: a sparkling-new Italian caffe, run by a guy fresh from Rome, with beautiful decor (even an indoor/outdoor water feature with koi and turtles) and a relaxing view of trees and sky. Where is this hidden gem? Tucked away at the back of a medical building on Don Mills road. 

I had a cappucino which was delicious and traditional in size and preparation. Then I decided to stay for pizza. Manuele made it to order (half meat half veggie) and I was pleased with the delicious hot Italian, sliced razor-thin and boasting that authentic dry-cured flavour. The vegetable side was also tasty with pungent peppers, mushrooms and pungent black olives (not the canned variety).

If you're frazzled from shopping at the Shops at Don Mills, this would be a welcome and peaceful retreat!"}
{"text":"Went: 6:45 pm Thu July 23 2015
Ordered: cold hazelnut coffee
Cost: likely $4.00 but free
The place is hard to find. Google maps will lead you to the Alpha Laboratories building. The entrance to the café is on the south side of the building, near the middle.
The customer service here is outstanding. The owner took the time to explain about his café, offered to make a custom cold hazelnut coffee for us, gave us samples of the different sweetness levels, and then did not charge us for it.
The person I was with loved the service but thought the drink was not that great. Only after stirring it was it discovered what was wrong with it.
Bottom line: Our drink wasn't outstanding (7.4/10=3.7/5=4/5), but the great customer service will bring me back to give this place another try.
A thought: Hmm, I wonder if the ratings for this place are so high because a lot of the first purchases were free. We like to think it doesn't influence our decision, but it likely does."}
{"text":"We were staying at nearby Weston Prince hotel and my wife found this cafe online.  We missed it the first time we tried looking for it but the second time we persevered and found it in the lobby of some medical building.  You won't see it from Don Mills Rd.

The place is like a small canteen.  There are tables right outside the cafe...still within the medical building so air-conditioned and they also have a counter with a few stools.  

We were on our way home to the U.S. so we got some food to go.  The menu is limited but if everything is as good as what we had I would have come here more than once on our trip.  I ordered the lasagna and my wife got the penne with chicken.  Since we asked for take away, the owner went out of his way to ask us if he should half-cook the dishes so we can microwave it later.  We opted for the fully-cooked dishes and would eat them on our way home.  While we were waiting, the owner offered us some pastries free of charge.  They were a puff pastry with ricotta cheese and orange...and they were delicious!  My son didn't care for it so my wife got to savor it twice.  The owner really took pride in his cooking and you could tell by the quality of his food.

Almost 2 hrs to get to Niagara Falls and that's when we ate...our dishes were still pretty warm and sooo good.  Probably would have been even better if we ate at the cafe.  My wife ordered a latte to go which was delicious as well.  Wish we found this place sooner...would have rather spent my money here than at the Starbucks we went to the other 3 days."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had cream pasta with chicken and tomato pasta with beef. They were great! After that we had cheesecake and cappuccino for desserts which were great as well. Staffs were very friendly. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Food is really great, as usual! This little cafe never fails to disappoint me! Very friendly owner and food is freshly made to your desire. Prices range from $7-12 for food which is a good price for what you get here! Come check this place out! some foods include pizza, pasta, Italian pastries."}
{"text":"great coffee with latte art. although the art that i got wasn't very impressive but the coffee was good enough. limited comfortable sofa seats though. very nice staff who was very willing too explain and talk about their food menu as it's not on any displays. location was not easy to spot on, it's inside a medical building. just go inside the parking lot and you'll see it right there."}
{"text":"Nice place, very friendly staff, the order was delivered fast, warm an yummy. I definitely come back for breakfast next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"everytime I visit this small place I feel like getting back to Italy.
I am sure that they make the best coffee and cappuccino here in Toronto.
if you are looking for some healty real Italian food so you must visit baretto caffè."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find as it hinds behind a building,but the food there is fantastic! The stuffs are super nice we even got a free latte!love this place!  For sure I'll go there again!"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back! The manager was super friendly and helpful in helping me decide what to drink. When asked, he lists all the different latte flavours they have. I got the hazelnut latte and the cheese danish. The cheese danish was the best. When I took out my wallet to pay, he said that I could pay after and that if it wasn't good, it would be free - it was too amazing to not pay. Looking forward to coming back"}
{"text":"This is probably one, if not the best caffe's in the area. The staff always makes you feel welcome and the service is top notch. All the coffee's they have are delicious and the pastries are out of this world. My wife works in the area and goes there for lunch pretty often as they make great food as well."}
{"text":"A caffe lover's dream! Modern caffe with a polished look really elevates the experience along with the classy jazz music. The place isn't crowded but it isn't empty either, there's a nice balance between the two that lets you work yet have a conversation with a friend(s) and not feel awkward about it. 

The service is amazing, and the food arrives at a moderate pace so you can settle down first. The waitresses are always so kind and know how to make you feel at home. Little things like \"hellos\" and \"goodbyes\" really do count and always pulls me back in.

The times I went, I ordered a caramel hot chocolate, the soup of the day (which was Italian tomato soup), caffe latte and apple cheesecake. They were all amazingly good and something you couldn't just make at home.

Overall, one of my favourite places to eat and chill or just enjoy a fantastically brewed coffee with a slice of Italian cake."}
{"text":"We visited the cafe with my dear friend last Friday. We ordered pasta with prosciutto and rose sauce (personally, the sauce was a bit thick, but the flavor was perfect), tuna salad, latté, and a complimentary cappuccino. It was a wonderful meal, with a leisurely atmosphere. The staff are also attentive and kind, taking the effort to chat with their customers and get to know them."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and the service is also fantastic. Everything I have tried so far is delicious. I wish I knew about this place a couple of years ago. They have the best macchiato."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food!  And such pretty designs on the drinks! I got an Italian hit chocolate with fresh coconut in my drink. And a croissant (so fresh and buttery)!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe in a medical building.  Cafeteria style seating area.  This is the type of place you would never be able to find or think of stopping by without the help of Yelp!  

SERVICE - was on point.  The staff was very tentative.  Tables were cleaned right away. 

FOOD:
Ginger Latte = AMAZING!  The best I've ever had!  Loved the extra thought with the design.
Lasagna = Great taste with generous portion.
Alfredo = Was disappointed.  It had a weird aftertaste.  We were later told it was made with blue cheese and that maybe the flavor we are not a fan of.  Next time we may ask for them to put less blue cheese.

Overall, great experience at this cute little cafe.  Will definitely returning for a quick cheap eats."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in North York. The cafe is not located in an easily recognized plaza, but the food is authentic Italian - delicious AND affordable - with EXCELLENT service."}
{"text":"Had a slice of apple caramel cheesecake and a cappuccino, and both were delicious! Because it's in an office building the atmosphere and seating isn't as nice as other coffee shops, however they more than make up for it with delicious Italian pastries and high quality coffee."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and awesome service. The Ginger Latte I bought tasted very nice - but could be more \"gingery\". I also got to taste their apple turnover and it was probably one of better ones I've had. I have to go back to try their lunches as I hear they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice little hidden gem of a cafe! My fiancee had the Croissant with Fried Egg & Prosciutto  with a cappuccino while I had the Lasagna and Mochaccino.

The Croissant was satisfying, definitely get the prosciutto as well as it adds the extra savoriness to the sandwich. The Lasagna was double the portion I expected it to come in, and came with a bit of bread and a small side of salad. The fare is what you'd expect of an office canteen, but at a reasonable price. While the restaurant is tucked away, there was still a flow of traffic on a Saturday afternoon.

There are two seating areas, a sun bathed area at the front and a room at the rear, decorated with a fireplace. There were outlets along the walls at the back too ;-)

The waitress who served us was really friendly and attentive. All in all this is a great place whether for a date or to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I went there 2 weeks ago with my husband and my kid.  We ordered one pizza and 2 cappuccino coffee.  The pizza was very delicious and the coffees was great.  Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"Must Try: Latte with Latte Art (with the option to be flavoured), Fantasia Salad, L'arte Della Pizza 

Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  

Tucked away inside a building, this very much represents a true 'Hidden Gem' in the city. The interior is a stark contrast to the plain outside facade. 

The menu takes the normal cafe offerings, and elevates each dish to a real treasure. I normally find Salads to be relatively the same, generally average and okay, occasionally terrible, however the Fantasia Salad was a breathe of fresh air. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly. 

Of course we have to talk about the Latte Art. Almost as important as the food, the latte's all come with different art designs, you can even ask them for special requests. This comes standard with the drink, so no extra charges will pop up.

The service was beyond friendly, and the seating area was comfortable and clean."}
{"text":"I was visiting downtown and this cosy cafe was on the way back to the hotel.
The soup and panini was delicious and reasonably priced.
Service was warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Very good place and the owners are so nice, food really good. Very nice environment and not expensive. Definitely I'll come back again. We tried the antipasto, veggie pizza, cappuccino and mint lime drink. The restaurant full filled all my expectations."}
{"text":"Friendly polite staffs. Very clean inside.  Sandwich was ok but the latte art are very cute."}
{"text":"Driving by area during lunch time and found this place on yelp. Had a ton of good reviews so we decided to try it out. Place is tucked in an office build so you might miss it. They had great Sevice and food felt home cooked. We order the lasagna and pizza. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a cute Italian cafe located on the ground floor in the back of a medical building. The aroma of authentic Italian pizza fills the air while you wait to place your order. There are a variety of menu options available from a light to heavier lunch. The price to portion ratio is very reasonable. We ordered the Chicken Alfredo pasta with fresh lime/mint juice, and a 12\" Proscuitto Arugula and Parmigiano pizza and their oh so popular Hazelnut Cappuccino (which was free with a minimum purchase of $11.50). The food took a little longer as they were made fresh but it was definitely worth the wait. The cute little bear design on my Cappuccino made my day (it also tasted amazing!). Service was great, staff was friendly and very attentive. Overall, I highly recommend this cute hidden gem and I will definitely be returning again for brunch."}
{"text":"Adorable little cafe! Wonderful service, delicious food, tranquil atmosphere, and good prices. The cafe was slightly difficult to find but my friend and I were very pleased with the cafe. (Follow the parking lot path towards the left side of the building, from there you can easily see the cafe's sign.)  

We ordered a lasagna (since they ran out of pizza after their lunch hour), antipasta - Er Baretto, hot chocolate and chocolatte. The antipasta and hot chocolate were very delicious but the lasagna and chocolatte were disappointing. The antipasta was a delicious and light snack and the hot chocolate was rich, creamy and had a nice cinnamon twist. Sadly the lasagna tasted like store-bought and the chocolatte was simply chocolate milk.  

The service was amazing - all the servers were kind, warm and so welcoming. The price was good for their large portions. The drinks were good too and they even gave us one of the drinks for free. There weren't many people but there was lots of clean and modern seating. (the washrooms are modern and clean too) 

The cafe was an absolute gem, and a very nice surprise."}
{"text":"This place is very deceptive. It's not your typical cafe inside a medical building. It is so much more and you will have to try it to believe it. I came here with two friends on a work day for lunch and my expectations were just blown. I have come back a couple times since! 

The pasta menu is really simple. Three types of sauces, two types of pasta and three meats to choose from. Like the cafe itself, the pasta dish exceeded my expectations. It comes with a small salad and a small baguette roll. Bonus: everything is made fresh. 

The cafe lattes here come with different art designs each time. I like that they don't come super sweet so that I can adjust the sweetness. I usually prefer no sugar at all. They come in generously sized coffee mugs! If you have some time, this place is nice to just sit back and catch up with a friend. I've seen some people bring some work here too. 

I think the best part of this place is that it's very reasonably priced as well. I couldn't believe the price that came along with the meals I ordered. I've always ordered a pasta and latte for just $15 including tax and tip."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food! We ordered lasagna, lime/mint juice, cappuccino and apple turnovers - everything was delicious. We had a hard time looking for the place but once inside it's a good work/study place. They have free WiFi too!"}
{"text":"Usually coffee in Toronto has a rather watered down taste but this one actually has a great flavour that's strong but not bitter. Great value for the prices and the latte art is adorable!! Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"The owners were very welcoming and the coffee straight from Italy! Pastries are good too"}
{"text":"The staff and workers are really friendly and accommodating! First time going to this place and I'd like to say it has a cute ambience to it. It's too bad that the location is hidden inside a medical building so it was pretty difficult to locate the cafe. Overall the food was amazing and the Irish cream cappuccino is one for me to die for. The prices for the lattes and cappuccinos are a great price. I just realized they were closed during the weekends and I went inside on Saturday disappointing myself. I really like this place and I'll be coming here more often before going to work!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best coffee bar's in North York period! Everything from the coffee beans, decor, machines, and accessories are high quality and authentic Italian. What makes the experience even better, is that the staff could not be any nicer. The owner has operated a coffee bar in Roma for a long time, so walking in to L'Arte Del Caffe you get that European coffee experience and service. Ask him for a ginseng cappuccino, or an espresso and you'll never go anywhere else. I used to go to Aroma and Starbucks, but then I discovered this place and what good coffee should taste and feel like. Now, for me, going to Aroma (which is similar in price to this place) is like going to a Tim Hortons. If you like good coffee, I highly recommend L'Arte Del Caffe. Oh, and they've got food too..."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Prices are reasonable. Staff are very friendly. Atmosphere is modern, clean and spacious.

Flavoured drinks are on the Christmassy side but taste was good.
Pizza was excellent
Lasagna was good.
All pastries / bread were very good.

I would come back again, especially if I was looking for some place to kill an afternoon.

Roadside signage is almost non existent but easy to spot once you find the right plaza."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite cafes of all time! It's a little hard to find as it is within a building but that aside, everything else is perfect. The staff are sooOo sweet and the place really gives off that cozy vibe. Like you're visiting your relatives for the holidays, almost!

The drinks are not only adorable, but delicious and at an affordable price. I'm usually not one for coffee or anything of the like, but I would definitely come back for theirs! Really impressed with this cafe."}
{"text":"food was amazing. their desserts are exceptional. and their service is great! thoroughly enjoyed"}
{"text":"This place serves some great Italian coffee with some of the best latte art in the city!

As part of their Yelp check-in offer (free drink with a pizza purchase), I tried their Prosciutto pizza. I really liked the toppings they put on the pizza: lots of Prosciutto and arugula with garlic sauce in top.

I'm not too fond of the dough they use as I prefer thinner and crunchier crust. This one was thick and fluffy."}
{"text":"Amazing cappuccino great service the only thing is they expect tips when you just get coffee"}
{"text":"The loveliest people in the world; the most care about food that has ever been made, all in all an amazing experience. I've been to Baretto Caffe (formerly called L'Arte Del Caffe). It is the people that keep you coming back to the place. Although the food is great and fresh and made to order; nothing beats coming back to amazing company. 

Although I'm not a fan of chai, the chai latte is always a hit in my opinion. One of my go to dishes is their breakfast croissant, open faced croissant with a cracked egg and prosciutto - to die for. Their pasta is made fresh and is delicious; their omelette is a healthier option. Although there's limited seating, people are always kind enough to yield seats, to move over if they're taking up two tables so others can sit.

It's always the places that look the most deceiving and are the most hidden that are the hidden jewels and Baretto Caffe is DEFINITELY one of those. The owner and his staff - excellent; the food - excellent. And it's going to show as everytime I go, they get busier and busier - and well deserved. Stop by, pay them a visit, meet great people and eat fantastic food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here around 10am on a weekday and it was empty which was great. Its fairly hidden in a medical building as well so it took a while to find it. 

Pros 
- Excellent service 
- Food was up to par as well 
- Servers were quick and efficient (I believe ours was Ayane and she was great)! 
- Everything was decently priced 

Cons
- None other than that we were charged for one of the cappuccinos which was supposed to be free given we had the yelp offer."}
{"text":"Highly recommended: cappuccino and daily pasta (served with bread and salad). It is one of the Italian cafes worth visiting in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good food, attentive service and cute lattes! Got the rigatoni with rose sauce, a banana milk shake, cheesecake a free cappuccino since we spent over $15. The only downside is the location, which was a little weird. Overall, the price was right and would recommend to all."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and I was looking to take my wife for some good coffee and breakfast and saw this place on yelp.  I am always looking for different places to go to, hoping to find an undiscovered gem (also one that is child friendly).  Initially, my wife was pissed that I took her to a cafe in a medical building and saw the limited menu.  However, when they brought our food it is hard to find a flaw.  It tasted great and looked like it was at a high end restaurant.  Then she tasted the coffee and Wow!!!    At this point she has been talking about how good the coffee is at this place and tell everyone.  Also, service was super friendly.  In summary, unique location, very child friendly (was great for 6 Month old), fresh tasty food with amazing coffee and friendly service.  A must visit."}
{"text":"This little gem...I am almost too scared to tell you about it in case it becomes overcrowded. The owners also own a spot in Rome, so they know the good stuff. The prosciutto panini, egg and prosciutto croissant, cream of mushroom soup and cappuccinos were divine. Like most other people, I have to thank Yelp for finding this little spot. Next time I come, I will definitely try their pizza and pasta as well. They have a Yelp check-in promo as well as one of you if you spend over $13?, You get a free cappuccino. We got a ginger and a regular- they comp'd the more expensive drink!!!! How can they be so generous?!!? Such a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Amazing place, amazing food, and exceptional customer service. Totally recommend that place."}
{"text":"Came here today in the afternoon around 2pm, the service here was excellent the man working here today was very helpful, confident and knowledgeable of  the coffee menu.  

He was very confident because he even gave us the option to not pay if we didn't like the coffee.We tried the coffee he made and it was really yummy, cute, pretty and creative. Its really good to see that he has a lot of faith in his customers.  

The only reason I am not giving this cafe 5 stars because it was hard to find..and parking is  annoying when its busy. 


This man that works here is supeeeer friendly and nice!!  Will be back ~"}
{"text":"My man, Manuel, always makes my visit there so pleasant. 
They have a Faema espresso machine, and boy do they know how to make a mean latte. 

The food there is also delicious. I've tried their veggie panini and their bacon potato soup; both of which were delectable. 
I always drop by there when I'm in that area in dire need of a coffee. 
I tried the Italian hot chocolate and it was really, rich. I was expecting a mini shot and it came in this yuuuuge glass. 

Bear in mind, Baretto Cafe is located in a REALLY REALLY random place, but if you take a lil stroll around the building, it is there in plain sight. It is worth the trek, I promise."}
{"text":"Great food, very reasonable price, extremely friendly staff and great atmosphere. I couldn't ask for anything more! Latte and cappuccino are so so heavenly! I never felt so great about any restaurants but this place is a must... Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place is like others have described it: an unexpected gem. It's located in a building with a medical and law offices. You'd expect they would have an unimpressive cafeteria. Instead they have this modest, unpretentious cafe with great quality food and drinks. 

I had the prosciutto panini with a mint-lime drink and shared a slice of a ricotta cake. Everything was fresh, tasty and superb! Also, relative to a downtown cafe, prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get. 

I recommend it for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Baretto definitely lives up to its five-star rating!

We came as a group of three and ordered the lasagna, the Fantasia salad, the soup of the day (Cream of mushroom), the Bruschetta toast (Tomato, basil), and two lattes (Vanilla, dark chocolate).

The lasagna and the soup both came piping hot; both dense in flavour and creamy in texture. The garlic toasts that came on the side were amazing as they managed to maintain their crunch. 

The Fantasia salad carried hints of sweetness from the bell peppers, which harmonized perfectly with the savoury tuna. The tomatoes from the Bruschetta toast were not soggy at all. I applaud its lightness and freshness.

Finally, and most importantly, their lattes. Not only did they look beautiful, they tasted beautiful too - very smooth and aromatic!

Aside from the delicious food, the service was great as well, the staff were friendly and accommodating. I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Was not expecting such a great meal inside a commercial building. They have great pasta dishes and amazing lattes and cappucinos. The latte art is amazing!

They are only open during weekdays and I ended up taking a day off just to go to this place. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"So you pick up your kids and want to get them a delicious meal...find this place! They are only open until 6pm but we have made it a regular stop. The prices are reasonable and the service is amazing.  Lots of tables in the side room."}
{"text":"I can't describe any better than I just LOVE this place.  Latte is beautiful and delicous, taste so much better than anything I had in downtown that is more expensive.  Pizza and pasta are no doubt big in volume and fresh, just the right amount of saucing.  With pasta, owner always pair with a small salad. A healthy and delightful meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Unfortunately it is within a medical building but the drinks are always great with a reasonable price. The service is great as well :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful latte art and amazing people. Would highly recommend the coconut cappuccino. 
Real hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the back of a unassuming large brown building, the place is a gem! Albeit hard to find, it's worth the visit. The owner was very kind and made our visit a delight! They definitely lived up to their hype on yelp. The latte art was fantastic. There's free parking in the back."}
{"text":"Ginseng cappuccino was amazing!! When your total amount comes to a minimum of $15 you get a free cappuccino. What a deal for a quality cappuccino.  Owners were also super nice and very welcoming. Would come here again"}
{"text":"Little gem in Don Mills area!
Found this place by accident/ through Yelp reviews when I was looking for a place to have lunch on my way to work ! Staff are lovely and amazing and food is authentic! They have nice gallery style dinning area at the back that o love particularly! Will go back for sure !"}
{"text":"Love this place - it's has the best latte in the area. So far I've tried the latte, coffee, cookies and pizza there. All were very good - except the coffee that I personally found to be watery in taste. Sticking to my latte next time!!! 

Have to thank @grasshoppereats for this great recommendation on her social media, as I would have never know about this cafe otherwise as it is hidden in a office/commercial-like building. The owner is always there, and juggling all the orders, super efficient and always asks how things are.

Looking forward to trying the pasta next time. It will be my 4th visit by then! :)"}
{"text":"This is my second time come to this cafe. It is hidden behind a medical building. So slow down a little bit when passing Bond Ave., or you may miss it  once or twice 

Very friendly staff and service. It's pretty clean and bright, simple and warm atmosphere. A very cute cafe will definitely makes you happy.

I wanna have their ginseng cappuccino but sold out this late afternoon. Instead their coconut cappuccino is great as well. The salad is of a big portion, with a wide variety of greens. I don't like the canned tuna but thinking of the price, it is a good value. 

Pretty nice experience and good place to hang out with friends. I'll come back to try ginseng cappuccino."}
{"text":"The cafe owners were wonderful- so welcoming and kind. I had the cappuccino and omelette and it was delicious ! I'd recommend this hidden gem to anyone who loves brunch/breakfast for a reasonable price! Will come back again."}
{"text":"I'm simply speechless. This place makes me appreciate the simple things in life. Simplicity yet magnificent. I'm not a cappuccino drinker, wait let me rephrase that, of all the cappuccinos I've had, I've never enjoyed it UNTIL NOW. I had the ginseng cappuccino since Yelp offered it as a free complimentary drink and also had the lasagna. The lasagna was hot, tasty and the perfect portion for me. As for the ginseng cappuccino, I sipped and enjoyed my fancy drink til the very last drop. The service here was amazing but it felt more of a genuine appreciation of servicing than anything else. 

Thank you for such a delightful experience."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!

However, the menu did not have an amazing variety (nothing out of the ordinary), but what my fiancé and I had was very good. I got the porcuitto and fried egg toast, and she got a porcuitto toast sandwich. We also got a hazelnut cappuccino and mochaccino - both had cool designs on the top and were delicious. Everything that we had was reasonably priced, and under $20 (including tip). 

Very friendly service, would definitely come again for a quick and tasty brunch!"}
{"text":"This is officially my favourite cafe in Toronto. 

Service was excellent - it wasn't just about running the business. The owner, Manuele, is very nice and hospitable. Ayana (hopefully I spelled it right) is very friendly as well.

Food: pasta was delicious. I got a rigatoni with Rossa sauce (combination of red & white sauce) - the dish was cooked well ( Al dente) and the sauce tastes fresh  and well balanced. We also got desserts (brownie trio and lobster tail) they were both really good!

Drink: I got the dark chocolate latte and it was good as well. I'm not a coffee drinker but it paired well with my desserts.

**I asked about the brownie only to find out that they weren't offering it at the moment. They made an exception and still served it to us.

Love the service here and keep it up. Food is fresh and terrific. Price range is also reasonable and affordable unlike other restaurants."}
{"text":"Fresh food and excellent service. Will be coming back very soon. Don't let the building throw you off this place is a gem"}
{"text":"Wow, this place has been under my nose in my back yard for a while.  It really is a hidden gem in all sense of the meaning.

If only all building canteens were like this... I'd be eating more at canteens more often I guess.  Super fresh food.. awesome service.. Now I'm hoping I need to come to this medical building for some reason."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch based on the great reviews on Yelp. I was surprised to find that it's located inside an office building. It's very nice and very clean. There are also tables in a nice environment available for you to dine-in. 

The staff are friendly. They greeted us right away and asked us if we were dining in. We said we were so she kindly told us to sit wherever and brought us menus. 

We ordered the Fresh Iced Tea and the Fresh Lime and Mint to drink. To eat we ordered a Tuna Bruschetta, a Ham & Cheese Toast, and Alfredo Pasta. 

First came the Tuna Bruschetta and Ham and Cheese Toast. Presentation for both was great. They both tasted really good and very freshly made. 

Next came the drinks. I liked the Iced Tea more than the Lime and Mint. However, my boyfriend liked it.

For our Alfredo pasta we got rigatoni with chicken. Again, for presentation everything was really nice. The pasta came with a slice of fresh bread, whipped butter, and a small spinach and tomato salad. The pasta itself tasted really, really good. It had the right amount of cheese flavour.

After our meal we bought a cheese danish, wafer cookies, and a Nestéa to go. They gave us complimentary lattes/espressos and gave us the cheese danish free of charge. 

All in all I would definitely recommend this cafe. The service was great. The staff are friendly and courteous, the food tastes amazing, and the prices are affordable. I will definitely be returning here for another meal."}
{"text":"Reminiscent of my visits to beautiful Italy,this coffee shop is so very pleasant ! 
I had the cappuccino it was Outstanding in every way! It was creamy smooth strong but not bitter with  excellent taste. 

I also enjoyed the breakfast sandwich with fried egg ,prosciutto lettuce and tomato on a croissant. Oh my ...this changes what breakfast looks like for me!!
It was delicious!

The people are very friendly with the typical Italian hospitality. It seems that they really care and that the value of their customers

I'm going to order a  Caprese   salad to take to work with me today I can't wait to try 
It's in a slightly out-of-the-way location but well worth the extra few steps or manoeuvres in the car that it would take to get here. Try it try it try it!!!


Food is a high priority for me and I would not lead you astray. It is clean fresh and well-made fare!


My takeout capris he salad was absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"I live nearby so I decided to check out this café. It was great to see that it was bustling (I went around coffee break time on a weekday) but service was quick. They had a large range of flavoured cappuccinos, of which I got the hazelnut and a slice of cake. Service is outstanding, one of the ladies asked me if I was enjoying my cake and told me a little more about the Italian sweet! Definitely hope to come back and try the actual food. A shame that it's not open on weekends, but that makes sense because it's located inside a medical building."}
{"text":"Amazing latte & delicious food! We decided to come here for a quick bite after reading all the great Yelp reviews & we were not disappointed.  Great service & friendly staff! The lasagna & breakfast sandwich was tasty & fresh.  Loved the latte as well! Check this place out if you're around the area. It is truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to this place, and it's WELL WORTH IT! 
Superb quality of food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"We ordered a cappuccino, an americano and two omelettes this morning. They are perfect. Service is good and we will be back."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for lattes and delicious Italian fare. Wonderful food, cute latte art, great service, and reasonable prices. Be sure to try Sfogliatella, which is a shell-shaped pastry that is directly imported from Italy. The owner (Manuello) is a kind and generous host who treats you like long lost friends when you walk in. His hospitality is truly beyond words, and can cater to any needs. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Finally, a coffee shop that knows how to make proper espresso-based beverages within reasonable distance from my office! I came in on a Friday afternoon and had an amazing ginseng cappuccino (yes, they do come with latte art) and a pasta. The owner was very friendly and made my experience there that much more enjoyable. Although the place is not visible from the street, it's well worth visiting and coming back to!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! It's a great little place for a quick breakfast or brunch. The service was exceptional! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My favourite go to place for coffee! The pasta and pastries are great too. I'll try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Never thought this place would have existed in a commercial plaza on Don Mills if it wasn't for trust Yelp. There is no sign as you drive on Don Mills Road with their store name. It's literally a hidden gem! Perfect place to grab a coffee, snack, or meal. This is an Italian Cafe specializing in coffee and italian food. They make their pizza when you order. I think next time I will try this as I saw many ppl feening on it! Even though it's in a random plaza with other companies nearby, there's ample parking and plenty of seating. Did I mention the service is amazing. They are so friendly and make sure they check in with you while you are enjoying your food. Overall, a great place and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"People are very welcoming and the place is very aesthetic. Food is great with affordable prices."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor- 4
Service- 5+
Food - 5
Strikeout - 0 

Interior design was very pleasant and welcoming.  Because it is located in a medical building, when you initially walk in it feels like a fast food Cafe, but as soon as you take a seat, you'd feel like home. They have comfortable tables and chair and a nice window view. It's also great for medium groups of up to 6-8. 

Service was very impressive! They not only brought coffee to our table when it was ready, they even brought us water when we didn't ask for it. That's was great!
I can be very indecisive when I order especially when there are many options of one thing, but the person taking my order was very patient. He explained everything and even gave me a recommendation which I took and was very happy with! 

I had the ginseng cappuccino! It was very smooth with a think velvety pillow of microform with no visible grains. I loved the cute and pretty design that came with my coffee. 
They have a large selection of coffee (lac to milk if you prefer it) lunch foods, and desserts! 

We also tried an specialty Italian pastry with custard and with pang orangey citrus flavour in the center! It was delicious ! 

I'm definitely looking forward to coming back again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Cappuccino. Usually, I am not a coffee drinker, the second I saw that bear design I have to try it! It's so smooth and the temperature is just right. 

The mini Italian desserts (Sfogliatella Napoletana) was a good size and very tasty with good friendly service.

Very reasonably priced Cappuccino $2.99 and the Flavoured Caffe Latte $3.75. Such good price with excellent quality! 

Service was very friendly and excellent. I just wish they have more locations, if it was near work, I will be going every day."}
{"text":"Really nice Italian food. We had lunch there on Saturday. Chicken & vegetable Pizza looks like homemade but taste really good. A little bit spicy. It's my first time try Lasagna in a restaurant. Really like it. Yummy toasted bread too. We also ordered latte and coffee."}
{"text":"5 stars for the cappucino and organic fruit smoothie. Bread is high quality and always fresh."}
{"text":"So I started raving about this place here as I typed my review and I thought, why not just do a blog post, so here it is: http://theroadtripgirl.com/2014/02/08/larte-del-caffe-review/

But as a summary, L'arte del caffe was a great experience. Service was excellent and the pizza went above and beyond my expectations for this little cafe. The latte was perfect, milk was perfectly frothed that it was sweet enough not to need any sugar. A hidden gem in North York. Don't have to go all the way downtown for a good latte now!"}
{"text":"Tried out this place on my way home from work, every lovely place! The food is very delicious and supper cheap, you get a free drink when you check in here too! The service was amazing, the owner was so nice, we didnt know that the stored was closed and yet he still advised us to stay and enjoy the coffee for another extra hour after operation time. Such a great service! Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fabulous service. However with 5 star rating , I expected better food. The food is decent but not amazing. Worth the price? yes. Id recommend just a side dish to go along with a cup of coffee/latte"}
{"text":"The food, price, customer service and ambiance was really nice. We have no complaints for a quiet dinner on a Friday evening. The magazines and the decorations of the Cafe sets a relaxing mood. The pasta&lasagna was freshly made. But for my personal preference I would suggest to lighten up on the spices for the pasta. The chai latte nicely decorated too with a heart shape on the foam. 

We look forward to our next visit here again"}
{"text":"My 200th review and I wanted it to be special thus decided to try Baretto a cafe that needs no introduction.

It was a little hard to find this cafe since it's tucked away at the back of a building but let me tell you it was worth the find!!

So as I walked in this cafe I had lots of questions my mind kept asking me.I was thinking to my self I hope this place lives up to its 5 star reputation also thinking what if it's just meh.Well I walk in and I was greeted by this amazingly friendly man who took my order of a cappuccino and a croissant.He asked me to have a seat and he shall bring out my eats.

This cafe has a unique seating arrangement, outside the cafe is an indoor seating area and in the cafe to the right is an enclosed seating area.

I chose to sit outside on the high top table facing the parking lot.Soon Manulea who I later found out is also the owner brought my order also with my order he handed me a chilled glass of water with napkin and all the eats were in proper china.I was already impressed.

So this far I'm thinking the service is great and so is the pricing.I soon tried  my cappuccino which was absolutely delish.Perefectly made and the temperature was right too loved every sip of it.The croissant was warmed up and tastesgreat- very flaky yet moist.I wish I wasn't in a rush or else I would have definitely tried their food.

As I was enjoying my coffee I started to speak to Manulea, I congratulated him on being 5 stars on yelp and that he was running a fantastic show.He was pleased to hear that and actually went in the cafe and got me a clipping where yelp nominated them for 2017 top places to eat.

Lots of parking.I do look forward to going there again to try their lunch."}
{"text":"Cool little coffee shop ticked away in a medical arts building. 
I tried their late but they have a full line of espresso based beverages."}
{"text":"Huzzah. We found it on the first try! After we got into the parking lot, I worried about how we would find it in the building, but it's significantly larger than I thought and it has big windows facing the parking lot. If there were fewer glass walls, the restaurant would be a lot more open concept. However, given the office structure of the building, I can see why they have the corridor there as well. On the left side, there's a room with tables in it. To the right, there's a counter where you can order takeout and also where you pay after you eat in. Deeper in on the right side, they also have more tables and a counter with a few stools. We stood at the counter and the lady at it asked us if we were eating in. When we said we were, she showed us to a table and gave us menus, then returned after to take our order. I must say that service was amazing. It wasn't quite as efficient as Chinese restaurants, but that's understandable. 

Between the three of us, we ordered a slice of pre-made mushroom and chicken pizza ($3.85 including a bit of salad), a prosciutto panini ($5.99), and a pasta with rose sauce ($8.99) with a chicken add on ($1.50). I checked in on Yelp and got a free cappuccino. The Yelp check-in offer is that if you order any pizza, you get the cappuccino. I saw another reviewer said she got the ginseng cappuccino, which is the most expensive cappuccino they have. I was not asked what kind I wanted. Here's an interesting thing to note. Even without the Yelp offer, the menu says that if you order over $11.99, you still get a free cappuccino. I didn't find that out until after I went through the Yelp offer. Oh well. Now I know for next time, and there will definitely be a next time.

Their pre-made pizzas are visible in their bakery display case. They had cheese, pepperoni, veggie, and mushroom and chicken. I didn't realize there was chicken on the pizza. I just knew I wanted the one with mushroom. The chicken was a bonus. The pizza in the display looks like a long strip. It's not a triangular slice. When they serve it, they cut it into four square pieces, each about 2 inches long. They serve a handful of mixed greens alongside this. The pizza was pretty good, but I prefer mine thinner crust. For that price though, it makes a great snack or light lunch.

Grandpa's favorite item was the prosciutto panini. He asked me if the prosciutto was bacon. I can see how he thought that. His cultural experience does not include words like prosciutto. It doesn't really matter. He knew the prosciutto was tasty, so that's good enough. The bread was what did it for me though. The outside was almost crispy, not crunchy, and the inside was light. I believe the panini had prosciutto, lettuce or some other kind of green veggie in it, and tomatoes. After being heated up, the sandwich filling was warmer than I'd have liked. I'm not fond of half-cooked tomatoes or veggies. However, that bread made things more forgivable. Next time, I'd like to make my my own sandwich with that bread. How about prosciutto, bocconcini, arugula, and pesto? Mmmm.

The pasta portion was decent, but for that price, could have also been larger. It did come with a small side of salad with two slices of tomato, and a perfectly toasted slice of Texas toast garlic bread sliced diagonally. Without the chicken add on, the pasta was just pasta and sauce. While the sauce was delicious and tasted buttery, it was still just pasta and sauce. Still, flavor-wise, this was my favorite dish.

Mom, Grandpa, and I finished all of our food, and I could have still eaten more. The plan was perhaps to grab a pastry to go, but I had to finish my cappuccino first. Anyone who reads all my reviews will know that either I have chosen to abstain from writing reviews on most hot coffee-esque drinks, or that I just don't drink them. It's the latter. I very seldom drink coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, etc. This was my first cappuccino with coffee art. Ever. This one was a bear. It was cute. My mom knew I used the check-in offer. She suggested getting Grandpa a cup of coffee with it. I insisted on my cappuccino (because I wanted the art), and we ordered Grandpa a cup of coffee. When the cappuccino came, she was pretty impressed. She hadn't known about the art. Neither had Grandpa. That was nice perk. The cappuccino itself came unsweetened, but they had sugar packs on the side. The cappuccino was quite nice. My favorite part was the foam. I'm a little kid. I like bubbles. LOL. After the cappuccino, I didn't need the pastry anymore. I was very full.

I was pretty torn between giving this place a 4.5 or a 5, not that I can give half stars on Yelp. They almost lost 0.5 stars because the portions could have been a little more impressive. However, they won it back because when we paid, on top of the free cappuccino, they comped Grandpa's coffee. I appreciate little gestures like that. Thank you, kind people!"}
{"text":"Baretto is the quintessential hidden gem. Discovered by a coworker of mine, a fellow foodie. This quaint caffé and eatery is connected to a medical building. So random. But totally holds its own with a small but chiche store from and glassed in seating area. The owner and cook makes almost everything to order, mainly the fresh pastas. Uniquely he does this with a pan on a panini grill! I got an amaretto cappuccino and my friend got the rigatoni in a rose sauce as well as an amaretto latte. I'm a coffee snob but I was so surprised with the quality and flavour of my cappuccino. It was amazingly flavourful and full bodied. 

Recently returning from a trip to Italy I didn't have the highest of hopes for this Italian coffee shop but damn, this coffee gave me the feels. My friend said she loved the latte and pasta - she even returned back there a second time this week for the same order. Also! Since the pasta is made to order you can call in your order a head of time. 

Baretto is top rated in Toronto on Yelp and I can see why. It's quality over quantity. The people were so friendly, the food was apparently great but the selling point for me was that lovely amaretto cappuccino."}
{"text":"We saw all the great reviews and thought we would go try it. We ordered a vegetarian pizza, cappuccino and cafe latte. 

The pizza was freshly made and was really flavorful.

The drinks were also great and the service was exceptional.

All the regulars seem to love this place and for good reason!"}
{"text":"An unexpected yet great find. The quality here is fantastic,some of the best I've had and this is now my favorite coffee stop in North York/East Toronto. The barista, a man from Rome, was knowledgeable and passionate about the coffee he was making."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Came on a Friday afternoon but they weren't busy at all. I got the chicken penne and it tastes amazing. They do seem to have really good pastry as well so I am definitely dropping by next time to try it out.

The restaurant is located inside a medical building so it's not that easy to spot. Just follow google map and you will find it!"}
{"text":"I found this place when skimming through Yelp and thought I'd give it a try with all the amazing reviews. The reviews are no lies, the service was amazing and food on point. I ordered the 12inch pepperoni pizza, there was so much pepperoni! Also the toppings go practically to the edge so there wasn't really a crust which I liked. My boyfriend had the chicken rossa pasta which was also delicious and creamy and the garlic bread was so crunchy and fragrant. Unfortunately we ran out of time so we couldn't try the cappacino at the restaurant and had to take it to go. The owner said it would taste better having it in house, but even so, in the to go cup it was still very delicious! Definitely will be back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Best place to have streaks nearby!!!
Nice ambience as well.... i just moved to the city...was craving... for some delicious food..my search endup here!!! 
Thanks for the delicious food"}
{"text":"Best lighting in the GTA for all you foodtographers! It's a quaint, quick and nice place to grab a bite to eat during your lunch hour or if you'd like to sit and enjoy a nicely crafted latte and croissant! The location is like a medical building I'm assuming so you'll be very surprised when you enter this caffe. Great service and super delicious food too which is always a plus! I had the matcha green tea latte and prosciutto sandwich! Very tasty and filling for both items haha! The prosciutto sandwich is so rich I could only finish half of it. Tomatoes, cucumbers, marble cheese, nicely salted prosciutto packed between two slices of ciabatta bread. The matcha latte is interesting. I've never had it served in a glass before so that was nice to see the foam! I wish I got it how other photos showed in a big latte mug with some art but that's ok, still tasted great!
I would love to try some of the salads and pizzas next time!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in the world! I always want to go back to L'arte del caffe... The quality of the food is excellent while the service is even better for an extremely reasonable price! I feel like I am getting a taste of Italy each time I go. Manuella is an amazing owner who truly cares about pleasing his customers. I wish I lived closer to this area so that I could pay a visit every day. Although it is within another building, I actually prefer that because it is more quiet and peaceful as opposed to other coffee shops. He told me about his brother's L'arte del caffe in Italy (where I'm visiting in a couple months) and I will DEFINITELY pay a visit. My best latte has always been and continues to be from L'arte del caffe... the egg sandwich is out of this world, and the custom pasta never disapoints. Thank you, Manuella for your kindness and amazing food! Love, your favorite customers - Natalie, Vanessa, and Alison."}
{"text":"One of the best italian places to eat. Came here with my wife and she ordered a chicken pizza with pesto and I had fettuccine alfredo. It was fantastic. A rare find."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop in a medical building. Super friendly owner...love the coffee and their latte art!"}
{"text":"Best pasta I've ever had!! They don't try to go too fancy and load your pasta up with ingredients (although you can add extra meat and vegetables if you wanted to for $1-2); it's just really good pasta and their sauce is to die for. I got the rossa sauce and it was so good, so creamy but at the same time have a little acidity to it. Also got the gingseng cappuccino and a regular latte. The gingseng cap is more cinnamony than gingseng but still good. The latte was so adorable, although i can replicate the same taste at home. The service is a bit slow, but they have great attitudes and are so friendly. Will def be back."}
{"text":"I like the taste of the salad, warm service and price is good.
I order their signature Antipasto. It is so fresh. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great food and drink, and even greater customer service!
I had a latte and a prosciutto panini, and both were simply fantastic. Best Lattè I've had in a while. The ingredients in the sandwich were very fresh, and it was perfectly toasted.
This cafe is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that the best eateries can be found in the most unusual places - street tacos from a taco truck, Mexican food from a grocery store, authentic Texas BBQ at a gas station eatery, the best butter chicken at a gas station eatery, authentic Thai food in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant....

You might not believe it but inside the Alpha Corporate Centre Medical Building is a lovely cafe that serves up delicious and artful coffee, freshly squeezed juices, pasta, panini, pizza, antipasto as well as decadent desserts. 

The challenge is first finding the place. The Alpha Corporate Centre Medical Building is located on the corner of Chipping Road and Don Mills Road (look for the brown brick building with mirrored glass). Then you need to park in the parking lot that's on the side with the stop light and the building's sign (look for the blue sign with a cursive, lower case  \"a\"). You'll want to park in one of the spaces in the middle of the lot. When you get out of the car and face the building you will see a large glass wall where you will be able to see into the cafe. Enter through the door on the left of the cafe then walk past the staircase then turn right. You will see the cafe on your right side.

Once you enter the cafe you'll be able to relax because you'll be greeted by friendly staff and or one of the owners. They will patiently guide you through the menu and answer any questions you may have. Anything on the menu can be customized. The syrup flavors periodically change so they will let you know what's available for that day (they have over 10 flavors to choose from). The desserts vary as well from day to day. If you choose to stay and eat, you choose where you want to sit and the staff will come by to take your order. 

You have a choice between a bright airy dining area that has art work and a fireplace or a dining area with cushioned chairs, a counter with stools and a water wall. My friend and I chose the room with the fireplace because no one was there. Most of the customers were in the other dining room. This didn't make a difference to the staff because they gave us as much attention as the the customers in the other dining room. 

We both ordered a cafe latte with a shot of hazelnut (They use Torani and Da Vinci sugar free syrups) and we split an apple caramel cheesecake. The coffee was served in large cups and we just sat there admiring the lovely artwork in our cups (please see photos). The coffee was delicious and smooth. For those who like their coffee strong, they do offer double espresso, Double Espresso Macchiato,Caffè Monte Bianco, and a Caffè Marocchino. The apple caramel cheesecake came with whipped cream and a drizzle of caramel that was made into the shape of a flower. The cheese cake and the whipped cream were perfect and not overly sweet, a perfect accompaniment to our cafe lattes.  

We took our time enjoying our drinks and dessert and never felt rushed by the staff. We found out that our server was one of the owners of the cafe, Manuelle. He does the coffee & dessert artwork, mans the register, prepares the food and then serves the food. He was attentive and very gracious. When I asked for the check he told us to relax and enjoy and just pay on the way out. What made me even happier was that Yelp had a check in offer for a free cappuccino!

What a nice get away from the hustle and bustle of the day! Definitely coming back with more friends and family."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Good breakfast, very fresh and made by order.
Awesome service and attention to details."}
{"text":"their coffee is actually great - reminds me of Italy! i came by during the lunch rush and the owner was super nice, he kept apologizing for keeping me waiting, i didn't mind. he definitely helps manage the grill, the espresso machine, everything - said today was a bit hectic, since he was training 2 new employees. for what you pay, the pasta is good, i mean it's still a cafe so you can't expect a sit down restaurant. regardless, he was so welcoming! made me my latte while i was waiting , got a free latte with the yelp check-in! even though he was very busy with all the orders, you can tell he cares and ensures everything is served right to his customers. i give Baretto 5 stars because of him alone! i really do appreciate when the restaurant shows appreciation for the customers, especially when it's busy. considering this is a little cafe inside a medical centre, i understand why everyone around the area will come by for lunch. i will definitely be returning when i get the chance, even if it's just for a latte. he also recommended i try the ginseng cappuccino next time, straight from Italy."}
{"text":"Quiet at 7:00 on a Thursday. Nice ambience and great, reasonably priced drinks. Would visit again!"}
{"text":"Weirdly located in the back of a medical building but it was definitely worth it. We didn't believe this place could be 5 stars with so many reviews, but it was. Quality home made Italian food and drink!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, plenty of options, and great service. Love it! I'll definitely have my breakfast here for the second time."}
{"text":"Great Italian food and prices! The cafe itself is a small place inside a medical building but don't let that put you off. 

The cafe uses really fresh ingredients. I tried their chicken panini and croissant with egg. Both are great sandwiches. The croissant is sooo flaky, it's amazing! The cafe is really good with their latte/cappuccino art. The cappuccino itself is average but the art makes up for it. 

I would definitely go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great food with amazing prices. The staff were very friendly and polite and the food was delicious. I got the pasta with rosee sauce and got a cappuccino as well.

If you're in the area definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Wow, this well be my new hangout spot on my days off during the week. I absolutely loved everything about this place. The food was delicious, the coffee amazing and the service was excellent. The place was very clean and well lit from the sun shining through the windows. I loved that the owner/manager asked for feedback after our meal. I have nothing but good things to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little cafe. Service was above and beyond. Exceptional cappuccino. I had a home made minestrone soup with a medley of fresh vegetables served with crisp garlic bread. Great place for a nice home made lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best matcha lattes I've had , not too sweet with a hint of coconut milk , lasagna was also good :) came here on a weekday , Many seats available which is good . My boyfriend had a panini and banana milkshake . I suggest everyone to visit if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Very good food. Best omelette I've had, very airy, moist and fluffy :) You can taste the good ingredients. I love to warm service from the owners who truly want the best experience for the customers. thank you for the free latte, will come back again. Definitely would try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Came here for the cute bear latte. Not only was the latte art nice, the coffee was great too! Very strong, aromatic espresso, unlike the 50% foam, hot milky lattes at commercial coffee chains. In fact, it wasn't overly milky and had no foam so it was more like a flat white. Bf got the hazelnut cappucino which was again very strong flavored and sweet. 

Also got the pasta lunch - penne bolognese, prepared to order. Can definitely taste that it's made in-house. The pesto cream was tasty as well. 

Total was about $12-$15 per person.. kind of pricey for a lunch but worth to try, at least the cute coffee."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and equally delicious food. Tried their pasta dishes and ice coffee and they were amazing. Nice quiet place if you want good food and a little different than typical Starbucks. And their latte art!!! OMG it's the cutest thing! Definitely recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Best cappuccino ever !  Good value.  Friendly owner and staff.  Wow the mochacino just excellent! A must try!"}
{"text":"This secret little coffee joint that's inside the side of the medical building. My partner was very skeptical when I asked him to turn into the parking lot of a medical building. We sat down and had a pizza, a sandwich and a croissant. The coffee is great! The pizza was very yummy, although had a lot of grease at the bottom - this could be what made it so delicious. The croissant was good also! The only thing I would change, or wish for, is that they would have one extra person to help. The day I went, it seemed like a two-man operation and it doesn't seem like enough. We waited awhile for our coffee - admittedly worth the wait - but if there was an extra person, I think they could cut the wait time in half for every thing. The service you get there is also very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot. They have the most amazing ginseng latte I have ever tasted! Amazing fresh squeezed orange juice, home made pizza and soups. A little hard to find as its in a medical building but so worth coming to! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"SO impressed with this cafe. Its look is simple and minimalistic, but the little decor accents (i.e. paintings, candles) make the atmosphere quite welcoming.

I started off with a dark chocolate cappuccino, which had adorable latte art and tasted fantastic. They have a ton of other flavour options, and I had a tough time choosing. For lunch, I ordered a chicken panini, all for less than $10. Everything was brought to my table, so you won't have to wait at the counter.

I was here working for around 3 hours on a weekday morning, and it never got very busy. The servers were very attentive, and didn't seem to mind that I stayed for so long. I will definitely be back if ever in need of a quiet cafe.

P.S. wifi password is michele11"}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place out with all the positive reviews! This place really is hidden so make sure you turn into the right brown brick building. There is a billboard you should be able to see with the cafe on it before you turn in. It's also not too crowded which I liked. 

Free latte for checking in with a pizza order. We ended up ordering the 16\" chicken and veggie pizza. The lady who was attending to us kindly told us it would be a 30 min wait but we were ok waiting. I'd say the 16\" pizza would've been good for 4 people. There was only two of us so you can imagine a lot of leftovers. I only wish there wasn't too much of the pepper spice on the chicken and veggie pizza next time. 

The cafe latte was great. You may need to add sugar to it. Whoever did the latte art did such a lovely job with it. Each latte had a different art work which was cute :) I'm definitely willing to go back and perhaps try something else on the menu.

Overall, 4.5 :)"}
{"text":"Really terrific little place. Really odd location. We had the caprese salad and pepperoni pizza. Both were really yummy. Very nice servers. Very clean. Great little place to grab a quick midday bite or to meet someone. I would definitely keep it in mind if I was back in the area."}
{"text":"Like others have mentioned, this small cafe is actually inside a medical building. Seating is quite limited, and service while extremely friendly can get a bit slow when busy.

The menu offers pastas, pizzas and sandwiches, but the pastas really are the highlight. It's made to order and sort of a build-your-own type thing where you can choose the pasta type, the sauce and the accompanying protein. I chose a rose sauce with the chicken.

The pasta comes with a bit of salad and some garlic bread. Taste is great! The pasta itself has good texture and the sauce is generous. Nicely seasoned.

Finally they make these wonderful cappucinos which are nicely decorated."}
{"text":"Came here because  the review on yelp is good(even the bad ones also write good stuff about it,  it just those people didnt put stars) and they claimed they make arts on your coffee. 
 First time visit, friendly staff,  they are warm and welcome.  I order cappucino ginsing n italian hot chocolate(hazelnut).  The taste of both drinks taste better then I expect(i actually wasnt expect a good coffee but the arts itself).  The boss also offer a cappucinno to try for free,  my boyfriend loves it but i would stay for the ginsing.  Its my first time leavin tips in coffee shop since they were so nice and offer extra drink for free. Will definitely come back next time and try their food."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in mid town Toronto. This place is very hard to find, but if you can it is totally worth it.

The manager there is extremely friendly and great cook/barista. Food comes to you at your table, making it feel like a high-end restraint instead of some cafe attached to a office building.

The manager offered me a Italian desert for free, it left me drooling for more, but I couldn't find similar things anywhere else.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great owner operated cafe - far better than what's you'd expect in a medical building.  The guy tries hard but the coffee is only three star. It is not indie coffee shop level - at least the latte I had.  Aldo he offers to add stuff like ginger or ginseng and other stuff - hardly the thing for coffee aficionados. 

The food as good perhaps 3.5 stars but not stellar. Not sure id go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"It was my birthday I just wanted to try some cool brunch place . And I found it one.
I went with my friend as soon as I walked in I immediately invited my sister . Because the food looks so good and atmosphere also awesome.

We ordered  the 4 dishes 
Pasta, salad, croissant sandwich , pizza.
( I know it's a lot but I wanted to try them all)
I can tell it's real food . Fresh, tasty and price is amazing.

Service is extremely nice.
They want to make sure we enjoy the food, keep asking feed back.  We all decide come regularly.

I really appreciated their complimentary cappuccino ( if you order more than 12 dollars) and wishes my birthday .

I highly recommend to everyone who loves good food.

Love it love it !!"}
{"text":"Imagine a fish and turtle pond (even in the middle of winter) water fountain, fireplace, steps from parking, elegant cafe, pleasant service, sinfully delicious artesan deserts and Cappucino that excels in Latte Art.... does a place like this exist in North York?

You have to hunt for this gem locate and you will be treated with a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"When i saw 150 reviews and a 5 star rating, i couldn't believe it. Well now i do lol!
Food tastes excellent, pasta and lasagna tasted amazing. I loved their caprese salad!
Customer service is above and beyond, very friendly and came to check on us twice. You can tell they are passionate about what they do. 
Prices are very reasonable! 
This place is very hidden, and hard to find.
Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Great service at a great price. Baretto Caffe proves you don't have to charge high prices for good food."}
{"text":"I can only say that their coffee is fantastic, hand made with some Italian amore!  Don't forget the artistic touch! This place smells amazing too. 

Easy to miss off of Don Mills in a predominantly medical use building. Take the extra minute to park and walk in and try something other than your usual drive-thru go to. 

Ciao"}
{"text":"Favourite Italian food for a quick fix. Kind service with a cozy atmosphere. The food is very reasonably priced and the quality is unexpectedly high. Definitely a returning customer"}
{"text":"This hidden gem at the back of offices on Don Mills north of Lawrence is worth the detour. Simple, fresh Italian food served by pleasant, accommodating staff. The portions are generous and reasonably priced. 
Don't forget to order a caffe macchiato, made with their specially imported coffee!"}
{"text":"This place was very difficult to find!  My friend drove past this place (despite gps telling her we're right in front of the cafe) because it looked so sketchy.  It sure is a hidden gem. 

My friend and I ordered the ginseng latte, coconjt latte and tiramisu.  The barista and server here are super nice.  They delivered the drinks and dessert to our table with a glass of water (we didn't request for water, but I def needed it).  The lattes we got were super cute, it came with designs.  We didn't want to drink our lattes because we didn't want to ruin the design.  The tiramisu was also very good-very moist. 

Exceptional customer service, quality food and reasonable pricing!  Will def be back when I'm near the area!"}
{"text":"2nd visit just as great as the first. This time also tried their desserts. 

Chocolate caramel brownie topped with a chunk of score and pecan caramel brownie. I personally liked the pecan brownie better. The chocolate brownie had a slight dark chocolate bitter taste and the pecan brownie had a sweeter vanilla type of taste.

The Japanese barista  is very talented when creating the artistic designs on the cappuccino's. She is very friendly and has a strong Japanese accent which I find cute :)"}
{"text":"Just found this cafe on yelp. I had the lasagna which is great. It comes with a salad and bread for a really good price. The other reviews says the cappucino's awesome and it's true. The service is awesome! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The capppucino was great,  strong favour and beautiful presentation!  The pasta was fresh and they have different sauses for you to choose from.  Will definitely come back when im in the area."}
{"text":"Comfortable seating with cute latte art when you order a cup of cappuccino or other types of flavored lattes :)"}
{"text":"We came in for a quick lunch, but we ended up spending over an hour here because they missed our lasagna. The owner was apologetic, so we were okay with it.

Service was slow, even with three people on deck. We watched them prepare, and serve - being in the other big room; it did not seem to be the most efficient way to run a cafe.

If based on coffee alone, it's a very solid 4 stars.
Food, however missed its 5 stars rating with us.

Lasagna $9.50 - aside from the sauce being more watery than sauce, it was delicious. The garlic bread that it came with was burnt though.

Italian Pannini $6.35 - it was good.

Fantasia Salad $9.90 - what can you expect from a salad, right?

We also ordered a cappuccino (delicious!) and an italian hot chocolate (super crazy way too sweet). 

Prices are reasonable for what you get, and I see why people love this little cafe. For what this little cafe offers, it's enough. Not opening on weekends, well, that's a lot of missed out business. 

Servers are nice. Parking is easy. A little hard to find as it's tucked away.

Overall, it's between a 3.5 to 4 stars for us. If we were ever in the area again on a weekday, we would come back. But we wouldn't trek our way out again."}
{"text":"Came here during my lunch break with a few of my coworkers. We turned into the wrong plaza twice as this place is a little hard to find. 

Now I am always impressed by servers (in this case the owner) taking orders without a pen/paper or any device while holding a conversation. He emphasized that we could order anything on the menu with any additions/sauces you'd like. My two friends ordered two lattes and 2 pastas, customized with difference sauces and meat on each one with no additional cost. I ordered the pizza with chicken and a medley of vegetables. So for the service this is definitely 5 stars.

As we sat down, we shortly got our food. The pasta and pizza are huge, he is generous with the sauce on the pasta and toppings on the pizza. The pastas came with slices of baked bread to scoop up the sauce after your done eating. The pizza itself is fresh with tons of toppings, but a little too much dough for me (I'm sure if I asked for thin crust he would say no problem). I didn't order a drink, but when my coworkers got their lattes, which had beautiful art on them, he brought us 3 glasses of water as well! Like a damn mind reader.

In summary,
Takes your orders without pen/paper AND gets it right!
Customize whatever you want at no additional cost
Brings you things before you even need it
2 pastas, two lattes, pizza after tax and tip $40!!"}
{"text":"Great Cafe. Wonderful service quiet and Italian. Loved the music theme. Food was exceptional."}
{"text":"Best consumer service ! I was with my kids (1 and 3 years old) and ordered take-out and the employee carried my order to my car for me! The owner is kind and awesome ! Even offered my 3 years old free chocolate bar. The food and drinks are great too!"}
{"text":"This is one great cafe. A little hard to find as the front of the cafe is not Don Mills road. But by using the actual address, I am glad I went in. 
The cafe is very tastefully put together. Not too fancy, but  very clean, modern and functional. The seating area does not have a lot of space but is not cramped. It also has a large window, and with plenty of sunlight,  feel very comfortable. I had a lattes and my wife picked the cappuccino. Both were picture perfectly done and the taste was awesome. My pasta dish was simply delicious. It tastes better than some fine dinning places I had been to. As recommended by the man at the counter, my wife selected a Italian pastry. It was light, fresh, refreshing and moist, all at the same time. To sum it up, a gourmet place, a hidden gem. 
P.S. Did I mentioned about the good service :)
David from Markham"}
{"text":"Very nice Italian cafe with the friendliest staff. We ordered a lasagna and a chicken pesto pasta. Also tried their latte, and grabbed a hazelnut cappuccino and two panini to go. 

Food was great. Sauce and seasoning was well done. Rich in flavour. There seems to be great care in preparing the food. 

Service was fantastic and I think that makes the difference. Very welcoming and attentive. The lattes and cappuccino come with fantastic artwork. Mine had a cute bear's face on it. What a great touch!

It's hard to find the location on the first try, but I'll be happy to come back again many times over."}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker but I saw the cute pictures online and I had to try this cafe! This place was extremely difficult to find because it was hidden behind Alpha Laboratories.

When I entered the cafe, I was greeted right away and I liked the friendly vibe already. It took me a while to decide on what to get because there were so many things to choose from. I finally decided on a cheese Danish and a cafe latte. I was excited to see what he'll draw on my coffee! He told me find a seat and he'll bring everything to my table.

When he came with a tray, the cheese Danish was heated up and cut in half for easy consumption. I thought it was very delicious. The cheese really came through and it wasn't too sweet. On my coffee, he drew two hearts. I was hoping for a pig but the hearts are still very cute! For a noncoffee drinker, I think it tasted pretty good. Lastly, on the tray was a glass of water with a big slice of lime. I really liked the small touches he added to my snack. 

Before I left, I asked him where the pastries were from. I was surprised to hear that some of it were flown from Italy. I definitely need to try some more pastries on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I've been here a few times already and tried the pastas, pizza, salad and both the hot and cold drinks and loved everything I had. Even the bread that came on the side of the meals was amazing. Everything tastes really fresh and homemade. The service is wonderful. The owner is very passionate and the server is super nice. The seating area is cute, clean and comfortable. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday, location is hidden in the building, but very good food and service there."}
{"text":"A hidden gem near my home. Found this place while passing nearby. Who knew, this could be the end of my cafe search! The place serves aromatic Italian coffees, with cute coffee art. The service is exceptionally great. Plus there is a free coffee/tea on the Yelp check-in with an order of ideally, it says with a pizza but the owner is generous enough to give you a free coffee with any other purchase. However, if you are visiting this cafe, you can't just leave without having a bite, so be it a dessert or a snack or a pizza. Everything is just outstanding. The cheesecakes are out of the world. Pizzas are thin, fresh and crisp. 

The coffee is strong and free from bitterness & aftertaste. It tastes delicious, a truly Italian coffee. I love their Cappuccino and Double espresso macchiato. They are soon starting to sell Italian coffee beans. Btw it is truly a hidden gem, behind some medical building, on the main floor.

The only con of the place is that it closes by 7:00 PM."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food, Great Service. Very nice and relaxing date cafe :)"}
{"text":"I have to agree with everyone else who has reviewed this tiny spot inside a medical building. It was a terrific little gem, but hard to find!! You don't see it from the street, and the only way we found it was by the address, and then by going around back. Oh, and we chose it because there was a Yelp special on it - free coffee.

But what a coffee! That was one of the best Café au lait / Lattés that I have ever had! 

Their sandwhiches were very tasty and totally reasonably priced. We each got an egg sandwhich, on whole bread, with tomato, lettuce, and mayo, and it was delicious! Both meals combined came to about $10 *(would have been more without the Yelp check in special; hope the tip was sufficient!)

There's a pleasant sounding waterfall near the seating. Not huge in ambiance, but the food and service were worth the visit. I would certainly go back if and whenever I find myself near there again."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this for place for awhile now since a lot of people who work near there said it is a good place for lunch. There's also a free cappuccino offer if you check-in on Yelp. Even though I was told that the restaurant is hidden inside a medical building, I expected a large sign on the street for people to see. Unfortunately, the sign only faced one side (South of Don Mills Rd) and so I passed by the location twice. 

I was greeted by the owner as I walked into the restaurant. There was a small open space with wooden chairs/tables on one side and a slightly bigger room with white chairs and tables for more group seatings, with several outlets, magazines, and calming music on the other side. I ordered a 12\" vegetarian pizza ($9.40) and a ginseng cappuccino (originally $3.99, but got it for free due to Yelp check-in). The pizza was made to order. It was delicious and there was enough toppings on the pizza. However, it wasn't anything special so I don't think I will order it next time. The ginseng cappuccino was made very hot just as I had requested it. It didn't have enough ginseng taste though, it tasted rather caramel-y, but overall, it was a great drink and I would definitely order it again. 

The table next to us ordered a tuna fantasia salad and a lasagna, and both looked really good. There are also many items on the menu that I want to try so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Located in a rather hidden spot in a corporate building, I was surprised to find such a cozy cafe. My friend and I each had a latte, and shared the chicken and veg. pizza.

The latte was delicious and had cute art.  Mine had hearts and the other latte had a bear.  The pizza was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  Service was fast and friendly.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This was a total pleasure !!! We called to make sure they were open in the evening &
the gentleman that answered told us yes . When we arrived the owner directed us inside and walked through the choices we had for pizza & pasta . Surprising how many choices there were considering this is a simple cafe.  As the owner explained everything is fresh & made to order . He took his time explaining how he tried to recreate his cafe in Italy . He was a total pleasure & the food was a delight . I had told him I had wanted to try his cappuccino but by the time
we finished we were all full . He brought a complimentary cappuccino for us to share, it was outstanding . Then he topped the whole thing off with 3 tiny pastries . These pastries 
are so GOOD ! We would come back anytime . The owner is a delight ,his food is great , cappuccino a feature itself & the pastries not to miss ."}
{"text":"One of the best places for latte art! Staff were super friendly, sucks that its in a medical building!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Definitely recommended!!!
Nice Owner and server. I had fried egg and ham with croissant, it was so tasty."}
{"text":"Found this cute Italian brunch spot while yelp surfing. It is the perfect place to catch up with ur close friend! 

I got the fettucine with chicken and rossa sauce. Which I loved and highly recommend! :) 
It comes with a salad on the side and delicious garlic bread. Muah! 

Also try their cappuccino/latte, they have a variety of flavours. I had their ginseng cappuccino which was delicious and very unique. It also comes with a cute design in it! 

Their service is very good. They were helpful when I asked questions about the menu and they are all very friendly! No wonder they have a 5 star review. 

Everything is very well priced and affordable. Food tastes better than other restaurants that charge double for a pasta dish. 

It's not a fancy place or anything, and location is kinda random and hidden. But everything else makes up for it :)

I definitely want to come back to try their arugula/prosciutto pizza mmmmm~ and another cappuccino hehe

Ps there's also a cute koi fish pond along the walkway!"}
{"text":"Hard to find. Parking is limited. Greeted with a friendly smile.  Menu seems limited.  I order a super mochachino and the tomato and beef soup, and Tomato and beef pasta.   Background music is a nice touch. May want to invest in better then folding chairs. Cleaning lady , and I mean cleaning lady very loudly cleaning the room, the smell of windex fills and I mean fills the air, after yelling to her friend in the hallway about the meeting her church group has in the city later that night, my companion and I are able to get back to our conversation.  The fact that we are in a medical building is fully put back in full perspective when the nice lady instructs us that we need not move for her...as she will be back to clean our corner. My soup was amazing. I wish I got the Alfredo and chicken like my companion, as mine mas under seasoned and he was licking his plate. My Mochachino came after pasta as is Italian tradition. Would love to come back and try the pizza. The food , service, and overall experience far out way the medical buildings flaws. 4 out of 5"}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite cafe. Excellent food and customer service. Their coffee/latte menu has a great selection and they all come with pretty drawings on top. Anything on the menu is good. However, for pizza selection I would go for small ones than larger ones. The large pizza has thicker crust. I like thinner ones :)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a coworker this week and had an Alfredo pasta and a green tea matcha latte. I wish I had gotten pizza based on some of the reviews here, but I must say the pasta was solid and the green tea matcha latte was amazing. The latte art on top of that is a nice extra touch. All of that for only $12 is pretty good value for the food. It's a pretty quaint place inside a medical buildilng that is relatively challenging to find your first time and not that great to get in an out of. However, once you're in you will be pleasantly surprised that to find a place like this literally in the middle of nowhere. I will be back to try some of their other menu items and definitely get another latte."}
{"text":"I love love love this cafe! From the delicious food to uber friendly servers to learning about the history of this cafe from the owner himself, this is one of my most enjoyable dinning experience this year so far.  Oh and how cute is the bear face on my cappuccino!!!!  

The owner Manuel was super nice, he came by to ask how our meal was and we ended up talking about how he got started in the business in Rome, showing us a portrait of his sister restaurant in Rome Italy on the wall.  Manuel place a strong emphasis on high quality ingredients, good tasting food and consistent good service.  All important ingredients to be successful in the food business.  After all, Baretto cafe did average a 5 star from 200+ yelp reviews!  

We ordered a vegetarian pizza, chicken rose fettuccine and ended off the meal with a cappuccino and their specialty, ginseng latte. All were very delicious but the rose fettuccine was heavenly! It's a must order imo if you like rose sauce.  The ginseng latte was very unique and different, Manuel told us it was shipped directly from Italy and only he offers it in Toronto.  That alone warrants a visit to Baretto cafe!"}
{"text":"better than the much coveted aroma at the shops at don mills!  must try.  and yes they make the cool foam patterns too.  I love the little details.

The best cappuccino I have had since I've been in Italy. Nothing comes close elsewhere in toronto."}
{"text":"This cafe makes you feel like you are in Italy. The design is very beautiful and the attention to detail in the drinks is amazing. As a bonus the staff were so attentive and caring. I will be definitely going back again and again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with some work colleagues, and at first I was confused as to why we were turning into a medical building, but low and behold, this little cafe was just in the back parking lot. 
Along the walkway to the entrance is a koi pond, which was a delightful first impression as I walked into the little cafe.
The staff were absolutely accommodating and welcoming. I ordered a 12\" pepperoni pizza to split and my colleagues ordered paninis. The pizza was great!! It had a bit of parm sprinkled on top and the crust was delicious. Half of the pizza was more than filling for lunch. The paninis were also well received, I'm going to have to try one next time. I also will have to come back for a cappuccino so that I can get a cute design! Love that...not to mention, I saw cheesecake! 
I keep seeing 'hidden gem' in the other reviews for this place, and I couldn't agree more!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to have Italian for lunch around North York and this place popped up on Yelp. We are glad we gave this place a try as the prices were reasonable, food tastes great, services were friendly, and also a nice seating area. It is not the easiest to find as it is hidden by a medical building. We had a small vegetarian pizza, a caprese salad, and a fantasia salad. All were great. Definitely worth a try and will come back to try other items."}
{"text":"Came here to see if this cafe lives up to its 5 star standards, and I was not disappointed.

The service was impeccable, everyone is so warm and friendly, the food was fresh and flavourful, portions were huge for the price! In total, we spent 17 dollars after tax on two cappuccinos, a caprese salad, bruschetta with prosciutto, and two delicious flaky.

All their food and pastries are made in-house, the owner said they are a branch of the Baretto caffe that's in Italy that's been open for decades. Definitely drop by this hidden gem if you have the chance."}
{"text":"Wow. I've been here 4 or 5 times already and everytime its just amazing food and amazing coffee. On two occasions I tried his pastas. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very rich. He adds a nice little salad with some ciabatta to finish off the sauce. Today I tried the proscioutto panini and it was great. Its a huge bonus that the owner is super nice and even gives away free baked goods sometimes. This place is very far from me- about 35 minutes. I have driven here twice because I really just wanted the food and coffee When I am in the area, I make sure now that I come here.

Heads up- The building is a little bit hard to find. Its in a red brick building that also has \"listen up canada\" in there. 

Go there and try the stuff, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Great place for a brunch at a reasonable price.  We had the pasta with rose sauce and chicken for around  $13, and eggs and prosciutto on a toasted croissant for around $7.  The owner was really friendly and gave us a ginseng cappuccino as it was our first visit.  All of the staff were very friendly, in fact, with big smiles on.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a stroller-friendly place to meet up and chat with a friend and discovered this cafe via Yelp. It deserves the 5 star review and I will definitely return if in the area. 

Food and drink: 5 stars
Service: 5 stars
Ambience: 5 stars (inside cafe)
Price: very reasonable! (Our drinks were free on this visit!!)
Stroller-access: yes! (I came with a newborn and a chunky stroller)
Baby-friendly washroom: yes! There's no change table but there's a large ledge in front of the mirror in the washroom which sufficed

Food is delicious, pretty, and fresh. We ordered fettuccini rossa with prosciutto, pizza with prosciutto, dark chocolate cappuccino and hazelnut cafe latte. I LOVED that there was art in my cup! Fancy place :) 

They had plenty of staff and it was a very relaxed atmosphere. Everyone was really nice and served with a smile like they cared. 

I agree that the building is rather unassuming from the outside. It looks like an industrial warehouse area, except for the nice red sign on the outside. It looks like the building is in the middle of renovations on the inside, except for the cafe which is bright and inviting. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place. My friend and I had an amazing time. I had a newborn with me and still felt relaxed!"}
{"text":"Lovely small cafe with very nice owners that you can tell takes their time and heart into making the food and coffee. This location might be a bit hidden but they are opening a second location downtown which might be more convenient for most people. 

Coffee was very aromatic and smooth; good coffee yet not overly strong where other cafes can be. Their pasta menu is also a good try - had their Alfredo fettucine; sauce was very creamy yet not overly heavy. If you are looking for a cafe to sit and chat with friends or just a quiet place to read a book as opposed to a busy Sbucks, this place might spark your interest. Would be perfect if they have a patio area, but I don't think that's possible in their current location. However, this place may remind some people of Aroma, but with a homier feel.They do have extra seating in a room off to the side (something resembling a cafeteria so you have plenty of space to sit during rush hours). Warning though, this place is opened Mon-Fri only, which might be difficult for the typical 9-5 people to find time to come here."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from this small cafe tucked away in an office building.  Latte was perfect and adorable - they created a bear in the foam.   

It's a bit difficult to find because it's at the rear of the building, just look for the street number and take the driveway to the back."}
{"text":"One of the gems in my neighbourhood that was due for a visit. I had a great time and the food, service, and environment was unbeatable for what I paid for. The owner was friendly and personally made his trademark cappuccinos. They were so delicious that I felt guilty for it coming here sooner!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe. You might miss it because the sign is not obvious but this is a great place! Tried their 12\" proscutto pizza ($10.99) and caffe americano (2.69). Both are great! Would love to go back and try their pastries/cakes! Staff is nice and friendly :)"}
{"text":"Nice friendly owner and staff.

Croissant was perfect :) a few styles of cheese Danish to choose from and I liked the savory version.

Coffee was very good too."}
{"text":"Can I say WOOOWWW. No I'm not exaggerating this place is absolutely one of the best cafes I've been to! The staff here are hands down some of the nicest people! They are so down to earth and willing to help! Amazing people. And the food, words cannot describe how delicious the food is. My boyfriend got a rossa sauce penne with chicken and the sauce was phenomenal... it had a hint of I believe curry flavour that was added to the tomato and Alfredo sauce and it just made it so much more delicious. Oh and we got the prosciutto Bruschetta which was literally a pile of thinly sliced  cured meat topped with arugula and parmeasan. For someone that loves prosciutto like me... this was heaven... and the thing only costed 5.49 for 2 pieces! Now if you are not hungry and just wanted something to sip on, their cappuccino and latte are so fragrant and full bodied it will hit all those warm and happy nerves in the body, making you feel like a fuzzy joyful soul. I'm not even exaggerating come try it for yourself :)."}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to its 5-star rating! It was a little hard to find, being tucked away in a medical building (entrance is right by the lights). 

The food was delicious with generous portions, accompanied by fantastic service. We ordered the lasagna, rose pasta, and the Baretto antipasto alongside a ginseng cappuccino, iced tea, and an iced cappuccino. My friends and I could not stop raving about the pasta! The pasta was perfectly al-dente and the sauce was so creamy and rich, it coated each noodle perfectly. I personally really enjoyed the ginseng cappuccino, not too sweet with a unique flavor to it. I couldn't put my cup down!

The individual who I assumed was the owner stopped by a few times throughout our visit to see if we were doing alright. He even noticed that my friend barely touched his iced tea and offered to make him a different drink in exchange (my friend was just too busy scarfing his food down). 

Will definitely be visiting this place again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Baretto Caffe used to call L'arte Del Caffe. A change of name but still have the same barista and menu.

What gives this place a 4 stars is really the attentive and sincere service. All the staff working here really wants you to have a good time and enjoy their offerings.

We ordered a Super Latte Macchiato ($3.49) and Cappuccino ($3.99). I would suggest just stay with the regular size. Since the cup serving the Super size is really narrow, so it is hard for the barista to create any decent latte art. 

Bruschetta with Prosciutto ($4.50) is a decent choice as a snack. It is really prosciutto on a toast, served like an open face sandwich.

With the lacking of independent cafe in that area, Baretto Caffe is worth visiting to support local business."}
{"text":"L'arte del Caffe is now my new favourite place to hang out with friends and family! It over-exceeded my expectations when I visited the establishment with my cousin. The sitting area was bright and clean, and the owner brought our orders right up to our table. I was recommended to try the ginseng latte by a regular there and it was the best! He even did the OK design milk foam art I requested (since I saw a lot of their drinks posted on social media). The owner also treated us to a cheese and orange sfogliatella napoletana pastry and even gave us a few extra pieces to take home! Great experience, I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I signed up for yelp just to give this place a 5 star rating. Although we are skeptical at first walking into a random medical building, the inside of the Cafe was beautiful and modern (looks like one of the small Cafes in Yorkville). Their pastas are home made and are the best I've had in Toronto. Price reasonably. Definitely worth a try!"}

Here is an update to my last review. 

Since going to Baretto for the first time, it has become one of my favourite Coffee / Breakfast and Italian lunch places. 

I have over the last two years become closely acquainted with Manuelle and his wife, Cristina, the owners. They are such lovely people and they put out the freshest and most delicious Italian food in the city. Its simple, fresh, homely and FREAKING DELICIOUS!!!

The coffee .....ohhhh the coffee...... If you have never heard of a Ginseng latte (i didn't), you absolutely need to go here and get it. 

Things my wife and I have tried here so far: 
All the pizzas
Lasagne
Pasta
Both the antipasto
Caprese Salad
Iced milk with mint
Croissant
Sfoglia
Italian Cream puff
Ginseng Latte
Regular Latte

I give all of the above a 100/100
I give the service a 100/100 


Original review....
I was in the Don Mills area and wanted a quick breakfast and was about to head to McEwans when I came across this place on yelp. 
It is located in the rear or this rather inconspicuous medical building. 
Let me start by saying that Yelp does not have the number of stars that I would like to give this place. The barista is a true gentleman named Manuelle who really makes you feel welcome. The place looks wonderful and there is another room as well that is a little more intimate and private. 
I had a coffee and a croissant and it's was delicious x  . The place is clean, open and really relaxing. 
Will come back here for the food and post another review."}
{"text":"What a great little coffee house! The owner of this cafe is a really nice person! I discovered this place on Yelp and went in with my hubby and 7 month old baby to meet mommy/her hubby and baby. It's very quiet and custom service is great. 

I went in again with our a friend and it wasn't a disappointment and the cafe owner recognized us and welcomed us from far. Coffee is far better than even Starbucks ( tastes like coffee from Italian Cafe since the owner is from Italy). And their baked food is very tasty! 

Glad found this place as it's becoming our go to place now. It's in the red medical building behind Aplha labs."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great prices. Overall Excellent
I ordered two lattés, one for me and m'lady. Lots of flavours to choose from for one drink. I got the hazlenut and chocolate latté. It tasted excellent- Aromatic, creamy and coffee in an excellent ratio. Was not a small size either. If you can spend money to buy a Tim Hortons drink, then at the same price Barretto serves it better by a mile."}
{"text":"The food here is really good for the price point and the staff are lovely! Service was 5/5 :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here! It is hidden in a medical building, so keep a lookout for \"Alpha\" when driving. It's half way after the traffic light. 

The service was fantastic. Staff there are knowledgeable, helpful and very sweet. 

My friend and I got the Veggie Panini, Bruschetta, a croissant, a Matcha Latte, and a Hazelnut Cappuccino. Overall, everything was really good, and a good portion. I really enjoyed everything, but especially the croissant haha.

10/10 would return!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe on don Mills that serves coffee, treats and food to eat.

I had the veggie pizza and a ginseng latte which were both yummy.  Also love the latte art that they drew for me.

Great place to chill and get some work done."}
{"text":"I searched brunch at yelp and found this amazing place. Although the location is a bit hard to find, the food and coffee was great. And they are in a decent price too. Thanks yelp for giving me a perfect place to eat!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. pizza and torta and other stuff was so yummy. Coming back for sure. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Very good coffee, food and service! One of the best authentic Italy cafe in town. Good selection of food and beverages with a very good price. Don't miss it !"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! With big windows, lots of natural light and friendly staff, I immediately felt welcomed. I never felt remotely rushed, neither to order or to leave after eating. The food was delicious, the presentation appealing, the prices very reasonable. If you're anywhere nearby, it's absolutely worth checking out. I would for sure go again."}
{"text":"If you ever have a day off, grab a friend and head to lunch at Baretto Cafe (cafe is only open Monday to Friday and closes at 6pm). The service here is amazingly warm and we were checked on multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed. I love that you can sit for hours enjoying the delicious food and drinks here... AND they have the most adorable latte art!

I had rosé pasta ($8.99) with prosciutto (+$1.50) and it was so tasty. The rosé sauce was creamy and slightly sweet and paired well with the crisp prosciutto. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente. The garlic bread was light and fresh and perfectly seasoned.

I've also tried the Prosciutto Pizza ($10.99) which is topped with a generous amount of prosciutto, fresh arugula and parmigiano. The crust is light and crispy but a little thicker than I personally like.

You can also get a complimentary cappuccino for checking-in on yelp.

The cafe is hidden inside a medical building and is not the easiest to find but totally worth the effort to come here."}
{"text":"Servers are super attentive and really nice. Kept coming by to ask if everything was okay. The food looked super fresh. It's hard to find in terms of location but definitely worth it. Would come back 100%"}
{"text":"Oh boy!!! This cafe is flawless!!! Loved everything I had in here! 
Pizza, cheese cake, cappuccino..."}
{"text":"Been there once. This has been my friends' favorite coffee spot for a while, but to me the coffee seemed a bit overly sweet. Beautifully decorated though. The food is yummy (the pasta was better than pizza), customer service is wonderful. Pretty clean, nice spot to meet friends. Maybe will come back."}
{"text":"Woooow, this is a hidden gem around this area! 

The food and coffee are amazingly prepared and delicious - I have been to many cafes in the uptown area and this is way better!! 

Forget about Starbucks or second cup, when you need some caffeine and happen to be around the area, must drop by! 

The only thing is that this cafe is located inside of a clinic - although really easy to navigate once you park the car (there is only one red clinic building), but there is no clear sign on the outside so you may miss it when you are driving by. 

Highly recommended for people who are passing by and want to grab a quick and delicious coffee/bagel."}
{"text":"Love love love love this place! Service is PHENOMENAL & food is AMAZING. 

I was working there for a few hours, and didn't realize that it was almost around their closing time (6pm). At 5:45, the owner asked me if I was still working and told me that I could use their dining space as long as I wanted. He also offered me a cup of their amazing latte since I was planning to work there for a while. Keep in mind that I have already redeemed my free latte earlier & now they're giving me another free cup! 

So generous! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, but if you're looking for a good cup of coffee this one only has great coffee art to offer."}
{"text":"The place is a little difficult to find but it's a cute hidden gem in the back of a medical building. 

The service is fantastic. All of the employees are great and very attentive. They really make sure you're enjoying everything. The place is clean and very well kept.

I had their pasta, it's very saucy and very delicious. Their chai latte is actually one of the best chai lattes I've ever had. They actually gave me the drink on the house because it was my first time there. The menu does say \"free cappuccino with an $11.99 purchase\" so it may have been something to do with that but hey, a free drink is a free drink. 

Very glad I tried this place out. Will definitely be visiting again."}
