{"text":"As a person who grew up in Damascus I can attest to just how good their baklawa is! So fresh and just sweet enough. 

They have gained quite a reputation among the Arab community in the GTA for a reason."}
{"text":"Best baklava in Canada!! very authentic, even better than the ones in middle east"}
{"text":"Quality has gone down. 
Prices have gone up.

petits four are over priced and is not consistent on quality or appearance."}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious! Made with real buttery ghee, fragrant rose water, toasted nuts and flaky pastry. I haven't tried a single thing at this place that I didn't love!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best baklava and kanafa I've had.  I got it on the Islamic holiday called Eid at the end of the month of fasting and the orders were coming straight out of the oven to the customers!  I've never ha oven fresh baklava and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Got an assorted couple kilos of baklava from this place and its delicious. I've had baklava in Dearborn and this place gets somewhat close to that quality, presentation, and freshness. Definitely will be my goto place in the GTA. Prices seem a bit high but I never know what it should cost. I suggest having a less sweet option on the menu!"}
{"text":"Absolute garbage customer service - can't even answer customers questions properly they really need to train their employees to listen and address customers appropriately- will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Kunafa and karabeej madd.  Too sweet. A small place can only contain two tables. May not go back."}
{"text":"I've had a craving for kanafeh ever since a friend of mine brought his homemade kanafeh to a potluck. After an extensive online search, I came up with a few places that seemed quite promising - Baklawa King and Patisserie Royale. I decided to stop by Baklawa King, as it was on my way home today.

The place is rather cramped inside, with only a few small tables by the door. The display cases are neatly stocked with a large variety of Middle Eastern treats, included baklava (obviously), mammoul, mafroukeh, and kanafeh.

The kanafeh was good, but I prefer the kataifi crust to the semolina crust that is used here. The cheese was nice and mild with just the right amount of salt, although it was a bit too chewy for my taste. Syrup was added just before serving. I think the server was a bit heavy handed on the syrup, as it was bordering on too sweet for me - which is saying a lot because I have quite the sweet tooth. I also feel like the syrup could have used some (or more) rose water, as it was not at all perceptible.

Overall, it seems like I am still on the hunt for my perfect kanafeh, but this was a decent alternative. Next time I will probably try their namesake pastry instead."}
{"text":"Best baklawa ever!!! Service is ok, (not terrible but not excellent either) and not really  a place to sit and eat. Have it to go and ENJOY!!! I drive 20 km to get my fix."}
{"text":"The flakiest and most flavorful Arab-style baklava I have ever had and I've been eating baklava my entire life - it also keeps remarkably well. I ask my aunt to bring it for me from Canada. I am shocked to see this place having less than 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Went here the other night just before they closed.
Ordered an assortment of baklava and when I got home and put them on a table I noticed there was a bug that was in the bag. Will never get food from here again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend regrets the day he introduced me to baklavas. I love them so much!! And the ones we recently got from Baklawa King was exactly what I was craving for. We got half a kilo and I can't stop eating them!
The gentleman that took our order was kind enough to give us 3 different pieces of baklavas to try. Whenever you're in the area, drop by and try some!!"}
{"text":"I purchased an assortment of baklava. When the lady helping me told me the subtotal at the register, I realized it was cheaper than I thought and asked her to add a few more for me. She rolled her eyes at me, huffed and puffed, and told me \"you should have told me from the beginning\". I'm sorry, isn't it a GOOD thing that I'm giving you more business? I don't understand. 
Not only did she throw on (literally) the additional baklava, I opened the box to see them falling apart. Am I supposed to serve broken baklava to my guests? 
As for the baklava, it wasn't bad. It's what you would expect. Even so, I will not be returning because I have never seen such bad customer service. Absolutely RUDE."}
{"text":"The best baklava I've ever tasted. Possibly the best there is out there? So flaky, full of nuts and just the right amount of syrup. Can't speak for their other pastries but the baklava is a hit"}
{"text":"This is for the service only. We were excited to try it out, but were greeted with rude almost scary \"what do you want\".  I was afraid to ask for recommendation at this point I  saw reviewers posted $10 plate photos so i asked  for it. She grabbed a container and proceeded with another \"what do you want\" repeating it while i was trying to make a choice with rather angry stare at me. I just wanted to leave asap. I don't think i've ever encountered service worse that this one."}
{"text":"I have not frequent this place for many months. I have been desperately trying to find a replacement after moving out East of the city. Searching far and wide and scouring through magazines, Yelp and online articles for a Baklava greater than the King. I have had the best in the Scarborough area, tasted the greats in North York and devoured the refined in downtown Toronto in the recent months. Yet every time with every bite it pales in comparison the the King. Even my partner was foolish to think she had found the new King out in Scarberia but it was I that reminded her that her judgement has been clouded from longing for the true King for so long. I had to take her back here and remind her just how great this place really is. It took one bite and she felt horrible that she has been deceived once too many times. This IS the best baklava the GTA has seen and it remains for now."}
{"text":"My friends and I tried this place and their pastries are just delicious. We tried assorted ones and we loved all of them! Definitely a place you need to try. Can't get enough of it! Some are really sweet though like any other desserts/treats but hey, just have some water ready just in case!"}
{"text":"4-4.5*, but bumped up the rating 'cause it's easily the best baklava in 'ssauga!  I realise that doesn't say too much, but it sure beats Paramount and Adonis.  :)))  And although it's on the edge of town, it's better than driving out to Patisserie Royale...in Scarb!

I got $10 worth of baklava today and doing my math, it's probably one of the \"cheaper\" dessert options at approx. $1/piece!  The pieces are fairly small, so you can easily eat like 3 different (or same) pieces in 1 sitting.  You probably SHOULDN'T, but you can, just sayin'.

The 3 varieties that I ate today were almost on par with Patisserie Royale.  I have to go through the rest of the box before I make a final determination!  For some reason, this batch tasted better than my last review.  

Waaay better than the crap that passes for desserts/sweets at Starbucks, a doughnut, or anything else from Tim Horton's!

Place itself is clean, but doesn't lend itself for chillin' out.  There is outdoor seating, but NO ONE ever takes advantage of it.  So just take your goodies 'n enjoy 'em elsewhere!"}
{"text":"RUN, DON'T WALK & get some of the BEST baklawa & Lebanese pastries!! These are the best patries I have ever had in the city. Thisplace has spoiled me for other place. They have a couple of tables. I only did takeout & didn't try the coffee there. I willdo that next time. Do yourself a favour & try them. It is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Best Baklawa in GTA!!! Excellent taste, not too sweet, great aroma and super aftertaste!!! Little pricey but you have to pay more for best!! Love to go again and again."}
{"text":"A quick place to grab some baklawa to go!

ATMOSPHERE: Small shop in a strip mall. It's been there a while, but it's a bright and clean shop. There are some seats (they do sell a few beverages too), but really a take-out place first and foremost.

SERVICE: Fast. It's a small place, and they fill orders quickly. Staff are helpful with recommendations.

PRICE: Very affordable.

FOOD: Large selection of baklawa, mammouls, pastries and other treats."}
