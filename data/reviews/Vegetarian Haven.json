{"text":"First of all, this is probably the best Vegetarian restaurant I've been to in the Toronto area, and probably in my top ten of vegetarian restaurants I've been to in North America.  I took a big burly omnivore with me, and he loved everything we ordered, so I take that as a great sign.  We started things off with an order of crispy oyster mushrooms and seared dumplings. I wish we had ordered two orders of the crispy oyster mushrooms because I can never have enough, they are so rich and flavourful and the sweet slightly spiced sauce is a perfect compliment for it.  We both ordered the Special of the Day, which was a tofu skin wrapped taro root mash on a bed of greens, with a side of noodles, and a flavour explosion of a mango salad.   Our waitress totally sold it. Her description got my mouth watering from the very beginning. It adds so much to a meal when the server is friendly, and she was wonderful. Moreover, she clearly loved the place and the food, which is exactly the type of person I want advising me on what to order.  I was feeling pretty full after finishing my plate, but there is always room for dessert. My dining companion and I shared a piece of chocolate cake and a brownie sundae (but since they were out of brownie, they used lightly warmed chocolate cookies.)  What can I say, other than delicious! delicious! delicious!   The chocolate cake was good, but not as good as the sundae. Though I'm glad our server made sure we took the left over chocolate cake home, because while it wasn't as awesome when it went head to head with the sundae, it was fantastic by itself at 3am.  In Short:  - order the crispy mushrooms, you wont be disappointed.  - And the Special; it's consistently amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. I started with an amazing drink that I highly recommend: the steamed almond milk with ginger. Perfect for a chilly night. then I had a great appetizer I also recommend, some kind of avocado and other vegies with a sauce wrapped in seaweed. Fantastic. the entree, sizzling eggplant tempeh in coconut curry, was really good if you like those earthy flavors. I certainly do. The only thing that didn't score a phenomenal rating from me was the chocolate fudge cake. It was good, but I expected it to be a little more rich. Probably better that it was not, though, since I was already full.  Also they don't serve alcohol, but i recommend their micro-brew ginger ale which does the job complementing spicy food, the same as beer.  Just wish they had a restaurant like this where I live in the US. I will go back any time I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"For someone who is neither vegan or a vegetarian the food here was fantastic.  I haven't had a meal that tasty in a long long time.  The service however was less than desirable. It all began when we showed up and much to our surprise they did not have our reservation. We were told they \"couldn't find one under that name\".  This was fine however the confusion as to who our server actually was made it a little puzzling to figure out who I should tip. Over the course of our dinner we had 3 different servers come up to us and take care of different parts of our meal.  One server (a curly haired blonde woman) was incredibly pushy, almost to the point of annoyance.  Overall aside from the service this meal was well worth the slightly inflated price.   Be forwarded they do mention that they sometimes charge an automatic gratuity of 18% (no party size specified). Rarely do I enjoy a tip being forced upon me."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a vegetarian restaurant and I was very impressed.  The food, flavors, and textures were outstanding. I hadn't heard of some of the ingredients listed on the menu but that was part of the fun; learning!  The service was attentive and the waitresses were happy to answer questions about the menu, and their recommendations were spot on.   I had the seitan and it was incredible. I've been looking for it in grocery and specialty stores since, learning that it is a good substitute for meat protein."}
{"text":"One of my favourite vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Toronto. Whenever my friends wanna go eat vegan food, this is the place I took them. I had done birthday dinner there many times and what I like about this place is that they don't have alcohol since it's vegan restaurant. The food and service is an excellent."}
{"text":"Went here for a farewell feast upon leaving Toronto for Edmonton.  Everyone loved their meals, but it was pretty pricey.  The wait staff were very knowledgeable and gave great menu advice to our omnivorous friends. The menu includes a glossary for people who are new to esoteric meat alternatives and that was pretty great.   For appetizer, we shared the soup and oyster mushrooms and simulated prawn. The mushrooms and \"prawns\" were exceptional. The batter was delicious and the prawn's texture was perfect.  For mains, I had the special, which was some kind of gluten-free deep-fried sweet potato thing with excellent sesame rice noodles in a delicious Asian-flavoured sauce. The texture was fantastic and all of it was very different and appreciated.   The DW had the avocado wrap, which tasted like an exceptional avocado salad in wrap form. Pecans, shredded vegetables, apples, all very high quality and fantastic.  Two of our friends had the pad thai and a stir fry and they were truly delicious.  For desert, the apple fritters were disappointing but all of the soy ice cream selections were just as good as milk.  The \"belt-buster banana split\" was huge. I put it away myself, which got a kudos from our waiter, but I would definitely split it in the future because it was just kind of excessive to eat it on my own."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at this establishment while I was in town for work. The atmosphere is cozy and zen. Not a huge place, but very quaint and cute. We noticed that it was quite warm inside, but we got used to it not long after sitting down.   There was a lime slushy special, which was perfectly refreshing after walking 20 minutes to get there. We had the dumplings and garden rolls for appetizers. Both were perfect in size and flavor. For my entree, I chose the sizziling eggplant with tempeh & curry. Delicious! Great flavors. Lots of veggies. My friend had the bird's nest with seitan and veggies, which she really enjoyed. The portions were quite large.  The pièce de résistance was our dessert. The \"brownie banana split belt buster\" will blow your mind! It has 2 scoops of ice cream (a handful of flavor choices), sliced bananas, sliced oranges, sliced apples, and blueberries over warm brownies with chocolate syrup drizzled all over. It's been a week and a half and I'm still thinking about it."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite veg restaurant in town for years; I just went again last night and wanted to update my review/ do a check-in and was surprised to find I didn't have one! Not sure how that happened.   Anyways, they never disappoint - the food is good and worth the price, and the staff is always lovely. If you are going past 7pm on a Fri-Sat you will probably need a reservation because they fill up. If you go around 6, there is usually tables.   It's a classy little bistro with a nice, intimate atmosphere. Good for dates or groups. The food is asian-inspired with a couple of moroccan-spiced dishes. They've got a huge selection of vegan desserts (cakes/cookies/brownies from sweets of the earth, tofutti ice cream, and some raw vegan tarts, and usually a pie or two). They do great smoothies and have a variety of drinks and fresh teas.   On New Years and Valentine's Day they always do a special 3-course meal designed for the day, and every day there is a \"chef's special\" dish that's creative new thing worth trying.   Anyways, I will always recommend :)"}
{"text":"Really cute and sweet.  I got a pad thai and my friend got a gargantuan brownie sundae thing which was delicious (and did not taste gluten free/vegan/healthy at all)."}
{"text":"I've been here bunches of times, and can safely say their food is incredibly delicious.  Particularly amazing: the specials, their tofu drumsticks (I actually think they're tastier than the chicken variety), and the soy ice cream.  Their food is varied and tends to be really interesting.  They don't use a lot of spices, meaning the flavours are very nonstandard.  This could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your taste - I personally really like the way they balance simpler flavours to make something really interesting.  Not the most organized restaurant, but the wait staff are friendly and helpful enough to make up for it.  I've had to flag down waiters on occasion, but once I get their attention they're very attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food. A lot of flavourful and the French press coffee is really good as well."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing Vegetarian Haven for a while and was excited to try a meal there. I ordered the Pad Thai Curry, I liked the soft soba noodle texture of the rice noodles. The flavour was kind of bland and they put kale stems in there?...blegh, why not spring for putting the kale leaves in, especially when you're paying 10+ for a meal. I did like the soya protein strips, tasted really yummy, like really meat.  The service was VERY slow we were there for maybe 2 hours? But it looks like they were just under staffed having 2 servers for a full house of hungry customers.  I would come back because the dishes my two other friends had looked and tasted good. Their desserts look really good, that's a reason to come back for sure.  I'm happy that there is a place like this open, we need more veggie restaurants!"}
{"text":"Since we ate an excess of meat this week, my fiancee and I decided to go vegetarian one Friday...we walked in and were immediately greeted with an enthusiastic description of the day's specials...  All of which looked delicious.  We decided not to go with the specials and ordered off the menu.  The flavours of the Moroccan spicy wrap seemed a bit conflicted but the sizzling seitan was as close to meat as you'll find.  Delicious!   For desert, the walnut apple pastry served with almond chocolate tofu I've cream was excellent, although a bit expensive at almost the same price as one of the meals.  The mint tea was fresh and aromatic, and the service was friendly.  Nice atmosphere on the beautiful Baldwin Ave and the  whole experience definitely wasn't bad for this meat eater!"}
{"text":"The special is always the way to go. Good vegan food that you could take your meat eating friends or family to. Items like the \"Drum Sticks\" are sure to fool the non veg heads and the other dishes have enough flavour to please the vegetarians and vegans."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the menu, I thought it would have had more options. I ended up getting the special that was offered that night (because I wasn't intrigued by anything on the menu), which was tempura tofu in teriyaki sauce with pad thai buckwheat noodles and broccoli. The person I was with got the moroccan wrap that came with a salad. Both dishes were good, but not amazing, and if I were to go back I would not order them again. I ended up taking half of my meal home, which is rare. I do want to go back and give this place another try based on the positive reviews. I plan on going back in the summer because the patio is cute and I want to give the other menu options a try, such as the matcha smoothie."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Haven is a Buddist Vegetarian joint. That's code for, \"completely devoid of flavor\". They don't use onions or garlic in anything which kinda sucks. It's a nice place to have a sit down vegetarian meal, but in the face of so many great veggie spot in Toronto, it just doesn't measure up.  However, they have great cakes. All the veggie joints use the same bakery for their cakes, but as far as I know Vegetarian Haven is the only place you can order a whole one from.  They also have great hand-prepared frozen dinners and ice cream that you can buy to take home with you and the people who run it are so nice."}
{"text":"It's SO GOOD.  Even for the carnivores among us. Super creative flavor fusions, and delicious variety.  A word to the wise, for soy and GF dietary concerns,  beward of Seitan, TVP, and the other \"meat alternatives\"  Do try the desserts, they are Haven-ly!"}
{"text":"Last night I attended a birthday dinner for a friend at Vegetarian Haven. I am not a vegetarian however I enjoy new restaurants and am always encouraged by thoughtful, healthy eating.  This restaurant is located on a very cute street, the patio out front is decorated with colourful lights and quaint tables on a wooden deck. The inside is small, but not cramped. When we first arrived we were 'specialized' - meaning we were not only told about the special of the night, but shown what it looked like cooked on a plate.  The menu is vast and it was hard to decide with all the delicious options. In the end I chose the special - a vegetable and herb medley encased in a phyllo pastry with coconut curry sauce, green beans and glass noodles. I ordered the rice paper Garden Rolls to start which were delicious and fresh, and a green tea with dinner.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes and the waiter we had was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful when we had questions. He encouraged us to try the vegan desserts so I tried the Blueberry \"cheese\" cake and a couple people shared the belt buster which looked quite yummy!  All in all, I really liked the ambience, the food, the wait staff ...until the bill came.  He wouldn't split the check between 4 of us, but told us he would enter whatever amount we requested onto the debit machine. After a few minutes of calculating we did just that. I included my tip in my amount, as everyone else did. We left the restaurant talking about coming back and bringing other people who would also enjoy this new found gem.  About 2 streets away I heard someone run up behind us. It was our waiter, Billy, from the restaurant. I figured someone had forgotten something until I saw the 4 receipts in his hand. He asked us if everything had been all right with our service, to which we responded, yes of course it was all great. I asked what was wrong and he very passively aggressively started asking again if everything was all right since our tips didn't reflect that we had enjoyed ourselves. He told us that we had only tipped about 4% between the 4 of us and it came to roughly $6 in tips altogether.   It was very awkward and very embarrassing to watch. It was almost as if he wanted us to pull out our wallets and give him more money right there on the street. I assured him if that was the case there was an obvious mistake because we were all pretty savvy restaurant frequent-ers and I'd ask about it once I caught up with the other girls. If it was a miscalculation or misunderstanding then we'd be back to fix the mistake.  He sulked away still visibly upset.   I told the other girls what had happened and they all said that they had also tipped him and didn't understand what he was talking about.  First of all, had it been an error or had we just tipped poorly or even nothing at all, is it really appropriate and professional behaviour to run after your guests and demand an explanation for why the tip was low?  I've worked as a waiter before and unfortunately bad tippers and rude guests are all apart of that line of work. I don't consider myself or anyone at that table as either of those so this was quite an experience.   To my friend Billy, I say, thank you for being such a great server to us during our dinner but your actions after left us all dumbfounded.   Thank you also, for the laughs that followed your theatrics.  Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I can't say enough good things about the restaurant and all those who work there! It's a favourite of mine and my husbands. We try visiting a few times a year and I can't get enough of their Miso Dumping Super Bowl"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant! They offer delicious vegan food that even my non-vegan friends enjoy. The service has always been friendly, and the food is delicious. The only problem is I have had trouble sampling much of their menu because the daily special always looks so good! The \"seafood\" soup is delicious, as is their mushroom soup when they make it as their soup of the day. The others are good too but those two are my favourites of what I've tried. The one thing I don't like as much at this place is their seitan. It's still good, but not as good as their other items, or as good as seitan from other places.  They have a delicious-looking selection of desserts, but so far I've always been too full to try any.  Overall, I recommend this place 100%."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place, and I'm not vegetarian or vegan.  I don't even know what I pick half the time, I just ask for the dinner special. Hasn't disappointed yet.  Hot ginger/mint tea ($3) is really nice to have throughout the meal, especially since it's getting colder lately.  Lastly, they have vegan options for dessert, which my friends are really happy about. The tofu ice cream surprised me, it was better than what I was expecting (since I'm used to dairy-based ice creams). Need to go through the rest of that dessert menu sometime :)  The service is pretty decent, they weren't slow about it at all and frequented the table often to ask how we were doing."}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to finish this review. I think it's been about 2 months since I visited this restaurant. I went after night class one night. I've gone over to other restaurants on Baldwin street so many times but I just hadn't gotten the chance to come here. I would definitely recommend it, even if you're not vegetarian. It's an interesting experience for non-vegetarians and it's awesome if you're vegetarian! There are wheat free and gluten free options as well, which is awesome.  I had a difficult time deciding what to order since everything sounded so good. In the end, I had their feature dish for the night which was an asian style flat noodle dish with some spice and ginger. I'm not a huge fan of strong flavours of ginger, but it was surprisingly good. As a vegetarian, I love anything soy. This dish had tempeh instead, which I haven't had much of. Loved it. Definitely going to keep that in mind for my own cooking.  I also had the ice cream which was amazing. Definitely recommend this. If I recall correctly, it may have been dairy free too.   The atmosphere is also great. It's a cozy little restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to admit when my friends suggested this place as a dinner option, I was a little hesitant because I'm not vegetarian and I was really in the mood for a hearty meal. My expectations were exceeded and the food really was great. They have some interesting drink options as well. The place was packed which obviously speaks to how great the food is."}
{"text":"Food is plain with very little flavour. Salt and hot sauce did nada. Not worth the price. My friends and I got the Miso soup, Moroccan  Pad Thai and mushroom clay pot dish. The Miso soup was watered down. The pad Thai was plain with spices that did not complement each other! The clay pot was not bad. Nonetheless, not worth the price! As a vegetarian, I was very excited to go to this place because the ratings were great."}
{"text":"Literally a vegetarian'a dream come true! Every dish on the menu is great. All the ingredients used are fresh and healthy and my personal favourite are the veggie drumsticks as an appetizer. The service is fantastic. Love it and I keep going back :)"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there. The curry pad thai was superb, vegetables ingridients tasted fresh and well-cooked, and I loved the selection of herbs and spices that complimented the veggies --- the flavours were brought out to a maximum without disrupting the food's natural taste. The service was warm, quick and friendly except for the brief time when the waitress got too busy with the regulars. The decor was mediocre but the enviornment was nice enough, and they provided Lush hand lotion outside the washrooms, a pleasant surprise. I would definetly come back and bring friends."}
{"text":"I had a difficulty time choosing from their menu of numerous delicious-sounding dinner options, but I went with the Spicy Coconut Curry Seitan Bread Bowl and was delighted. My co-diner had the special for the evening, which was a bean loaf with noodles and a salad. Blueberry cheesecake was the dessert of choice. Nice diversity of veggies, complex flavours and well-considered portion sizes (not too big, not too small). The vegan cheesecake was exquisite."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Recommend the fresh garden rolls & Dumplings. I had the seafood clay pot which I enjoyed- however, if the special is tofu skin rolls I highly recommend that. Lots of variety for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Very good food, loved the mushrooms especially and got drunk on the beet juice :). Place with a very happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourites in Toronto for veg. I've never ordered a bad dish off this menu. The shanghai noodles are probably my favourite - very flavourful and filling. The dessert is great too. I always get the blueberry cheesecake - delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I feel about this place. I'm a first time visitor, so perhaps I need to return to try some other dishes.   The food was nothing to write home about; very typical Asian and some Moroccan flavoring. Also, I understand everything is vegan, but why are there so many veggies in all the dishes to the point that there is an imbalance between veg and starch/soy/seitan?   The service here is calm and relaxed. Servers check in on you at perfect intervals, while water refills are so consistent that you will never lift an empty glass for a sip. They explain every facet of dishes, should you require it, and are willing to make accommodations for allergies.   For the vegan/vegetarian, this is a great find, but otherwise you might be quite underwhelmed. I hate giving low ratings, so I hope to return to find out if I will be more impressed by one of their salads or wraps. (Or juices! They seem to have really the most incredible juices and smoothies, but I was too full to try one... totally regretting it now.)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My favorite dish is the Shanghai noodles. It is soooo good! It's a go-to place for delicious vegetarian food. Baldwin is such a cute street too :)"}
{"text":"Rediscovered this restaurant recently and wondered how it ever left my radar.  The featured meal (displayed on a table) was ordered and fabulous...did not miss the meat at all.  The servers were super upbeat, funny and provided great recommendations.  Had to wait a bit for a table but a dialogue about seitan with the server helped pass the time.  Sometimes my eyes are bigger than my stomach but this time finished the meal with a smile."}
{"text":"I debated whether or not to let the secret out about this place, but i have to give this restaurant the 5-star review it deserves! An amazing menu that uses only the freshest and healthiest ingredients. I order something different every time i go and i have never been let down! From their wraps and soup to their sizzling skillets and noodle dishes. Absolutely delicious. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Perfect lunch at Vegetarian Haven with friends. The lovely patio on tree-lined Baldwin St makes you forget the hot weather and the busy city. Service was quick and friendly. I had the avocado wrap, classic but very good (especially the salad dressing) vegetarian fare. My friend loved her Buddha's Delight. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A must try! The food was excellent and the service was top notch! The tempura, dumplings, and avo rolls were dynamite! Edamame could have use more sea salt. The spicy coconut curry eggplant hot plate was absolutely delicious!! Very creative ingredients, beautifully presented, fresh and wonderfully flavourful! Only one suggestion: more desserts made in house would have been appreciated. With vegan ice cream being so easy to make, why use processed tofutti brand?"}
{"text":"The owner was really nice to me. And we ordered lunch special.  The portion are really good. I did enjoy the soup.  The course is more like combined with chinese food & viet food"}
{"text":"Food is 4.5/5, service is a 2.5/5.  I went on Saturday and it was half packed, so there was no problem getting a seat without reservations. Not sure if they are usually extremely packed on Saturday. I ordered  Sizzling Eggplant Tempeh in Spicy Coconut Curry, and the person I was with  Singapore Seitan. Both were very delicious and left me quite fool ( a bit too spicy for me to get again though).   My only issue was the service which will probably prevent me from going again. The servers although energetic just constantly bother you every few minutes with questions and see OVER enthusiastic about the place which can become quite irritating when someone recommends and pushes you to get a bunch of desserts you said no to multiple times.  The bill came up too a bit more than anticipated but we still managed to leave a 10% tip, since there service was quite annoying to be honest. And yes I know not leaving at least 15% is disappointing but after how annoying those servers were they were lucky to have received any. But of course they decided to push some moral monologue about how it's not enough tip and we should leave more and if we weren't from around here and didn't know how things work, and kept forcing to leave more. Frankly I was happy after that that I did not leave giving them any more and was happy to finally leave.  servers are super annoying and ruined the whole experience for me."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's best vegan restaurants, with a distinctly Chinese/Asian bent. Delightful sidewalk patio during the warm weather. Homemade desserts. Vegan cuisine doesn't get much better in Toronto."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've had amazing vegetarian food eating out as a non-vegetarian (other was Zen Garden). Vegetarian friends liked it but my brother (also non-veg) didn't like his order (some kind of soup I think). The pad Thai was awesome for me. Staff were incredibly enthusiastic too."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Haven is a great and accommodating option for vegans, vegetarians and those following a gluten-free diet. It's a treat to have an entirely vegetarian menu, but my non-vegetarian friend also found the options equally enticing.   We sat on the Baldwin street patio, which is lovely on a summer night. Be forewarned, they do not serve alcohol, so be prepared to swap that glass of wine for an iced mint tea (which was fine with me.)   The menu had a variety of plausible options available, but we decided on sharing the Bird's Nest (seitan nuggets, vegetables sautéed in a sweet and spicy Szechuan sauce, served on crispy sweet potato noodles) and the kale quinoa seaweed salad. Both were good, with subtle notes of unique spices. I really enjoyed the salad, though it was something I could easily make at home. The seitan aspect of the Bird's Nest was delicious. Aside from being a bit overly sauced for my taste, I loved the amount and diversity of the vegetables and especially the vegetable to noodle/rice ratio, which was perfect!   The flavours were asian-meets-moroccan-inspired, but Vegetarian Haven surpasses the typical veggie stir fry you would get in China town. I will definitely come back to try more of the extensive menu. Nestled beside the Vegetarian Association, it's great to have a little haven in the city that caters to the needs of people with alternative diets."}
{"text":"Never mind vegetarian, the food is delicious by any standard. There were 3 of us for dinner and all 3 dishes were tasty and well-presented. Our two servers were charming and attentive. The meal was too filling for dessert but next time I might split an entree and go for an appetizer and dessert."}
{"text":"Boring and bland are not part of Vegetarian Haven's vocabulary.   The Sizzling Eggplant Tempeh Spicy Coconut Curry was like party-in-my-mouth good.  This wheat-free dish commands your attention from the moment it entered the room, the sizzling sound, the enticing aroma from the spices and the overall presentation of the dish ... oh man ...  I'm hungry thinking about it (and I'm a carnivore!).  After one bite, I instantly became a fan of this zesty dish.  Eggplant was perfectly cooked.  Loved the texture of tempeh, especially pieces that were soaked with curry.  The service that evening was stellar.  The waitress was lively, knowledgable, personable and funny!"}
{"text":"Many people recommended me to try Vegetarian Haven, I finally made it there last week.     I shared the lunch special combo with my frd: Stuffed phyllo pastry with side green salad, avocado/mango salad and stir-fried flat rice noodles + soup of the day (squash vegetable soup).  The stuffings in the phyllo pastry was quite interesting, there were some celery/shredded carrots and tofu, it somewhat reminds me of turkey stuffings.  Soup was quite yummy as well, they didn't completely blend the squash, it's kinda nice to have some squash chunks.    We also finished our meal with their vanilla cheesecake and a ginger almond milk.  The cheesecake was well presented and it was quite light and smooth.  The ginger almond milk was great too, love the ginger kick.  Enjoyed my meal there and would love to go back, but I guess... I ended up spending $ 18 for lunch... that seems a bit much..."}
{"text":"This place is vastly over-rated. As a vegetarian of 30 plus years I've had lots of vegetarian food. The \"warm\" Kale salad was room temperature and I didn't eat even a third of it. Thinking it was just me, I brought it home for my husband - he didn't like it either. Regarding desert, I didn't like the apple fritter and neither did he! Will not return"}
{"text":"This place is good! Had the chickpea wrap the first time- amazing! Full of flavour and spices. Second time I had the dumpling noodle bowl. Also very good!! The dumplings were delicious. Portions are also good here. Not too little, but not ridiculous. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Will highly recommend this place. Flavorful food Atisa- the hostess- is amazing. She made our time there extra special"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy, feel-good food. Creative creations and twists on traditional veggie  Only thing...... GET A LIQUOR LICENSE! (No alcohol... Maybe for the best. Keeps it THAT much more healthy)  * great servers ** they take reservations *** they have a patio"}
{"text":"Great staff. Great healthy food. All vegetarian of course. The food is very simple and has an Asian influence. Good place for a first date. Tried a tempeh steak. It was better than most"}
{"text":"A tad pricey, but well worth it for the excellent service, quality of food, and environment.  If you're into vegan, this is definitely the place for you. I've been here twice, and their service is so speedy, that as you're putting down the lid of your clay pot, it'll literally disappear from your hand before it reaches the table (true story).  I love mushrooms, and the fact that most meals there include mushrooms makes me insanely happy. I'm not normally a vegan/vegetarian, but I don't miss the meat when I go there at all, as they do an amazing job at having subs for the food.  All-in-all, I'd definitely return there many more times :-)"}
{"text":"Great FOOD! Was so glad that we visited Vegetarian Haven."}
{"text":"One of the best places.  The service was amazing, the food was amazing.  I wanted to order everything. I asked the server who gave me some recommendations and I was NOT disappointed.  I can't wait to go back! Everything looked soo good!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. However, both times I've been here I was met with very sub-par meals with weird flavours or no flavour at all. The first time I went here I had the seafood clay pot and it was just very weird and almost inedible. I haven't had seafood in years so maybe I just forgot how fishy real seafood tastes. My boyfriends meal, the special, was just okay. Our appetizer, however, was great (dumplings).  We decided to give the restaurant another chance. On our second visit, I got the Miso Dumpling Souper bowl and my boyfriend got the Bird's Nest. My Souper Bowl was very bland and basically just tasted like mushrooms. I had to add lots of soy sauce and hot sauce in order eat it, and even then I didn't have any desire to eat all of it. My boyfriend's meal, again, was just \"meh\"-- the seitan was good but the sauce that everything was in was lacking depth in flavour. We ordered dessert and it was very good-- particularly the almond bark ice cream. We also found the service to be very slow. Overall, I will not be returning or recommending this to my friends-- there are plenty of better vegan restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I was at Vegetarian Haven this week for dinner with my SO and his sister.  This is my first vegetarian restaurant experience (south indian restaurants are not included in this grouping).  I have never been one to speak out vegetarian restaurants but since my SO's sister is a vegetarian I was up for trying something different.  When you first walk in, our server presented to us their bistro special.  I was sold at hello, it looked delicious!  They have a great deal for under $17 a two course dinner.  They had a hearty lentil and tomato soup that I could not say no too.  The meal was outstanding, not only did it looked delicious but it tasted delicious as well!  I was quite full after the two courses.  My SO's sister was craving something sweet after dinner and she had decided on their blueberry cheesecake.  Note: all their desserts are vegan.  I was a bit skeptical on a vegan cheesecake but it was surprisingly good.  It was light and had a mousse-type of texture.  It was a pleasant way to end the great meal.  Service was great, they are super friendly and have great recommendations if you are undecided on what you want to eat.  For the three of us, the bill was under $60!  I will definitely be back to try out other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Amazing, friendly service (they accommodated the 5 of us last minute with no reservation, checked up on us a lot even though the restaurant was packed and the food came quickly) and amaaaaaazing food; there's so much variety and flavours and my carnivore friends really enjoyed it too!! a definite recommendation, I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with a very nice front patio, the incense inside was an odd choice of scent but it didn't bother me as much as it did my girlfriend. We were seated promptly and served. I got the dumplings and the Buddha's Delight, my girlfriend the Shanghai Noodles. Both entrées were very tasty and well put together. The dumplings were good but a little on the bland side, but a very nice light appetiser. All in all a very pleasant experience and I will be returning."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing! Wonderful food, delicious & creative, flavorful & filling. Fantastic staff, nice atmosphere, definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to vegetarian haven since i graduated from school 2 years ago so sorry that my review is of when i went there long ago. However, when i was there i loved the food, the huge menu selection, the wonderful atmosphere and friendly service. I hope to get back there again soon.... it's just a little far from where i live now."}
{"text":"The tofu drumsticks were delicious but like the rest of the menu, a little pricey ($8 for 2 small ones). The restaurant was very crowded and the seating was uncomfortable. The staff was in a rush to get us out and asked us to leave after our meal because they wanted the table."}
{"text":"If you have a party of vegans and non-vegans this is the place for you as it has something for everyone.   When we came in the patio was welcoming and the server was very helpful in bringing us a sample plate of the day's special which helped me decide. Having experience with only Chinese style vegetarian fare before, the menu covers both the classics that I've seen before like Singapore style noodles and Korean jaep chae to Canadian fare like warm kale salad with seitan (made in house btw) and a stir fry in a crispy rice bowl.   Service was excellent and the server convinced us to try the 'shrimp' tempura appetizer made with springy konyaku and huge oyster mushrooms. Delicious!  For dessert we had the tofu ice cream with carab chips that tasted like milk chocolate. It was both flavorful and light at the same time.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get into vegan fare."}
{"text":"I'm only a part-time vegetarian (i.e. I usually eat meat, but sometimes I'll skip it).  I think I would be more of a vegetarian if I knew how to do it healthily.  I wanted to steal the menu at Vegetarian Haven for just this reason.  There's a handy glossary at the back of the menu that lists all the meat substitutes, what's actually in them and what nutrients you get from each of them.  So useful!  I started with a mango smoothie, which ended up coming with strawberries and a banana too - bonus!  Then we chose the avocado rolls for our starter.  I love avocado so I knew I would love these.  Very refreshing!  For my main I went with the Sizzling Egglant Tempeh in Coconut Curry with Purple Rice (13.95).  So yummy!  I was worried that the Tempeh would have a weird texture or bad taste, but the way they cooked it was perfect.  Great flavour and sauce.  Delicious food, excellent service.  Also, we went here partly because they have great hours. Open until 10pm (for people like me who don't think about dinner until 9:30)."}
{"text":"Vegetarian with a menu full of fake meat. I'm all for fake meat, but don't just shape some balls of vegetable protein into different animals and call it a day. I could hardly eat my \"seafood\" dish. Maybe it looks too real? But the texture and flavor were all the same. Vaguely fishy, but it was the texture that made me gag. As others have said if it's Buddist Veg, there isn't any garlic or onion. I can't tell you what was missing, but I've been there one other time for 'ham' and pineapple dish that also lacked any particular taste."}
{"text":"I think eating healthy is an acquired taste ...  I am not used to this type of cuisine but I really want to like it.    So, I ordered the quinoa and kelp salad with tempeh on the side.  When it first came out I thought \"how is this going to fill me up?\"  Well, surprisingly, it kept me full all throughout the night.  I did not even require a snack before bedtime .... which surprised and delighted me since I am trying to cut back on my snacking.    The salad itself was a little too sour and weird tasting ... but I give it points because it is healthy and kept me full (which must mean it is packed with nutrients my body needs - otherwise my body would have told me it was hungry, right?)  My husband ordered the avocado salad ... this too was a little weird tasting to me ...   Our friend ordered one of the noodle dishes and this was definitely much better than our salads.  It was spicy and it was yummy ... I wish I had ordered this instead.  We also ordered special drinks ... well, probably not going to order them again.  They were a little warm and thick - in other words, not refreshing.  Gave some to my little boy and his expression was classic.    And it may seem weird that I am giving this place 4 stars based on my review but I really do think it is because my palate is not geared towards healthier alternatives that I wasn't able to fully enjoy my meal.  But, eating here made me reflect on my diet - in a positive way.  I do want to incorporate more kelp and quinoa into my diet.  I do want my son to be able to drink healthy - cholesterol busting, liver cleansing, kidney detoxing drinks without making a face ....   So, hopefully we will eat here again and become healthier for it.  By the way, service was incredibly friendly and wonderful :)"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a rainy Saturday night...  Service: 5/5 -- everyone was so enthusiastic and very friendly  Food: a tad bit $$$ I would have to agree with the other reviews that many of the items on the menu are some variation of veggie stir-fry.   Got the special of the day + soup: $20.99 -- was very interesting. Not my fav dish. 4/5  Birds nest $18.99 : the seitan was delicious! 5/5  Although we didnt try, they make their own drinks!   I would recommend trying the food at least once esp if vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Best vegan meal I've had in a long time. Beautiful dishes made with fresh, nourishing ingredients. My only regret is having to leave the city before having another meal here."}
{"text":"This restaurant was DELICIOUS. My two friends and I cleaned our plates and even got dessert. The food is flavourful and delicious. I recommend the Buddha Delight and the Spicy Eggplant!  Atmosphere is cozy and welcoming and the patio will be an absolute treat when the weather warms up. For the quality of food, the price is good and I was more then stuffed when we finished."}
{"text":"I ordered the Moroccan wrap which was delicious! The service was great. We went for lunch during a weekday workday and they were quick and efficient and the food was also very well prepared and presented. Although I'm not a vegetarian, I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase - this place doesn't mess around with their desserts. Cake smoothies? Cookie smoothies? PIE SMOOTHIES? Oh be still my slowly becoming diabetic heart. If you're after something a little more traditional, they do stock the aforementioned treats (mostly Sweets of the Earth creations as far as I can tell) sans smoothie, as well as some other lovely in-house treats like apple fritters (take a deep breath in when these arrive at your table, it's like inhaling an apple pie).   Now i've got the afters out of the way, let me address the 'fores. There's always a daily chef's special and soup of the day - these always look fantastic and the staff really sell them. On more than one occasion they've lured me away from the set menu with their wiles. Appetisers lean toward a dim sum offering, with selections like dumplings, tempura, fresh rice paper rolls and - my favourite - crispy, savoury tofu drumsticks.  Mains have changed somewhat in 2010 at Veg Haven - the focus has shifted more toward asian (or asian-inspired) dishes (apart from, perhaps, the salads). Hearty tofu clay pot stews, stir-fried noodle dishes, sizzling seitan plates and a couple of curries. I miss the seitan burger, but there's still enough appeal that it takes me forever to decide what I want. And hopefully leave room for the desserts mentioned above!   The restaurant itself is clean and relaxed, the decor is classy without being overwhelmingly upmarket, and the patio affords a nice view of the lovely Baldwin street area. At just a short stroll away from the AGO, it's worth heading to the area to enjoy the relaxed vibe and sit out on Veg Haven's patio for some delicious eats.  Apart from the dining and food experience, Vegetarian Haven are supporters of Toronto's vegetarian community - Toronto Vegetarian Association is situated upstairs, and if you scan the noticeboard near the washrooms you'll see evidence of their continued contributions to animal charities. It's lovely to see that the owners have their heart in providing a cruelty-free environment and experience for diners."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! They make vegan food that would appeal to any palate. I also liked that they offer the option of non-soy meat alternatives like seitan if you're sensitive to soy, like I am. (There's a minimal extra charge for that.) Very pleasant service, but also very popular. Arrive early if you don't have a reservation, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious vegetarian food I've had yet!  This is my third time dining in at Vegetarian Haven. I've had several of their seitan dishes and their tofu ice cream and they have been delicious every time! The waitresses are courteous, conversational, and nice. They have their dinner special on display, which is nice to see before you order it.   It's on the more pricey end of what I usually go for, but it's worth it. There's a classy ambience and they're not stuffy."}
{"text":"A fantastic vegan restaurant in the city. I sometimes forget about Baldwin Village despite the fact that it is so close to U of T. A lovely little spot with a cute patio. They take reservations as well, which is nice.  I ordered the Spicy Bali Noodles and they were delicious. Good portion sizes. No fancy plating, but good food on a plate (or bowl in my case). The noodles were actually pretty spicy, I might ask for a milder version next time. Filled with veggies (tomato, zucchini, broccoli, carrots), and topped with temphe. Yum!  I ordered their special drink of the day which was a lime slush. Basically a whole (peeled) lime blended with ice and sugar. It was delicious and tart! However I was disappointed at the price. They were $6.50 each, which I felt was a little high for a single lime and ice (I watched them make it). Especially since they didn't tell us the price of it when we ordered it. Still my whole meal came to about $24 with tax and tip, which isn't horrible."}
{"text":"I went with my sister and we had such a lovely meal!  I'm a vegan and my sister is not even vegetarian BUT she is open to trying new things so I love taking her to vegan restaurants :)  She lives close by and had been saying that she wanted to try it for a while.  I had the Shangai noodles which were delicious.  She had the special, unsure what it was, some tempura, some kale, some noodles, she loved the sauce (it had pineapple in it which I'm not fond of so I declined that).  Both our meals were just amazing!  Oh and we had tofu drumsticks which my sister found AMAZING.  Some places are incredible with tofu and some are terrible, this is definitely one of the ones that had good tofu.  I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"yeeeeesh.  I have had two exceptionally bad experiences here...    the food was alright enough the last time so I wanted to go again.  It was the customer service that hinders the atmosphere and made the meal have a sour taste. I went twice and I am the kind of person to give people a second chance (but not food!).  The first was a year ago and I can't remember the reason why but I do remember the servers were uninterested and sarcastic and made you feel guilty for making requests.  She was also snippy with my boyfriend.  And our wait time was exceptionally long. The second time was hardly different from the first.  Except worse.  All I asked for was salad and I wanted to know my options for the dressings.  First, the server didn't know the dressing selection (odd, as she was the server we had LAST time a year ago.. but forgivable).  Second, she conversed with the woman who OWNS the restaurant about it bickering back and forth RIGHT BEHIND ME about my order and other customers... then came back and still didn't have the options but said \"it's like tahini... but it's not tahini, so don't take my word on that\"  OK? I'll take that one.   So our appetizer shows up 20 minutes later... steamed edamame... takes like 5 minutes or less typically but I'm fine with a 20 minute wait as they were half full/busy.  Then my salad makes an appearance: warm kale salad.  Beautiful.  But no dressing.  I tell the waitress, she gets the woman who runs the operation and bickers with her behind me and then ...  owner comes over and says \"No there's definitely dressing on it.  It's there. \" After explaining politely that it in fact isn't (because I know people make mistakes) she huffs and goes \"I'll take it back and see what they can do\".  She brings out a side plate of dressing and  says \"so you wanted it on the side?\"  I said no, she went back and bickered again with other employees and then took it back and \"fixed it\".  Brought it back out and my salad is now less than luke warm.  It was bad.  The food here is interesting and has not 100% classically predictable gluten free options.  Which is why I've fooled myself into going here twice.  The service is terrible.  Would've been happy with a smile from an employee than a guilt trip for asking if I can have a different salad dressing/have salad dressing at all.     Service is a no no here.  I wish I had better things to say about it."}
{"text":"Incredible! If I could give this place 6 stars, I would.  I must admit that I am a vegetarian & do love my veggies, but this place is great. The food is consistently good, and the staff are beyond welcoming. The first time I came in here I was actually taken back by how sweet the waitress was! The tofu drumsticks are out of this world good, as is the miso soup starter. They have a great vegan pad thai, and wide variety of vegan desserts. I highly, highly recommend this place. Also: if you are new to veggie cuisine, don't be afraid to ask questions. I've overheard other patrons asking for definitions of certain food items. and the staff have always been happy to answer (what an eavesdropper! lol)."}
{"text":"Great food with friendly staff set the mood for a perfect meal."}
{"text":"awesome  went here for my 30th bday with my mom and gf  we ordered the squash feature with rice noodles and veggies, miso soup, spring rolls, edamame, and avocado salad , carrot cake and ginger ice cream, we split everything and it was all DELICIOUS!!!   service was great- and one of the waitresses (cute chick with fun glasses) sat down and gave us a list of like 25 places to choose from to check out based on what stuff we said we liked to do. and we did go to a handful of them and she was dead-on - they were all fun - so thanks for that.   we had a curly haired waitress and a male waiter both who where super informative and knowledgable about the food.   it was warm and cosy and we sat in the window area- it was nice and private. I could tell a lot of the people were regulars and everyone seemed like they we sorta \"family\" atmosphere- you could feel the warmth and luv! will definitely go back if i am in toronto"}
{"text":"This place has a huge menu of tasty and healthy food.   However, I feel like the food at Vegetarian Haven has gone down hill over the last year or two. It seems a lot more hit or miss, even on the same dish from one visit to the next.   The focus on service has also gone down... it used to be excellent but lately the servers seem distracted and abrupt.  When the food is good, though, it's good! The menu is huge so it offers a lot of choice.  Probably not the best place to take your meat-eater friends to."}
{"text":"This is honestly my fave vegetarian place in the city. I have yet to have one thing on the menu that was anything but delicious and again like other reviewers have mentioned the deserts are to die for.   Highlights: The wonton soup, Avocado Salad, and Fried Banana desert.  I took my dad who is a non vegetarian here for dinner last night and he really enjoyed it. In fact I have taken many non-vegetarians here and they really enjoyed their food. I also have found the service excellent every time I have ever been here. This is just an all around excellent restaurant that I suggest you check out vegetarian or not.  SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT!  Just remember: There is no alcohol here. But they serve my fave lemonade ever Santa Cruz organic!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I returned to vegetarian Haven and had the avocado hand rolls (called something else) and the spicy coconut curry bread bowl. My friend and I had an appetizer each and split the main course. This was enough for both of us to be satiated.   Both dishes were yummy. The menu looked amazing and I can't wait to return and try more!     Previous review:   I want to start off by saying that I only had 2 dishes at Vegetarian Haven and I want to return, try more things, and hopefully update this review.  I went to Vegetarian Haven on Wednesday. My friend and I got the last table on the patio.  The host was slightly rude when we asked for it.   We shared: summer rolls that had avocado and were fresh and amazing (A five star appetizer)  The spicy coconut seafood bowl - this was ok. It wasn't as coconutty as I had hoped and there was one flavour that just didn't work in the dish. It may have been fennel...  The \"salmon\" and \"prawn\" in this dish were unimpressive. Both tasted like soy. Perhaps more seaweed would have made them more convincing.   Also, I am not a vegetarian but I love vegetarian food."}
{"text":"I went to Vegetarian Haven for the first and last time on Valentine's Day. It was by far the worst vegetarian food I've ever had. The food was cold, textures were off and the flavours were also unappealing. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This is the best vegetarian restaurant I have been to in Toronto. It makes good Thai food and doesn't try too hard to make everything taste like meat. It is much better than Fresh, which I never thought was very good."}
{"text":"Amazing medley of flavors. Superb soup of the day. The care and Love they put into the food is astounding."}
{"text":"Slightly theatrical .. no gastronomy here .. a camouflage of words for ingredients .. you're not quite sure what you're putting in your body .. perhaps an agreeable experience .. once didn't hurt .. i'll leave it there .. the part that disturbs me a little is how sometimes the market takes advantage on people's vulnerability , in this case the vegans' .. no doubt in my mind the supply side of the market in Toronto will catch up .. there are wonderful vegan recipes out there .. just a matter of time .. i am somewhat deceived .. likable staff ..  acceptable overall cleanliness  definitely overpriced"}
{"text":"Had a amazing and impressive dinner in this place. Food here tastes very Asian style. They have different daily special everyday and the servers will kindly introduce their daily special.  Would definitely recommend to vegetarians and ppl who like Asian flavor"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Every dish we had was fantastic. Staff was friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best vegan eateries in Toronto. The menu is expansive yet sophisticated. I've tried almost all their mains and they are all incredible. They always have a daily special, too, so you never get bored of the selection. The desserts are plentiful also. Sundaes, cakes, banana splits, cookies, pies...mostly Sweets From the Earth stuff but with their own flair. I love their sundaes made with warmed up brownies and Tofutti ice cream. Great place for a date, birthday/anniversary dinner, or just a treat. The interior is cozy with nice art and exposed brick walls. Service is good, make a reservation for dinner especially on week-ends."}
{"text":"Loved it!  With a party of six, I had a chance to sample much of the menu and nothing was less than very good with many things best described as exceptionally good. It's a bit crowded and the decor is pretty humble, but it's comfortable and inviting and the food is inventive and very well prepared.  These people know there stuff.  As others have mentioned, it ain't the cheapest meal, but if you can ignore that, you'll enjoy it very much."}
{"text":"I had such a great time here! And the food was so flavourful and tasty. I went wth a friend of mine and we tried the dumplings and miso soup to start. Both were authentic and vegan at the same time. Which is something that's hard to find. Then we had the spicy flat noodles and the stone bowl mushroom tofu rice. Both were great and I suggest you try anything, just beware of how spicy things can be. My dish was the perfect amount of spice for me, but I can tell for some people it might be too much.   Other than the food, the environment is great and the waitresses were super helpful and friendly. If you're new to vegan food they're very informative when it comes to what ingredients they use and what their specials are.   Overall was a great visit and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ok for vegan food. Server was snippy when i asked if there was dairy. Generous portions, but boring. Too much salt, spice or just plain bland. Tofu ice cream was good, but it's just tofutti. And it's not healthy, more fat, sugar and less protein than it's milky cousin. Nice try... Was busy, had to wait over 30m for a table, not really worth the wait."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. The meal, was delicious, flavourful and tasty. Friendly, helpful staff,  the location was charming. Best vegetarian experience. For dessert, a warm brownie, with chocolate covered almond ice-cream. Mmmmmm! that was delicious - The chef is amazing!  I'm definitely coming back here when I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic restaurant. Friendly staff, amazing food, great atmosphere. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I absolutely loved the food, but some of my meat eating friends strongly disagreed. If you don't like vegetables or 'healthy' foods in general, this probably isn't the place for you. I wouldn't say this place is completely healthy with all the oil added, but there is quite a bit of vegetables (which I loved!!)  The servers were very nice always asking if we were doing okay, but they charged us 18% service tax which was pretty unbelievable if you ask me. My mediocre-sized dish of noodles cost me $20. Definitely on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday evening with a friend. We're meatlovers through and through but wanted to try something different. And I'm glad we did! Just an FYI, Vegetarian Haven is a bit of a misnomer...it's actually a vegan restaurant. Nothing wrong with that but I do want to put it out there if you're the kind of person who likes cheese on everything (like me).  Quick take: - small restaurant - great & knowledgeable service - good menu selection - $$ - great and filling food - would definitely go back  One of the things I liked about their menu was in the back it explained some of the items on the menu. Being a vegan restaurant they use substitutes for meat such as this thing called seitan which I had never before heard of in my life but kept seeing it in multiple dishes and was like what the heck is this thing. Turned a few pages over and they had an explanation of a variety of items that non-vegans or non-vegetarians like myself may not be familiar with which was super handy.  Our server was awesome. I was debating between getting an appetizer and a main dish and the server instead of pushing me to get both when I asked her how big/filling they were said I would be fine with the just the main that I wanted which was the Bird's Nest. And I was! I couldn't finish it actually. It was chock full of vegetables, tofu and seitan and the sauce was this spicy sweet flavour with these crunchy noodles. It was delicious! The seitan was really yummy, I've since learned it's a pretty common mock meat. I'm not usually a huge fan of tofu, but I liked the way they did it. To drink I had some ginger tea, which wasn't some packaged thing but literally shavings of ginger steeped in water. I love ginger so it worked for me, but if you're expecting a teabag, you have been warned!  I will admit the decor is nothing to write home about, but in a place like this I prioritize food quality and service more, especially at this price point. With that said, food quality was fantastic! Which I'm sure is the reason why on a Wednesday evening the restaurant was steadily busy.  So if you want to try out some great vegan food, come here!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and I find that the food is average and overpriced for what it is.  On my last visit here, I ordered the special of the day with soup. The soup was borscht and kind of tasted like canned tomato soup with more fillings. The special of the day was grilled tofu steaks with tomato and pepper tempuras, noodles, and a salad with ginger sesame dressing. The noodles and tempuras were nice. The tofu was grilled to the point that it tasted burnt and it didn't have much flavour.   I tried some of the dishes my friends ordered too. The eggplant tempeh dish was the best in terms of flavour and texture of the tempeh. The soy protein in the bali noodle dish had such an odd taste, I wouldn't order this if I came again. I also tried the buddha's delight which was a bunch of veggies and seitan in sauce. The seitan had a nice chewiness to it, but I didn't find the flavours were anything special.  Most of the entrees here are close to $20. A lot of the desserts are close to or over $10. I find this to be pretty pricey for vegetarian asian food, considering chinatown has tons of vegetarian options for less than half the price."}
{"text":"Really good food. Lots of flavor and variety. When they say spicy they mean it, not that it was too hot but it had the right balance. Atmosphere was nice, playing some Jill Scott which was cool for me. There's lots I'm going to back and try. It was a little pricey though, but good quality so worth it"}
{"text":"We ordered \"Seafood\" in clay pot and chefs special. The seafood special is very good! The purple rice at the bottom is soaked in all the flavours and juice from the veggies on the top. Yum yum. Servers are also amazing.   Come on a summer evening and patio is nice!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I was honestly blown away. INCREDIBLE, high quality vegan-meats, and the best vegan cakes I've ever had! The Matcha Green Tea Smoothie is so good, and so is their Seafood Clay Pot Bowl. Their vegan seafood and meat is so flavourful, moist, and tender! All of the cakes are made with tofu, and they are so rich and honestly better than the real thing. The portions are filling, and all the dishes are flavourful but not salty at all. This place is booming, and it's pretty hard to get a table from 6 - 9! Make a reservation or get there early! The staff are all so sweet, friendly and courteous. The food comes really fast too - 10 mins tops! This is not a place to miss, and will satisfy all vegans or carnivores."}
{"text":"You just feel great and healthy walking out from this restaurant. Now, I love including meat in my diet, but Vegetarian Haven makes vegetarian/vegan diets look  good! I was sort of dragged there by my roommate and I was very pleasently surprised from the variety in the menu to the super healthy (and tasty) drink options. I always get the \"Souper Bowls\" which are basically large bowls of soup filled with all sorts of stuff. I always get one that has \"fake\" or tofu meat in them and the \"meat\" tastes great!  I always thought that the people working there might see the meat eater in me and just shun me away, but that didn't happen, and far from it! They were very friendly and helpful when it came to deciding what to get. Our server also recalled that the last time my roommate had dined there she asked for no mushrooms in her soup, and we were both impressed with that!   They have a daily special and if I was not so in love with the souper bowls, almost every daily special I've seen looks amazing. I hear their wraps are very delightful as well!    In recent times, every time I've wanted to come here they've been closed, so I just wish they had longer hours of operation."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. Cute spot on Baldwin not far from the Art Gallery. Our service was impeccable. They allowed us to change tables 2 times to accommodate me and a friend who had to work on our resumes while we ate (we had laptops and papers spread out and needed a table for 4 instead of 2).   We didn't make reservations but I would advise you to because arriving at this place on a Wednesday evening for 7:30 - it was packed! The patio was packed as well. It was a dainty little patio however inside it was cozy, and kind of a casual-romantic atmosphere.   What I found amazing was that the server brought us a plate of the Chef's Bistro special (beautifully presented) when we were cruising through the menu. I have never been to a restaurant where they show you a plate of the special of the day to show you (visually) what that special looks like and what it is. This persuaded us to choose that off the menu. She did the same with the dessert. The presentation for all the food they brought us was over-the-top amazing. There were moments we would drool when seeing plates of other people's food go past us! A friend of mine is a vegetarian food blogger @romeorajah and they even wrote a brief description of the Bistro Special for him on a piece of paper. Very nice!   Fresh Garden Salad with the Chef's Bistro Special $20.79 value: This looked like a piece of steakbut was actually a lot of vegetables mushheeedd together. Didn't find this to be amazing. It broke a part pretty easily and seemed it like was shaped to stay in place by hand.   SPICY 'SEAFOOD' SOUPER BOWL for $19.49.  - I asked for this to be extra spicy and man did they deliver!! This was a delicious soup with mock shrimps and a variety of vegetable and other ''seafood.'  DESSERT Berries Basil Cheesecake: Hands-down one of the best desserts I've had. Not too sweet yet the texture, taste and mix of fruit was on point!   I just recommended this place to a colleague!"}
{"text":"Came here twice during my trip to Toronto, it was that good. Honestly, this is among the best vegetarian food I've ever had - and my vegetarian partner agrees. The food is largely asian-inspired and during our two visits we had: vegetable dumplings, bird's nest noodles, avocado apple hand rolls, curried noodles, sizzling eggplant, and singapore seitan. Along with the \"famous\" lime smoothie. All amazing. I didn't even think I liked seitan until I tried their version, made in-house. The vibe is cozy, but nice. I'd say it's probably \"advanced\" level vegetarian food, in that if you're not used to eating a meal without meat and you can't handle the idea of tofu or seitan, maybe work your way up to vegetarian haven. I don't mean that as a put-down, just in comparison to some other vegetarian places I've eaten, which focus on things like veggie burgers and meal structures that feel very familiar if you're an omnivore, this wouldn't be the place I take my meat loving friends to convert them. It's the place I'd take my vegetarian/vegan friends to blow their minds."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh vegetables and savory sauces, and beautifully composed imaginative dishes. We got the pan seared dumplings, garden rolls of mango and avocado and cucumber in thin rice paper, and a savory eggplant tempeh curry. And lime slush to wash it all down! If I find myself in town again, I'll come back."}
{"text":"Cute little vegan Asian-inspired joint tucked in Baldwin Village.  I had noticed it last summer while dining on a nearby patio and finally tried it.  The decor is simple with a small patio out front.  Upon arrival, the hostess showed us a display of the chef's special soup and entree.  It was a nice change to be able to see the special as opposed to imagining what it might be based on a description.  Our waitress made an effort to educate us (and I could overhear the same overview being shared with other diners) about the kinds of protein they use.  While I eat a mostly vegetarian diet, I wasn't even familiar with some of their proteins so I appreciated that they explained the menu and the ingredients in their dishes.  We shared the miso dumpling soup, veggie dumplings, Malaysian noodles and tofu & mushroom claypot.  The portions were generous so this was more than enough food for two guests (we did leave with leftovers).  The noodles were too spicy for me but they did warn us.  The claypot was amazing.  The dish stayed warm due to the dish and I loved the rich flavours (tasted like soy and teriyaki).  Even though I was full, I can't leave a vegan establishment without dessert so we shared the almond bark ice cream which was unbelievable.  I can't wait to come back and try more dishes - hopefully next time in a bigger groups so we can try more varieties."}
{"text":"Had the 'curry pad thai'. It was very mediocre (not terrible, but really nothing special), and was pretty expensive. The serving size was good. For reference, I usually eat a vegan diet, so I generally like vegan food."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's cozy, warmly lit and has an extensive menu. Both times I've been there's been something with taro root on the menu and that's an ingredient I wish I could eat every day. The food is tasty and complex but I'm here to talk about the service, which is by far the best of any place I have ever been.   Some background: My husband is a vegetarian with fifty food allergies, many to commonplace vegetarian ingredients like nuts, avocado, coconut flesh, basil, raw vegetables and lentils. It's been an uphill battle to track and understand these allergies, which result in something called allergic esophagitis, but we do all right. Some of his allergies are life-threatening, but the majority just result in pain. Going out to vegetarian restaurants is usually not so great, as the idea of allergies is met with skepticism at best all the way to a waitress laughing in his face. It flabbergasts me because we learned how to feed him healthfully, so I don't appreciate the cracks about \"but what do you eat??\" from people who work with food.  At Vegetarian Haven, we are treated with respect and understanding. They always take down the list, consult with the kitchen and do everything to make sure he can eat his meal safely. We feel cared for and that's all one can really ask of service, isn't it?"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian restaurant in town. I came with an expectation for asian fusion vegetarian food, hoping to please a party with both vegetarians and meat eaters, and this place exceeded all our expectations.  We ordered the following items: - \"King Prawn\" & Oyster Mushroom Tempura - Spicy Singapore Seitan - Spicy Basil Stir-Fried Rice Noodles - \"Seafood\" in Clay Pot - Bird's Nest  We collectively voted the \"Seafood\" in Clay Pot dish as our favourite, however all dishes were great as well!"}
{"text":"Inventive dishes with big flavor. And wonderful service too. Nice patio too."}
{"text":"Lets talk about options, which this place has PLENTY of! I was pleasantly surprised with their menu. I wanted to try samples of everything cause their food descriptions sounded delicious. I ordered the organic kale salad and had a few bites from a friends dish which was the spicy Moroccan noodle. Both equally great.  We found the service very slow which I can handle BUT both of our glasses arrived with lipstick marking - SO. gross!! What does it take to wash glasses by hand?  Nonetheless, the food and atmosphere was excellent!"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian restaurant ever!  Our party had some apps which included king oyster mushrooms, soy drumsticks on a sugar cane, dumplings, and shrimp tempura and cold spring roll.  The \"shrimp\" tempura was delicious and you couldn't even tell it wasn't really shrimp.  I also loved the soy drumsticks as they came on a nice sugar cane like Vietnamese pho places.  As for the other apps, I won't go into much more detail as I loved all of them with the exception of the cold spring roll.  It was quite bland.  However, executing that many apps so well is tough, so I can't expect everything to be perfect.    As for my main, I had the Spicy 'Seafood' Coconut Currylot Soup-er bowl.  OMFG!  I think I am having wet dreams about it.  Jk.  It had noodles, mock shrimp, mock squid, mock salmon and other veggies in a delicious spicy coconut broth.  The best way to describe it is a Tom Khai soup but with all veggies and 10x better.    Verdict: def. going back for a Soup-er bowl."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food here. It's a little pricey but delicious. I also love the fact they don't use garlic or onions in their cooking.  The service has never been great. (maybe it's just me?) While the servers are really nice, and the owner/manager is very friendly, it takes forever to be seated, forever to order, forever to get your food. There are frequent mix-ups, back-and-forth when you ask a question, and seemingly never-ending waiting. I made a reservation once, and pre-ordered my food, only to STILL have to wait outside for exactly 40 minutes. I was so embarrassed to have brought a date there. BUT THE FOOD IS GREAT!!!!!  PS: Jagmeet Singh proposed to his fiancé here! What a kicker."}
{"text":"This nice little Chinese run restaurant is tugged away on the small street of Baldwin, near OCAD and AGO.  Its a very popular spot for local vegetarians and vegans.  Especially those art students and curators.  I would say the restaurant atmosphere is decent, kinda awkward.  There's a chinese water fountain and then french styled furnitures to feel like a cafe.  The lighting is also very stale during lunch, and dimmed during dinner time.  Just a juxtapose of random culture.   As for the food, YUM!  The portions are fairly large.  If you've been here, try to get the special of the day.  For lunch I had a vegan chicken pot pie baked on a small bowl, served with a side of steamed vegetables and wild rice.  The pot pie was so delicious, its got a cheese texture but a complete different aroma.  If you are not too hungry, go ahead and get the \"light lunch\" meal.  Which you get to pick two to three sides.  I highly recommend the pot stickers/dumplings.  Most of the other dishes are like seitan steak with black pepper sauce.  Vegetables with curry.  Very typical Chinese buddhism vegan dishes.  I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a big meal but without paying the high price.  It is also a great place to introduce people to the vegan cuisine."}
{"text":"Very chic and rustic place! Comfortable inside. Great for casual group outings.  Ordered Moroccan Pad Thai..dish wasn't described as it was. Not really spicy, as advertised.  Full of vegetables and beans: very interesting, well made dish (I think some sautéed tofu would do wonders for this dish).  Initial service was great. Took a long time to bring our bills after we were done! Reasonable experience...great place if your into vegetarian and vegan food."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but was trying out some Toronto vegetarian restaurants and found this one on Baldwin St. Cute part of town and the food was very good! I got the soup and chef special and I couldn't complain. Staff were very attentive, explained my options and gave me great advice. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, so I'm rating this against food I'd normally eat and flavours I expect. Both meals tonight were fresh and light (in a good way) but just kinda feel short.   The stir fly (birds nest) was overly sweet and tasted like the sauce cake from a packet. The California rolls were just missing ... something. Needed more flavour, though I loved the crunch. Staff were amazing.   Good location  and nice patio too!"}
{"text":"I was full simply by watching my Yelp Friend flirt with the staff dude. When did she become Vegetarian-friendly all of a sudden? Good thing as that distracts her while I Yelp'd via Little Video Shop Wifi.  The Food did take some length of time to arrive unfortunately even when we're nearly the only ones dining while hoping to make the Yelp event on time.  We were served some really clean looking water.  Yay for reverse osmosis filtration.  Org. Lemon Lime Spritzer($4.00) - Refreshing but ice packed  Bird's Nest w/Purple Rice($13.95) Spicy Bali Stir-fried Rice Noodles($10.99)  Buddhist-style Asian, I'm all too familiar with eating the Seitan growing up.  The execution of the dishes were done well with minimal oil residue.  The Bird's Nest had a sweetness to the sauce that was less popular as we agreed the Spicy Bali Rice Noodles were better overall.  Hard for me not to compare to Chinese Vegetarian food and Chinese restaurant pricing.  In terms of flavour, it doesn't lack.  I just can't help but think the price can be more affordable overall.  It could be that I'm not fully considering the area(Baldwin) and the neighbourhood restaurants(Hua Sang, Wah Sing, Kowloon Dim Sum).  Meat on the brain doesn't make me think/review straight.  Vegetarian Haven seems to do a good job satisfying various demands. Sigh, the price I pay to be healthy."}
{"text":"I really, really want to love this restaurant. Sadly, I'm disappointed every single time. I try to stick to a vegetarian diet so I can eat just about anywhere but I go to this place with my vegan friends to ensure they can get some reasonable food.   The first time I went I got the special. It looked great. It had some salad, some citrus flavored seitan, and a heap of taro puree. I think taro should be illegal, but the other ingrediants outweighed it so I went with it. The citrusy sauce was very flat, it had the citrus note and nothing else. The setain was also way too spongey like it had been boiled at too high of a temperature or braised improperly. I tried my friend's sizzling seitan and the texture was much better.  The second time I've blocked out of my mind for the most part but I got the special again and it also had taro mush. I'm a sucker for punishment.  The third time I got smart and thought maybe the specials are just bits and pieces that have seen better days and I ordered the pad thai off the regular menu. It wasn't offensive but it was incredibly bland and nothing like the pad thai I've had in China Town or even Hamilton or Halifax really (and yes, I know real pad thai isn't vegetarian, but I always get the vegetarian version so that's what I'm comparing). Not impressed again. I actually got the dessert this time though and it was redeeming. I sampled a lot of the desserts around the table and they were good. Thumbs up for that at least.  I'll probably go back, I just wish that their chef would review the recipes, maybe even start from scratch. I know vegan food can be great. There's lot of potential here but a long way to go."}
{"text":"Yay, Vegetarian Haven!  Amongst the many restaurants peppering the Baldwin strip, sits this little beauty.  Stopped in for dinner this evening.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Staff were happy and welcoming - it must be all those veggies!  I ordered the Artichoke, cucumber, and chuck pea salad.  A heaping pile of greens sat nestled in with an assortment of chickpeas, artichoke hearts, cucumber spears, and strips of tempeh, topped with fresh sprouts for good measure.  Dressing was a creamy dill get up, and although maybe a bit too generous, was quite tasty.  This my friends, is what happy times are made of.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"Went here as a new vegan with my husband for dessert as a first time customer. Waited a long time to be seated and waited even longer for the waitress to take our order. It was seriously the longest wait I've ever experienced. The ONLY reason I stayed was because we really wanted dessert and it had go be vegan or else I would've left. By the time the waitress came to us it was only to say \"sorry about the wait I'll be with you in just a minute\". Waited some more because now I've already invested all this time. We ordered desert and it was VERY underwhelming. I had the blueberry pie and I was disappointed with the taste and appearance. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food is extremely flavorful.  They'll have an example dish of the daily lunch special when you walk in and it always looks so good, I end up ordering that more often than not!  The only negative thing about this place, is one of the servers.  She is so over-the-top cheery and loud, that it comes across as disingenuous.  I've noticed other customers look uncomfortable with her, no one knows how to react to her nearly orgasmic attitude.  Maybe she really really likes serving people."}
{"text":"Place has decent food but the service was unsatisfactory. The place was not so great either, no ac just a table fan. Dont go in with high expectations."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. They have a great menu selection and everything we ordered tasted amazing! My party of three came in on Saturday at around 930pm and the kitchen staff stayed opened for us even they were close to closing. Everyone there was super nice and very sweet, knowledgable, giving great suggestions and overall making our experience a better one. Check this place out you won't regret it... I definitely will be coming back.   ps. I'm a huge meat lover and I still loved this place"}
{"text":"A miserable experience. My wife is vegan and thanks to her I've tried dozens and dozens of amazing vegan meals. I know how good it can be when done right.  From long wait to get seated, we had to wait for a long time for the waitress to get our order. After which we waited for a long time to get our food. Seating is cramped and people bump into each other when leaving and/or going to the washroom. We not very loud speakers when eating outside and we had a loud group next to us that made it impossible to have a conversation. Yes, the seats are THAT close to each other. Food was between average and poor. Icing on the cake was lukewarm coffee. Couldn't wait to settle the bill and get out of the place."}
{"text":"Amazing food options and everything is without onion and garlic. Great option for Jain food lovers"}
{"text":"Had another wonderful lunchtime experience with the lunch special (salad or soup of the day + chef's special $19 incl tax). I brought my meat-loving friend here today for the first time and besides dodging a few of the vegetables (e.g. he doesn't like carrots) he was pleasantly surprised by how delicious and filling vegan food can be. Today's soup featured chunky butternut squash and carrot in a coconut milk based broth - if you like root vegetables this is the soup for you! Very warming, filling, and flavorful.   I really liked the chef's special entree - I asked to sub out the rice noodles with extra salad and zucchini noodles. The highlight were the crispy tofu rolls with veggies, taro mash, and tofu \"sausages\" (texture and color were spot on of that of real pork sausages!) in a pineapple sauce yum...  Service was amazing as usual - very frequent water refills and caring check-ups.  Lost 1 star for the value (quite expensive), but some days you just have to splurge on good food and here you can do it totally guilt-free ;)"}
{"text":"It's okay, but not worth the price. The tofu drumsticks are really the only delicious thing on the menu (and they're great).   They do an impressive job of making the food look pretty, but every entree I've had there has been just okay.  If you're looking for Asian vegetarian food, King's Cafe is nearby and much better."}
{"text":"Ohhhmg the food in this place is so scrumptious. I went there on an impromptu dinner date after a long afternoon of studying.   I ordered the matcha latte to start, which was everything I hoped it would be-- smooth, matcha-ey, hot and just the right sweetness. Next was the creamy coconut curry seitan in a bread bowl. I ate the whole thing and even though I was full, my inner glutton wished for another. We finished by sharing the featured \"cheesecake\" which was creamy, tasty and equally amazing as all the rest. I wasn't blown away by the service, but it was busy so understandable and the staff was nice, and that is fine by me.   My relationship with my date turned out to be a flop, but I regret nothing thanks to having discovered this wonderful little haven."}
{"text":"It's nice to try a vegetarian/vegan restaurant once in a while to change things up a bit. Made my way here on Baldwin street with a famished appetite which was shortly satisfied with a hearty and wholesome meal.  They won't be selling you on fancy decor as the place look like it's been kicking for quite some time now but it oozes a sort of zen aura. You will be greeted at the door with a visual display of their daily specials. That's how they sold me on the red pepper & tomato lentil soup.  The menu is Asian inspired and has quite a wide selection from soups & salads to wraps and curries and noodles.   - Spicy Bali stir fry noodles: One of their most popular items and I can see why. Loaded with veggies and rice noodles, this dish is very flavourful with the perfect amount of sauciness and spicy kick. The tempeh is different from other ones I've had with the texture and taste being a mix between fried tofu and taro.  - Seitan in black bean sauce: sizzling on a hot plate, this is the steamy vegetarian take on Chinese style sizzling beef. The star was definitely the seitan which I had no idea what it was but actually tasted quite similar to real meat protein especially with the black bean sauce.  I can't say that I was particularly wowed with the food BUT they know how to spice up the flavours and keep things interesting. I felt like I was introduced to new and unique vegetarian/vegan items which I've never tried before and appreciate - I think that's the key to loving this place. Didn't miss the meat last night!"}
{"text":"I was seated and then had to wait about 10 minutes for a menu..I kept looking for the server..finally the man who seated me came over and I said \"can I have a menu?\" he said he was very embarrassed, so I guess he can be forgiven.  I like that this place has a mix of healthy food (salads etc) and mock meats..My waitress suggested a hot drink of ginger juice with almond milk and cinnamon, I took her suggestion and it was really good! Yum! For my meal i had a salad,  the Organic Kale Quinoa Salad.  I asked the waitress if it'd be filling and she said yes but recommended adding avocado, which I did (think I would have been full without it though!). Anyways the salad was super yummy.  The best part though was dessert, a blueberry cheesecake, I asked them to heat it up, it was SO yummy."}
{"text":"I'd never thought I'd write this review nor that I'd try this place. My boyfriend and I were super intrigued after walking past by numerous times and we decided to give it a try.   The food was so original, filling and flavourful. I got the seafood Super Bowl, which was essential a spicy and creamy noodle soup with \"shrimp\" and \"salmon\" which was so similar to the real deal and so well seasoned. The broth was very flavourful - much more flavourful than any meat based broth I've had in a long time.   The prices are a bit more expensive than same dish in a non-vegetarian restaurant but for a once in a while experience, It was worth a try."}
{"text":"I went here back in September and I'm still dreaming about the delicious SPICY 'SEAFOOD' SOUPER BOWL I had! I highly recommend it over everything else! For the portion you get it is worth the amount, and you can share it if it's too big for you."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Vegetarian Haven this evening because I was looking for something with a gluten free menu in my new neighborhood and I prefer to eat vegetarian whenever possible as well.  The menu has a variety of gluten free dishes (especially on the appetizer menu) but not as many mains.  I'm celiac, and the menu seemed to be labelled appropriately.   When I came in, it took a few minutes to be seated despite staff standing and talking.  It took nearly 15 minutes after looking at the menu to order, and after I finished my meal it took another 10 before the waitress came by and I could ask for the check.  Again, much longer of a wait for her to bring me change as well.  If I wasn't acutely aware that most servers make most of their wage through their tips I probably would have left a lot less.  It wasn't so busy that one couldn't keep up with their tables.  The food was good -- spiced appropriately, plated nicely, and had a good balance of flavours.  I had the deep fried oyster mushrooms and a glass noodle salad and they were both excellent.  The tea I ordered was a little weird though, having been looseleaf and left loose in the cup.  Is it a western preference to have the leaves strained before drinking your tea?  One thing that was super annoying was that the plates they brought sat on a glass countertop, so every time you tried to cut something with your knife the plate would slide and make a clacking noise on the glass tabletop.  I realize this keeps things neat and tidy, but it sounds awful and makes it awkward to enjoy a meal.  All-in-all I will probably return once again to Vegetarian Haven.  I'm certainly going to wait a while though in the hopes that they improve their customer service.  They're not alone though -- I've noticed that vegetarian and vegan restaurants are notoriously bad at customer service."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a co-worker as I had seen good reviews and they have lots of gluten free options for the person I was with. We made a reservation for 1pm and it was good as the place was quite full. It is not a very big restaurant, kind of a hipster vibe inside and located on a very cool street. The staff was amazing, knowledgeable, friendly and just the right amount of attentive. For apps we got the California avocado Temaki - A hand-held cornucopia of perfectly ripe avocado, tomato, apple, cucumber, lettuce & sprouts, wrapped in crisp nori seaweed. They were super fresh and the creamy sauce it came with was delicious, the only complaint is that they were so big it is a mission to try to eat! You can't do it in one bite but you can't cut the seaweed with a knife!  My co-worker got the Organic Kale Quinoa Salad - Rich in calcium, iron, protein & anti-oxidant properties, a nutritious salad of kale, quinoa, seaweed, beets, raisins & seeds are dressed with apple cider vinegar, olive oil & fresh lemon/lime juice. She liked it a lot and it was a huge portion! It is obviously GF as I previous mentioned. I got the Spicy Singapore Seitan - Tender slices of succulent seitan cooked in a sweet & spicy pineapple peanut sauce, served with purple rice & vegetables. Oh My Gosh. This dish was amazing. The seitan was marinated and had this wonderful cinnamon flavour. The dish was just spicy enough. Presentation is absolutely lovely here and the purple rice was fantastic! I have never had a dish like this before.  This place is a true gem for veggies and carnivores alike!!! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Packed for a reason - and that reason is: THE FOOD IS GREAT  Firstly I love Baldwin Village - its a small slice of the uniqueness Toronto has to offer - and such a lovely vibe in the summer with the patio's ablaze with energy and people.  Now for Vegetarian Haven: Staff are very friendly, efficient and genuinely seem to enjoy working there.  The food is amazing, great selection and phenomenal /interesting choices and selection of unique food's that are put together to make for a tasty vegan/veggie food that you couldn't possibly do at home anywhere as good as Vegetarian Haven.  It is very busy during the weekends - so a reservation would be best if you don't want to wait and wait and wait :-) for a table.  That being said they do endeavour to move the tables fast (but not too pushy to the customer).  Definitely on the fancy gourmet side of vegan/veggie fare and a great place to take a date - friend - group of folk.   The price point is very reasonable considering the generous portions and quality of the food being served.  Absolutely NOT your generic Veggie/Vegan fare here - so you will be pleasantly surprised at the array and unique authenticity of the quality and genre of foods being served under the vegan/veggie banner.....which makes for a wonderful night out - as it certainly isn't the same old-same old at this joint (the food is delicious)."}
{"text":"First off it's good to know this place is vegan even though it's called 'vegetarian' haven. Came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner for a vegan birthday girl, also I am vegetarian. First of all the service was absolutely fantastic, our server was very helpful with describing things and answering a lot of questions the meat eaters at our table had. She was very patient and friendly. The appetizers were delicious and the juices and smoothies were great as well. The chocolate rocket was to die for. Desserts were delicious too. Unfortunately mains didn't come up to par with the rest of the food. I had the chefs special which was some type of potato cucumber tofu roll with salad, which was delicious except for the salad. The dressing on the salads across the table were not enjoyed very much, very bitter. The pad Thai was really reallyyy spicy even for the people who liked spiciness. Someone else got an avocado wrap which they didn't enjoy because there was too many raisins. Otherwise it was about 50/50 and the other half enjoyed their food.. however it's good to note that the actual vegan wasn't one of them. The place is small but cozy. There's a parking lot across the street and they have street parking but it's quite expensive for weekends. I wanted to give this place a 3 star review based on everyone's opinion at the table (at least until I go back and try it again) but the service and desserts were so good I had to give it a 4."}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner. My first time at a vegan restaurant. Very nice restaurant. Very cozy and very relaxing atmosphere. The waitress was amazing. She recommended many dishes and explain everything about their food.  The food was very delicious.  Everything was very fresh and tender. Beautiful presentation.  Very friendly, happy and professional customer service.  I could eat this food everyday (with little bit of meat on the side lol)"}
{"text":"As you can probably tell from the name, Vegetarian Haven serves vegetarian food but what you can't tell is that they do it with an Asian flare. It's a cozy place and has that Baldwin street hipster feel.   Why only 3 stars? Don't get me wrong, the food was good, vegetables tasted very fresh but it was pricey for what it is... which is various forms of soy and vegetables. The mains start at around $15.  The menu is extensive and was a little overwhelming as the indecisiveness in me decided to come out and play. I ended up getting the mushroom tofu clay pot and it came with a good variety of different mushrooms, some veggies (carrots, baby corn, zucchinis, bok choy, among other) some purple rice and a heck lot of sauce. It tasted fine, no complaints.  Our server was super friendly but my friend's request for hot sauce was never delivered. I didn't have any room for dessert but there are lots of gluten free cakes on display that looked very yummy. The free apples on the way out was a nice touch. I myself am not a vegetarian but given the great reviews, thought I'd try it out. I likely won't come back as a meatless meal leaves me feeling a little unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I ordered the Moroccan pad Thai, it had a nice flavor but the noodles were over cooked for me. I also had the butternut squash soup. It was flavorful but lacking in texture. I wish it was a little thicker and smooth. My boyfriend ordered the seafood bowl. He was quite excited to try it because seafood was one of his favorites before becoming a vegetarian. He was very disappointed. I did have a bite and I wasn't blown away but it did have a very strong seafood taste if that's what you like. Finally I had the blueberry cheesecake for dessert which we both agreed was amazing. I don't think I'd go back. Maybe for the dessert."}
{"text":"Dinner was okay. I had the sizzling eggplant and my friend had the Buddha plate. Mine was much better, but it was something I could make myself. The later was disappointing. I can see how it's a good option for vegans, but really nothing to write home about. It's pricey. The staff are nice."}
{"text":"I am going to go against the grain and say that this place was not as good as everyone makes it out to be. I've been a vegetarian for 10 years and have had my share of fake meats.   I got the king oyster as an appetizer. It was ok. Nothing crazy and delicious. Sauce was decent...mushroom tasted like a mushroom? Nothing special here.   I ordered the spicy Singapore Seitan for my entree. I really expected this to be better. Seitan was flavourless and the sauce was chunky? Not my favourite and the flavour was not really there.   The cheesecake was delicious however. I haven't had a cheesecake in forever and this one was vegan so it was amazing!! Also the service is very very friendly so I made sure to tip well.   Overall, I don't think I'll be coming here again and it's not my favourite vegan spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful, satisfying meal here, stuffed peppers with glass noodles and broccoli and salad, PLUS this fantastic deep-fried faux chicken drumstick, the bone was edible, made from crunchy sugar-cane FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite places for a 'nice' meal or a date. The atmosphere is pleasant and serene, and the servers are always calm and kind. We enjoy the food a lot, although it's not as delicious as some of our cheap-and-cheerful vegan go-tos. Highly recommend for the vegans among us. My husband especially loves the vegan cheesecake. When we ordered the chocolate cake one time, it was so stale and dry that we could barely eat it, and as the food is pricey, this was a disappointment. Aside from that, our food experiences have been largely positive."}
{"text":"This is Ginger Almond Steamer or something by that name, delicious! The food was great and the atmosphere was very relaxing. A hot spot clearly since we had like three birthdays before we finished our dinner."}
{"text":"Ce n'est jamais facile (ni très objectif) d'écrire un avis sur un resto qui remonte à quelques mois, pendant les vacances, quand on y songe en rêvassant un peu... CERTES, mais même en sortant de Vegetarian Haven, je me suis dit que c'était top ! C'est dans une petite rue charmante, pleine de terrasses estivales et de petites guirlandes lumineuses, ce qui rend le diner en terrasse fort agréable ! Pour ne rien gâcher, un menu varié qui donne envie avec bien marqué ce qui est sans gluten, sans blé... J'avais pris une sorte de pad thai fusion à la marocaine (oui un peu étrange sur le fond), et c'était très bon et copieux ! Les prix sont assez corrects si je me souviens bien. J'en garde donc le souvenir, pas si déformé que ça je pense, d'une excellente soirée et c'est avec plaisir que j'y retournerais."}
{"text":"A vegan bistro? Yes, please.  Vegetarian Haven's menu is inventive and goes all over the world map. And the portions are pretty generous. For example, the special the other day was a gigantic plate piled high with veggies and what looked like a vegan drum stick, plus soup. Point is: you won't leave hungry.   I opted for a smaller dinner than the special and was still satisfied. I had the soup of the day - a fragrant batch of kombucha squash stew - and seared dumplings. I ended with a hot drink. The sweet waitress stopped me from ordering the Bambu (she said it sort of tasted like processed coffee) and steered me in the direction of Teccino with steamed almond milk instead.   Of my order, the soup and the drink were fantastically flavorful. The dumplings could have had a bit more seasoning, but they were hot and filling, which still satisfied most of my craving.  Definitely worth going to if you're nearby."}
{"text":"For lunch, I ordered the miso dumpling soup and others ordered the special of the day and seafood curry.   Not particularly fond of the dumplings which had glass noddles inside with very little vegetables - I would have preferred more crunch or texture to them. Miso soup itself was mediocre.   I have to commend their shrimp and chicken (brilliant that sugarcane replicates the bone of the chicken)! Although I didn't try it, I was told it tasted better than normal chicken.   Cannot give full stars as I think there can be some flavour improvements to the dish I ordered, and the restaurant isn't the most renovated place either."}
{"text":"First of all, I am not, by any means, a vegetarian or vegan - so that tells you alot about why I choose to rate this restaurant so highly and give it four stars.    Food quality and selection is amazing.  I venture to Fresh and Fressen every so often, but this place makes produces lots of \"stick to your gut\" cuisine.  Desserts and drink selection is also great."}
{"text":"The omnivores didn't like it, but the vegans went home happy.  The Sweetie enjoyed it enough to go back again the next day with her work buddies.  Food and service are only 3 stars and bathrooms are a mess, but they get an extra point for having dozens of vegan dessert choices.  Best vegan blueberry cheesecake ever."}
{"text":"I got the noodle dish here, my thoughts are that the price is a bit too high for the volume of food they give you. Also i would describe the tastiness of the food as good to okay, didn't seem too fresh :)"}
{"text":"I'm no connoisseur of vegetarian, but it wasn't bad for what it was. Good portion of soup and novel presentation of specials. Not a great venue though."}
{"text":"I went to Vegetarian Haven for dinner with a friend of mine. Their menu had many options including gluten and wheat free meals. I had Shanghai Noodles which was very filling; not the best vegetarian meal I've had but pretty yummy. I have to say though, the dessert was the show stopper. My friend and I shared a chocolate cake and tofu vanilla almond bark ice cream combo. It was amazing. The cake was moist and very sweet and the ice cream was incredible. I could taste the tofu flavor but it wasn't odd or anything. I recommend this place for all vegetarians with an intense sweet tooth! Try the desserts, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"So..everyone on my table seemed to have a great meal! Mine not so much..  I had the 'seafood' coconut soup. I am not a picky eater..but gosh..I could not get through this. It was a mix of random flavors..felt like every spice in my pantry was tossed into this soup! I left paying something like $15 and hungry.  I will give it another try just because everyone else on the table was satisfied, especially with the daily special.  I want to like this place so much..but did not work for me."}
{"text":"What a great find!  First I must say, not just the food but the service here is absolutely impeccable. I'm shocked to read a few reviews talking about bad service? I can't imagine the servers being rude to anyone..  It was our first time here this past snowy weekend which delayed us ~40 minutes for our reservation. But the owners were so accommodating..they didn't bat an eyelash and were able to seat us as soon as we walked in. What I really liked is being able to see the special of the day before ordering it..that was great!  Since we had our toddler in tow, we decided to order food that looked bit more 'kid' friendly and ordered the following: -king prawn and oyster mushroom tempura -fresh garden rolls -Shanghai Noodles -Bird's Nest  We loved everything...but my fav was the tempura! it was so so yummy! The flavors are perfectly balanced and even though I was skeptical at first bout the purple rice, I'm a changed woman! Definitely worth the snowy drive into the downtown core - we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Food: 2/5 Service: 4/5 Location: 2.5/5  As a non-vegetarian, I came here to try it out with a vegetarian friend of mine. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the food. I ordered the Bird's Nest and my bill came to around $20. I'm a skeptic when it comes to fully plant-based restaurants. They advertise as \"asian inspired\" cuisine and I have to say that they just missed it with the flavours. The bed of crispy noodles that the stir fry sat on was flavourless and the \"Szechuan sauce\" didn't deliver the full flavours I was hoping for. I am not a huge fan of the seitan they tout as a main ingredient. It has a much more earthy flavour than normal tofu, and even the sauce couldn't really mask the funk. Nonetheless, my friend enjoyed her curry Pad thai. However, this didn't really boost my confidence in fully veg dining, but that's not to say I am not still open to trying more places."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best vegetarian/vegan restaurants in Toronto.   Vegetarian Haven boasts a healthy and tasty asian-inspired menu.    It's a nice restaurant with familiar faces and a quaint patio for warm days.    One of my favourite things about the Haven is their daily special.  Always something offbeat that you might never think to try if only seen in print, you'll most likely jump at the chance to order it.  All mains come with either purple rice or noodles and steamed vegetables.    Don't be discouraged by all the mock-meat - I would say everything save for the seafood is worth trying, but then again, I was never a fan of seafood anyway.    I've brought many friends who enjoy a full diet and they loved Vegetarian Haven. Oh and be sure to try the tofu drumsticks as a starter!  Also on the menu - a wide range of dessert.  Must haves include the banana split, chocolate cake (which is decadent and massive!) and my fave, the cheesecake.  Again, all is vegan, and still, very, very good.  I think my only problem with the Haven is that they don't serve any alcohol - strange for a relatively nice restaurant.  I think they should apply for a liquor license - they might get more groups coming in for birthdays, etc."}
{"text":"All the dishes we had were outstanding!  Wonderfully rich flavors and texture in every dish!  This will be a regular spot for my wife and I."}
{"text":"I had expected some pretty good things when I booked my reservation and I'm happy to say every single one of my expectations were surpassed.  This place was INCREDIBLE.  I am by no means a vegetarian in the slightest sense of the word, so finding a place to dine with my vegan parents (outside of the cafeteria crap Fresh serves) can sometimes be a challenge. Our table enjoyed 3 apps, 4 entrees, 4 beverages and a dessert and the bill came to just over $100 for some of the best food I've had in months. I made it a point to try everything at the table - except the Pad Thai which I was told was wonderful - and loved all of it.   I would personally reccomend the garden rolls as an excellent app. They are supser fresh and have great big chunks of avocado and just the right amount of mint and cilantro. The \"Seafood\" in clay pot was an excellent main. I'm a big shellfish eater and was acutlaly surprised by how bang on the mock shrimp was. It was also very hearty and I found the nori and tofu played off the vegetables and purple rice really well. The Buddah's Delight is also something to note as awesome. The braised seitan was fantastically tender and flavourful. We ordered the vegan cheesecake for dessert and were not disappointed. It wasnt quite as firm as a regular cheesecake but the flavour was fantastic.  I also couldn't believe how lightning fast the service was. And I do mean fast. Fressen used to be our go to before it closed down and we were lucky to get 2 plates of hummus inside 40 minutes of ordering it there. Haven was at capacity when we sat down just before 8:30 on a saturday night and within 15 minutes of our butts being in the chair we had 2 fresh pressed juices and 3 apps on the table. Our mains were equally fast at no more than 20 minutes form the time our apps were dropped.  All in all it would be safe to say that this is one of my new favourite restaurants. I absolutely can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on a Tuesday night around 9pm with a friend to catch up. The atmosphere was really cozy and the service was phenomenal! We asked if it would be okay for us to sit down for a while, and they welcomed us in and told us their kitchen closes at 9:30pm and that we still have plenty of time to sit and chat. We were both looking for something to nibble while chatting, so we decided to share the avocado salad ($15.99) The salad was super yummy and aesthetically pleasing! There were some greens blended in with avocado, apples, raisins, peppers, and their house made sauce. Definitely a healthier option compared to other food we could get from around the area. It is true that the price isn't very cheap, but the salad was still must try and I would recommend this place for a cozy, friendly hangout!"}
{"text":"Overall I had a pretty good time at Vegetarian Haven. I had the Bird's nest (which is a very unappealing name for food I must say) and it was quite delicious. Lots of veggies, seitan and purple rice in a great sauce. What I didn't like was the \"crispy sweet potato noodles\" it was served on. These tasted like nothing and got all soggy once they touched the sauce. The dish would have been amazing without them.   The other thing that took away from our experience was the server. Someone at my table asked if they did iced tea and she replied \"Well it will take 10 minutes.\" This would have been fine since we were waiting for our food for that long anyway, but she went into detail explaining how difficult it was going to be to make the tea. Secondly, she made a snotty comment about us asking for separate bills. She said for next time, we have to notify our server before the meal that we want separate bills because their machine is old. Instead, she could have asked  us at the beginning of the meal. I have little patience for issues like this because any other restaurant has no problem doing separate bills.   I would definitely return to try out some other dishes but hope for a better server."}
{"text":"Yay I'm officially a fan! After dining here for the first time with a friend, we both loved the food but the price to pay to be healthy is another story.   Ordered the green tea matcha smoothie (6.50$) and the California sunshine (5.75$). For food we ordered the king prawn and oyster mushroom tempura (7.99$) and mushroom in a clay pot (14.49$).   The green tea matcha smoothie was really good and perfect to drink especially on a nice summer day on the patio. The California sunshine was disappointing. The tempura was excellent and texture/flavours were there, it was one of my favourites. The clay pot was also very delicious except for the price being not my cup of tea.   The cool thing that I liked about this restaurant is when describing the specials to you they go into great detail in regards to the drinks and also visually show you what the special is. They literally come out with a plate with what the special looks like.   Service was excellent and very attentive. Loved this place! Must come back to try more items on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Service was terrific.  Desserts are OMG great!!. Both waitresses were fun and helpful,  my only complaint was that the pad Thai had mint in it. Mint with noodles (and curry) was weird. The happy goner dink is highly recommended."}
{"text":"By far, the best vegan restaurant I've been to in the city. This will now be a regular joint for me. It's called Vegetarian Haven, but it's 100% vegan with GF and WF options as well. There is an extensive menu of choices, which makes it a painfully hard decision to decide what to eat. But I guess I just have to keep coming back to try them all!  Everyday there is an AMAZING daily entree special as well as one or two non-alcoholic drink features. They have homemade pies, and many other desserts from Sweets of the Earth, as well as french pressed coffee! Mostly everything on the menu has a bit of an Asian inspired flare to it which is fine by me. The curry phad thai is incredible.  Servers are a bit spacey and don't do much to dismantle the \"all vegans are hippies\" stereotype, but that's ok. They're nice and there's nothing wrong with the service.   Whether your Vegan, Vegetarian, or open minded Omnivore or Carnivore, you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian Haven is a solid option if you are vegan/vegetarian or dining with people who are. It's also a safe bet for people on gluten-free diets, as there are several dishes marked \"wf\" - wheat free. I eat meat, but the dishes here are so flavourful, I don't miss it. I do wish they did more tofu as tofu vs. tofu as faux-meat. That would be my biggest complaint as an omnivore who happens to enjoy tofu and lots of vegetables.  Anyways, the patio is great in the summer and the indoor seating is warm and cozy too. The servers are easy-going and patient with explaining all the dishes. There's a daily soup and entree, and they have a display plate of it that they carry around and show each table. It's nice to be able to see exactly what you're getting. On the day I went, it was this tofu skin wrapped around some squash/yams, with a side green salad and flat rice noodles. A few people in my party tried it and said it was good. The portion-size was pretty generous. You can get the soup & entree special together for $17.   I opted for the fresh garden rolls, which I devoured - they were some of the best fresh rolls I've ever had. You get 2 huge rice paper rolls with mint, avocado, fresh mango, cucumber and some other veggies I can't remember. The spicy, oil-based dipping sauce adds just the perfect complimentary flavour. It's different from what you'd get at a Thai place (usually a creamier peanut-based sauce), but I liked it. I had the Shanghai noodles. The wheat noodles were skinnier than what you'd usually think of for Shanghai noodles. The light sesame-based sauce and heaps of veggies made it really yummy, and healthier than what you'd normally get from your typical Chinese restaurant.   I didn't get a dessert, but the menu is interesting. They classify their cookies as \"wheat-free\" and \"lactose-free\" etc., but they don't actually tell you what *kind* of cookies they are. I thought that was weird. They did have some tasty-looking tarts and pies on display, which can be served a la mode with soy ice cream. But, to be honest, I remain a little skeptical of dairy-free desserts.   Finally, there are lots of delicious shakes, juices and teas here. I went with the freshly pressed apple juice, which they serve in a wine glass. Delicious!   I'd be back. It's nice every now and then to eat out and not feel that the food is really unhealthy and heavy. This is my go-to place when eating with vegans. I prefer it to Fressen or Sadie's."}
{"text":"I feel bad about saying this because everyone else seems to like it, but the food is just plain bad (especially when you take the prices into account). The atmosphere and service are fine, though.  We were super excited about the \"spicy\" Moroccan pad thai ($14) because it sounded so interesting, but it was incredibly bland and texturally challenged. We got the souper bowl ($16.50) next, and it was just a bunch of rice noodles and frozen dumplings someone had plopped in tasteless broth and topped with some canned mushrooms. The heads of the mushrooms had a weird fluid sac in them that burst in my mouth, just like something out of a horror movie.   I honestly can't recommend this place to anyone, and am shocked every time I see people saying how much they like it. Maybe it was a good veg option ten years ago, but it can't compete on flavor or decor or price with most other veg spots in the city now. Skip it."}
{"text":"Everything about Vegetarian Haven is spot on. Been going for over 8 years and will continue for awhile. :)"}
{"text":"I came to Vegetarian Haven with two friends on my last visit to Toronto. We were at a nearby museum and I was excited to see a vegan restaurant so close by.   Unfortunately, the food was overpriced and underwhelming. The dishes were all variations of a simple vegetable stir fry -  very simple and very similar to what you probably make at home. Nothing stood out about any of the three dishes we ordered (Buddha's delight, bird's nest, and  sizzling eggplant) and they all sort of blended together in flavor profiles. For around $20 per dish, I was hoping for something a bit more inventive."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service very friendly. We went for my mom's birthday and she enjoyed it very much. The 2 course dinner is such a bargain. They make vegetarian full of tastes and not boring at all!"}
{"text":"Flavorful curry but a little bit too salty for me Like the touch of herbs in the curry and salad The portion is okay Good service"}
{"text":"Vegetarian Haven is where I usually take my vegetarian friends when we meet up for dinner since they can eat everything off the menu instead of being stuck with a handful of potentially boring options while I get my feed on. I've been there about 4 times over the past 2 years. The food quality is consistently good, but not stellar. That being said, I'm not expecting 4- or 5-star food from a casual resto. The service has always been friendly and the ambiance relaxed. On one occasion the waitress sat down beside us and confessed that she was absolutely wiped out due to an intensive session of hot yoga that morning (re: the vibe is casual and somewhat granola, which I don't mind but some might). In terms of price they're reasonable given the downtown location and freshness of the ingredients. One of my favourite dishes is the tofu drumsticks starter, which looks like chicken drumsticks but is made of tofu (WARNING! It does NOT taste like chicken but it is VERY CUTE!) The spicy Bali stir-fried noodles is my fav entree. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Sorry... I really wanted to like this place but for me, the food was bland. I've been to other Asian-inspired vegan restaurants that also don't use onion and garlic in their dishes, but those were still very flavourful. I had a daily special for dinner which consisted of a soup and a main. The main sounded like a creative dish but it really lacked flavour. Same with my friend's dumpling appetizer."}
{"text":"It's really great to have a vegan restaurant that takes their food very seriously. The ingredients are fresh and the preparation is thoughtful and high quality. I have been here twice and the food has been very good, though I think that it helps if you have a vegan or restrained vegetarian palate as some of the dishes are very subtle.  I can give them a solid four stars for all the great things about the restaurant - delicious specials, excellent, friendly service and a gourmet approach to vegetarian fare, but I what prevents them from getting five from me is that some of the dishes are a little \"over done\" (too much flavour) and others are \"under done\" (a touch too subtle).  I would recommend ordering something that has some variety on the plate - like the special. BTW they have a great way of \"selling\" the special - they bring one to the table to show you: really gets your mouth watering!"}
{"text":"Disclosure: I'm not a vegetarian but my partner is so we tried this place for the first time.  On a Friday/Saturday if you want to come during peak hours you need to have a reservation otherwise you may be waiting quite some time as this place is very busy (testament to its popularity).  Environment: It has a nice intimate ambiance. Very narrow restaurant. There is nothing particularly unique about its decor.  Service: Very friendly and informed. However given how busy it is you can expect to wait a reasonable amount of time for your order to come in. This definitely is not fast food.   Food: We ordered the Oyster Mushroom Tempura as an app which was absolutely delicious (I wish I ordered 2). Then for entree we got The bird's nest and Mushroom Tofu in a Clay pot. The Bird's nest was on the sweet side, not bad. The Mushroom Tofu however was very saucy and actually good (I would recommend it).  Overall this place was great and I would come back."}
{"text":"My favorite vegetarian restaurant in Toronto and in my top 5 in the world. The most amazing assortment of deserts, an ever changing special of the day, great drinks, juices and smoothies and the kindest staff ever. The food is great whether dine in or take out, I have never had a bad experience once!"}
{"text":"Good vegan food that is for sure....  I was here over a year ago and just again last night with a group of 10 people. The menu is much reduced from my previous visit, but I dont think this is a bad thing. Sometimes I can't handle toooo many options!  But here are the things you should know:  1. Enough seating room to accommodate large groups. (there was another group of 10 there at the same time) 2. NO BOOZE (not a problem for me..but could be for some!) 3. The special seems to be where its at. If you dont know what to get, get the special. 4. General chaos and disorganization at check out/bill time which for me tainted the whole experience. I would like to preface this by saying that I eat out a LOT and that I organize group outings frequently, so I know how smoothly and awesome things can be for larger groups. Sadly paying the bill at this place was quite the ordeal!l!!  They added 17% gratuity to the bill and then handed us a calculator so we could all *try* to figure out what we owe. After being demanding and bitchy they finally agreed to give us separate bills (which should have been done from the first place)  I will go back, but probably with a smaller group (under 6) as 17% gratuity is added for groups of 6+."}
{"text":"Absolute favourite vegan restaurant. I've tried the sizzling satan, birds nest. Their brownie sundae is to die for! Slightly in the saltier side but the texture of the satan is amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is just an outstanding restaurant; it doesn't matter that it's vegan. The food was very well prepared, both as apps,mains and desserts. As well as smoothies--I had a pumpkin one that was like drinking pumpkin pie. Outstanding eggplant curry, special of the day and kale salad were the standouts. Service was a bit upset-oriented but enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This is my first time at a vegetarian restaurant and it totally exceeded my expectations!   We ordered the soup of the day which has loads of ingredients in it, we were already half full after finishing the soup. For main course we ordered shanghai noodles and king prawn and oyster tempura and both of the dishes are really amazing! Especially the prawn the texture was exactly like prawn you wont be able to tell a difference and the \"oyster\" was delicious!    The waitresses are really friendly and attentive as well. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant. We had three light appetizers. All delicious.  Avocado wontons. Kale and yams. Hummus plate.  Very friendly staff Kim.  Recommend highly"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a vegan meal coz it was Ash Wednesday. It was my first time in a vegan and vegetarian restaurant and I wasn't disappointed. I like how entering the restaurant they have a plate on display show casing the chefs special.  The menu main menu provided a lot of choices from apps to the entrees. After eating a dish it kind of wants to make you challenge yourself to try something new every time. If the meal doesn't fill you up you can explore their delicious desert or try one of their specialty drinks for an after meal finisher.   For my first visit I chose the chefs special:  My starter was the soup of the day: vegetable curry. It was delicious. The taste of the soup reminds me of an Indian dish called sambar. It was also full of vegetables so you get a mouthful every time.  For the main, the chef special is a vegetable + tofu 'meatloaf' with an Asian sauce, accompanied by flat noodles with sesame seeds, and a salad. Not much to say about the salad but the 'meatloaf' was yummy. My favourite though was the flat rice noodles with the Asian sauce. It makes me want to order pad Thai from them in my next visit. I ended my meal with a satisfying ginger tea (it was written on the menu how ginger helps with digestion).   All in all it was an enjoyable experience of which I would gladly recommend."}
{"text":"I REALLY like this restaurant and the food is amazing. I have gone here numerous times with friends, coworkers and family! However, last night was a bit of a disaster.   Finally we get our spot in a restaurant to get some desert and we had just sat there and were not even settled in! My 2.5 yr was kicking her seat (she is NOT a rowdy kid) and this server came and told her rudely to stop kicking. I was stunned. My 2.5 yr old started sucking her thumb and sank behind me. None of us made a scene...because the rest of wait staff is STELLAR.   Is this behaviour justified? Are there no other ways to tell a child to stop kicking?   I am appalled."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I was a vegan but haven't been back since my taste buds grew back. My non-veggie friends said they liked it here too. This was around 2006 I believe."}
{"text":"\"I know what you mean!\" my sister agreed through a mouthful of avocado apple sprout wrap ($6). She was referring to my point that if delicious vegetarian fare was more accessible, we might never suffer from another meaty craving again. With a menu that's a booklet full of lovingly prepared dishes, Vegetarian Haven provides a plethora of healthy, unboring options.   The mushroom salad ($13) is a conservative, yet flavourful serving of sauteed assorted fungi atop of mixed greens. The daily special ($12) is a long plate consisting of a little bit of everything. On my last several visits, this included green salad, a pile of Shanghai noodles, a slice of savoury vegetable tart, and a puck of imitation meatloaf. The servers always bring a sample of the daily special to the table and this is often a great introduction for first timers to vegetarian fare.    Fresh juices ($5) and daily special drinks such as iced jasmine tea ($3.50) are refreshing ways to start any meal on a sunny day on the sidewalk patio. Beside the lovely opportunities for low key people watching, there are few other metal chairs that will leave quite the extensive grid marks on the back of your legs if you wear shorts. Get them while you still can!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and always love it.  The sizzling eggplant tempeh is amazing, and all the dishes are great.  The daily specials are usually awesome too.  Lovely environment. :)"}
{"text":"Having lived with a vegetarian sister growing up, I have always found myself semi anti-vegetarian - I guess because I was forced to stick to that diet without choice! Because of that, in all my time of dining on Baldwin, I had never ventured to Vegetarian Haven.  So, on my first trip, I was slightly apprehensive, but ended up being totally surprised! There is tons of variety on the menu, which ranges from salads, to wraps, to soups, and noodle bowls. They also apparently have an array of vegan desserts on the counter inside, but as it was a sunny day I didn't leave the patio.  I had the Curry Pad Thai, which I really enjoyed (except the mushrooms - should have thought to ask for no mushrooms!) I also tried the Avocado Wrap, which was full of good things, but had RAISINS which totally disgusted me and eventually (though I tried to get over it) made it inedible.   The main drawback of this place to me is the addition of raisins to so many things!! Whyyyy you would choose to ruin such delicious food with raisins, I'll never know. But if you like raisins, I guess this won't be an issue for you.  So in summary, even for carnivores like me, this vegetarian place is definitely worth checking out!   P.S. They don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food; couldn't ask for more! A hidden gem for sure. The coconut curry souper bowl was incredible."}
{"text":"I had the soup of the day and the chef's special for lunch. Everything was fresh, tasty, and more than filling. Deep-fried tomato was great, something I've never tried before. Had the chocolate vegan cake for dessert and albeit a little dry, it tasted great."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Greated at the door by a friendly female server and Bob Dylab coming outa the speakers. Food was delicious. Def the best California roll ever!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! Finally a vegetarian restaurant with really tasty food.  This place is wayyy better then Fresh, etc.  I highly recommend it and you can't beat the price. The service is great too.  Very hospitable warm people."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasant, and the servers were friendly right away. They all were highly knowledgable about the menu items and were eager to tell us how things were made, what their favourites are, etc. They all had great personalities and seemed to enjoy their jobs.   The food and drinks were all amazingly delicious. I had the coconut curry soup, my girlfriend had the eggplant tempeh. We each got a drink off the summer drinks menu and had temaki cones to start. The food was flavourful and well-presented.  The server even thanked me for the generous tip I left, something most servers don't do. I'm a server myself so I know that lots of places don't acknowledge tips, good or bad, and that's just how it is. It was nice to hear a genuine thank you. She even told us she hoped our flight home in the morning was safe.   You won't be disappointed at this place!"}
{"text":"How come I ended up at Vegetarian Haven?   How come I am not here with my Hot Vegetarian/Yoga Date instead with my \"meat loving eat anything\" Yelp friend?   - Local and certified organic ingredients used whenever possible  - purified drinking water using reverse osmosis filtration  - In-house made seitans, sauces & dressings   All come with a price my friend... a price that I might not able to pay on a regular bases.. Maybe I just boil some vegetables at home and just eat that... and cook some of my own blend of purple rice.  Bird's Nest with Purple Rice ($13.95) and Spicy Bali Stir-fried Rice Noodles($10.99) both highly recommended by our friendly waiter that I have a nice conservations with..sadly I don't think he is interested in me.. more in my yelp friend...   Without the use of garlic and onion and all these healthy options, making these asian dishes can be challenging. Both of the dishes were nicely done. Taste were subtle without being overpowering. Healthy without make you feel like eating too healthy...   The deco and ambiance at Vegetarian Haven is calm and  zen. Definitely a great place to impress your vegetarian/vegan dates... shown them that you care!  Am I slowly being convert to vegetarian one meal at a time?"}
{"text":"The Avocado salad was truly a heavenly experience...rich in flavor with fresh ingredients. Will come here a lot!!"}
{"text":"Third time's a charm may an incredibly cliched expression, but I found it to describe my experience at Vegetarian Haven.  (Not that the first and second time wasn't wonderful, because otherwise I wouldn't be given Vegetarian Haven 5 stars--in fact, notwithstanding my two 5-star reviews today, don't expect me to give 5-star reviews all that often, and especially not for initial visits, no matter how good the initial visit may be.)  The first time I went to Vegetarian Haven was April 2011, as part of the Veggielicious promotion in Toronto.  (Veggielicious was a promotion by the Toronto Vegetarian Association where restaurants in Toronto and surrounding areas would offere deals on selected vegetarian items).  I went for the \"buy an appetizer, salad or entree and get the 2nd of the same dish for half price\" deal on the seared dumplings--and those are delicious dumplings indeed, filled with vegetables and rice noodles and wrapped in a chewy skin.  When I went there again at the beginning of January, I ordered the sizzling seitan steak because I remembered seeing someone else order it on my first visit and thinking that it looked delicious.  And delicious it was! The seitan steak was served to me in a hot plate and had a considerably meaty texture.  I especially loved the rich, flavourful mushroom gravy, the accompanying grilled vegetables and purple rice (Vegetarian Haven's trademark rice blend of white, red, brown, black and wild rice).  For my third visit, I had a light lunch--the soup of the day (kabocha carrot walnut soup), a garden salad, one tofu drumstick and two seared dumplings--as well as the California avocado temaki.  The avocado temaki was a rice-less handroll filled with avocado and other vegetables/fruits such as carrots, cucumber, and apple.  The avocado was very smooth and the apples pleasantly sweet, but I'd advise against ordering it if the soup of the day also features sweet vegetables (like the kabocha carrot walnut soup that I had).  Garden salad included some grilled mushrooms and bell peppers that I didn't expect in a typical garden salad, which was a pleasant surprise.  Finally, the tofu drumstick was crunchy on the outside and surprisingly felt like pulled tofu on the inside.  I would definitely visit Vegetarian Haven time and time again for days--they're officially my go-to choice for vegetarian food.  Great eats, cozy atmosphere.  (A possible word of warning to potential Yelpers: Most of the protein offered at Vegetarian Haven is soy protein (tofu/tempeh) or fake meat (seitan).  Your enjoyment of Vegetarian Haven may vary depending on whether you like these forms of protein (yep, it's obvious that I'm a major fan of the above-mentioned forms of protein :D ) )"}
{"text":"Meat-eaters take heed, you will like Vegetarian Haven.   VH is tucked away in Baldwin Village, and is pretty easy to miss. It has a lot of cred amongst hardcore veg-heads, and it doesn't hurt that it's right next door to the Toronto Vegetarian Association HQ. The space is long, calmly decorated, and has a very calm and serene atmosphere about it. With an abundance of two-tops it's a great place for a date.  They have a super eclectic menu that's mostly Asian-inspired with some Moroccan flavour as well. Their proteins du choix are tofu and seitan and they make it all in-house. For those who cannot tolerate gluten, there are a host of wheat-free options, and if those don't appeal to you, many of the options are tweakable. Do note this place seems to be Buddhist vegetarian: no onions, no garlic.   I have no complaints about the food, the service or the restaurant. On my last visit I had a mock Prawn tempura and their special which was a noodle and tofu medley. They actually brought out a plate so we could see the special which I thought was an interesting touch.  They have a wide assortment of vegan desserts also, but I have always been too stuffed to even entertain the thought. Someday.   Obligatory Title Pun: I'll have what's she's HAVEN.  Menu Readability: Not just well-designed, but it also includes a glossary.  Need to mention: In spite of the name, everything on the menu is VEGAN.  What this place teaches me about myself: If I had a personal chef, I could certainly give up meat. (NOW HIRING.)"}
{"text":"First time here and it blew me away!   The service was quick, friendly, and very helpful with the specials of the day. But the star was the food! I got the clay mushroom pot which was a stew purple rice combination and it was delicious! Very flavourful and filled with vegetables.   I also got the dessert of the day which was delicious (see photo attached) and the presentation was on point.   Would def recommend for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian Haven makes a great meal.  They are quite accommodating to adjust to someone's dietary needs.  The space itself is nothing too exciting, although people-watching outside on their patio during the summer is a lovely experience.  Their servers are well-informed about the menu options & will do their best to explain the \"veggie terminology\" to any meat eaters.  Even if you never were a fan of seafood, I recommend their \"King Prawns\" in particular.  I also recommend saving some room for their desserts - they are a blessing."}
{"text":"Overall I love this restaurant, I have been there twice so far since my Vegan lifestyle began.  The one MAJOR downside is that apparently they really try to get customers not to order the Apple Fritters.  The last time I walked in as I ordered my meal, I specifically said \"I want the apple fritters after dinner please, i know they take awhile so could I put that in as well?!\" The waiter said sure. After dinner as he came over with the bill I said \"Am I getting the apple fritters?\" He replied with \"It'll take 32min\" I was shocked, really disappointed with that...so I passed on dessert, super annoying!"}
{"text":"As a non-vegetarian, the food was pretty food. Service is perfect. We order a curry pad thai and a chef special. The taste was good. Overall I will give it an 8/10."}
{"text":"Very good. Food here is very sophisticated compared to other vegetarian restaurants in Toronto. I love their soups."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a purely vegetarian place! To be honest, I wasn't expecting too much from this but my friend was raving about it so I gave it a shot. I was extremely pleasantly surprised by the quality and the ambience of the restaurant! It's a cute little spot on Baldwin and it gives nice vibes when you walk in. We went in for lunch around 1 and wenwere greeted by the waitresses who described the chefs special of the day before we were seated. Unfortunately I have a small stomach and was unable to try the chefs special of the day but it did look amazing for the price. I ended up ordering the Shanghai fried noodles and I was really anxious about trying the mock meat made of soy protein. I love Shanghai noodles so I was excited to see the vegetarian spin on it and how closely it resembled the real thing! The noodles were not as wide as normal shanghai noodles but the mock meat was incredible! It had the texture and taste of pork, and the sauce even coloured the soy to resemble pork too! I wish I was given more of the mock meat because it tasted really good! I would definitely come back and try other dishes and I'm glad my vegetarian friend took me here"}
{"text":"CREATIVE & surprisingly FILLING vegan food! It's on the pricier side, but totally worth it IMO.   //THE FOOD// Fresh Garden Rolls (5/5) - packed with fresh veggies & loved the cooling cucumber dip. Tofu drumstick (5/5) - delicious deep fried goodness! Seriously felt like I was eating a drumstick because of the Bamboo 'bone'. Wish their portion size for this was larger though!  Spicy 'Seafood' Souper Bowl (5/5) - loved every bite, it had just the right amount of spicy kick to it. The 'seafood meats' were made of some sort of soy product but it's shape/colour/texture was very similar to the real deal. I asked for the noodles to be substituted with just more veggies and they happily obliged !!  Spiced Carrot Cake with Vanilla Almond Bark tofu icecream (3/5) - the cake itself was unsweetened and wasn't flavourful besides the thin icing that it had. The tofu was interesting to try.  I can't wait to come back again to try more of their entrees :)"}
{"text":"To be fair, this was my 4th visit to Haven but my mom has been here many more times. We would come here because my mom is a vegetarian and the food quality met her expectations. Everything was great until my visit this past weekend. Due to the poor service, we will never come here again.   Long story short - my mom ordered the Spicy Coconut Curry Seitan Bread Bowl. She's had this 2-3 times before and it was one of her favourites. We asked the server to send the dish back because the curry was really salty. For someone whose had this dish a few times before, my mom could tell. The server gave us this look and said \"All our food are made the same way. Even if I sent it back, it's going to be the same.\" She did not offer to even ASK the chef or for us to pick another dish. She kept talking...did not let us speak and dashed away with our dish. 5 mins later, she came over and said \"the chef is remaking it and we'll have it out for you in 2 mins!\"   At this point my dad, my bf, and I had already got our food and stopped eating to wait until my mom got her dish back. approximately 15 mins later, another server stared at us and was wondering why we weren't eating. We told her we were waiting on one more dish. She went to the kitchen to check up on it only to come back and say \"I'm sorry but everything is out already and your dish will not be coming out because it will taste the same if we bring it back out to you\" I responded \"Are you serious? the other server said it was coming out in 2 mins that's the only reason why we were sitting here waiting. We would've ordered something else. So if we didn't tell you, we would have been sitting here for the rest of the night waiting.\" Then I just asked for the check.   After the owner came over and was explaining that the restaurant was really busy and they forgot to tell us that it wasn't coming. I responded \"Honestly, that is not an excuse. It is very simple to tell us it's not coming. We are extremely disappointed. Can you just check us out so we can leave?\" The owner actually began to RAISE HER VOICE AT ME saying \"We are human and human make mistakes!! Why are you angry for?!\" I said \"I'm angry because my mom hasn't ate the entire night...how am I not suppose to be? She had this dish before and you are basically making it seem like she's wrong for sending the dish back? Humans make mistakes but they also apologize (The owner only yelled at us and did not even say sorry. If you don't say sorry to me, that's fine. At least apologize to my mom.)\"   This was honestly not the way to approach customers and situations. If they had been more compromising and nice about it, I would have considered coming back. It isn't even about the food anymore, the service was TERRIBLE. I would never come back and I do not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"This is one of the best vegetarian restaurants in Toronto. The food is as good as it can possibly get. The menu is the right size, not too many options, but enough for any taste. The specials are usually a good choice. The location at Baldwin Street is great, especially in the summer when you can sit outside. The staff is always very friendly. If you skip the desert, go to the ice-cream place next door (which has vegan options too)."}
{"text":"We were vegans visiting Toronto, and went on an eating and drinking tour over 72 hours.  We made sure that Vegetarian Haven was the first place we stopped.  It had great reviews online and a unique menu, which made it a priority on our trip.  The location is great, and you can walk in any direction before/after your meal and run into more things to do.    I had the Sizzling Eggplant Tempeh in Spicy Coconut Curry.  It was great!  It came out very hot, and the temperature stayed throughout the entire meal (I also eat fast).  The spice was there, but it wasn't too much at all.  The other person had the popular Spicy 'Seafood' Souper Bowl.  I've never seen anything like it before.  It includes vegan 'king prawn,' which was shockingly accurate with it's seafood taste/after taste.  For dessert, we had a slice of the carrot cake with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on the side.  So good!  The service was very friendly and helpful when answering questions regarding the menu items.  They offered great suggestions, and even helped us find more things to do in the area.  I would highly recommend this place to any locals or out-of-towners who are looking to experience the vegan options of Toronto."}
{"text":"By far one of the best vegan meals I've ever had - even in comparison to NYC & SF. The Claypot and Ginger Almond Steamer drink is the way to go. Gotta thank my lucky stars they had pumpkin cheesecake. Added chocolate almond vanilla ice cream. Everything was not too salty, not too sweet.  Atissa provided the ABSOLUTE best service. Kind, caring, friendly. Couldn't have asked for more.  TL;DR Vegetarian Haven needs to be one of your first stops in Toronto if you're into plants. Period."}
