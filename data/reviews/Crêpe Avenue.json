{"text":"Yay! A crepe place in Kensington! I had a dessert crepe and it was good. Nothing too fancy. I'm excited to try a savoury crepe. It takes a little while for the crepe to be made, so be prepared to wait if there are already a lot of people in there. They wrap them up so you can walk around with one, but the paper they use is a little tough and awkward to unwrap."}
{"text":"I've had better, I've had worse. The crepe itself was well prepared. Nice selection of fillings, but a bit sparse and lacking in sauce (eg caramel, chocolate). Not nearly as much whipped cream as in the tantalizing plastic crepe models in the window."}
{"text":"I love crepes and these crepes are really thin, a little bit crispy and stuffed with tons of fillings!  Lots of unique filling options as well as the usual suspects - in both sweet and savoury!  What a great place we walked into!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a crepe place in Kensington. So I decided to give this place a try.   I have been there twice so far and both times I had to get my order remade because they put ingredients in the crepe that were not mentioned on the menu. Now I am a picky person this is one thing that irks me. But I am always polite and kind about this kind of thing, it happens.   I actually had to laugh when they put nutella all over mt chocolate, strawberry, banana crepe. I saw them doing it and stopped them and asked if the nutella was the chocolate and they said yes. Sorry but just because nutella has some cocoa in it does not make it chocolate! Yikes, what if I were allergic to nuts. This is a problem waiting to happen.  Also service can be a little slow at times. I did however really like their happy hour pricing on crepes!  The restaurant itself is cute and cozy.  All in all I would go back, I just need to be really specific about what it is I want in my crepe. Although my fav crepe place is still Sola Cafe on 17th ave, I am extremely happy to be able to satisfy my crepe cravings in kensington.  I think this place will get better with experience :)"}
{"text":"Visited this cute little place last night, and the Tom Yum crepe was unexpectedly good! Although it doesn't seem like that it's a combination made in heaven, it was so awesome that I had to stop myself from wanting to get another one!  Though the set up of Crepe Avenue could be better - the tables were really just too small for a person, not to mention for two to share! It was still a place with decent options and again, the great tom yum crepe!   I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday since it opened. I ordered the special of the day, which was a Thai Green Custard, Banana and Almond crepe, and my boyfriend ordered the Turkey Club crepe. When we received the crepe, I was quite surprised at the way they presented it. It was rolled up and handed to me like a shish taouk sandwich! I have never had a crepe presented to me like that! It was pretty interesting! Upon biting into the crepe, mmmm... it was deeelicious! Infact, I had my custard-banana-almond crepe taste lingering in my mouth for hours after I was done. My boyfriend's turkey crepe was good too.  The crepe was reasonably priced, but what was a bit of a peeve for me was the overpriced drinks. I ordered a green tea and my boyfriend ordered a Coke. They were about 3 bucks each. Each. Yep. Rip-off.   But now I know better.. I will definitely go back for the crepes, but may hold off on ordering a drink."}
{"text":"I love me some really thin pancakes.  Seriously. Especially if it's stuffed with ham and cheese. These guys make some delicious lunch out of dessert. It's like the Tubby Dog of crepes. Flavorful and just a little bit different. Don't want meat and cheese on your crepe, no problem. They make some fine sweets.  I'd also suggest the panang curry (not on a crepe)! Delicious for take out!"}
{"text":"Sigh I really didn't want to review this place. I wanted to keep it all to myself, but I guess a girl can only eat so many crepes herself!  I stumbled upon this little (tiny) place walking by on 10th street on a stroll. Crepe Avenue sits neatly tucked somewhere between beadworks and a health/wellness store. I must had driven past this place a hundred times but it's so blended in I've never noticed. Boy am I ever glad I found it.   They have a selection of either sweet dessert crepes or savory snack crepes. I almost never stray from the strawberry nutella crepe, it's absolutely yum. They make the crepe fresh, and hand it to you over the counter so you can enjoy it still warm. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do! My only complaint is they could be a lil more generous with the filling. A full size crepe will run about $6~ a mini is $4 and half the size. They have a seating area of 3 small tables, so don't expect to get a seat if people are already lined up. However they do offer free wifi!  note: they don't have a designated parking area so you have to use street parking and private lot parking. If you use safeway's parking they may come out and give you a ticket, I've seen it happen!"}
