{"text":"Review based upon deceptive advertising not food quality. Hamburger listed at $3.25. I ordered one, was asked if I wanted everything on it, lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle.  I said yes. Was charged an extra dollar since it only comes with 3 items on it. To get the 4th, it's a dollar more. The hamburger was good, I don't mind spending $4.25 on it, but after looking at the signs, idid not say anywhere that I could see about the extra dollar charge. On the receipt , it said water, $1.00.  Sad.  Lost a customer over a dollar."}
{"text":"Small portions, high prices, average at best taste. Won't return. The hot dogs are tiny. You would think for the price you would get a larger dog but nope. Comparable to a gas station hotdog but a lot more expensive."}
{"text":"Growing up on the west coast I've never had a Nathan's hotdog before. I was not disappointed in the slightest. The food was very tasty, and the outdoor atmosphere of Crocker park made for a relaxing afternoon. The prices might be high, but to experience the famous Nathan's hotdogs in Cleveland was well worth it."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for side street hot dog and fries with not spending an arm and leg at Crocker park!
Amazing lemonade, outside sitting, relaxing!!"}
