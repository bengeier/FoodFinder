{"text":"This is my favourite sushi restaurant on Kerr Street!  The owners are super friendly and always seem genuinely happy to see me and my son when we come in to grab some rolls to go.  There are a few fancy rolls that I have not seen elsewhere - one is called the Magic Maki and it is so good!  Last time my family stayed to eat in the restaurant (there are only 6 or 7 seats), we got a few freebies offered to us as well :)"}
{"text":"What amazing hosts. And great sushi too! Try any of Tony's original creations. Let him suggest one to you! They're all good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very welcoming hosts.

Tony Maki and Vege-Balls are favourites.

Lunch special bento boxes are great."}
