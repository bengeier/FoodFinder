{"text":"Their alfredo pizza is the best!   We also love their lasagna, calzones, and chicken salads.  Luciano's is always near the top of our list for a great local restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been getting food from this place for years. I don't understand the negative comments. It's a restaurant--sometimes people screw up or the food isn't perfect. I love their food. Their white pizza is great and so is their chicken salad. Yeah, they've changed their sauce a little bit but it's still good. The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because a lot of the times they forgot some of your order when you order take out and you don't realize you are missing food until you get home."}
{"text":"I have been going to Luciano's for quite a long time. Almost every time I have gone, we have ordered pizza. Don't get me wrong, the pizza at Luciano's is exquisite. But, I happened to want a salad this time that I went. I ordered the dinner portion of the Caesar salad. I have always liked their Cesar salad the that give you as an appetizer but I cannot say the same for the entrée version. It was absolutely freezing. The ones that they serve you as appetizers are warm and delicious. This one was so cold that when I took a bite, I felt that sensation that you feel when biting into ice cream. I was completely unsatisfied with it. My advice to all of you, do not order a Cesar salad as an entrée here at Luciano's."}
{"text":"Ok, my extended family keeps making us go and every time I leave angry that I agreed to go in the first place.  This was my THIRD awful experience.  The service is HORRIBLE.  We even called ahead this time to make sure we'd have a table ready and we still had to wait for 20 minutes to be seated.  When the hostess took us to our table, most of the restaurant was empty and the lobby was FULL with people waiting outside.  

I'm a vegetarian, so when I ordered I asked if there was meat in their sauce.  The waitress said no, but there is meat juice in the sauce.  She said \"in case you are allergic to meat, its okay because they just drain the juice off of meat and use it in the sauce, but there are no meat chunks.\"  That eliminated 99% of the menu for us.

The food takes FOREVER to arrive.  Our salad and bread plates were never cleared from the table so we started stacking dishes at one end of the table.  My sister-in-law asked the waitress if someone could please clear the table, but that request was ignored.

I had the bruschetta as my entree which was smothered in cheese so it was more like pizza bread than bruschetta.  My husband had manicotti and it was cold when it arrived and completely flavorless.  

Unfortunately, I'd have a better experience at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Just ordered a ceasar salad, all the lettuce is brown and wilted. It even has that 'I've sat so long I'm almost see through' look. If you wouldn't eat it, then don't serve it. It's so disgusting its not edible. 

They only get 2 stars because they have good white pizza."}
{"text":"Good environment to go eat with the family. Good food and separate bar area. Nice Italian menu with various options. And you can't go wrong with the brick oven pizza !"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and spaghetti to go, got home and the pizza was fine, very good, no complaints. The spaghetti tasted fine, but the salad was FROZEN and the bread was smashed and old. Very disappointed because when we dine in everything is usually top notch..."}
{"text":"Have frequented this restaurant for 19 years but won't be returning.  Ordered take-out today and was told their computers were down and cash would be best.  No problem with that and was told 25 minutes for pick-up.  Arrived 30 minutes later and asked if pizza done.  No was all I was told by the cashier.  After a while the older gentleman running the oven asked what order I was waiting on and I told him.  No response back but assumed at this point my pizza was at least in the oven.  After 10 minutes longer I again asked about the status as it appeared my pizza had just been put in the oven.  Ends up it was my pizza.  Why would you tell people 25 minutes when you know the pick-up time is closer to an hour, and why not have the courtesy to tell someone when they are waiting to pick up their order that it hasn't even been put in the oven yet?  Very poor service on several levels."}
{"text":"I bought many deals for restaurant from Groupon. They are all great deals except this Luciano's Restaurant. I went there today right after I bought it from Groupon. Food is not even fresh. I waited their for half hour and they brought me some cold stuff. The price is way expensive. Dont trust the five stars reviews. They are all fake and I really disappointed about it. They forced me to pay 18% tip. What hell is that? If I could rate it 0 star, I would."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, subs, and calzone.  As a popular place, wait times to get seated and served are sometimes a problem.  Overall, good food at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. Food was cold.  The service was very slow and not personable.  Waitress was one of the worst I've ever had.  It was as if she was doing us a favor by waiting on us.  Needs improvement or the waitresses need less tables"}
{"text":"We have coming to this restaurant for years. I have noticed the past year or so that soft drink and iced tea refills are not offered, even if the server notices that your glass is empty. I was in Belgium a couple of years ago, and saw that if you need a refill, you wave your glass in the air and this alerts the server. I guess this is what you need to do at this restaurant."}
{"text":"On Sat. Feb. 28, 2015 we stopped at this restaurant after a hockey tournament.  The meal was not that bad even though we ordered mussels as an appetizer and half to the mussels were not open.  They were sent back and the next order was the same yet they still charged us for them????  I later notice on my bill that my drink( which was Makers Mark on the rocks) I was charged $2.00 for the rocks(ice).  If I had known that I would have gotten the drink straight.  The kids had pizza and were charged extra for the pepperoni.  This restaurant is a rip off joint.  I will never stop there again and will advise all of my friends as to the restaurants policy."}
{"text":"I can only recommend foods like pizza, Stromboli and their sandwiches (they have amazing breadsticks too). The dinners here are inconsistent, often bland and I suspect they overuse microwave ovens. The atmosphere is also nice, but I wouldn't recommend anything other a night of beer and pizza here."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to write this review because I USED TO love and frequent Luciano's but, it has gone way down hill. Your best bet is to stick to a calzone or hoagie because they are typically okay and fairly priced. They started chopping up their salads (small) which I don't understand...lettuce/salads are cheap why get chinsey on them? You're lucky if you get a meatball in a cup of wedding soup...I just don't get it...why the changes? You are loosing loyal customers!"}
{"text":"Food is good, overpriced in my opinion, but was good for an occasional treat. Pasta Luciano is yummy which is their red sauce and alfredo sauce mixed together. Chicken Parm is another favorite. The Wedding Soup is spot on. 

The servers are usually very pleasant but the hostesses and managers are TERRIBLE. They have the attitude that you are bothering them by being there and if something is wrong, they try to turn it around on you. If that only happened once, I'd just brush it off, but it has happened several times. Sorry, but when you order a pizza for delivery and they bring you something completely different, I'm not taking partial blame for that. 

I'd suggest you just go to Tillie's Restaurant down the road."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try the place as I drive by it all of the time, but when we went last night I was definitely disappointed. The sauce was good, but everything else was bland. I had the shrimp alfredo, and my hubby had lasagna. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food.  Everyone raves about their pizza.  To me, it's good, but definitely not my favorite, but I'd eat it any day over a lot of others.  The rest of their food I tried is pretty good.  Service is always pretty good.  Sometimes the place is a bit busy, but no busier than if you went somewhere like the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Now even ordering pizza is a risk.  About a month ago my husband called to order a pizza and they said 15 minutes.  It took almost an hour for the pizza to be ready, yet they were still telling everyone on the phone 15 minutes for pickup.  The last time I ordered pizza for pickup the girl on the phone was really rushed and they forgot 1 of the 2 toppings I had asked for.  I'm just not ready to give up on the pizza yet but we will see."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Bad wine. Less than stellar  food.  Server never asked if our food was good.  Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"The italian dishes are good...but your pizza has a lot to be desired. Lots of toppings but no flavor. We threw away the left overs and thats unusual."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this place! I have been eating here (actually at the original location) since I was a child. However on more than one occasion I have received horrible food! My most unpleasant experience was wish I ordered a pizza for pick up and when I got home the crust was burnt and there were barely any toppings and the cheese was only on half!!! Like HELLO. Someone actually thought it was acceptable to put that in the box. Terrible. Not to mention their pieces aren't the cheapest. I have refused to return. Go to Woodys instead!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of much here.  Pasta sauce is sweet as well as the pizza sauce.  Bread sticks with cheese and garlic are awesome. But again if you like sweet sauce this place is for you.  I do like their Alfredo pizza as well. Just average"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start. My past few visits, the food and service have went downhill. The past two pizzas we got were tasteless. Today was the worst.
I came for lunch with my daughter about noon, the resturant was less than half full. I stood in the waiting area to be seated for a good 15 minutes before someone even acknowledged us,  even tho multiple workers saw us. We were the only ones waiting the entire time, I even walked into the bar looking for someone to seat us. 
After we finally got seated we sat there for another 10 minutes before someone came over. We ordered as soon as someone did. I got my salad which was just some average iceberg lettuce with two cherry tomatoes and a cucumber slice. Then the wait began. We waited. And waited. And waited. 45 minutes to get one small bowl of awful penne and three pieces of bruschetta. The sauce tasted like tin can, like old canned tomatoes. Neither of us could eat it because it was so bad. The bruschetta was also terrible. It was hard, crunchy and tasteless. We took maybe four bites of our food and waited for our waiter to return. I told the waiter we didn't want a box. He didnt even ask what was wrong with our meal, just jetted off with my card. Not planning to return."}
{"text":"This is a place that you should go out of your way if you love good Italian food. My server was Autumn and she awesome. Best service I had here was by her!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Luciano's 5 stars because their pizza is my ALL TIME favorite!!!! It never disappoints. I almost always get pepperoni and sausage pizza. There are some downsides to Luciano's, but I normally choose to look past them, but for the sake of the review I'll share. If you're dining in, the drink selection is awful! They literally have the worst tasting drinks ever. If I'm dining in, I normally just bring a bottle of water in my purse. The other downside is the price of their toppings. The price increases per topping depending on which size pizza you get. I got a large pizza not too long ago with two toppings and ended up paying over $20. I think that's a bit ridiculous, however, you just cant find better pizza!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  I see many mention the prices and I find the prices perfect.  Their calzones are massive for the price,  their half is as big as most places whole calzones.  Their pizza is excellent, not sure how anyone could dislike their pizza.  Always good service,  always a good meal,  it's a great place."}
{"text":"Love the eggplant parm (my favorite in the area), Italian hoagie is good, as is the larger one with sausage and pepperoni, like Luccis pizza, their Diablo, and chicken parm too, I've been coming here since the early 80's (in the old rainbow shopping center) their food is consistent.

The restaurant area is noisy and sometimes service can be slow if you're looking for some quiet space you may want to select a booth in the bar area.

We've had 2 events here, my moms wake and granddaughters birthday, both were alright....The only issue I've had was when trying to schedule my dads 80th birthday party, after several attempts, their events coordinator did not call me so we booked at nearby Woodys which worked out to our advantage because we had the entire restaurant to ourselves along with great food and service."}
{"text":"I had never before heard of this casual Italian restaurant, but my husband's grandma recommended that we all eat dinner here. We showed up on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was packed with customers. We had to wait several minutes for a booth near the bar. The bar was not our preference because it was noisy, but at least we got a place to sit. I liked the taste of my house salad, the table bread with olive oil, my broiled cod with broccoli, and my husband's chicken parmesan (yes, I ate some of his food!). The waitress brought out the food without long waits. The price was not expensive. The problem that we had was that the waitress gave only one out of four people a drink refill, so three people had drunk all of their first drink and were very thirsty. I was sucking furiously on my straw to drink the melted ice cube water. Because of the lack of drink refills, my husband left a small tip. Overall: decent food for the price."}
{"text":"Ugh this food is sooo boring and bland. Don't attempt to buy a bottle of wine cause they have no clue how to ring it to sell it to you or open it. I also don't recommend for groups either, the wait for food is long."}
{"text":"I've ordered a few items historically, and have always been happy.  I am primarily a take-out patron.  Tonight we had a pepperoni pizza, which we enjoyed.  I also got some meatballs - I LOVE them!

Service was friendly and my order was ready at the estimated time."}
{"text":"Had the Monday lunch special: good healthy chicken salad with lots of chopped veggies and good balsamic vinegar dressing. Wedding soup was tasty also."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza for sit down family time!
Good service and delicious  food, simple and reasonable prices.
Only dab thing is they take too long to serve and I have not been able to figure out how a simple pizza can take so long."}
{"text":"This is the best place for italian food hands down!!! I actually crave their italian wedding soup, it is the best ever. The service is great and the prices are reasonable. I always recommend Lucianos to everyone. Awesome"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Lunch is very reasonably priced!  Dinner is pricey.  The bread is always very good with their own dipping oil.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Used to love their Chicken Alfredo. After more than one bad experience though, I'll pass. Ordered Chicken Salads for work one time and all that ate it got sick. Was told that it couldn't be from the chicken because food poisoning takes 24hrs. We all got sick right after eating. Food is always cold when delivered too. Overpriced for the quality in my opinion."}
{"text":"We were looking for a bite to eat, close to home, yet somewhere new.  After some thought we ended up at Lucianos in White Oak.  It was odd entering, seeing a sign saying \"Please wait to be seated\" with no hostess or waitstaff in sight.  There were empty tables, so it was odd when someone finally came up and gave us a pager for a 5 minute wait.  Shortly after another hostess arrived, wondered why we were told to wait, and quickly seated us.

When our waitress arrived, we ordered a couple beers and bruchetta for an appetizer.  When it came, it was quite large in size, not portion.  Flavorful and had a zesty marinara sauce on the side.

Dinner was Chicken Parmesan.  This dish is how I gauge an Italian restaurant because it allows me to sample the pasta, sauce, and how well they can cook chicken.  Unfortunately my chicken was significantly overcooked.  Perhaps it was frozen instead of fresh? The sauce was flavorful and the pasta was al dente.  

The BF ordered a meatball calzone.  He felt the meatballs were bland and the only flavor he got was when he added the marinara to it.  

To quote 10 Things I Hate About You:  \"I know you can be overwhelmed and you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed?\"  To me that is Lucianos - sub-par service, decently priced, and certain foods are okay."}
{"text":"It's a real shame about this place. It used to be excellent, but it's really gone down hill. 

To begin with, the salads lately are made up of nothing but lettuce cores, and brown ones at that. There isn't a piece of leaf lettuce to be found, but there are enough carrot shavings to sink a ship. A few years ago they made a real good salad that was full of fresh romaine, but I guess times are tough. The chicken parmesan is chronically undercooked, to the point that it tastes like rubber. 

The employees also disappoint. Sit-down service is okay, but prepare yourself for blood-boiling frustration if you try and place a take out order. The girls working the phones are so distant and inattentive that, the last time I called, they asked me for my name four times, what side I wanted three times, and then put me on hold for 5 minutes, and then hung up on me! I called back and cancelled my order. Take my advice: go there to sit down or don't go at all. This isn't a new occurrence, either; with each (increasingly infrequent) call they seem more stoned. 

I won't give Luciano's one star because of the happy memories I have of this place, but I'll give it the next worst thing. If you want a good meal with good service, drive five minutes down the road to Tillie's in McKeesport."}
{"text":"This place rocks.. employees aren't the friendliest but the pizza is straight awesome !!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times and had a variety of selections from the menu. All have been delicious, served promptly and efficiently from a lot of different waitstaff. Never a bad experience, and not at all hard on the pocketbook. Polenta and the pizzas- especially good!"}
{"text":"Still the best pizza I've ever had.  Many years removed from living around McKeesport, I still have the odd craving for it.  None of the big chain cooked-on-a-conveyor-belt pizzas can even come close.  Definitely the first place I'll stop whenever I go back to visit."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 , i dont throw around the fours and fives. I don't recall  bad meal. On one occasion many months ago, server gave me the other tables veal parm it was so effin yummy. I came back again to see if they would repeat that oopsy. They did not, service was solid, food hot and plentiful, consistant and thats good, nothing fancy. The pie was well prepared and the chicken and pasta was tasty."}
{"text":"Not keeping up. Waiting a long time for entrees. Dirty tables not bussed in a timely fashion. Started and stopped. Pretty unsightly. Doesn't seem that busy for a Tuesday. Wedding soup was good. Bread with oil & spices was nice but we tended to eat too much bread waiting for our food. Flatbread was pretty good but the garlic was a bit acrid tasting. Server didn't clear soup bowl or dirty plates very timely but service was exceptionally friendly. I'd come back."}
{"text":"This is a nice place with good and economical Italian food and a full bar.  My eggplant parmesan was special.  We enjoyed our shared Caesar salad.  Our group also had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and a side of fries (go figure).  All were good, as was the cosmopolitan.  As an added bonus, the bar had the Oakland Warriors vs Cavaliers game 3 on TV."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was a bit slow but it looked like they only had one server working.  I would definitely go back"}
