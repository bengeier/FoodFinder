{"text":"Great food, fair prices, love the choice of how spicy you want each item. Great for accommodating kids who are sensitive to spice and grown ups who love it!"}
{"text":"C'est un très bon restaurant thaï  avec des serveurs très aimables
Je vous conseille d'y aller"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any of the food options here. It's all FANTASTIC!! It can be a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today for a late lunch. The service was amazing! The staff was so sweet, friendly and so helpful and really took care of me. The food was extremely fresh and the portion sizes were fabulous! I got the fried tofu for an app and the grand salad for my entree. Usually I am disappointed after a salad entree because I am still hungry afterwards, but that was not the case here! The portion was filling. The inside is decorated VERY well and I loved the beautiful bowls the food was served in. Overall, amazing experience and I can't wait to come back! I will post photos."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is outstanding! I've had multiple things from the menu and have yet to come across something I didn't like. If you like curry, specifically yellow curry, definitely try it here it is my favorite dish so far! The spicy greens beans are also pretty good! The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the service. One time we had to wait close to 45 minutes to get our food, granted there was a HUGE party there that got served just after we sat down so I assume that slowed the kitchen up. The other time we didn't have to wait long for our food at all but after our food came, we didn't see our waiter again for close to an hour (me and my girlfriends were catching up so we didn't really mind). Buy besides the service, this place has some pretty tasty Thai food!"}
{"text":"I went to lunch here with a friend today and was pretty disappointed. I ordered the lunch special fried rice with beef and added pineapple. The soup that came with the meal was fine (although it had chicken in it and the waiter didn't tell us which was not ideal for my vegetarian companion), but the rest of the meal was pretty bland. The most disappointing part of the rice dish was the beef. It tasted like a cheap cut of meat that you would find at a chain Mexican restaurant and it lacked spices. The saving grace of the dish was the pineapple, which is not typically part of the dish. Too bad, I had high hopes for this place but I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"So yummy. My wife had the yellow curry; I had the spicy noodles with basil and chicken. I probably went a little too hot with a 4, but I still really enjoyed it. If you decide something needs more heat, they have the sauces and spices at the table so go lower if you aren't sure!

The unsweet tea is the delicious Thai version: no sweetener needed."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Thai E-San for years and it's probably the best Thai I've had in Phoenix. Service is great, always greeted warmly and promptly. Food is super tasty and great portions for great prices. I would highly recommend coming here to anyone looking for a good meal (and a joke or two from Rex -- just ask for one, you won't be sorry!)"}
{"text":"Wow!! I must say this was the Best Thai food that we had in Arizona!! We had the Pat Thai, Lemongrass soup with shrimp, papaya salad with crab, sticky rice, fish with ginger, all the food we had it to a medium spicy. Every food that we had was just perfect very flavorful they had extra spices on the side which I thought I might need to use but. ( I love spicy food ) but like I said everything was seasoned perfect!! 
Being here on vacation when u see the restaurant don't we fooled by the outside. The restaurant is so clean, cute decorations, VERY attentive staff, restaurant full with business people for lunch. You know this Resturant is good!! If I live here I would come back here.  But being from Hawaii you can only come when ur on vacation. I'm gonna miss this Resturant!! Definitely going to come back when I come visit to Arizona!!"}
{"text":"Twas'  a Friday evening and I worked way too late, so  I decided to pick something up to go at a relatively new Thai  restaurant close to where I live. 

Thai E-San doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you walk inside - you are transported to a different world.  Although I have never been to Thailand, I could only imagine that this is the kind of restaurant one might find there.  Beautiful tapestries, huge granite- inlay  tables  and an ambiance that transports you to a different place and time.
For a Friday night at 7p.m. it wasn't that busy - only three other tables- two of which were single guys.  So I ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with shrimp only , and was offered a seat while I waited.  The only server  working asked me if I would like water or tea and since I thought that it would only be a few minutes,  I politely thanked her but declined.
45 minutes later.........
 I finally had my to-go  order.  But please , let me digress.......

After 20 minutes of waiting  I got up and stood in front of the reception counter and looked into the kitchen.  There were only two persons working in the kitchen; I assumed one to be the cook and a prep cook. I had asked the only server who was running ragged ( mostly to the kitchen asking (in Thai?? ) where the food was).  She told me the cooks were from Thailand.  

 It looked like a Laurel and Hardy comedy back there.   The (prep cook?) kept wringing her hands and pulling her hair  and dropping things.  The cook (I assume) kept yelling at the poor woman (no wonder she was discombobulated). 

Ok . let's talk about the food.   My Pad Thai was ok.  I had asked for a side of the chili sauce (which they forgot to add) as  I like my food spicy.  These were really mild.  Also , the noodles were gummy and stuck together.  I was wondering if they overcooked the noodles in their confusion to get the other diners food out (which, I observed also took way too much time) .

I have read some rave reviews about this place.  So I do want to give it another try before giving my final decision. I am willing to forego some hiccups with service and food as I appreciate the fact that this is an authentic restaurant with immigrants from Thailand, and that it may take some time to get their act together to  provide consistency in service and food.  I really do want them to succeed.  I'll try again next month so as to give them some time to get their act together.  Hopefully, I'll have a better review next time.        Chow for now :-)"}
{"text":"The quality of their food is fine, but the value of the meal is weak. I felt that my Thai curry dish could have used more \"meat\" and vegetables since they added an extra dollar to the tab for the vegetables. We also ordered the vegetable dish in the brown sauce with shrimp for $12.95. The shrimp was good, but it just seems a bit pricey for a dish with just vegetables. I feel that I like Thai Rama (located on Camelback Rd) better for their value, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hey! Thai E-San, I'm back.
I just went to Thai E-San last Sunday. It was busy day! I ordered appetizer #angel wings to start with. Then TOm Yum soup came right after angel wings, it took us 15-20 min to finish those soup and appetizer. The meal came a little late BUT the taste was so GOOD. My spicy eggplant was little too hot, but don't worry I love it! I'm not a big fan of noodle dish but my mom ordered Rad Nah noodle with gravy sauce. That dish was surprise me! I think I like noodle from now on. We would love to try mango sticky rice for dessert BUT we were so full , maybe next time. The food portion was so big, finally we finished it all, and have a very great evening!!! 

Thank you Thai E-San, I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Second time we have been there, the service is Great. Food is Excellent and they are willing to tweak your order to your taste. 
The best part is they will take a reservation, we called and set up a time with 8 people and 2 babies, how nice to arrive and have the table set-up with high chairs and no impatient babies raisin hell.
So impressed, will be back and tell everyone we know!"}
{"text":"all the naysayers seem have a bone to pick, the service here is incredible and the food is better.  vegan options as well and staff that helps make sure your order has no egg or fish sauce.  if your looking for thai, this is the best place in the valley we have been to, and being vegan, we have been to too many to count"}
{"text":"We recently stopped into this gem for some delicious Thai food. Highly recommend them to anyone who wants a nice atmosphere, great service, fantastic food, and just an over all wonderful experience. The staff couldn't have been more nice, professional, and attentive. The Food was absolutely delicious, highly recommend there pineapple curry if you like a hint of sweetness with your curry. At the end our waitress packaged our left overs and added a small side of rice  to go along with the left overs, which was so incredibly generous and thoughtful of her. She said that you shouldn't have to eat curry without rice. Our experience here was an overall pleasant one. Definitely  will be back and will recommend to all friends looking for a great Thai experience."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Consistently good service since eating here for the last four years.  I live off in Buckeye so it's a bit of a trek but the food is so worth it!  Staff is always friendly and polite."}
{"text":"We were at the Thai E-San recently as our friends had recommended it. The food was less than luke warm, like it was sitting in the kitchen and quickly put together. The restaurant was not even closing for another hour, so that was not an excuse. I am not in the habit of complaining, as the food should at least be hot when it arrives at the table. It was not as flavourful either. Very, very disappointed. I would not recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Ab so lute ly delish..

I luv Thai food.. I mean it's my very favorite..
I've eaten at all the local Thai places.  But we only just found this one.
We ordered the Thai cashew pork, chicken pa nang, and the pad Thai.. 
Along with Thai iced coffees..
Excellent food, great friendly service.  Nice atmosphere.
Average price per person with drink and appetizers is about $17.00..
An absolute must try.."}
{"text":"Great food. Beautiful atmosphere. Friendly staff. We will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"So the owner/management has changed so not my first place to drive a long distance to!"}
{"text":"Best Thai experience that I've had in phoenix/in awhile. Wonderful staff, very inviting. Good was amazing! Can't wait to come back! 

Recommendations: drunkin noodle dish and the egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I really hope this isn't the best thai Phoenix has to offer. It was decent. I don't like how they prepare the tofu and that's usually a speciality for me at thai spots. And then this is funny but not: we ordered brown rice. Didn't know about extra charge but don't care either. Lunches came out with white rice as supposed to. I mentioned I want brown rice. They were quick to scoop up our plates, put that white rice BACK for the next customer (not cool), and happily brought us each our own orders of $2 brown rice (we could have shared one). But!.... If white rice is included and I had to pay $2 extra for brown rice; wasn't i entitled to the white rice already on my plate as well, rather than it being \"recycled\" for next customers? Just saying"}
{"text":"Not good.
Very bland Thai food, ugh, the two words do not belong together, bland and Thai!
The Peanut sauce was the worst ever.
The Pad Thai and Tom Ka Gai soup were blech.
Fresh rolls large but no flavor.
The service was decent though.
Just disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. Best Thai I've had in Phoenix by far! Everything I've eaten has been delicious and the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Had the Spicy Fried Rice for lunch today. The food was excellent and the service was great."}
{"text":"Good Thai food when you order off the menu.  My favorite is their clear broth Tom Yum soup.

Don't come here for the lunch buffet though - it's not real Thai food and is loaded with MSG."}
{"text":"Always friendly and welcoming.  Food is ALWAYS fantastic.  The menu is extensive, and no matter what new thing I try, I'm never disappointed.  The coconut soup and Thai fried rice are particular favorites.  Oh, and make sure you know what you're asking for on the spice level before you order it.  \"Thai spicy\" are not for the faint of heart. :)"}
{"text":"I luv this place. 

Today I have a cold so chicken curry is exactly what I need to clear my head. .

Best Thai in the city by far."}
{"text":"It was a dark and stormy night... no it wasn't.

We were all set for an evening in with wine, trivia games and crappy TV... What better to cap it off  with then with some Thai food.

This place is across from our weekly grocery store staple fresh and easy, and we had heard a bit about it.

We stopped in to Thai E-San and perused the menu, both electing for the safe choice of Pad Thai.

We returned home, cocktails full and settled in with forks and empty stomachs, writhing in anticipation of the delicious smells...

Thats where the good things ended.  The fresh eggrolls were overloaded with mint, and the pad thai noodles where way over cooked into a mushy mess.

Guess we'll have to stick with cherry blossom for our pad thai cravings from now on."}
{"text":"The Thai iced tea is so good here. I had the egg roll appetizer and the red curry with seafood. Everything was delicious. 4/5 on the heat scale was was perfectly spicy and had my nose running."}
{"text":"I Love the service. The owner always remembers me. The spicy red curry white chicken meat is to die for. I never get enough of it. Don't miss out. Come and bring your hugery with you. Gotta love the food"}
{"text":"We had the sampler appetizers to start with which was excellent.  Then we ordered the Thai Baroque chicken  and the Crispy spicy chicken sauce. All the food was awesome. Cozy little place. I will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"I've been to several Thai restaurants in the valley and this one is my favorite. Great food with great service!"}
{"text":"My goodness this place was outstanding! I asked for the hottest spice level (5) and they actually delivered to the point where I didn't need to add any additional sauces from their free selections on the table.  This in of it self is an automatic 4 stars minimum since I've been disappointed numerous times at other thai, indian, mexican, etc. restaurants.

Past the outstanding heat level the curry itself  still had a great flavor and creaminess and was served with a nice side of rice in a separate container.

Can't believe it took me this long to finally try this place. I was missing out."}
{"text":"Have yet to find really good thai food in Phoenix area. Can anybody help??? Super friendly people otherwise I'd probably give two stars. Bbq chicken was sketch and drunken noodle was uninspired."}
{"text":"No stars the waiter told us as we left that sinces there was not tip given he would not serve us any more. If he wanted a tip he should have been a better server...  not going back there again."}
{"text":"Was in town for business and tried it out. Excellent food. Hope I get the chance to good back."}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood Thai restaurant! We discovered it months ago & come back every time we're in Phoenix.

Like:
Pad Thai
Silver Noodle Soup
Pineapple Fried Rice
Thai Iced Tea
Service - server & owner kind & attentive! Come over & chat with customers

Wish:
They opened in Riverside Ca!"}
{"text":"Right next to my house and they have a great menu. Prompt and delicious. The staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"One thing is great customer service. For the first time the owner of the restaurant responded to my review and took it as advice to better the restaurant. For that I change my rating from 3 to 5 stars because the only reason it was a three was customer service. Besides this, the food is amazing and priced very reasonably. Definitely one of the better thai restaurants in Phoenix"}
{"text":"The green curry and Pad See Yoo are excellent, and the staff is exceptionally (and very genuinely) kind and welcoming.  Thai iced tea is amazing and delicious."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai we've had in phoenix. Very authentic. The heat levels are not kidding around. No one I know has been able to enjoy higher than a 3 without crying."}
{"text":"Food....average taste. Portion size was a little small for the price. Definitely not the best Thai I've ever had but better than some others.

Ambiance...from the outside looks a little shady. I got takeout but seemed a little dark inside.

Staff...friendly.

Verdict....if you need a Thai fix, I guess this passes. The portion size, at least for takeout, was ridiculously small."}
{"text":"Our second visit to this gem. This will be a short review - you should go. Spicy options from 1-5 - if you decide to go level 5 ask for a thick stack of paper napkins. Excellent service. Easy parking."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend from Bangkok and we had a lovely dinner.  I highly recommend the green papaya salad, the spicy catfish, and the pad thai.  They now have a liquor license, so you can cool your mouth with a beer or glass of wine :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Some of the best Thai food in Phoenix!  The owners are wonderful and extremely friendly and hilarious!  I always have an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Great place has really big tables but good food . Curry beef the best . Been there more than once !"}
{"text":"Wow!! We lived so close to this gem and had never been there; if not for a Living Social deal, we might never have found it; You can bet we will be constant customers now. We had dinner, and it was wonderful; now, I see the reviews for the weekend brunch, got to try it also.
We went for the combination platter for our appetizer, and yummy. Both of us loved it all, tho I must say the Satay was great and the Peanut Butter sauce almost as good as my hubby makes.(can't say better, or I will be in trouble). 
For the entrée, he had a Stir Fried Basil, with combo meats, and he loved it!!!I was having a hard time choosing and my server kindly offered to help by asking me what I liked and how spicy; Have to say, he chose great; It was the Stir Fry Silver noodles with vegetables,, and chicken. Never had Silver noodles before, but sure will again.  Suffice to say we loved it all, and yummy on all the sauces.
The ambience is also nice, and we were treated so well by the staff we felt like VIP's!
You can bet we recommend it, and we cant wait to go back and try other menu items; The menu is extensive, and if it is all as good as last night, we will become regulars.  I sure would recommend you try it out. Prices are reasonable, also."}
{"text":"Had lunch here twice. I thought the food was really tasty and the service was great. It was 2 Saturdays in a row around lunch time. The place was empty both times but seemed to have a busy takeout business. The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Best thai food in phoenix. The owners, Pui is super friendly and remembers her regulars. Must eat! Can't give it a 5 because it is overpriced. Would eat more often if it was more reasonable."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Thai food with nice ambiance. I ordered take out and they packed the food well and were great about having it ready when I got there."}
{"text":"Hands down the best teriyaki chicken I've ever had. I have been frequenting this restaurant for a few years now and have absolutely loved everything I have eaten there. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend this place and would give it 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Visited on a Sunday around 3pm with a friend and were the only 2 in the restaurant. Tried the pad thai and terriyaki chicken. Loved the huge portions, friendly staff, huge granite table and ethnic background music."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is good and the service is better. We visited a few weeks ago and had the pad thai. You can't go wrong with that. Tofu dishes are good as well, but nothing is better than the lemon grass soup. Yum."}
{"text":"I really liked this place until tonight.

I have a very serious allergy to fish. I know as such that it is a risk to go to any \"ethnic\" place. However, its always worked out that if I tell them in advance that \"hey, if you serve me fish I am going to die\" that 99% of places step up. While I loathe our ultra litigious society (and thus I am a self loathing lawyer) when it comes to this sort of thing, my ilk has got it right. If they try to kill you, sue the hell out of them.

Tonight we were at a loss what to get for dinner. But wait, Thai E-San has done us right in the past, the food isn't greasy, and its pretty good though not authentic in any shape or form to Isan food.

We called in our to go order, and not once, not twice, but three times we told the woman on the phone to make sure that the spring rolls were vegetarian. Get it home, open it up, and low and behold its shrimp egg rolls. 

I've learned over the years that if the food in the bag has fish on it, all of the food has fish on it. I can't afford to be down 5 days right now because someone can't get the order right over the phone.

What it really came down to was that at the same time someone phoned in a $150 order when we ordered our food. They made a conscious choice to go with the bigger order and to mess up an order of a regular. 

Well, that's pretty simple for me. Won't ever going back in there. Ended up wasting $40 on dinner that I can't eat or smell. Awesome. I'd tell anyone who asks if you're looking for Thai in Phoenix, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"For all intents and purposes, this place delivers what is promised; good Thai food. The coconut soup was surprisingly delicious and so was the yellow chicken curry. I think we'll come back for some coconut flavored ice cream. Delish!"}
{"text":"Great service! Foods delicious.  The large table next to me had alot of different plates and they loved everything as well. Coconut ice cream is really good for dessert.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite Thai restaurant. The service is great.
Their wontons are nice and crispy. Their egg rolls are delicious.  My favorite dish is there Pad Thai with tofu and vegetables and there sweet ginger. Spice levels ranges from 1 to 5 And I  stick around a 2-3.
They also have a really amazing lunch menu. Lunch starts off with a soup of the day, wonton egg roll and your entrée."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in central Phoenix, hands down.  

If you are looking for tasty, authentic Thai food that is prepared with fresh ingredients rather than an Americanized version of Thai food, Thai E San is the place you want to go.  We dine in and ordered take out regularly and we are always pleased.  The food is consistent and the flavors are very authentic.  The restaurant staff are pleasant and very attentive. The portions are a good size and their prices are reasonable, especially considering the excellent quality of their food.  

And as a vegetarian I have to say that they know how to cook tofu and don't skimp on it in their dishes. And the variety of options here for vegetarians is very good. The tofu satay is a must.  Their vegetarian Pad Thai and Massaman Curry are 2 of our favorite dishes.  Everything we've tried has been delicious!"}
{"text":"In an effort to be nice, let me just say this.  If you are going to try this place for the first time, try not to get your order to-go. This way you can make adjustments and hopefully get your food to have some flavor. I guess I should have known something was amiss when the order was called in and nobody asked how spicy to prepare the dishes.  The pad thai was mushy and bland.  The thai style chow mein had more firmness in the noodles, but still required extra soy sauce.  I will give some credit to the egg rolls that were pretty decent and not overly deep friend."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and the service is even better!!! Had the Papaya Salad with lime, peanuts and shrimp....thought I would try something new.....Sweet Baby Jesus it was GREAT!!!! Spicy as hell, but that's probably why I loved it even more. The sticky rice and Iced Thai coffee are also really good! Great Place!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Phoenix. Great atmosphere. Will never go anywhere else.  Must try!!!!!!  Thank you for the amazing service. Staff is amazing from the moment you walk in to the time you leave."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous lunch today, choosing Royal yellow curry and Pad Thai, then coconut ice cream for desert.  It was our first visit and we were welcomed warmly by the charming owner who sat and visited with us.  An already wonderful day was tremendously enhanced by finding a delightful Thai restaurant where we will become regulars."}
{"text":"Food is hit and miss... but then menu is funny.  They the traditional soups, but they don't call the soups by their Thai name, Tom kha or Tom yum. I had Tom kha which they call coconut soup, it was quite good with chicken, plenty of chicken and mushrooms.  Second dish is number 70 in the menue, it was a disaster, Pa nang beef, it was soupy, and beef portion was so small that I  had to dig for it, beef was over coocked.  Third dish chicken snd namboo, again vrry small portion of chicken and strangely spiced, this is number 48 on the menue. NEITHER DISHES WAS GOOD. Nice portion of rice, here you pay $2 extra for brown rice. I would rather stick to Wild Thaiger.  The reason I went to this restaurant was because Sunday noon Wild Thaiger is closed!  It is over valued by LOCAL who give it high ranking in Yelp. Mediocare food!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find. I was in the area on a date and chose this place for their positive reviews on Yelp. The food is amazing!!! This is my go to Thai restaurant from now on! Please be sure to try the spring rolls and thai tea for me."}
{"text":"I am quite fond of the decor, and chu chee duck. Especially with eggplant. And all the staff are lovely people!"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai Food in the valley! The staff is very friendly. If you're looking for an authentic Thai restaurant than look no further. Their curry is delicious and their coconut ice cream is home made. I visit here at least once a week and always end up ordering another meal for lunch the next day. Very clean and plenty of tv to watch baseball or basketball"}
{"text":"My first Thai E-San experience was just funny.  Shortly after they opened, I went in for take-out.  There were all these menu possibilities (e.g., fish in noodles, etc...) that I had never seen before.  So, adventurous me decides: Must order.  

Well, this inspires lots of interesting looks .... and finally (ions later) the food comes out and they say \"well, we never really made that dish with fish ... It might not be good... if not, return it...\"  (No, they didn't think to say something before they prepared the food...)  I go home and find myself separating the fish from the rest of the dish and eating the two dishes. 

So, after that ... long Thai E-San haitis...

Find myself back there.  This time I ordered pad thai, figuring that they must have prepared pad thai.  The wait was shorter.  The pad thai came and the first thing that I realized was holding the pad thai package was like weightlifting... Yes, there was just that much food!  The food was good.  It was fresh.  But, seriously, it could feed a military.  The military of a small country, but a military. 

My big complaint (after the fact that their portions are HUGE) was a massive lack of heat.  Next time I will ask for uber-spicy..."}
{"text":"It was lunch time on a Sunday afternoon and I was craving Thai. I pulled up the Yelp app on my iphone and started searching. The first place I went to wasn't actually where Yelp said it was. Strike one. The second place I went to wasn't open. Either they were closed on Sundays or only for dinner. Strike two. The third and final location I was going to try was Thai E-San. The building was where Yelp said it was and they were open. Third times the charm. 

Pretty good sized menu. Lots of seafood options. Nice list of appetizers. Full bar. And really spicy dishes. Score! 

When ever I try a new Thai place I almost always go with the Pad Thai. To me it's the dish to judge how all their other dishes will be and so far it has served me well. Their Pad Thai was no exception.

I loved it, the son loved it. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area and I'm ecstatic to have found an amazing thai restaurant so close to me. Making a big move to an entirely different city is always scary, but to leave behind your favorite restaurants? That's a different story. A short walk down from my place reminds me of where I came from.

It doesn't get more wholesome than this! This is delicious thai food! The Massaman Curry with chicken is amazing! Honestly, anything in the Massaman Curry is a great choice! The curry is so smooth and the peanut sauce makes it so creamy. The crab puffs are so good! They are filled with crab meat, which is unusual to find in the landlocked state of Arizona.

I am happy to have found this amazing thai restaurant a walk away from my apartment. I moved in a month ago, I've already had take out more times than I can count! If this wasn't so close to where I live, I'd starve! I suggest this restaurant to anyone and everyone! Go in, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"One of the Best places for thai, even simple things like Fried Tofu are really good. Had the Tom Yum and red curry and I loved it, the soup is some of the best I've had in the Phoenix area. Amazing decor as well, especially at Christmas time!
*a good drinks selection too for their sake*"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great customer service! Definitely a place to come back and visit if you love Thai food. Also, the perfect spot for those who love spicy food!"}
{"text":"Been driving past this place for years and never noticed-mainly because was never a big Thai food fan.  Fortunately for them, my GF is, and I did the research to find a nice, homey Thai restaurant for a special occasion.  They didn't disappoint.  She loved her food, I'm now a fan of their Gai Ping (peanut sauce is amazing), and their service was almost too good!"}
{"text":"So I wanted something different than the normal.  My wife and I split the lemon grass soup . as a appetizer it could serve 4. We both  ordered different types of curry and everything was really tasty."}
{"text":"First time here.
The inside is very welcoming, nice environment. Can't tell from the exterior it's this pleasant.

Customer service, very pleasant, our waiter was very friendly and attentive.

When I usually go to a Thai restaurant, I'm always looking for a good tomyumgong soup, unfortunately, this is not the place for me, the soup needed more flavor for my taste. 
However, the pad Thai and the spicy fried rice were good.
I probably will come back only if I'm in the area, not take a special trip to come here.
I hope they improve on their Tom yum goong."}
{"text":"I was starving and asked to Yelp for a good Thai restaurant. I found an excellent red curry.

Two thumbs up !!"}
{"text":"Just came home.  After an hour of waiting for our food after ordering, we just walked out.  And this on a Sunday evening when the place wasn't even full.  We weren't the only ones; everyone looked like they had camped out for quite a while without being served their food.  And not a word from the owner or anyone else to acknowledge that there was a problem.  A total insult.  No food is worth an hour wait."}
{"text":"Found this little gem in the way through Phoenix.   The food was delicious, portions average, and service was great.  We tried the curry and I'd definitely come back for it again!"}
{"text":"I only give 5 stars when a restaurant exceeds my expectations and tonight this place did that. The services was amazing.
The lemongrass soup with shrimp incredible....seriously the shrimp were huge and tender and absolutely delicious. The noodles with shrimp were just as wonderful as the rest of the meal. Everything about our dinner was great tonight."}
{"text":"So, Thai E-San, let's get down to business. 

PREMISE
-------------
I was hungry. I wanted dinner. But not a break the bank dinner. So it was either Gallo Blanco or Thai food. Guess which won.

SCENE
-----------
Sitting discreetly on Indian School, facing the former shoeboxed-size aura of Chez Nous (now the fluorescent-lit cube which is Fresh N' Easy). 

You walk in, and then find your way around some wooden partitions to encounter a room which is surprisingly very ornate. Painted walls, heavy, ornate tables and chairs (all of which still have the shrink-wrapped plastic covering on them - LOL). Traditional Thai folk music softly playing overhead...

I was the only customer at this point, expecting a friend to join me. I told the traditionally-dressed hostess there'll be a party of two. The room, however, did not have any table even remotely that small. She sat me at a round table for 6, which is fine, just a little amusing. I wondered what their lunch scene was like with a bunch of single diners eating on these giant tables.

FOOD AND SERVICE
------------------------------
My friend joined me a few minutes later and it took us a while to get our hostess' attention, given we were seated out of sight from the kitchen behind the wooden partition. We eventually ordered the following:

* Green papaya salad
* Drunken noodles with chicken
* Massaman curry with beef

All were ordered to be Thai spicy. Now, never in a Phoenix Thai restaurant have they actually made anything extra spicy (or done it well) whenever I've requested it, so I was skeptical, but thought it was worth trying anyway.

And so...

* Green Papaya salad - They sure as hell made it Thai spicy! It was good and I was loving the heat. Very fresh tasting (at least that evening). My friend was dying a little, slowly melting beside me, but was a trooper and kept on eating. Good work, amigo! Rating: 4/5

* Drunken noodles with chicken - If they actually gave us this dish, I'd more accurately rate it. However, what was placed in front of us was chicken stir fried with basil. No noodles anywhere. Neither of us were patient enough for them to take it back and make the correct dish, so we ate it anyway. Wasn't spicy. Wasn't bad either, per se, but not very memorable. 3/5

* Massaman curry with beef - I'm a big fan of this southern Thai dish when it's done well. The flavors are usually pretty distinguishable from the other coconut milk-based curries on a Thai restaurant menu (which should be the point) but this one wasn't really. Kind of generic and not very spicy either. And just like the previous dish - not bad, but not memorable either. 3/5

* Service - Decent, but non existent at times, which was weird given that we were the only diners in the room the entire time. Also, getting your orders wrong when there's no one else's orders to mix them up with is not so great.

FINAL VERDICT
----------------------
So it's an \"ok\" kind of place. Started out promising but drifted a little downwards from there. Ornately done room and very reasonable prices (which is a plus). 

Would I eat here again? I think so. Maybe they had an off evening and nothing I had was bad.

Would I recommend it to others? If they're really curious about it, maybe. But in terms of Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area, there are definitely some better ones around (then again, there are worse ones, too). 

Thai E-San sits comfortably in the middle of the pack.  

3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is fast and has a great selection of Thai food. I love spicy and their Thai hot is unmatched. Servers are very friendly and it is extremely reasonably priced. Definitely my favorite Thai in the valley.

{"text":"I stopped in to pick up some Green Curry tofu to go, and have to agree that unless you've got a crew, the seating setup doesn't  seem like it would lend itself to intimate dining. But it's not anything unexpected as far as decor. Much like the Indian restaurants on 8th Street in NYC, if it doesn't look like the inside of a fully lit Christmas tree, there's something wrong.  I enjoyed the substantive look of the chairs and tables, actually. Compared to the converted diner look of Thai Rama, there's much more opportunity for ambience in the evening, for sure.

Back to my food: I asked for it hot, and said \"I can handle it.\" I likes me some spicy. The hostess was super nice and I waited maybe ten minutes before my to-go bag arrived.  As a lunch special, it came with a spring roll and soup, which made quite the spread for ten bucks. The green curry was awesomely spicy, savory and the veggies were nice and crisp, however, I would have liked a firmer tofu in it. The rice was nice and sticky and aromatic, too. 

Overall, I think Thai E San gave me a great calling card with that one dish. I will definitely go back with friends to try some more dishes we can all share to explore more of what the restaurant has to offer."}
{"text":"The first time i came here was when they first opened. So i thought i would give it another try. As i was craving Thai food.     I hoped they were still open as most places close @2:30 pm.    Yes they were open and they serve lunch specials till 3:00pm/ Wonderful!  Guess what else???? They do not close after lunch and reopen for dinner. They just stay open.                                                                                 You know when you want food, but cannot go until 3, but nothing is open till 5:00. No worries here they are open all day!                                                                  When i came in at 2:30 i was the only one there,though more people came in later. It smelled wonderful and i was greeted and sat immediately.   My waiter Julio was adorable and sweet. He brought me some lovely hot green tea in a half glass Tea pot. It was delish!  The decor is very nice with a lot of sparkle. Slight Christmas decorations tasteful and not over done. Bathrooms were nice and clean as well.                         For food, I got the yellow curry with Shrimp. First he brought out the soup that came with  it. Wonderful chicken and rice soup. It was so good.                                          Spice taste is 1 through 5, i ordered a 3.  The rice was fluffy and not all stuck together as some places have. The curry dish was incredible, it also came with an egg roll and some fried chips. Even the egg roll was good with fresh veg inside.  I am so happy i went there. I can't wait to go back. After you have finished your meal, they bring you some fresh cut watermelon.  Just enough to clean your palette.     This is the place to be!!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had in Phoenix!  Service was great.  Food was amazing.  Kept eating even after I was stuffed."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch on a Sunday ~2 pm and was surprised to find the place half full

Great service and delicious Thai food coming from someone who has eaten a lot of Thai all over the US

Got the papaya salad, red curry with veggies (lots of fresh veggies included), and spicy basil noodles with chicken 

Everything was delish; minor points: papaya slightly raw, noodle portion slightly small. However plenty for 2 of us to eat and finish. 

Left happily for our flight back to the SF bay area shortly after."}
{"text":"Thai E-San is not as authentic as it gets. I really enjoyed the customer service and the setting of the restaurant. Right off the corner of 7th Avenue and Indian School Road this little restaurant is great for a first Thai experience, however if you're a person who enjoys drinking a soft beverage with their favorite Thai dishes, I would consider the fact that they charge the drink per can. For $1.50 more you can get another can of your favorite soft drink that's if your budget permits to three to five dollars worth of drinks. 

The Thai food is as simple as it gets, the portions are sizable and to ones surprise enough for one to take home! On the tough side, the vegetables to meat/noodle/rice ratio is somewhat uneven, the flavors of egg in most dishes is over powering taking one back to the feeling of breakfast or a less enticing egg sandwich flavor. Over all the food is acceptable but don't hope for high end flavors that take you back to an out of country feel. 

This quiet and relaxing restaurant is very clean and professional, however the constant reminder of the news channel is unnecessary. Let's keep politics out of the table. On the other hand, as one person that doesn't know how Thai food is made, I have experienced other variations of authentic Thai food and this restaurant does not equal to my satisfaction.

{"text":"coming from toronto, where there is an abundance of amazing and authentic thai cuisine - and having visited thailand twice - i have to admit that i am a little picky when it comes to thai restaurants.

thai e-san is the first thai restaurant i have been to in the valley that has really impressed me.  the flavors are incredible - fresh, bold, authentic!  the menu is unique & diverse, the portion sizes are generous and the staff is friendly.  oh and when you say \"spicy\" it actually MEANS \"spicy!\""}
{"text":"Now I am no Thai food expert I've only been to Thai restaurants a dozen times this one was one of my favorite I like the Drunken Noodles probably more than any other place the papaya salad wasn't that good prefer other places better had the sticky rice and ice cream too those are okay now the service is really good explain anything you wanted one and get it by heart but they recommended getting Level 4 probably I would recommend this place to anyone that wanted a pretty good Thai food and good service"}
{"text":"Curry and coconut soup was A-mazing!! We'll be back soon... and often!! Great for take out!"}
{"text":"The food was good & My waitress Alexandra was super sweet!  However,  I gave this place 3 stars because the portions were small and hearing the owner yell at the guys working in back nearly ruined my experience!! I dont like to see people mistreated or belittled and IT IS important to me that I support business that that treat their employees with respect and integrity. That was clearly not the issue here. Still on the hunt for my favorite local Thai restaurant here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The BEST authentic Thai food in the valley! We are so happy to have found this place! We used to drive to Old Town and pay a premium for some really good Thai but this place is less expensive (totally reasonably priced) and even better flavors and service!

The spring rolls (rolled fresh in house daily) are to die for! The panaeng curry is so flavorful and delicious! The pad Thai my husband ordered (not usually one of my go tos) was phenomenal! The best I've had! I actually love it now. It doesn't taste like mushy ketchupy noodles like other places. The jumbo shrimp in it was marinaded, flavorful and high quality! Everything we tasted was amazing!

The service was fantastic! Our server was friendly and sweet. She was fast and knowledgeable. The owner greeted us and checked in during our meal, telling us a bit about the menu and process of making everything fresh daily. She was so nice and hands on! 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my most favorite Thai place I've found in the valley to-date. I'm a sucker for their house pad Thai with chicken as well as their egg rolls and Thai iced tea. I like my Thai a bit spicy and they don't mess around with their levels (1-5). I regularly visit Thai E-San and every time I do visit, the owner remembers me and makes me feel welcome. If you haven't been to Thai E-San, you should definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Consistently the best Thai food in Phoenix.  Service: awesome, food: awesome.  Been going here for years and will continue to do so."}

Parking can be a bit tight so careful if you are going right at busy meal times.  
Staff is friendly and helpful in making selections."}
{"text":"Best Thai food we have had in Phoenix area.
Very friendly owners and wait staff.
Three of us ordered chicken pad Thai, duck red curry, and royal curry combo. All were excellent. Spice levels were 2, 3, and Thai hot. All arrived spiced correctly. We split fresh coconut ice cream and mango sticky rice. Both were very good.
We will be back"}

So far I've had the chicken coconut curry, the drunk noodles, garlic stir fry chicken, pot stickers/dumplings and all were top notch super yum.  Will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai in town. Wonderful food and service. Beef salad is perfect. Satay is really good.  Parking can be a bit of a chore if they are busy.  Agree with others, spice level is skewed towards hotter side. Level 3 is more spicy than most other places."}
{"text":"Came down from California and decided to check out this Thai spot along our trip. Great cuisine and excellent customer service , if we resided down here, this would definitely be our regular Thai spot . We tried the roasted duck curry and was best I've had . Another note is that this is a very friendly kid place !"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place almost every single day for the past couple weeks. My girlfriend never had Thai food before, so I made her try yellow curry with chicken... she now demands it just like how my cat demands canned food.

The royal curry (yellow) with chicken is the best I've had here in Phoenix, as well as the places I've eaten in California. 

The gai ping is amazing as well, I'm still on my binge for that until I move on to something else on the menu. The spinach is fresh and crispy as well, I actually like it a lot. It goes perfect with the dish. This coming from somebody who doesn't really like spinach to begin with.

As far as service, my drink never hits the bottom and the staff checks up on us frequently to make sure we're squared away. They know that perfect balance of leaving you alone, but not neglecting you either. They've got a family vibe at this place, seeing as how it's a family run business, not hard to see why. They treat you like a guest in their house, a friend of the family. It doesn't have a typical restaurant/business transaction feel like many places out there. That's one of the reasons I keep coming here. Rather than the typical song and dance, orchestrated charade, I can actually come here and relax.

The atmosphere is kind of somewhat like a lounge or hang out spot with a very calm setting. The lighting isn't obnoxiously bright (bright lighting pisses me off), the music is nice and relaxing, kind of like 95.5 KYOT back in the day, and it's not very loud either. It's basically the perfect amount of background noise needed for the atmosphere.

The price of this place is actually quite reasonably priced compared to most of the other Asian restaurants I've been to. There's somebody else that commented about the price going up every time he eats here, I don't know what the fuck he's talking about. Your price will change if your order changes, that's a no brainer. 

This place has basically become our default place to eat when we can't decide what we're hungry for."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix, as well as the closest to what I've been missing from back east.  Have been here several times over the past year and a half, and have never had a bad dish.  Clean establishment, great selection, and the food is FAST.  The owner is incredibly friendly, always walking around to check in on guests, and see how their meal is.  My only problem is that I don't live closer to here, otherwise I'd be here every week!"}
{"text":"Ok prices, Ok food. I would rather go to Thai Basil. The portions don't match the price, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ate here last nite. Ordered Masaman curry with only vegetables, my friend ordered silver noodles with shrimp. My curry was not that good to heavy, and thick. vegetables were lacking not too many. And the few vegetables that were in the curry were diced up very thinly and overcooked. very disappointing. I ordered brown rice which costs $2. And the small bowl was not even full. less than half full. my friend said his silver noodles were just ok. vegetables were overcooked. and their were not much noodles. The manager or owner or both came over and sat at our table to ask us how we liked our food. I metioned about the vegetables and my friend metioned about the overcooked veggies. and She was very gracious and asked us to come back and to make a special  request as to how we want the food. That was refreshing and made us feel validated. 

Before we went to eat their we called to find out if they used MSG and the person on the phone said that \"no they did not use MSG\" so with that we decieded to go there to eat. 

I found out they do use MSG. As I woke up last nite with a splitting headache the type of headache I only get if I consume MSG. 

It sad because I wanted to give this place another try. however I don't think I will return they use MSG and that is poison and it makes me sick."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a great local Thai restaurant, so I decided to try our Thai E-San (since it's right around the corner from my house). I was able to call my order in, and it was ready about 15 minutes later. It's in what used to be the Big Wong Chinese restaurant, but they've made some nice changes inside. The decor was very nice and inviting, and I was promptly greeted by a super cheerful lady all ready with my check. I ordered the  Pad Thai Lunch Special with chicken and Shrimp. I ordered it with two stars for the level of spice, just to be safe. the lunch special came with a humongous bowl of soup, a spring roll and a humongous heap of Pad Thai. I started with the soup, which I found a bit off putting (but I'm not much of a soup guy, maybe my wife would llke it better?) Next I dove into the spring roll. Not very good in my opinion, but that could just be my taste. I wasn't a fan of the texture, and there wasn't much flavor in the spring rol. The pad thai was pretty good, I've definitely had better. Will I go back? Heck yeah I will. I only tried the one dish, and it was pretty good. Next time maybe I'll  try one of the many curries they have on the menu. All in all, I shelled out 7 bucks for lunch for myself and what will most definitely by lunch for my wife tomorrow."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch Sunday and had red curry. The curry was very good. They have a 1-5 spicy scale to tell them how hot you want your food. I went for 3 since I had not tried their food before and am cautious of Thai opinions on spicy. Next time I will try 4 since it was not as spicy at that level as some other places I frequent. 
Service was very attentive and friendly. The restaurant was busy but we got a table quickly and several people came over during the meal to ask if everything was good. I will definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Got to go food, was super excited to try this place out! Noodles were soggy and didn't have a ton of flavor! Maybe I'll try dining in next time to see if it's the to go food that sucks."}
{"text":"The best Thai place in town. Great lunch specials. Friendly staff. I used to live nearby and have eaten here at least 50 times. Moved 45 minutes away but will drive back for it."}
{"text":"Thai E-San is easily my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix and I have tried almost all of them. 

Lets begin with the service because it is amazing. The owner is always there and is so friendly and absolutely devoted to great customer service. The staff is friendly and the environment is great! The have sweet and sour on the table (some places are stingy with this and I love sweet and sour sauce) and fill water glasses frequently (a necessity when you order your food Thai hot). The portions are large and I usually leave with leftovers. I usually get the stir fried mixed vegetables with chicken and my husband loves the chicken red curry. The fried spring rolls are to die for! I highly recommend this Thai food and the service here."}
{"text":"It was delicious !!  I had the flaming coconut soup.  It was awesome. And the spring rolls were great too"}
{"text":"We were greeted quickly and very warmly upon our arrival. I asked if they had a cocktail menu and they did not, so I asked for a mojito. They didn't know how to make that, so I asked for a tequila with soda and lime. The bartender came back to our table about 5 minutes later and said they didn't have lime. What?! Isn't lime one of the primary ingredients in Thai food? The crispy spring rolls arrived and while I would have preferred spring rolls without chicken, they were hot and fresh, if not a bit greasy. The pad thai was nicely seasoned but again, could have used the acidity of the lime to balance out the sweetness of the tamarind. My husband enjoyed his royal yellow curry with chicken and we shared the egg fried rice. Service kind of went downhill as the restaurant got busier. Our waters were not refilled and we were not asked if we wanted additional drinks. We sat around for about 15 minutes waiting for the waiter to ask if we wanted our check and finally, we just got up and went to the front register to cash out."}
{"text":"We stopped by this location for mother's day dinner  thinking we would have a great experience from the 4 stars OMG I was completely wrong! After my fiance spent $60 on dinner  the customer service was unprofessional, crappy and extremely long! We waited a whole hour for our meal in this small restaurant with hardly any customers if anything people were leaving because they were screwing up other meals.
I was disappointed that the waiter got my fiance meal wrong  3 times. By the 3rd time I was expecting them to  give my fiances meal for FREE. The manager  said she tasted his food before serving it to him to see how spicy it was and then gave him the left  overs. I thought WTF that's DISGUSTING we don't know if the woman gas a disease in her mouth!  When we started complaining  the old lady then started criticizing my 12 year old son saying he looked  like a girl from his hair cut. My son is just about bald and the only little girls I know of that dont have hair or have very short hair are little girls with cancer! Either the lady is completely blind or just stupid! I confronted the old lady who is also the manager about calling my son a girl how she shouldn't be saying that to kids my son even confronted her saying it really made him sad! The lady had NO REMORSE I had to tell her to apologize because she didn't want to.  I  thought my son deserved a FREE meal after all that crap but no she only gave $6 off of $60 Talk about PAYING FOR A  RUDE ASS MOTHER'S DAY DINNER!  All week long I've been telling my son he doesn't look like a girl   because he believes what the manager said! I  really want this restaurant to refund all the  money my fiance spent there! My advice Do not bother stopping into this restaurant just to pay to be criticized and have the old lady eat off of every dish they serve that's disgusting!"}
{"text":"Well this place has everything I could ask for.. I would say it is the most \"authentic\" Thai I have found in Arizona.  When I order \"Thai hot\"  at other restaurants I am left disappointed. Here, my eyes water. That's what I'm talking about! They have quick service and it is family run. The owner's daughters are both vegetarian so she is quick to accommodate and also recommend dishes you might not even see on the menu. She is always there and will come and greet you every time you visit. My personal favorite here is the massaman curry.. The best in town without a doubt. They also serve amazing thom yum soup.. And it literally comes out on fire.. Well, there is a circle of fire around the soup bowl. Semantics. 

This place has recently undergone a facelift. They used to have very over the top dining furniture which limited seating. They have since streamlined and added new booths. There is also a large flat screen usually featuring sports and they now offer wifi. 

The last thing I really appreciate about this place is that they are open late!

Hands down my go to place for Thai. I tell everyone and bring everyone then repeat."}

Only reason I didn't give a 5 is the air condition is low for summer time a little to warm for comfort and the ambience is very dark and out dated other then that great food and service I would come back"}
{"text":"Great food, interesting service. I always go and never leave wanting more. I end up full but wish that the decor was better. It looks like Thailand threw up on it. Good food, support a local business."}
{"text":"I had pad see ew, pad Thai, lemongrass soup, fried fish cake, glass noodle salad, and spicy fried rice. The seasoning and flavoring for all of them were good except the fish cake. The fish cakes look as if the oil being used to fry them was old and they just fall apart as I took a bite. I've had better!"}

It's huge, there are coconut curries, satay, spring rolls, and an awesome diversity of Thai dishes in varying degrees of spice.  I really miss being walking distance from this place."}
{"text":"This little place is in the hood and I finally got around to trying it today. 

 I'm a purist when it comes to Thai food...a good pad thai, a ton of peanut sauce, and some spring rolls are all it takes to make me happy. Luckily I was with a buddy who is a bit more adventurous than me...she had the recommended yellow curry and pronounced it delish!  We met the owner, who is a hoot, and thought the decor was very nice.  The food was great.

I really appreciate the fact that the food meter goes from 1 to 5.  3 was just right for my meal and my buddy went big with 4.

Now, how to get another star:  

focus on better service.  The staff was good at keeping our drinks filled but forgot to bring things to the table.....this is a minor quibble for me but may be a dealbreaker for others.

My noodles were also just a tad undercooked

We didn't have condiments at the table

All of these little touches will add weight to your reputatiion!



We both had leftovers to take home and the bill came to a whopping 28 bucks.  We left full and happy.

Great food and good pricing?  Less than a mile from my house? Yes, please!  Can't wait to try it again :)"}
{"text":"I wish Big Wong is still here... but instead its Thai ESan.

After my bad experience at Thai Lhana I thought I would redeem the Thai cuisine by checking this place out for dinner. The parking lot look busy but when I got inside, there were maybe 5 couples seated. There were only 2 servers so we waited a bit before being seated.

The place was scary quiet, library quiet. I couldn't figure out but then I had an AH-HA moment... the tables were GINORMOUS. I felt small sitting in the chair and the round marble tables normally seat 6-8 but are used for couples. Everyone was seated so far away, screaming would have been a good conversation level. 

The two servers seemed pretty busy so it was a while before we were able to put in our drink orders. We both ordered an iced thai mil tea which was good, standard. 

We ordered a Thai Sampler Appetizer: wontons, fish cake, chicken satay, egg rolls and Thai Toast, pad thai and red curry (spice level 4 of 5).

It was about 45 min before our appetizer made its way out. I would normally be understanding if they were busy but there were only 5 other couples in there... and its just a plate of deep fried goodies. I think that should have taken 10 mins.

The egg rolls were probably the best. The wontons needed more filling, I pretty much ate deep fried wonton skins. The fish cakes were good but overwhelmingly seasoned with lemongrass. It was almost too much to eat. The chicken satay were alright, a bit dry from the grill. The Thai Toast is battered tofu and deep fried, of course... would have been better if I had some maple syrup. It was deep fried beyond recognition.

The pad thai noodles were mush. The noodles were overcooked and just stuck together in a huge ball and was hard to separate. And while I wanted to taste it, I honestly believe Thai ESan cooks season all their dishes with a huge heap of chili powder. Every part of the noodle was covered in the chili powder. I'm actually still flossing out chili flakes from my teeth. It was too hot to even enjoy.

The red curry was good. I liked the coconut flavor and fresh basil. Never had curry with green beans and bamboo shoots before but it was good. Also another dish with a generous heap of chili powder added to it. I couldn't have anymore because my lips were on fire. 

I know Thai food is spicy but damn... let me taste the other flavors too. All I tasted was HOT. I couldn't finish the curry or the noodles. I thought Thai ESan would convince me that Thai food was amazing again but it was too hot to handle.. and not in a good way either."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good Thai restaurant in The Valley and Thai E- San did not disappoint! 
Food is great and so is the service! They do seem a little bit more spicy then other Thai places. So if you used to eating a 4 or 5 some place else I would recommend a 3 here! 
Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Thai restaurant, one of the best I have tried in the valley. The ambience and service is quite and friendly. Its a fabulous place for date night.  Now here comes my food critic side and knowing the cuisine from growing up in California and spending summers in Thailand. The food at Thai E-San is not bad I just want to reiterate that. However I feel that they can do so much better. For instance for our appetizer of chicken satay, the chicken was dry and didn't have enough sauce to make the distinct taste of chicken satay. Also, for my rad nah I would have liked it to have the noodles browned a bit more to make them crisper so they weren't soggy and the gravey just needs a bit more of a thickening agent to make it more gravey than soup. 
These are just tiny things that can be over looked but I just wanted to let people know. 
I do recommend Thai E-San for a quite weekday date night with your special someone."}
{"text":"An absolute disaster of an experience tonight -- our server basically completely ignored us, our food took more than 45 minutes to arrive at our table, and by the time it did, I had forgotten what we'd ordered. While I try to be a decent tipper, this was the first time in a long time when I didn't feel any remorse about leaving no tip.

The catfish that was served was slathered in sauce to the point where I didn't recognize what it was. 

The seafood stir-fry something or other was decent, as was the something-or-other soup, but by the time it was finally brought out, I didn't even care. I just wanted to leave because I had been waiting so long.

The only redeeming factor was one of the servers/hosts comping us a beer and a Thai tea because of the delay in getting our food. Otherwise this would have been a zero-star review.

Thai E-San may have decent food, but they need to learn how to handle a semi-busy night. This was an utter and complete FAIL as a dining experience. They need to learn how to better operate their kitchen and deliver the dishes ordered in a timely manner. Few foods are worth waiting for as long as we did.

Until they get their act figured out, I recommend going somewhere else for Thai food."}
{"text":"Favorite spot to get pad Thai in Phoenix. I usually pick up my order to go, and the service is always quick and friendly. I get #3 spice because one time I ordered #4 and it about burned my tongue off."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly service, and comfortable environment. We came for dinner on a Friday night and found it almost empty upon arrival. As we went through our delicious meal it got more crowded, but the attention from our waiter never wavered. He always made sure our waters were full and our food was being enjoyed. We had the Pad Thai, panang curry, and chicken skewers app. It was more than enough food for our family of 3, and we enjoyed every little bit (and we have leftovers to continue enjoying it tomorrow!) We cannot wait to try more menu items on our future visits."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch as I'm a Thai junkie. The service was okay, not very friendly or personal and it was not very busy at the time.

I ordered everything spicy, and when it can it had good flavor with a raging spice to it. Needless to say I worked up a decent sweat by the time I left. The restaurant is nice, the food came out fast and hot, and the price is great! They have a large menu selection for everyones palate.

Good place to stop for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food we've had in a long time! In AZ briefly from LA, and stopped here for dinner. The food is spicy, flavorful, and fresh. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is SO good! Very authentic! Our favorite Thai place in Phoenix. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"If you desire an authentic Thai restaurant in near the Park Central neighborhood, this is the place to go. The chef does not scrimp on the fish and fermented crab sauces. You will also have an option of spiciness levels. Have been here several times in the past few years and have never been disapoointed. Hubby and i can tell if a Thai restaurant is good by the papaya and other salads and this place never disappointed. Also their Thai beverage choices are always worth trying. Service is friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. Dishes are large sized. Good for groups and parking is easy."}
{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant for a friends birthday party. We had a large group who were hungry and ready to eat. While guest were trickling in the one server took her time getting drinks, placing orders, and bringing out plates etc. I mean we called prior to give the restaurant a heads up on our large party. It still took them forever to serve us. I believe it took a hour for them to take my order. The food was good when we finally got it but I was annoyed once I received my bill to see that I was charged gratuity in the amount of $16 dollars. After the wait to place my order then to get my order you would had thought there would had been some kind of compensation. Smh very disappointed because while the food was good, the service was crappy. The owner is very nice but she has to be more prepared for large groups. Especially when they call prior to make a reservation to ensure there will have a table and be waited on in a timely fashion. 

I won't be back, sorry!!!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised to find a good Thai restaurant in Phoenix.  I'm from San Francisco so good Thai food is easy to find.  The owner, Pui, is very nice and visited our table to unsure everything was going well.  She recommended the sticky rice with mango and home made coconut ice cream if we were interested in dessert.  

All of the the food was very good and I will definitely be back when in Phoenix.  I recommend it and hope that people frequent it enough so that it is around for a long time.   

We had Pad Thai, Beef Salad, Chicken with Snow Peas (ordered for someone who doesn't care too much for Thai spices), Creamy Chicken, Stir Fried Eggplant with Tofu, Pineapple Fried Rice, and the mango with sticky rice and coconut ice cream (also comes with something very similar to banana lumpia).  All was very good and can make it as spicy or not as spicy as you like.

This placed open in January 2011; therefore, I'm not sure if the old reviews that brought down the overall rating really apply to this place.  

Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed.  This place should have an average of 4 stars not 3."}
{"text":"Wanted to like it. It's close to where I live. The food was pretty sad. Overly sweet, none of that balance and punch that I love in Thai food. My wife and I shared pot stickers (pretty bland and sad, despite being deep fried, which normally makes food irresistible) pad see ew with pork, and chicken with masaman curry. Really didn't enjoy any of it."}
{"text":"The service here is great especially when eating spicy food. We have never been here before since I was here for school so I saw the amount of reviews and it was great. The scale is 1-5 but if you're not into spicy foods that much a 3 is great."}
{"text":"Very good Thai Food! I enjoyed the Masaman Curry and loved it!"}
{"text":"I was a little doubtful about this Thai restaurant, the building is a bit scary from the outside but once you enter staff is friendly and welcoming; the whole impression changed. Amanda was our server and she is knowledgeable of the menu and gave good suggestions. We ordered the angel wings and yellow curry and red curry, both so delicious and tasty. Very pleased with the traditional menu. Even the ice Thai is authentic. I used to have my favorite Thai restaurant in San Francisco and I haven't been able to find something that authentic than this restaurant here in Arizona. So happy to find this jewel in the avenues."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look too fancy from the outside, but it sure is a hidden gem! I finally tried it and liked the place a lot!
Menu has good options and red curry is a must to try - Really good!
I ordered spice level 3 and it was perfect for me, not bland and not too hot either that you won't get the real taste of the food."}
{"text":"Just had this for lunch with some coworkers, I had the Royal Thai Curry lunch special and it was absolutely delicious.  The soup that came with my meal I believe was the Silver Noodle and it was great with the cilantro!  Great prices and delicious curry, will definitely eat here again, next time I'm trying that Pineapple Fried Rice...yum!"}
{"text":"Over ratted Thai restaurant. All the chefs are Mexican. Spent like $50 for uncooked chicken skewers. The pad see u tasted awful and the chicken meat are rubbish. Would never recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Good, legit Thai food. It's pretty good here, friendly staff and very good service.

They have a 1-5 spicy scale, any dish can be made spicy. The 5/5 here is the same as a 5/10 at any of the legit thai places I've been to (where 10/10 is pet pet and 12/10 would be pet mak). A 5/5 is spicier than hot cheetos, but maybe not as spicy as the XXTRA hot cheetos.

Usually at these sorts of places, I get a 6 or 7, so I just put a few spoonfuls of chili oil to give it an edge (it has roughly the same amount of spiciness as the standard thai chili)."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious food.  Pui was very thorough and helpful when I ordered a large amount of food for our company meeting.  I think I found my new Thai restaurant.  Thank you and keep up the wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"I had the Pad-Thai which was fantastic. The noodles were perfectly done, and the sauce was tangy with a wonderful amount of spice. I was really happy with the amount of food I got for the price as well. 

I also recommend the angel wing appetizer. It can be described as a \"Thai chicken nugget\" very yummy with their sweet sauce."}
{"text":"They messed up my order twice, took an hour to finally get my dish right and the management is rude and clueless on how to properly run a restaurant. I went on mothers day with my girl. I ordered the red curry tofu with pineapples and a thai iced tea. I got my meal way after everyone at my table and the table next to ours got their food. When my dish finally came, about 38 minutes after I ordered it, the server brought me the wrong dish. She came with vegetable red curry. There wasn't any tofu in the dish at all. I mentioned to the server that she brought me the wrong dish and she tried to tell me that that was indeed what I ordered when I know I mentioned tofu at least 4 times to her. She said the tofu would be an extra $2. I told her I refused to pay extra for something that should have came in my dish. Why would I keep the wrong dish and pay extra for what I wanted? She eventually agreed with me and took my dish and said she would fix it. Another 15-20 minutes later she came with my plate again, this time it had tofu but it didn't have any pineapples. I got up from my seat and had to walk to my server since she was far away from me and I was extremely hungry at that point. The server told me \"they forgot to put it back, I'll bring it to you now.\" It sounded like they picked out the veggies and the pineapples and threw tofu in the bowl, I hope they didn't use their hands for the process. I was upset cause I thought I was getting a new bowl of what I actually ordered, not the previous wrong dish they brought earlier with stuff taken out, not just the pineapples, with tofu thrown in. The manager stopped by to ask me if everything was okay after the first dish came and I told her no cause I was still hungry and still didn't get what I ordered about an hour after we got to the restaurant. She later came back and said my girl's son looked like a girl even though he doesn't and brought me her left overs from the the original dish they got wrong for me. She said her dinner was the plate they originally brought me and it was too spicy for her so she wanted me to have a little cup of what she couldn't finish. I was really offended that she thought I would want her left overs and that she called my girl's son a girl on mothers day of all days. The food was good but the experience was horrible. This my first and last time ever coming here. They got my order wrong twice, it took an hour to finally get my dish right, the manager gave me her left overs, the manager called my girlfriend's son a girl. All of that and she didnt even offer us a discount until my girl mentioned to the manager that she was offended by her calling her son a girl, and the only discount she gave was $6 off a $57 check after the horrible experience we had. I wrote on the tip section of the check, read my yelp review, I really hope she reads this and realizes that she could have made our experience better but instead everything she did just made it worse. We are never coming back."}
{"text":"If you are feeling sick or low, the wonton soup is the perfect comfort food. It's served piping hot with lots of bok choy and garlic mixed in. Most places I end up just fishing for the wontons and ignoring the broth. This soup is different because it is so good all the way around that even when the chicken and wontons have been picked out everyone I've ever taken here has helped finish the entire thing off. The silver noodles and chicken satay are also good.  I think they have the best cucumber/vinegar salad of the local Thai restaurants, it's addicting. Thai tea is of course always a hit. 

Decor is...random and sometimes there are too many plates/dishes set up for various courses and it gets crowded/chaotic. Music selection over the speakers is horrible but it can be used as comedy during the meal."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, priced right and served with a BIG smile. The owner is right there on site riding herd over every detail.  As the customer, you know that you are the most important part of the scene here. You cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food, the right spice level, friendly staff, and traditional cosy atmosphere. I feel it's the best Thai restaurant in the valley and definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Love this place, first amd foremost the service is always A+. They are friendly and extremely fast. The food is fantastic, stands up to any Thai food you will find in the valley. We shared the Phad Thai and Royal Curry which are easily my favorite dishes here. If I could change one thing here it would be a larger beer selection,  but that is not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai I have found in Phoenix... the satay was different than I am used too, but still good. The masaman curry reminded me of home though. Love this place and I am from Seattle where Thai food is very very good."}
{"text":"One of my friends chose this place and it was great! Excellent service, atmosphere and the prices were reasonable. The food was delicious and the restaurant was clean. I will be back!

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the owners make it that much better as welcoming as they are"}
{"text":"Great portion sizes for the money. Every dish has been fantastic, though I am especially fond of the coconut soup. The restaurant is always quiet, clean, and the staff is always very welcoming."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE CURRY SPOT IN ARIZONA!!!!!!!!! Don't even bother flipping through the pages of the menu. Locate the curry section, select one of her 6 options, and enjoy what will happen to your taste buds. The owner prides herself on customer service - she has been there for over a decade and really values connecting with her customers. After the second time I went, she surprisingly recognized me and said, \"Oh no. You cannot be here otherwise you will get addicted to me.\" I was in tears of laughter and I could genuinely feel her passion for her restaurant, love of her employees, and appreciation of her customers. If you haven't been here yet, you are committing a crime and I feel like you need to make it right by trying some curry at Thai E-San. Seriously, the best curry spot in the Valley."}
{"text":"I Took some friends here from out of town last night. The service was good, very friendly but the food was absolutely awesome!
  My friends said the next time they come to Phoenix to visit we are definately comming here.
  Very glad I found this place.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food (basil chicken) at the right price. The rice is separate from the dish which was okay but different from most Thai restaurants. Got Thai iced tea and that was good. Lunch combo came with delicious coconut soup and egg roll. I'll come here again."}
{"text":"Just maybe, just maybe the best thai ive had here in AZ. This place is first team all state easy. Go try the classics like curries and pad thai, or go with your gut and get that incredible, mouth watering, you know you wanna break up with your vegan gf just to get it, thai sausage."}
{"text":"Very awesome Thai! The restaurant is super clean, decorated tastefully, there were fresh flowers on the table which is not a must but very nice and inviting to see. 
The staff was super friendly and helpful making sure drinks were always filled and we had enough rice.
The portions were generous, I had the duck curry and ended up taking half home because I was so full. They do a 1-5 scale, I choose 2, which was a perfect between mild and medium. 
If you are in the area and craving Thai, you definitely need to go in!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends picked up takeout from this joint on Friday (11/04). 

I had the garlic chicken and my husband ordered beef and broccoli with a side of noodles. Both were very good and we had left overs for Saturday. The dishes offered bold taste with a bit of spice.

I will be back to try additional dishes."}
{"text":"This is a really nice looking place and the decor is really pretty. I would say there food is really good, but can be hit and miss as times. There a little over priced for there meals but there BBQ Thai Pork ribs are really good. Overall it's a great place to go."}
{"text":"Great tasting food! Their iced Thai tea was amazing! Customer services was also good! Would definitely recommend this place for a nice date or family dinner. It's not loud and the music sets a nice ambient."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place and not simply because it's near my home. It would be worth the drive. It is in a nondescript building (aren't most in Phoenix?) across from the Fresh & Easy at 7th Ave & Indian School. Inside it's very nice, including the large tables and throne-like chairs. The menu is extensive. Trying a variety of options and eating family-style, I can't remember the names of all the dishes except to say everything was good. Most especially, I can't quit thinking about the Thai ribs. I would swim in that sauce."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Colleagues at work raved about this gem so decided to place a to go order. 

Ordered the lunch special, red curry with the combination: shrimp, pork, beef. 

Portions are pretty big. The special comes with rice, soup of the day, an egg roll, and wontons. 

Flavor of the food was great including the soup-Coconut Soup. I'm not sure if I was served sticky rice but defiantly was not what I expected. The main dish had an abundance of curry and good pieces of meat with only one shrimp. The curry I ordered at a 4 (1-5 spice level), had a nice kick to it would definitely try the five just because it wasn't spicy enough. 

Would I come back? Maybe. Not work the $15 bucks for the lunch special. Would try the place again for a large party to order main entrées and sides to share.  

A solid three stars."}
{"text":"Great food,  quick service. And a 4/5 spice level was a touch spicier than I expected.  Next time I'll stick with a 3!"}
{"text":"Great thai food in a strange part of Phoenix. Saw it was highly rated on Yelp and thought I would give it a try. All that was said on Yelp was true ambiance was cute and very festive for the holidays, food was served quickly and was great. Prices were very reasonable. If I'm back in town I will definitely be revisiting this fine Thai joint."}
{"text":"Just finished take out from this place. Outstanding Thai food. Most authentic Thai food in the area. Full of flavor and taste that hits the spot. Highly recommend this place if u are looking for great food at a reasonable price. Not sure of the service as we had take out."}
{"text":"I am surprised by their rating. I tried the restaurant recently and was disappointed with their service.  Their  spring rolls were greasy and the vegetables were soggy. Tried their green beans with red curry the dish was salty and the beans overcooked  ph at thai was also  overcooked . Disappointed"}
{"text":"This restaurant does not look like much from the outside, but inside was a whole different story.  Very clean and neat.  Comfortable seating and TV's if you want to catch a game.  Some of the best Thai I've had.  Red curry was excellent!  Pricing was very reasonable for the quality of the food.  They have a limited beverage selection with only serving cans and bottles."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very reasonable prices, convenient location in the Melrose district near the central corridor, and a pleasant and friendly staff makes this my favorite ethnic restaurant in central Phoenix. Even though it's not a huge restaurant, there is enough space for group gatherings. They also have the best Thai red curry sauce I've had anywhere. And, of course, free WiFi is always a plus."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants I've had hands down and I eat a lot of Thai. Couldn't decide between the red curry or the sweet and sour chicken so I got both. They were both amazing. The service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"The Pad-Thai was probably one of the best I've ever had! And I've had my fair share of pad-thai's before! They also gave me free ice cream!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. The service is fast and the owner is always here checking in. I come in pretty often and they remember what I order, even if I change it. I wouldn't go anywhere else now that I've been here!"}
{"text":"I loved the Thai Toast!   The portions were perfect for family style dining.  The Vegetable PadThai was excellent!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Thai E-San several times and the food is very good. The ingredients are very fresh, which I suspect is why the prices are a little higher than other places. I would personally rather pay an extra dollar to get high quality.

The pad thai is excellent, one of the best I have had. It's suprising how many thai restaurants cannot make a good version of this basic dish. Add a little chili sauce to give it a great kick. The red curry is a little different than most places, but very good and very fresh. The same goes for the chicken coconut soup. It's delicious.

I agree that the large tables are a little big for a twosome, and the service is a little off.  I think the service will improve with time.

I have eaten at thai restaurants around the world and I think the food here is excellent. Very fresh and authentic. Give it a try.

UPDATE: They have lowered their prices a bit, and they are now very competitive. Most of the lunches are $6.49, which includes soup and eggroll. A great deal for excellent food."}
{"text":"My friends  really like this place.  It was a sustainable Sunday  night . We were seated  promptly.  However  it took them one hour to serve us . This is nonacceptable. The  chicken . was very dry . The barbeque  chicken  was burnt. Pad Thai which we ordered medium was extra hot . . The dinner took two hours and the owners  never stopped by."}
{"text":"I ordered Royal Curry with beef and Viet Egg Rolls to go. 

First impression was that the restaurant appears to be in okay condition.  The person at the counter was focusing on handling other tickets and was not friendly at all. It also looks like the prices were higher than the menu listed on Yelp from another user.

Now to the food: The egg rolls were delicious, a little greasy but had a great taste.  The curry was just okay, the rice was hard and tasted under-cooked. The beef and flavor of the curry were both decent but not great. 

I don't plan on returning to this restaurant, I would rather go to Wild Thaiger."}
{"text":"Tried this place 3 times because of the reviews. Not really good all three times. The first two take out visits the food was mediocre. The last time I feel like I really got ripped off. I ordered beef Panang Thai hot and I honestly got 7 pieces of beef. I have been to many Thai places that some curry dishes were like soup but this was just a extremely small portion. This was the second time I ordered beef Panang and it was the minimum for portion size the first time but someone just made a mistake this time and I had to pay for it. My girl and me have also tried there pork pad see ew, Thai chicken egg rolls, sweet and  sour chicken. Very average at best."}
{"text":"perfect early Thai dinner.... spicy Musscles ...  Tad Pad with Shrimp and Chicken , perfect fit for a early dinner., no RUSH crowd here if you arrive a week night early dinner    Good food, great price !"}
{"text":"Delicious food! The lunch special is a great deal; you get a soup, huge plate of food, and an egg roll. The soup was amazing. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and reasonable lunch price and food.  Nothing was wrong but nothing stood out either.  That's why I gave 3 stars.  I ordered lunch order of Pad Thai with medium spice.  I have above average spice tolerance but their \"medium\" spice was hotter than average.  You might want to notch down for your spice level in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I took too long to write this but, even though the food tastes good, I would never come back to a place that has Rats. A rat run between our legs while we were eating in the restaurant. I used to buy to-go, but now I won't even do that. I am usually a positive person and fair about posts, but I consider hygiene one of the most important aspects of an establishment. I cannot believe the person in charge had the nerves to tell me that It could have not been possible as city just certified them and cleared them. Maybe the rats were hidden while they were being inspected. 3 people saw the rat, and one of us felt it as it ran touching a foot. This is pretty disgusting, pest control should be called often. Careful if you ever get sick after going here."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Thai E San many times and every time I am greeted with a friendly smile, sat at a beautiful table in a very clean and vibrant restaurant. The food is by far the best Thai in Arizona. It always comes out fresh and hot, and quickly (as quick as possible given that is made fresh!) My favorite item is the yellow curry but I can honestly say that every dish I have tried is amazing! Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"The good was amazing!!! We are so happy we found this place during our visit. I highly recommend for spicy Thai food lovers! We will be back!"}
{"text":"So good! By far my favorite Thai spot. When so many local Thai restaurants fall short on expectations this one will restore your faith. Authentic and awesome service. Love their green curry!"}
{"text":"Chicken pa-naeng was absolutely amazing. Nice and spicy with the sticky rice was just perfect. Lunch portion was more than enough to satisfy the palate. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"4 stars for food.  5 stars for Sunday brunch value and fun when we went with a dozen friends.  Love the yellow curry w potatoes.  Soup is terrific too."}
{"text":"It's hard to separate this Thai restaurant from the rest, especially when there are more authentic and delicious Thai places popping in the valley. We were seated right away on a busy Thursday night. The pleasant waitress came quickly and took our order. I had Pad Thai. To our huge surprise the food came out rather fast... too quick. My food tasted as if it was just mixed/ covered  in spices. The noodles were cooked and quickly mixed with the ingredients. All I could taste was the spices. Does that explain the fast food turn around? The Crab Rangoon was not that good, as the pastry wasn't cooked all the way. Unfortunately, I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"The Chicken Satay was so good! The service is always excellent and the Thai ribs are my absolute favorite!! Really great food at a good price. Its a Favorite."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to the UYE set up by Liz S. last Sunday.  We had a really great time.  The buffet was very good.  I am a fan of yellow curry.  I wish it was not Tofu, though.  I had a taste of everything.  The only thing I skipped was the donut hole thingys.  I am being adventurous with beers also, so I asked them to suggest one, I had the Chang.  It was perfect with my meal.  This is such a reasonable place, you can enjoy your meal, watch the game, yes, they had the game on tv, have a beer and relax.  The buffet was only $9.50.  Thanks Liz, for setting this up, we got to experience a great place."}
{"text":"It's always fun when you find that an unexpected connection to a longtime friend.  That connection can be particularly delightful when you discover that said friend has a connection to a local restaurant.  Growing up I've had friends whose families owned restaurants like Miracle Mile Deli, Luke's Sandwich Shop, Sing High and Posh just to name a few.  Nevermind how much free food that meant I got to mooch (I always offered to pay for my meal for the record).  Perhaps there's an extra trust factor when someone you know personally is running the show.  Such is the case with Thai E-San.  Pui and Rodger Pongtratic have owned this small CenPho spot since 2011 (and have run several other kitchens in the past).  I actually grew up with their daughters Jan and April, but never knew their parents owned this place.  Given the high Yelp marks and that personal connection to the Pongtratic family, it was about time for a Thai dinner here.

Located on the north side of Indian School Road just east of 7th Avenue, Thai E-San is a super relaxed space that can hold probably 70-80 people at full capacity.  You'll see more than a fair amount of Thai decor on the walls along with lots of old red leather booths (and for some reason a wall of Christmas lights even in summer?).  I got here at 5pm on a Wednesday and the dinner crowd was light, so I got a nice comfy booth to myself this go around.  The food here is Thai, but more specifically geared towards northeastern Thailand (known as Isan) with some subtle Laotian and Cambodian influences.  Truth be told I usually play it safe with Thai cuisine.  Partly because I'm a wimp when it comes to spice but partly just because I love my standard Pad Thai or Drunken Noodle dishes.

Knowing that Jan and April would probably give me tons of grief (and maybe even dead arm) for playing it safe in their own parents' establishment, I decided to go outside the usual standard Thai faire.  Fortunately, the menu labels their house specialities accordingly in case you're unsure what dishes stand out.  But first, gotta have a Thai iced tea.  Just a simple mix of tea, milk and sugar, but a nice creamy and slightly sweet drink nevertheless.  And I was gonna need it to wash down all the food I ordered.  For my app, I got the Angel Wings.  Ground pork and chicken mixed together with noodles and herbs and then fried to create a drumstick-like appearance.  The dish also comes with a cucumber sauce (I think I picked up vinegar, sugar, salt, garlic, and some chilis in the sauce).  For my main entree I went with another house speciality, the Thai E-San Sausage.  FYI I believe the Thai term for this is type of sausage Sai Krok Isan.  Basically a fermented sausage with pork, rice and a mix of herbs and spices.  The entree was served with cucumber, lettuce, ginger, and peanuts.  And of course you get a healthy helping of some of that sticky rice to bring it all together.

I was caught a little of guard not only by the fact that food came out to me so quickly (less than 5 minutes), but that they brought both my app and entree out simultaneously.  Had the restaurant been full, I might've been embarrassed by the fact there was so much food put in front of me.  Not that it would've stopped me of course.  First the Angel Wings.  By themselves the wings are just okay, but the cucumber sauce was fantastic.  Dip those drumsticks into the sauce and you've got a winner for sure.  Good portions of meat on each as well.  Now for the sausage.  This was a delightful surprise.  Four big juicy links in all (pre-sliced for your convenience) that paired perfectly with the rice and the veggies that came with the dish.  I'll cop to the fact that I probably screwed up the flow as I had no idea how to eat these items together (Do you wrap the sausage in the lettuce? Do you wrap it in rice?  Both?  Neither?), but it didn't matter.  The sausage was excellent and the portion was plenty generous.  I was stuffed with no room for dessert this go around, but very satisfied with my meal.

Total cost for the app, entree, tea, tax, and tip came to about $35.  The service was incredibly friendly, super fast (I was in and out in just over a half hour), and the dishes really opened my eyes to a type of Thai cuisine I never knew existed.  Big props to Rodger and Pui for labelling their menu accordingly so I knew which items to target outside of my usual comfort zone.  Seriously, who do you know that goes to a Thai restaurant and falls in love with sausage?  You know what, on second thought, don't answer that question."}
{"text":"Decided to come here last night to fulfill our Thai craving & so so glad we did. Okay fair warning it is in a sketchy part of town but you can't rate the food based on location & it's just your loss if you do!! When you walk in it's actually a quaint & cozy place that definitely takes pride in their restaurant, you have your choice of table or booth which all are set up with their place settings. We were greeted by our super friendly & very energetic server Bobby, who's from Thailand but has an easy to remember American name, we couldn't have been happier with the service that he gave us. We started with the potstickers & the crab puffs, both were cooked perfectly without being overdone. For our entrees my hubby chose the half BBQ chicken which he said was perfectly cooked with the right amount of seasoning. I chose the snow pea pod stir fry with mixed seafood & a spice level of 3, it came with two large shrimp, four mussels, calamari & a scallop, all were cooked perfectly, it was a large portion, therefore lunch for the following day!! We'll definitely be going back, can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Craving Thai food when I landed back in phoenix after a work trip.
Been to a few before and wanted to try something different.
Found this spot and the greeting were friendly.
Thai egg rolls and papaya salad with crab to start.
Both were good.
House pad Thai for the hubby and he was very pleased as it had shrimp and other meats in it instead of just one.
I had the veggie red curry and it was very flavorful.
Love the bamboo.
The playing was beautiful and the interior was authentic.
I feel like we found our new go to Thai restaurant close to home.
Definitely will be back again!
I want to try some of the soups as they looked really good but I had no more room for them this trip.
Thanks for the great service!
Prices were very fair as well.
Great find for us."}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this review? 

First, I visited this place with my boyfriend a couple of times earlier this year. The Thai Basil Chicken was okay. It looked like porridge on a plate with slender pieces of chicken and just large vegetables slathered on top. I ordered their tom yum soup and it was not hot temperature wise. The soup was just a little warm. 

The last time I visited was by myself where I waited for over 15 minutes before the lady in the front finally took my order. It seemed important for her to collect the money for her other customers rather than take my order when I have been standing there. I finally placed my order of the Red Curry with Chicken, which came out a little heavy with excess curry and less chicken than I thought and small traces of vegetables.

Recently, I went here for lunch by myself. It did not take them long to seat me. First, they sat me in a small table which was all right. I noticed that they sat a man that came behind me who was dining alone in a bigger table. That's fine and all, but then I noticed that the waiter took his drink order and his meal order before mine. I was highly offended by this because I sat down before him, and I waited 20 minutes before they took my order. When they did take my order after a long wait, I got my food which was the same thing I got as last time: Red curry. The lunch proportions were decent and they give you a little scoop of rice for the entire bowl of curry, which is a waste because there is excess curry leftover. Not once, did any of the waiters asked if I was ok or if I needed anything else. They proceeded to ask everyone else about their meals or if the other customers needed anything else. However, I felt neglected as a patron of this restaurant. Coming from a big city like Atlanta, I am used to better and higher class, prompt service at Thai restaurants.

This restaurant failed to meet those standards. Food is subpar, and not worth the $11-$20, especially because I have had authentic Thai cuisine elsewhere. Their service is not the best, and I will not be returning here after this last visit as it was apparent by their behavior today that my money is no good to them. I'll be saving that $11-$20 thanks to their horrible customer service and overly priced, lackluster cuisine."}
{"text":"Thai E-San is my favorite thai restaurant in Arizona. We started with an order of papaya salad. I am usually not a fan of papaya salad but I saw that it was their specialty. It was delicious! I finished the whole thing. The shredded papaya with the dried shrimp was the perfect combination (Bangkok Style). My boyfriend didnt want too much soup so he ordered the coconut soup in a smalller serving. It was delicious as well. I couldn't pick which one I liked better - the coconut soup or the shredded papaya salad. Just like most thai cuisine, the standards for spiciness are a lot higher so take note when picking your spicy level. For my main entree, I ordered the thai bbq with jasmine rice. I was not a fan of this one for some reason. I guess I prefer my bbq chicken a lot crispier and somewhat charred? They give you a huge serving of this one, about 3-4 pieces of chicken. 

The service was good and the vibe was great. Definitely reminded me of my visit in Bangkok a few years back. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My first time here and only second experience with Thai food but I will definitely be back! It was so good and the staff was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Had super yummy chicken fried rice and iced thai coffee. The staff was so kind, and went above and beyond. I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I could only give 1 star for the food.  But 5 stars for the customer service. The food were not delicious. I got lemongrass soup and it was too sour. A Thai iced tea that was too sweet. Pineapple fried rice is too wet to called it fried rice. Pad thai had this unwanted smoke flavor. Beef salad is the worst. And lastly, the angel wings was the only thing that is good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai food restaurant by far. I've eaten many pad Thais and curries, and theirs is perfection. I eat the green curry with tofu at least once a week, and when I am under the weather I'll eat the noodle soup with chicken. They are extremely friendly and always welcome me warmly. Eat here, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and service.   The duck Chu chee is so good, along with the Az rice and the pepper steak is really good. Spice level 3 on all. 

P.S. 
Avshalom A. 

This person wrote a bad review about this restaurant. I think it's kind of funny when somebody cannot spell correctly and is telling someone in the restaurant business how to correctly write a menu. She chose to write the menu, I'm assuming, in English to accommodate the majority of people, who don't speak Thai.  Just saying."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their Pineapple Curry is delicious and can be spicy or not spicy at all.
It's probably my favorite Thai place in Phoenix. I highly reccomend their food. The service is also amazing.
If you have short lunch hours it's probably best to call in an order because their food is made fresh, so you actually have to wait"}
{"text":"Random pick for lunch to get out of the office. Had the lunch special, which changes every day. Today was the Fried Rice plate. I got 1 out of 5 for the spiciness and enjoyed the meal. Plenty of flavor and the watermelon slice was a nice end. A coworker got a 4 out of 5 for spiciness and had to take a break while eating, so you can definitely get your spice on if that's your thing. Friendly and speedy service. Server split the bill without asking, which was totally okay. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I love the love specials!  Really nice service, and everything I had was good (Spicy Noodles, chicken rice soup, thai iced coffee)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The lunch specials are very reasonable.  I had the spicy noodle with vegetable and chicken.  I asked for medium spicy and it's spicy!!!  I think I would order less spicy next time. The service was also very good.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service, we go every time we can, you should go there and take your whole family, you will be glad!!!"}
{"text":"The Mrs. and I went there today.  Had the lunch specials.  We knew about this place because it came up when I listed thai restaurants...highest rated, on Yelp.
A group of people came out as we were going in and they raved to us about how good the food is.
We found the raves to be no exageration!  We both had Pa Nang Curry: hers with chicken and mine with portk.  Very, very good.  We both had a 3 in \"heatness\" and while not that hot, it was a bit hotter than we would usually care for.  Maybe next time a \"2\".
Wait staff were very good.  The woman at the cashiers table (Pui) was very friendly and put us at home."}
{"text":"I've been ordering to-go from here for the past year! Absolutely delicious every single time, and the service is always wonderful. Always greeted by the friendliest staff/owners.  The coconut soup with chicken and spring rolls are my favorite! Can't wait to dine in when I have more time. Until then, I will keep placing my to-go orders!"}
{"text":"We tried Thai E-San for the first time last weekend and really enjoyed it. Everyone in our party was impressed with the menu options and service. I tried the Green Curry and a spicy cashew fried rice and both were balanced and bold in flavor. We all loved our food and would happily come back again! Thanks Thai E-San!"}
{"text":"In the death throes of Big Wong the place had really  fallen apart. I was glad to see that the new owner had revamped the place. Nice decor...TABLES OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS. These tables are not only something that you'd expect to find at the top of a beanstalk, but I think archeologists will have a big find in a few thousand years (sturdy). The walls have been tastefully painted. The ceiling has been restored to it's 1970's, stick your pencil into, glory.

Food: Hot. Great gobs of hotness. They give you a scale of hotness (I love thai people) of 1-5. I hesitantly ordered my Spicy Noodles at a level 4. My wife ordered her pad thai at a level two. My dish came out at a perfect heat for me. The noodles could have been a little less done. I couldn't taste the spice at all, but my wife still enjoyed it. 

All in all, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food I've had in Phoenix on this road trip.   

The Massaman Curry is extremely flavorful with peanuts and a super thick creamy thai curry sauce.  

The pepper steak was just as amazing with incredible flavors of pineapple and oyster sauce. 

Dinner for two without cocktails was a little bit over $20 which seems like a pretty good value for this amount of food"}
{"text":"I started with an order of the pad Thai, it came out crazy bright orange & the tamarind flavor was so overpowering, I've never had pad Thai like it before, my husband almost spit the bite out I gave him. I told the server & she seemed annoyed & was a bit condescending about it but got me an pad see ew instead. After that incident she avoided our table & was not very friendly. I felt so uncomfortable, I had already felt horrible and embarrassed for sending something back, her attitude just made it so much worse. The replacement was decent & the lady at the front was so warm & friendly. I'm not sure if we'll be back anytime soon due to the server (or maybe we will do take-out next time)"}
{"text":"The serving staff at this location is always super friendly and attentative. Love any and all of their fish entrees. Pad thai has great flavor. And their top level spicy is legitimate. Food always comes out promptly and the atmosphere is casual without being tacky or untasteful. Close to home, makes for awesome takeout."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for lunch. Owner Pui was great. Most customers she knew by name. I had the vegetable panang curry with brown rice and tod mun for an appetizer. If you are in Phoenix it is worth checking this place out."}
{"text":"This is our number one take out restaurant in Central Phoenix. We love Thai E-San. The service is always perfect. When I say service I mean the care and concern of your take out order. This facet is very often over looked in restaurants and we the diner have about a 60/40 chance of arriving to our home with what we actually ordered and all the accompaniments required to enjoy it. 
I highly recommend the Panang, it is my favorite Thai dishes and Thai E-San has it on point. Delicious!!!!! We also always get their BBQ chicken dinner which is unique and finger licking good. Then lastly make sure you order the plain sticky rice. Yum! Thai E-San is one of the only Thai Restaurants that have authentic sticky rice for you to enjoy with your entree like in Thailand!!!! The have the sticky rice desert too if that's your thing. 
You can't go wrong with any of your choices at Thai E-San. Everything I've had here is wonderful. Don't wait any longer try them tonight you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"On a scale of one to Chiang Mai... this is amazing Thai food. I am always craving warm, make it THAI hot, curry in the cooler months and have been on a personal mission to find JUST the right place here in the valley for THE perfect Thai cuisine. Not only the perfect Thai cuisine, but one that has all the right things : an authentic menu; good ambience that isn't 'diner-y' .. with a cold, brightly lit style of decor, great service; and a FULL bar. You would be surprised how finding THAT ONE great Thai place with all of these elements attached , hasn't been easy! Thai E-San is warm and inviting , with great service! Our waitress explained the heat factor on the dishes we ordered and made suggestions, as well. On this particular night, I was craving a Thai hot-pot style soup, initially, but ended up with the Pineapple Curry. My dish had lots of fresh veggies and chunks of fresh pineapple in a lovely green curry coconut milk; JUST what I wanted on a cold desert night! I got a two on the heat scale of one to five , and I was still in need of a tissue for my nose! ( Well! Best to know that, in case ! ) But, not to worry, as the great wait staff never let the water glass go dry. I got a side of the sticky rice for all that coconut curry goodness , so as not to waste the yummy saucy part. I coupled this with a Chardonnay and all was perfect .. I even had leftovers for the next day, as the servings--Serve! I highly recommend Thai E-San.. as I write this review, I'm suddenly craving that seafood hot pot again ... darn it and here it is closed as its late! Oh well! Maybe tomorrow, as they have a great take out menu. Just remember , if your a two to five sort , bring your tissues !"}
{"text":"Love this place, I forget I'm in the states when I eat the food here.  So far, I've had a curry and a noodle dish.  The noodles are wide and short, very easy to eat with a fork and boy are they tasty. The curry portion is large, I'm a big guy 6ft 2in 240-ish lbs. This night I ate my noodles and a portion of my Lady's curry.  The hot tea is very calming too, so far I had jasmine both times. Tonight was 2nd time and my Lady's 3rd, she took her Mom here for a Birthday dinner."}
{"text":"This place is the best. My husband and I are regulars and the food is always fantastic. It's our favorite hole in the wall. Amber is our favorite server. She is prompt and attentive. The prices are decent, although they have gone up, some. I definitely recommend this place for a wide variety of dishes, excellent egg rolls and great customer service. The only reason I give it a 4 is because of the parking. There is limited parking and you risk parking your car in an unsafe spot if you park behind the building."}
{"text":"Great staff they are friendly and fast. It's clean. There is really good food. Nice verify of food. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, very reasonable price. The food is very good. Spicy levels range from 1 to 5. I usually eat very spicy food. I ordered level 3 spicy and liked it very much. There are quite a number of parking spots outside and behind the restaurant. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I love you Thai e san. You're seriously such a delicious place to go. When I'm sad, when I'm hungry, when I'm meeting friends. Im currently eating your coconut soup. NOM NOM NOM NOM"}
{"text":"One of our go to Thai restaurants in Phoenix. The food we have tried has been good. The wait staff is friendly. We will go there anytime we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sooo good!.. I've been on a quest for the best yellow curry in town and this is one of my favorites so far. Very friendly service, and a ton of food for what you pay for. The lunch special comes with a mushroom coconut soup, chicken curry, rice, egg roll with two crisps AND watermelon at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch. This place is in a small strip mall but once you walk in, it's such a nice looking restaurant. I love the chicken curry & sticky rice... delicious! 
It might be a little drive for me but I most  definitely be going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Update: I received a very respectful message from the owner (or some relation, I presume) expressing condolences for my experience. I realize that experiences may differ, but it is your right as a consumer to know my first impressions and weigh them against the overwhelmingly supportive reviews. That is why the rating and review will otherwise remain unaltered.

In short, the food was not good. The service is some ways was acceptable and in other ways abysmal. The staff seemed happy at least. 

I went here with my wife and my parents because we wanted Thai food, and this place has among the highest ratings for Thai food in the valley. We drove all the way from Rural and Broadway. My parents came from Mesa. 

All of the people who prescribed a five star rating, I'm calling you out. Yelp has consistently lead me to awesome new finds. I even chose my attorney through Yelp. Of course, there is always some expectation of differing opinions from reviews: some better, some worse. This place, however, was way off target. I'm not going to try to estimate wait times, but the whole course of the meal ran about two hours with just an app and an entree. We ordered an appetizer first thing, which the wait staff had to be reminded about. Every time we would try to say something to one of them, they would listen until they got that one thing, and then scurry off before we could mention anything else, which resulted in a lot of subsequent back and forth trips. 

My wife ordered tequila, which I know is not Thai, but they offered it. When it was brought out, they were really weird about it. The server asked her to taste it to make sure it was alright. They were very mysterious about what brand it was.

They did not have limes at the restaurant, which is bizarre for a place that people want to call \"authentic\" or \"legit\" Thai food. 

My wife and I both asked for 4/5 spiciness. We were not impressed. Thailand makes some of the spiciest dishes in the known world, but my dish ranked on par with Tapatio hot sauce. Obviously, when you go to a Thai restaurant, there is an understanding that people who are not Thai probably should not be unwittingly exposed to the native level of full spiciness, but we're not babies. 

They dropped a lot of bowls while we were there, which we agreed was probably the reason that the bowls are plastic. 

They were stingy about how much rice we got. I think I would call my portion about one cup. It did not seem to have been made recently. The entree portions were fine, but my meal didn't seem particularly fresh. 

They were very prompt (minus a little confusion) about refilling our drinks. That is a plus that even good restaurants fail to live up to, so bravo.

The people there seemed happy, and I liked the matching but not identical elephant shirts the staff wore. 

Not sure what people are saying about the \"atmosphere,\" it was just some big tv's and a bunch of mish-mashed nic-nacs: the usual strip mall Asian cuisine furnishings. It wasn't too noisy or anything. Generally was disappointed not so much because of the place itself, but because of my artificially inflated expectations."}
{"text":"Super nice people. We were a huge crowd returning from Sedona called them to tell them we will be getting there 30mins before closing time and we got hungry kids. 

They were so warm and welcoming and ready for us. In spite of it being busy they had a server ready waiting on us. Service was fast, food Scrumptious. Haven't had such authentic Thai food before. We were so hungry that we gobbled our food down and sat back sipping our drinks. The owner came to check if everything was ok and she didn't even rush us. She talked about her family and her history with the restaurant. At no point did we feel they wanted us to leave. Awesome awesome place. I will most definitely come back here on my next visit. 

Thank you for taking care of us and for such a delightful meal."}
{"text":"There's no better lunch special than Thai E-San's. Pick your protein (ranging from chicken/beef/pork to roasted duck and seafood), pick your curry or traditional entree, and enjoy a bonus mini fried spring roll, soup du jour, and puffed rice crackers. We tried the boiled potstickers, pad prig king, massaman curry, Thai coffee and Thai iced tea- we loved all of it. The soup was a vegetable lemongrass, and it was light and delicious.

Meals are selected with a spice gradient of 1-5 (mildest-hottest). The pad prig king was excellent and ultra spicy at a 4, and the massaman curry was perfect at a 3. 5 might be unenjoyably for most, but if you really love to test your limits... This would be a place to do so."}
{"text":"Our favorite family run Thai restaurant. Always the freshest ingredients with big shrimp in their pad Thai and massaman curry. Wonderful authentic recipes and service with a smile."}
{"text":"I love this place, by far the best of Phoenix for Thai food, cozy atmosphere and courteous servers, the owner visits your table to make sure everything is good....I come here almost weekly and have always loved it, my favorite dishes are the red pineapple curry and drunken noodles.  When I return home from vacation this is the place I come first"}
{"text":"Best curry in town and when I ask for added veggies, they add a wonderful assortment not just bell peppers. Service is always good and most is gluten free."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Arizona. The service can be a little variable, but the kindness of the staff and quality of food more than make up for it."}
{"text":"I thought the food was coming directly from Thailand, because of how long it took to get it.

From the moment we entered things seemed a bit off. We were not welcomed, and after a awkward two minutes up front the hostess walked to the tables with some menus and we assumed to follow her.

We got to our table and review the lunch menu, pretty much standard items. We waited some time before we put in our orders, we also hand to remind the waitress that we needed to order drinks.

After a decent wait our soup came,   and then our waters.  The soup was decent and it was fun to spicy with the condiment tray on the table.

We then waited, waited and waited,  47 minutes after we entered our food arrived, this does not work well for a lunch.

My Druken Noodles were mushy and soft. (6.95 combo)  The Won-ton chips were quite stale and my meal did not even come with the egg roll that the menu indicated was included.

Just a note if you decide to come here for some reason their spice scale is the same 1-5 but 3 is hotter than you usual 3.

We then played the waiting game again to get some dogie bags and our bill which we just paid upfront.

There are faster, and better options around that are worth the extra $1."}
{"text":"A great place to eat... food is relatively authentic and the service was traditional. I have always believed that Thai food is an overall experience. The food alone does not qualify. Thankfully this restaurant does! Great job"}
{"text":"Just went here with my buddy last night. We ordered 3 dishes: vegetable pineapple green curry, pad thai and the short ribs. The pad thai was certainly yummy (albeit pretty standard) but the green curry and ribs were out of this world. The green curry was super flavorful and had plenty of veggies, while the ribs were crunchy and unbelievably delicious. To top it all off, the owners and staff were wonderful. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Back to my best Thai place! They have the best curry! I also love the coconut soup and pad see ew! Don't forget about their mango sticky rice for dessert!"}
{"text":"Shady area and shady on the outside .... inside / ambiance : the food made up for it as it was some of the best Thai food I have ever had and in AZ! Started off with splitting the fried tofu ( delicious) and then ordered the eggplant with chicken as it came recommend from a previous yelp review ..

Wasn't terribly busy for a Wednesday night but they also do a big takeout business.

Best Thai food I have had in AZ in the 30 plus years I have lived here .. not afraid to compare it to a place as good or better than in Houston which has food from all over the world 

A++++ I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Thai restaurant in Central Phoenix.  From the delicious food to the incredibly kind and friendly owner and servers, this place is truly the best.  I order take out on the regular and am always greeted right away, never having to wait long.  My favorite dishes are the coconut soup, Pa Naeng Curry, spicy sweet basil with tofu, chicken sauté skewers and the papaya salad."}
{"text":"I have been searching for decent pad thai since I moved to central Phoenix, & Thai E-San has come closer than anywhere else I've tried so far. Spice level 2 that was actually a 2 - not bland, but mild enough for my preference, light, flavorful sauce (admittedly, I supplemented it with a side of their peanut sauce), and a decent amount of chicken. (If you're the type that counts, you might be disappointed that there were only 2 shrimp. I didn't really care.) I got my order take-out, so can't really say much about the service, except that my order was taken quickly and courteously over the phone, was ready when I got there, and the woman at the register was very pleasant and efficient. I'd like very much to dine in & try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is packed with flavor. Every item I've ordered has delivered. I'm sure it helps too that the team there is awesome"}
{"text":"Good little Thai spot, place was packed when we arrived for our pick up order. Servings were somewhat small, but the red curry and garlic chicken were delish."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time tonight. Little spicy for me. Will try few more things!"}
{"text":"Thai E-San is truly delicious. They create a very welcoming environment, it's very clean and the staff is very friendly. The food is so good. My personal favorite item to get is the chicken pad Thai spice level 3. They have a spice system 1-5 5 being the hottest which I am sure is very hot because theee leaves your mouth very warm."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai spot in the valley! Can't say enough great things about it. The staff is friendly. The restaurant is clean with cozy seating options. The food is beyond spectacular. Be sure to try the panang curry. Hope this local gem stays around forever :-)"}
{"text":"Love this Thai joint. We love to order yellow chicken curry (spicy #3), spicy basil rice (spicy #4), spring rolls and the Thai tea is so good."}
{"text":"The food was delicious... just the right amount of spice. We shared the homemade coconut ice cream for dessert, which was also great. The owner was adorable too. She made a point to come by and talk to us at length about food, travel and Thailand. An overall great experience!"}
{"text":"The firsf thing they asked me was \"Are you Thai?\" which made me laugh. Anyways, their pad thai has chicken and shrimp by default and tastes amazing.. They let you control spiciness from 1-5, and 1 already has a good kick to it so be ready!"}
{"text":"The best ever.... We love the food... We love Piu... Her daughter January. The entire staff is awesome... The food is truly authentic...."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out via online and was amazed at the fast service. The food was great and the service was too. I will visit again..."}
{"text":"Best thai food I've had in a long time. Dishes are fresh and spicy. Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Arizona and after a long days hike, my peoples and I wanted to find some flavorful carbs to binge on. I yelped and got a long list of thai restaurants. This one stood out due to its reviews on flavor and service. 

We arrived around 7 and were quickly greeted and seated. We were a bit complicated since we asked to change tables three times to be more comfortable but were easily accommodated. The waiter was EXCELLENT! I didn't get his name but he was tall and thin and had a very flamboyant attitude. He was prompt, very hospitable, and so resourceful!

The place was dimly lit, with a few string lights, lots of vibrant decor that weren't too distracting and booth seats- each topped with a rose. This was very comforting and they also have television sets for those who don't like to talk during dinner. 

We ordered multiple items- most of them extremely spicy. The heat was nice but definitely wasn't good on the stomach afterwards. I think I would sacrifice my stomach again for the goodness though. :) If you're not too fond of the spicy heat, please opt for the lowest number when the waiter asks you. All of the items were full of flavor, not lacking one bit like some Thai restaurants. My peoples and I were highly impressed and were happy to have found a gem blindly in Arizona. 

The waiter was the best local tour guide- swear to god. He gave us tips on where to go during certain times for the best views or even shopping. He even provided the weather deets and told us to bring a sweater to stay warm in Sedona- boy was he right! His excitement and interests in our travels was much needed and we felt grateful all around. 

Thank you!! We had a great time in Arizona because of this one stop!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the more authentic and best thai places I've been to since moving to AZ. It's almost as good as my favorite place back home. They give very generous portions and the prices are decent. We had egg rolls and fried tofu as appetizers. The tofu was the perfect crispness and the thai sweet chili sauce was sooo good (comes with peanuts, so if you have an allergy, don't forget to tell them to make it without). 

I had pad see ew with fried tofu and loved that they put chinese broccoli in it. That's how the place back home makes it. They also have regular broccoli too so its a nice mix. The noodles and sauce were really good and not at all overcooked. I also got pad thai to go (with chicken and shrimp) and it smells and looks really good. (I'm eating it for lunch tomorrow!) My friends got duck penang curry and chicken green curry with level 3 spicyness. They can eat spicy, but it was hitting them pretty hard tonight, so you might want to watch out for that. 

Overall I was very happy with the food! The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy at night and it's a bit far from where I live, but it's close to where we did yoga so that was convenient. There was one semi-creepy guy refilling our water, but that didn't bother me too much because I was starving and the food hit the spot tonight!"}
{"text":"Holy Moley Batman!

Found this gem on Yelp while waiting for a flight home from Phoenix.  From the outside it screams \"amazing hole in the wall\" and it did not disappoint.

Came in for lunch and we were immediately handed a lunch special menu, I was worried.  After looking at the menu it made sense.  Proteins and then your preparation.  The lunch special comes with an egg roll, wonton chips, soup and rice.  

The soup was amazing seasoned well and you could taste the layers of flavor.  Probably the best Tom Yom I've ever had.  I got the combo protein (beef, chicken, pork and shrimp) prepared \"Royal Red Curry\" style.  Holy Jeebus it was amazing.  Again great flavors and the proteins weren't over done.  

Very, very, very good Thai, don't let the exterior scare you.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm coming here right after I get off the plane."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food I've ever had. Incredible variety (can add squid to a lot of the dishes), and some regionally specific dishes that I've never seen before. 

The owner came over and talked to me while I was picking up my order. She was super nice and really appreciative of her customers. Can't ask for more than what I got at Thai E-San."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food restaurants in Phoenix.  If you are downtown do not miss it.  

They recently upgraded the interior so the ambiance is nice.  

If you were a fan of pink pepper in the north valley then you will love this place.  This is the same owners of the original, before it went downhill.  

Fried rice is excellent, crispy orange chicken is perfect. 

We bring the family and are trying to work through the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Donna R...the staff does a good job with customer service and the owner is very friendly. The prices are just a little bit higher than what I'm used to paying for Thai food, but the food is outstanding and service is great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had dinner here and it was amazing! We have been in love with Thai food since having it in Portland Oregon and this was by far the best we've found in Arizona! 

I would highly recommend the pasta pasta with shrimp! It was amazing we did the spice on level 2 and it was the perfect amount of spice! 

There was a bit of a wait for food but other than that highly recommended with friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is the best rated Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Being an Asian food junkie, I just had to go. First off, I thought the ambiance was nice- Asian flair in the decorations, fresh cut roses at each table, etc. I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, my go to Thai dish and even though I went at an off hour (1600 on a weekend), my food came out in probably 5-7 minutes. It was good, but it definitely wasn't the best I've had. On a scale of 1 to 10, I got a 5 for spice and I thought the spiciness reflected that- which I appreciated. Too often I ask for spicy but don't ever experience a hint of it. I don't know where they get their shrimp but it's definitely not normal sized shrimp- it's gigantic. And delicious. And sparse. I just thought there was something missing. Maybe the tamarind, maybe the peanuts, maybe not enough bean sprouts. It didn't have that fundamental and signature \"umph\" I usually taste in the Thai food I ate in NYC. I will say three things: 1: it was definitely the wettest Pad Thai I had. There was an abundance of sauce. 2: the portions are giant. 3: the service is perfect. I guzzle down water while eating and found that my glass was never empty or even half empty. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Authentic food and atmosphere / great food / good prices and friendly staff what else can you expect, Try the rice soup yummy"}
{"text":"Their food is good, pad thai is my favorite. There is one thing about them, they try charge extra on a small tiny thing which is not worth to do that. Anyways I think this restaurant is one of the best Thai restaurant in town. I always tip them well."}
{"text":"Just kind of Average

Thai  E-San offers a great variety of entree selections on their menu and the staff is knowledgeable of allergens in their foods. The staff is very friendly and accomdating and the owner usually goes around and talks to all the guests.

On this visit I started my meal with Coconut Milk Soup, to be honest I wasnt a fan. I then moved onto went on to Phad-Thai, and beef fried rice. The meal was enjoyable however the entrees were a  little light on the meat, the meal just wasn't very memorable.


Thai E-San is centrally located with easy access and parking. The wait staff are  prompt and courteous. The restaurant and decor is clean and pleasant.

{"text":"I love this place. Everyone in the office comes here once a week for lunch. I love the spicy noodles w basil and the beef laab. So delicious !"}
{"text":"Wonderfully spicy pad thai with tofu topped off a very long day of work. I always try to adventure out on my own during business trips, and Thai E-San didn't disappoint. The only downside of such a huge serving is not having a fridge in your hotel to bring it home!

They do brisk business in take-out orders, and the restaurant was packed when I arrived. My one-top status didn't prevent them from seating me in a booth, which was greatly appreciated after a long day on my feet. Bonus: The Rockets game was on the TV."}
{"text":"This place is a farce and a travesty...  as are all over priced banquet style Thai places that place a premium on marketability at the expense of food taste and quality.  It's the sort of place that fat English guys wanting to recreate their holiday in Pattaya or Koh Samui would go.   Again, I go back to my rule about ethnic restaurants - the less people of that ethnicity you see patronizing the place the less likely you are to get a great meal.  

Although they do serve authentic Isan food on their menu - they recreate it unfaithfully and only in shades of what you really get in Thailand.  Isan, is a poorer, ethnic minority in Northeastern Thailand that is significantly influenced by Laos.  True Isan food is amazing - usually eaten with hand fulls of sticky rice - larb (ground meat, mint, and lime) , som tum (papaya salad), gai yang (grilled chicken), and sai krok isan (isan sausage). 

Any restaurant claiming to be the standard bearer of Isan food, should serve these dishes with mastery.  Thai E-San does offer them, albeit at a ridiculous premium, but does so disappointingly.  

It is sad to see such a great regional cuisine get such a terrible representative here in Phoenix.  Save your money and go elsewhere... unless you are an English tourist in need of nostalgia... in which case, proceed with my blessing!"}
{"text":"Been here so many times and a review is overdue. But this review is based on my last visit. 

Every time we walked in the door we always greeted with this waiter (don't know his real name) we called him \"Mongolian Beef\" (inside joke). He's always friendly and we often joke with him. 

Most of the time I would start with Thai Iced Tea for drink and I did this time as well. Although I do think it is a little too sweet but it is pre-made so they can't adjust that. I love their Pineapple Fried Rice when they put the fried rice in the actual half cut emptied pineapple shell, but they don't do that anymore. So for this time I ordered a Pa-Naeng Curry (Malaysia) it has coconut milk, red chilli, & fresh Thai herbs. It tasted a lot better than it looked."}
{"text":"Now that we have eaten here several more times, I realized the 4 stars does not do this place justice.  Really excellent food."}
{"text":"I don't often make it to this part of town, but now that I've tried Thai E-San, that just might change.  Friendly staff, great food, and a calming atmosphere give this restaurant an A in my book.

Myself and two other friends enjoyed a few dishes, as we were told most were meant to be shared.  What was selected: Lemon Grass soup with Chicken, Fish, and Squid; Yellow Chicken Curry; and Chicken Pad Thai.

The Lemon Grass soup was just what was expected, deliciously tangy with some nice heat.  Tender fish, chicken, and squid was portioned liberally and melted in my mouth.  The Yellow Chicken Curry and Pad Thai were pretty standard, though definitely not a disappointment.

Everything was excellent, though I have a feeling if it wasn't, the chef would have corrected it for us.  She was very helpful, even came out to make sure everything was to our standard.

I will be back."}
{"text":"We were craving Thai food when we were here and Thai E-San looked like it had pretty good reviews. We ordered the pad see ew, coconut seafood soup, and yellow curry (with duck). I thought the pad see ew was a bit salty, but overall, everything tasted good. We definitely got our Thai food fix :)"}
{"text":"Its 9:15 on a Saturday night in downtown Phoenix and the boyfriend and I are hungry.  Thai food sounds good but one of my biggest issues with Phoenix restaurants is that they close too early.  You are lucky if you can find anything opened past 9pm.  I think I remember that Thai E-San is opened until 10:30 but I am not sure why I think that.  

I have never been to this restaurant but I hear good things and have wanted to check it out for a long time.  We get to the restaurant and check the hours. They close at 9:30.  I hate getting a table at the last minute as I don't want to hold up the staff that have been there all day long and know that they want to go home.  I turn around to get back in my car when a nice lady comes out and asks us to come in.  Well, with that warm welcome, how can I refuse?  

We get seated in a comfortable window booth and look at the menu.  It is big with the usual menu items that one would expect at a Thai restaurant.  We start with Thai iced tea ($1.99) the perfect drink for a hot Phoenix evening.  We then ordered the chicken Satay ($9.50) Seemed high priced until the dish arrived.  7 large servings of grilled chicken breast perfectly grilled, served with cucumber salad and peanut sauce.  For our main dishes we both were in the mood for curry.  We tried both the Royal Curry, yellow curry in coconut milk, potato, onion and carrot (9.95) and the salmon green curry, coconut milk, bamboo shoot, green beans, Thai eggplant and Thai herbs ($14.95)  Both servings were Tasty, although too large for us to finish but that did not stop us from ordering the Sticky Rice with Mango ($4.95) 

The service was exceptional as the staff treated us like family.  One warning, if you do not like your dishes spicy, do not order past a one star."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their garlic chicken and the servers and hosts that I have encountered have been super friendly. When I ordered carryout food it was packed, hot, and ready to go at the front. I just recently discovered this gem and I see myself being a regular from here on out. Over the past two weeks I think I've been there three times already. Can't wait to for my next visit."}
{"text":"Want really good Thai food? THIS IS THE PLACE!
This is the best I have found in the Valley.
Everything on the menu is amazing (yes, I think I have frequented here so much I have tried everything on the menu)
The staff is amazing as well, always make me feel welcome and at home.
Just be sure to get here at least 15 minutes before they close."}
{"text":"I'd love to write about each of what seems to be an onslaught of Thai restaurants opening in the Valley, but many offer the same style of fare. However, a few serve more unique dishes in addition to the classics.

Located on Indian School Road next to 3 Snaps Resale Shop, Thai E-San specializes in the regional cooking of northeastern Thailand, also known as the Issan or Esan region. It is difficult to clearly define Esan cooking since many of those native dishes, like papaya salad and larb, are common on many Thai menus. They are more about heat and sourness, as pretty much everything we tried here reflected that.

I have noticed some commonalities among Thai restaurants, including gracious service. From the time we entered the large dining room until we left, the staff was polite and attentive, not to mention gorgeous. Thai women are stunning.

Another similarity with many Thai restaurants is the sheer size of the menu. I have no idea how they can keep so many ingredients on hand to make so many dishes. If you don't mind some reading and ask lots of questions, you can learn a lot about food, cooking and, of course, eating.

Starting with the Thai E-San Special Appetizer ($12.95) lands you in the middle of a massive amount of shareable treats. Brimming with crunchy Egg Rolls, tender peanut sauce laden Chicken Satay, Wontons and a sweet and spicy Cucumber Salad, there is enough for at least three bear-sized appetites. The portions are large, so sharing is a must, which is also very Esan.

The Beef Salad ($8.95) is sliced char-grilled sirloin with chili, onion, lime juice, rice powder and fresh Thai herbs. It can be ordered with varied heat, from one, which is mild, to five, which is hot as it gets. I prefer ordering two or three, then add heat from the chile condiment jars. This dish was bold, with a nice sourness from the lime juice.

I also was excited about the Thai E-San Sausage ($10.95). It's more of a grilled savory sausage than a fermented sour or sweet sausage, with tubes stuffed with ground pork, pork skin and Thai herbs with a heavy lime flavor. The snappy crunch of each bite led to textures of the pork skin and ground meat, tender with a chewy spring.

I love Drunken Noodles, and Thai E-San's version was top notch. Also called Spicy Noodle with Basil ($8.95), there's a choice of meat or tofu that is stir fried with large wide noodles, chile, basil, bean sprouts, onions and bell peppers. Each tender noodle tastes like it was seasoned on its own with an explosion of flavor and spice.

The massive pile of Pineapple Fried Rice ($12.95) is mixed with shrimp, chicken and juicy pieces of fresh pineapple and topped with cashew nuts. It's a sensual mix of sweet, sour and salty, appealing to most, if not all, of your senses.

Thai E-San offers only a couple of desserts, Coconut Ice Cream ($3.50) and Sticky Rice with Mango ($4.95). The latter offered slices of sweet ripe mango atop hot and sticky rice bathed with warm coconut milk for a great finish.

Thai E-San has almost 100 menu items, so there is plenty to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Wow amazing food. Restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated. Great owners. Very reasonable prices. Everyone there were so nice to my son and I. Definitely going to make this our new Thai food spot."}
{"text":"Best thai food I have tried! Highly recommend the drunken noodles!! The yellow curry was good but small portion. Restaurant is clean and great service!"}
{"text":"Came in with a large group of co workers for a lunch. Lunch specials are pretty awesome. For $8.99 you can choose what entree you want and you also get to pick your protein to go along with it. You also get to choose how spicy you want it to be with a level of 1-5. I ordered the royal curry which is their yellow curry. A very good yellow curry. I enjoyed the overall flavor of the curry and the chicken was moist and had good texture. The lunch special came with a small bowl of their soup of the day and it also came with 2 wonton chips and an egg roll. Service was great and you can tell that this is a family run business, which I love. Would definitely recommend this Thai place."}
{"text":"Great place with a beautiful atmosphere and great service. Try the silver noodle soup and follow it with some Pad Tai!"}
{"text":"We went here again tonight. The food is as good as last time! And the owner is super nice! She said she remade the crushed red pepper by herself! She ended up giving me some to take home. And she always try to make sure everything is ok while we were eating. Such a nice owner who truly cares about her customers!"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried there has been very good! I especially love their House Pad Thai! We get it hot and it has a great kick to it but not too hot! (I have a pretty high tolerance.) They were able to make a mild house pad thai for those who could not handle the heat. I also love their coconut ice cream. It was bigger than I thought it would be, so the price was fine. Creamy and no coconut flakes in it! Just the way I like it!"}
{"text":"Definitely the spot to go! I absolutely love their food! They always make the correct order and are very nice every time! Have been coming here for a couple years!"}
{"text":"Really great Thai food.  I am a creature of habit so I have only tried a few things on the menu.  The yellow curry with chicken is my favorite!  I get it almost every time I am there.  I am also a wimp so on a scale of 1 to 5 I get it on a max of 2.  Sometimes that is even too hot for me. lol  Service is always very fast and friendly.  Restaurant is super clean.  Free wifi too!"}
{"text":"I had the vegetable pad Thai. Meh . I like my noodles not to stick together like sticky rice to my tongue after running a marathon with no water, and I enjoy a little more flavor. Vegetables in the pad Thai were decent. What allowed me to give any positive review was testing their pineapple curry. It wasn't my meal but I had a taste of it and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in phoenix. Haven't found a place that tops their Panang curry , they also can make the food super spicy which I love!"}
{"text":"First time going to eat here and the food was delicious(I had the Red Curry)."}
{"text":"I've had Thai in restaurants all over the country and thus was one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the U.S. They were friendly, and there were a lot of special touches that made the food seem \"homemade.\" The fish cakes were top notch, and the eggplant was perfect. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant.  The service could not have been more friendly.  The owner and wait staff really want their clients to have a delicious and warm experience.  Our meals were positively delicious and spicy.  We tried both noodle and rice dishes and they were exquisite.  It was a nice touch by the owner to stop me on the way out to make sure that we enjoyed our lunch.  This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Thai restaurant.   Every time I have been there, the staff is friendly and welcoming.   They will prepare your dish as spicy as you want, I enjoy really spicy food and they do a great job accommodating my request.  I usually either get shrimp or scallops with my dish, and they always are fresh and high quality.   I did not have an issue with the portion size.   I had plenty of food on my plate and left satisfied.   The food has a very clean taste and does not leave you feeling too full and uncomfortable.   I will definitely continue going here and will recommend it to anyone looking for a good Thai restaurant in central phoenix area."}
{"text":"Some of the best dang red curry I've had in a long time. Met my boyfriend here for lunch today and we were both satisfied with our fantastic meals! It wasn't too busy when we went, around 1:15 on a Saturday. Service was pretty fast! I got red curry with tofu, my fave, and my boyfriend got red curry with pineapple and chicken. We both agreed that the spice level was perfect. We are both total wimps so we got 1's out of a 1-5 spiciness range. It was perfect, a little kick without being too hot. The tofu was crispy and yummy without being too chewy. We both loved how creamy the broth was and how it was loaded with vegetables. Also one of the most affordable meals we've had in a while. Glad I found this place, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Mom and Pop place that is delicious.  A fan of their drunken noodles.  They will ask you hot spicy you want your curries.  If you brave good for the spice, you can always quence your thirst with a Thai tea.  The Satays are delicious and the portions of all meals are plentiful.  I usually have enough for anotehr meal.  The decor is nice but they do have these oddly large tables.  Go with a big group and order lots!  They also have lunch specials which are really reasonable."}
{"text":"After a few months of living down the street I finally made it over to Thai-E San! And let me just say I waited way to long to give it a try! We enjoyed potstickers, wonton soup, #29 & #34! Our server recommended the #29 and it was absolutely incredible! Went with the medium spice & I swear I will be craving it the rest of this week! We ended our meal with the coconut ice cream and OMG! Amazing!!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had so far served by really nice people in a clean and quiet environment. Even my friends from Asia pronounced it \"Really good,\" so that's quite high praise. Everything was perfect - not too sweet or Americanized. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I also ask them for suggestions and they are incredibly helpful. I have never had a bad meal here. It's a little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a little confused by the super high rating of Thai E-San. The dishes I had here weren't bad, but I've found other Thai places in Phoenix that far outstrip the fare here and often at more generous prices. 

The restaurant itself is located in a small lot off a busy street, and the parking lot has very slanted parking spaces. The interior decor sports an interesting mix of wooden tables and red plastic leather booth chairs. The ambiance was definitely casual. Service was fine, a little slow but friendly. 

I do like the variety of spices and sauces available on each table, and I was a huge fan of the jalapenos in vinegar that helped to cut the heaviness of the dishes I tried. That particular sauce was also incredibly salty, but it was flavorful enough that I didn't mind that as much.

Pad Thai:
This was so sweet that I was grateful for the very salty sauce I mentioned above. The noodles were drenched in sauce, which I like, but the sweetness made me not want to take more than a few bites before dousing the next few in salty sauce. The portion was generous, and the shrimp were nicely tossed so that they weren't overcooked. 

Pad See Ew:
I liked this dish better than the Pad Thai, as it was much better balanced. The soy sauce was flavorful without being too salty, and I detected more of the wok-fired fragrance I love in these kinds of sauteed noodle dishes. The beef was a bit stringy and tough, possibly because it hadn't been tenderized before sauteeing, but I didn't mind it too much since the flavor was pretty good.

With so many other amazing Thai places in the Phoenix area, it's unlikely that I'd return to Thai E-San. I'm glad that so many others find this place amazing, but I personally found it just a-okay."}
{"text":"Always a good and low key place for lunch. Anything I've had here was great.  Ambiance is a little dark but comfy."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food place in Arizona! The staff is the best, love the atmosphere! Prices are affordable and the service is great. I always come here even though I live quite far from it. 
I always recommend my family & friends here as well! Never disappoints."}
{"text":"They really have some of the best Thai in town. The owners are wonderful and staff does a fantastic job. Their coconut soup is always a favorite as well as their wonderful beef salad, very fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to's while I'm in school in Phoenix. I love that Thai E-San has delicious food with great portions and a decent price. Plus, the service here is always really friendly, and they even got my name right on the first try, which always impresses me.

In all honesty, whenever I eat Thai food, I almost always order the Pad Thai or pad see-ew. Both are great here. I've also had their spring rolls, soup, and mango with sticky rice. All of them are so delicious, and sometimes I want to come back just for the dessert."}
{"text":"Crazy delicious! I'd give this place 6 stars if I could! I had green curry with chicken and jasmine rice, my sister had pangang curry. We also had spring rolls for an appetizer and I had a Thai tea. The service was fast and very friendly. Everything was wonderful and the food was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! As good as it gets!  Some of the best Thai food around town. This isn't close to my house, but I seriously need to go back soon.  Very authentic."}
{"text":"Yummy food, reasonable prices....need I say more?"}
{"text":"Thai E-San is a great place to eat. I got a lunch special for a great price and it was yummy! I plan to come by next time around and hope to bring some coworkers with me!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food i had till date. All the spices were just perfect.
Awesome hospitality by staff, especially by the lady at the front desk:)
Highly recommended if you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Since we were just working in Phoenix for the weekend, I yelped \"Vegan\" to see what options this city had in store for us. Thai E-San was highly rated with great reviews that proved to be true!. The owner was great and let us know everything was made to order and that we could pretty much pick anything to be prepared Vegan. The Pad See-Ew and Eggplant were cooked to perfection. We ordered a 3 on the spicy scale of 1-5 and that was HOT, but so goooood. To-go portions were generous as well. Plenty of food for 2 people to share. If we lived here... we would definitely become regulars."}
{"text":"This is our go to Thai restaurant! We always get take out and service is so prompt and friendly we always go back. We order the Tom ka chicken coconut soup and 2 orders of egg rolls for under 20$. We've been going here for over a year now at least 3 times a month. Great staff and great food! The inside of the restaurant is also clean and it has a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!!! It's really hard to find a really great Thai restaurant in my opinion, but I'm glad I stumbled across this place!! First of all on my boyfriends behalf \"the spice is on point\".  Every Thai place never gets it right. He ordered the red curry with chicken at a 4 spice level. He was pleasantly pleased. 

I ordered the beef pad see ew at a 3 spice level. If you like spice then I would start at 3. Personally it was too spicy for me but the food itself was great! 

I would deff recommend this place to anyone. It's very clean, the food is great, and the staff is friendly! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Thai I've had in a long time! As a SF native/former NYer, I've had some of the best Thai food so my expectations weren't that high for the desert. But, bygolly! This food was AMAZING! I had the fresh spring rolls with tofu and warm peanut sauce, and the pad see ew with broccoli, carrots and tofu. Some of the best pad see ew I've had!   

Excellent, attentive service and ample parking. I dined on a Sunday during NFL playoffs and they have large TVs so its a great place to catch a game. Can't wait to go back.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were so happy to find this restaurant! Delicious! We will definitely return to try more menu options! Our waitress was so helpful and attentive!"}
{"text":"Their $7.49 weekday lunches are such a great deal. Even the soup that comes with the lunch is yummy. It's not on the lunch menu but they always make the Yellow Curry for me upon request. The Spicy noodles are very good as well."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've tasted in the valley.  Completely hearty eating and cleanly prepared food - two things that I haven't experienced at other Thai restaurants in this area. The setting is laid-back and casual. And Jamal is the kind of waiter that you leave a shout out about; great with strangers and exactly the kind of personality you want representing your business."}
{"text":"I've been on a Thai food binge recently visiting a lot of Thai restaurants in the area and Thai E San has come out on top. The staff are really friendly and put some Thai hot together for me and took great pride doing so. It seems family owned just by the feel and hospitality, I may be wrong but that would be my guess. 

The green curry here is my favourite. Lots of flavour and spice... if you can't handle heat I would keep the spice to 2 from the 5 levels. If you are like myself and like the spicey then 3 and above is great. 

One thing that is a must is the Tom Ka soup. It's the best, so much flavour... coconut, lime, chicken at a level 3. Very satisfying.

I will be back soon to try some of the Panang. I'm sure I will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in since the reviews were so good and now I see why! Spring rolls = amazing!! BBQ Chicken = melt in your mouth! Pad See Yew = Fantastic! Massaman Curry = spicy but so so good! I'm kind of an expert in Thai restaurants and this is definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in Phoenix. Oh and super friendly staff! Helps when u tell them u saw them on yelp"}
{"text":"I was there on a Friday night.  We had 10 people in our group.  They had more employees this time and I am glad.  The food is good and we did not have to wait a hour for food.  The service could be better, had to ask for refills and someone to take our order.  We ordered:

Appetizers:  Angel wings and #10 combo appetizers (chicken stay, chicken egg rolls, fried wontons, Thai toast, and fish patties)
 All of the appetizers were GOOD!  

Entrees:  2 BBQ chickens; green curry with beef; 2 tom guy soups; pork fried rice, pineapple fried rice, pad saw yee noodles, pad thai noodles, and green beans with pork.
 The BBQ chickens were good but dry (need to apply the sweet chili sauce).
 The tom guy soup were mild (but my mouth was on FIRE).
 Everything else was GOOD!!

Everyone took a leftovers for lunch!"}
{"text":"We have lived here for almost 5 yrs now and have never been here, drive by it all the time. We were fans of Thai Basil, but one night they were not answering the phone for a to go order, we drove over and it was closed on a Tuesday early eve? Online it even said they were open. So not sure what happened, but we ended up trying Thai E San. What a charming and cozy place inside! Clean, great display of food also when they bring it out, down to the dishes. Great date place, great atmosphere, very attentive service and polite, The food was great! We have already been back, if it weren't for Thai Basil being closed that night we probably wouldn't have stopped in! So glad we did! Its our new fave place!"}
{"text":"Thai E San is an exceptional Thai restaurant. Here are some of the highlights: 
The curries are all consistently good with enough heat to clear the toughest sinus. The specials change each week, the Gai Ping is a delicious chicken in peanut sauce with spinach, definitely worth a try. The spicy green bean (PIK king) is flavorful and can be made like all other dishes with a choice of meats or tofu. The Thai tea here is sweeter and smoother than Thai tea that I've tried at other establishments. 
Service is exceptional, just be on guard for the part time comedian, his service skills may make up for the bad jokes."}
{"text":"My bridal party decided to take me here to eat for my bachelorette dinner and when they called to make reservations the staff offered to call and have a stripper come out. I was like WTH kinda thai restaurant are you guys taking me to?!?

For a Friday night they were pretty slow. Place is pretty spacious and big enough to hold big parties. Please check the silverware and cups prior to using it. My girlfriend saw a lipstick stain on her cup. 

we got the usual safe thai dishes: curry, pad thai, papaya salad, pad see ew, tom yum soup, etc. 

for a party of 6... we got quite a few plates to do family style. the portions were really small. so we each couldn't either get seconds or get a generous amount. usually in LA it's easy to do family portions because the amount is pretty big. I zoomed in on my pictures that's why it looks like the portion is big btw. 

to be honest, nothing was really memorable food wise. if you truly had nothing else to eat and was craving thai then i would say come here. they ask if you want stuff spicy and would give you a very big scale to rate from. i believe it was 1-10 which is a really big scale to choose from. As a side note: I'm just spoiled by all the food options in LA and it's truly hard to not compare it to what I'm used to. Therefore my review may be totally different than a local. 


staff speaks english really well. dimmed parking lot and inside. 


Tips:
-has its own parking lot. 
-takes reservations
-cash and credit cards accepted
-adds gratuity for parties of 6 or more. 
-small portions
-indoor seating only
-they do catering."}
{"text":"I'm really picky when it comes to Thai Food.  Place is nice, clean, pretty no nonsense.  Staff is friendly.  We ordered the appetizer sampler.   I was not really impressed.  The fish cakes were flavorless and not a cake at all, it looked like it was poured in a mold.  Crab puffs/rangoons didn't have anything inside.  The chicken was not bad.  I had the chicken with cashew nuts.  It was good, but reminded me more of Thai Basil.  It was my friends favorite place so he wanted me to experience it.  I would come again but only for the lunch specials.  Not a date night place.  My favorite Red Thai has yet to be beaten."}
{"text":"I'll be back soon!

Parking: There is a small lot in front. I went on a Sunday afternoon but suspect on weekday afternoons, it could be tricky to get in/out just due to location.    

Atmosphere:   Super casual. There are a couple TVs inside that had sports on, and there is a sign outside that states \"Wi fi.\"   

Service:   The wait staff were incredibly friendly and nice. They also were not annoying at all and did not rush us.  

Food:  The soup is what I test Thai restaurants with. The lemongrass vegetable soup was delicious, spicy and hot.  I asked for medium spicy and that's exactly the spice I got!  I also ordered sticky rice, and it was as it should be.  The guy I was with got some kind of pork curry and said it was perfect.  He was able to get brown rice with this.  

Drinks: I had water and jasmine tea.  The jasmine tea was hot and appropriately flavored."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place in Phoenix. Red curry is my favorite. They'll make it as spicy as you ask. Crab puffs are yummy. Thai egg rolls are also a fave. And of course, the pad Thai is delicious and fresh ingredients. I eat here like twice a week. So good!!"}
{"text":"We were just driving along, originally looking for an Indian place miles away when we spotted Thai E-San and said \"what the hey\". Turns out it's great food all around and very friendly staff and reasonable prices. We loved it! We like really spicy food, and the waiter talked us into a \"3\" level of spice. If we had gone \"4\" it would have been too much."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight -takeout. The service is great, nice on the phone, and were prompt making sure I was attended to. Got the vegetable green curry- 4star and pad Thai 3star. Green curry is nice, it was a true 4star spicy, vegetables crisp and cooked just right, but sauce did have more of a sweetness than I'm used to. Bf got the pad Thai, and he liked it. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place sets the standard for good Thai food in Phoenix. Great ambiance and the food seemed to come out pretty quick, and the staff is helpful with recommendations. The spice levels are pretty spicy, so if you like spicy order a 4-5 if you are a little weary of spicy I'd stick with a 1-2. I had the spicy noodle with shrimp, beef and chicken. Spice level was a 4 and was certainly spicy enough. They aren't the biggest portions and I only had 2 shrimp in my combination.  Had they been just a little more generous I would rate 5 stars. Would definitely try again."}
{"text":"The most authentic Thai food I have eaten in Phoenix. I ordered Beef Rad Naa, a noodle dish not nearly as well known as Pad Thai. It was spot on, including the wide, soft rice noodles stir fries with seasonings over which to pour the beef and broccoli gravy. Perfect with the fermented soy beans in the mix. Looking forward to going back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. I get the green curry special with chicken medium - only costs $8.15. The spice is perfect! They give a ton of food too for take out compared to other lunch specials. Everyone is very nice too!"}
{"text":"Just finished our take-out dinner from Thai E-San. Let me tell you about my first time here. The moment we walked in we were greeted by two members of their staff. Atmosphere in the restaurant was quiet and friendly. After ordering, I assume it's the owner, came over and chatted with us about why we chose their place. REALLY nice! 

Let's talk food! Curry, Ginger Stir fry, and a Shrimp stir fry. Flavors were incredible. I got the Ginger as a 3. Perfect! Next time we're eating in instead of taking to go. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My regular Thai joint wasn't open and someone had mentioned this place to me. I will go back to this place, only I will choose something different to eat.

I went with the Shrimp and Scallops in Peanut Sauce. When she asked if I want hot, I hestitated than said yes. Than she said 1-5, 3 I replied. I could've went with 4 or even 5, I like it spicy! Out of the whole dish, two bites were actually spicy. The shrimp and scallops were HUGE, there was only three of each in the dish. The dish was just okay. I didn't have time to research it which is why I went with the day's special, a \"safe\" choice.

The service was really decent, it was like they read my mind. I was taking a second bite thinking I wish there was more sauce in my dish when the waitress asked if I would like some. Than later I was thinking its freezing in here, thank goodness I had my sweater, when a woman walked up and said she's cold and if I was, and she turned down the A/C.  This same woman apoligized if she was being to loud on the phone, which it was loud conversation with the phone being passed around, but I barely noticed...I'm used to it.

They were all very nice and my water was not allowed to get past the half way mark.

I also got the Thai Eggroll (2) which were good. I like that they had the sweet and sour in the squirt bottles. It controls waste and its helps me aim specifically where I want it. LoL. The enitre meal was just under 20$, a bit pricey for what I got. But like I said, I went for the safe dish and will go back to try something different."}
{"text":"Thai E-San,

I forgive you! Like my sister who told a secret to someone that I didn't want that person to know and she starts crying and apologizing profusely once I tell her how upset I was. She states that she didn't know that it would upset me so - I had to forgive her and move on. It was a genuine apology and I still love her.... Yes, that's how I feel with Thai E-San. 

They messed up, but they didn't know until I posted that review. The owner reached out to me and invited me to the restaurant on her. She told me she researched what was wrong with the noodles and it's because the manufacturer of the noodles changed the texture/ingredients so when you cook it, it turns into mush. She had to change the way they cooked the noodle dish to make it back to the greatness I remember it being. She also discussed the service and she has made changes to improve. 

She apologized and thanked me for posting the review. She said that she deals with negative reviews seriously and she takes it as constructive criticism to improve. Bravo, Pui (the owner)! Now, that's a great restaurant owner!

We came the other night and we were served the two dishes we always get: Shrimp Pad Se-Ew and Beef Panang - both were deliciously fabulous! The service was great and the owner was so sweet and hopes that we come back. 

So moral of the story - The owner apologized, it was genuine, and she took proper steps to improve. Like my sister, I have to forgive and move on because I still love Thai E-San.

Duh, I will dine at this establishment again and again and again."}
{"text":"The food here is solid and ultimately, that is what matters to me.  Tonight I had the red curry with vegetables (they must've thought I looked like I needed protein so they threw in a few pieces of tofu also).  It was pretty much perfect.  I ordered it as a 4 and am happy to report that my nose ran and I perspired adequately.

The service is a bit slow but for the quality of the food, I can look past that.  This has definitely become my go-to for Thai in Cen Pho!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! Great service and even better food! The ladies are very nice and helpful! I recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Central Phoenix. E-San refers to an area in Northern Thailand where the food is a little more mild in flavors. There is no shortage of great flavor in Thai E-San's food though. 

It's a lovely restaurant. Very nice Thai decor. They have several tables and booths to choose from. 

Any time I am at a Thai restaurant, my drink of choice is the Thai iced tea. This one did not disappoint!  Highly recommended! 

To eat, we started off with the Thai toast appetizer. It was a huge portion of little toast squares that are topped with a meat mixture and then coated in egg batter and fried. Served with a sweet cucumber and onion sauce. Absolutely delicious. 

For my main course I had the spicy basil noodles and added chicken for my protein. I ate every bit of it. My two friends ordered tofu panang curry and pad Thai. All of our choices were delicious. 

The owner of Thai E-San is a very sweet woman. She walks around chatting with her customers and makes sure everyone is happy. Nice touch!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good flavor, friendly crew. But more than a complaint, I have a question. I ordered curry with roasted duck, and although I understand duck is fatty and has little meat, I'm not sure that less than 2 ounces of actual duck meat is enough, especially when you pay extra for that. I got quite a lot of skin. It's just that, if any of you out there or even the restaurant want to tell me what duck is all about I'd appreciate it. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ok, so my mother(65) and I(29) love going out to eat around town and always looking for the better spots. I must say this is one of those spots. We have eaten decent Thai food in phx before and been happy. This place far exceeded all those before. Great, great flavor! The green curry was FANTASTIC! As was the Pad Thai! This place is on our \"to return to\" list. So delish it's highly recommended in my book. Small place with huge flavor!"}
{"text":"The BEST customer service I've had in a long time!  To go order. She explained ingredients of all 3 entrees; got a bottled water while waiting.  Greeted by 3 different employees.  Great job!  Good good too.  Usually goto Thai Lana, but think I'll be going here now!"}
{"text":"Every now and then I get severe Thai food cravings. Thankfully Yelp has always steered me in the right direction!

Hubby and I came here around 3 pm for an early dinner and the place was already more than halfway full. When we got our food, we could see why. 

Here's a dish by dish breakdown: 

- Pineapple fried rice: 4.5/5. Contains chicken, shrimp, and cashews. Very unique flavor, with earthy undertones from the cashew that really livens up the citrusy bursts of pineapple. Only 2 shrimps in the whole dish, but plenty of chicken. 

- House pad thai: 4/5. A little sweeter than I prefer, but still well executed overall. Heavier on the sauce but not too greasy. Also comes with mostly chicken and 2 shrimps. Looks a lot redder than in photos. 

- Fish cakes appetizer: 3.5/5. Comes with 5 deep fried pieces and a dipping sauce. Quite flavorful but couldn't taste any fish. 

Prices are reasonable.  2 entrees, 1 app, and 1 drink came out to about $40 with tax. 

Service was decent and prompt; food came out within 15 min. 

Ambience is casual with a more traditional looking interior - red and gold colored decor, paper parasols decorating one wall. There are two widescreen TVs tuned into ESPN which was nice. It's not a large space but not too small either - can accommodate parties of any size. 

Private parking lot out front with a sign for more spaces in the back.

Long story short, this definitely satisfied my Thai food craving and I'd recommend trying it out at least once!"}
{"text":"My favorite dish here is the Spicy Basil Noodles! They are always perfectly seasoned and cooked. I'm normally a pad Thai girl but here the basil noodles are so tasty that I have no choice but to order this amazing and tantalizing dish! Their soup and curries are also delicious, especially my favorite Yellow Curry. The service is also very good and the staff are a pleasure to talk with. I love my food very, very spicy and this restaurant delivers on spice! Be careful when choosing your number and maybe start out with one number lower than you usually order elsewhere. Overall, this place has become my favorite Thai place in AZ, and I'm not easy to please when it comes to my favorite cuisine!"}
{"text":"The yelp review score made me want to come here. I wish it was in a better location but either way was good. The staff are friendly and seat you quickly. The food was delicious and authentic Thai. The Thai tea was excellent. I must say I asked for mild they said scale 1-5 spice I picked2 bit it was way spicy my advice is say no spice. Other than that great food."}
{"text":"This is a very good little Thai place! Pretty average priced, $13 or so for pad thai! Very friendly staff and fast service. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My fav thai food restaurant! Fresh food and good service. 
The bathroom needs some TLC though."}
{"text":"Thai E-San serves the best Thai food I've eaten anywhere. I've never been to Thailand, but it's clear that the owners care very much about bringing the authentic flavor of Thailand to its guests. The food is always fresh and consistent. I became addicted to many things on the menu and went twice per week for quite some time. I've since moved away and miss Thai e-San every day. The owners and the servers are such wonderful people, and they take the time to get to know you and remember all of the details. I never had to ask for special things I like, they just always knew. The ingredients are perfect and they handle each superbly. The spices they use to heat the dish are unlike any other place and they know the perfect balance of chili oil, paste, and powder/seeds and how to match it to the dish. The meats always taste fresh and take on the flavor of the dish whereas many other places cook the meat separately or overcook it. If you're looking for authentic, fresh, and friendly then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Love love love the food here! I've been coming here for about 3 years now and it never disappoints. The owners are very sweet, it's nice to have such sweet and humble owners. The this yea is amazing! My favorite dish would be the massaman curry."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant having picked up food here before as a Postmates driver (they offer free bottled water to drivers while they wait - very generous). Today I had an odd craving for peanut sauce, and I found out that Yelp lists them as the number one place for this in the valley. This is for a reason - the peanut sauce is unique and delicious; it is the best I have ever had. It is very thick and spiced nicely.  Coupled with the broccoli chicken I was in heaven for lunch! The price point is amazing for such gourmet Thai. My lunch was punctuated with a slice of watermelon too - nice touch for the summer. I also love that soft drinks are served in a can so you can keep track of how much you are drinking a little easier."}
{"text":"If you are near the Woodlea / Melrose area in Phoenix and are hungry...go here!  Great friendly service, great food, reasonable prices!  The coconut soup is fabulous, all of the curry dishes are fantastic, and the Thai E San sausage (listed with the salads) is really, really good!"}
{"text":"I like their pad Thai, and our favorite soup is the coconut shrimp! Always a pleasant experience here. Just be sure to not order too spicy or you may ruin your meal. They also have Thai tea and boba! Their coconut ice cream is my usual dessert of choice."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, the service is always very quick and the servers are very nice. The inside is dark but inviting and comfortable. 

There lemongrass soup is perfect when you're sick and the rest of their menu isn't quite as spicy as most other Thai restaurants. For me this isn't a problem since I'm usually really on the fence about Thai food anyways, but as my boyfriend grew up eating authentic Thai food everyday, its definitely a let down for him. 

Give it a try if you love Thai food and don't mind not burning your taste buds (or further south of the border)"}
{"text":"Food can definitely stand on it's own, but simply doesn't stand out.  Good food and good service.  You won't really crave Thai food specifically from here though."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMY! Yesterday I went to lunch with a friend at Thai E-San. I got the Pad Thai noodle lunch special. All the lunch specials come with a soup of the day and egg roll for a great price. The soup had tofu and cabbage. I'm not a big fan of tofu, but the flavor was really good! It was sweet, sour and spicey and I didn't mind the tofu at all! I got the pad thai noodles \"medium\" spicey.... wooohooo, the medium spicey cleared my sinuses! It was on the little spicey side for me, but flavorful enough for me to keep taking another bite! The meal ended with a few slices of watermelon, which was perfect to cool my lips and mouth with. I can't wait to go try another dish. The food, service and value will make me come back!"}
{"text":"This is THEE best Thai place in Phoenix.... or maybe in my life! And no, I haven't been to Thailand so that means the best I have in the United States! 

NO JOKE! I go here so often, I know the staff. I got so often, I have brought at least 12-15 new people with me and recommended it to at least 6 clients who have gone by themselves. I go so often that I sometimes run into other people I have gotten hooked on the place! I have gone on my birthday! I have brought out of town visitors there! I being clients, friends, family and co-workers!!!

I honestly shouldn't have to tell you how good to food is after the above. But here goes: IT'S FABULOUS! Fresh, made to order, even their rice! So good, delicious, and SUPER VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY! 

Honestly, worth trying- you won't be sorry. Poi and her wonderful staff will do a great job taking care of you!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in the minority obviously with this restaurant, but the food was not that good--too greasy. And their Pad Thai was not good...the flavor was \"off\" and it was greasy too. Disappointed. Two stars because it was edible."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant after my usual Thai food go to on N 36th St & E Indian School messed up my order and blamed me for it. I'm kinda glad they messed up because I probably wouldn't have found Thai E-San. The food here is delish and the people who work there are very friendly. I truly appreciate their great good, professionalism, and customer service."}
{"text":"Best curry in Phoenix! And it's a huge plus that their tofu is cooked to perfection. The Yellow and Red Pineapple are my favorites, and the staff is always nice! Definitely my go-to for Thai."}
{"text":"Food and service were awesome. I had the lunch special which it's a great deal for the price, great portion and includes egg roll, wonton chips, soup and tiny dessert. 
I will def recommend this, also my food was out very fast even tho I went at lunch hour (12:00pm)"}
{"text":"Great service, very quick and friendly staff! Ordered the pad Thai and their yellow curry. Pad Thai was ordered to be not spicy at all, but looking back I would have turned up the heat. Yellow curry was ordered mild and had a great kick! Would recommend."}
{"text":"We just found this wonderful neighborhood place. Great food and warm, friendly service. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Thai E-San has been an incredibly good experience every time that I've been there (20-30x).  The wait people and managers are efficient and helpful, you can get the food as mild of hot as you'd like.  My favorite is #51, Eggplant with garlic and vegetables.  I like it over the brown rice, it makes for a nice, chewy texture.
They have good beer choices, as well as sake.  There are big tables for groups, so bring your friends!"}
{"text":"I liked it! The service was good, very polite. The food was good, I've only been the one time, I got the Pa Naeng Curry and it was good. I could have gotten a spicier version, but luckily the chilly sauce on the table hooked me up. The atmosphere is pleasant, and welcoming. I liked it."}
{"text":"Great food amazing service wonderful ambience good music recommend this place a million times"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the service I received when I ordered carry out. I ordered pineapple fried rice, which was $16 . I was alarmed at the price and expressed this, the lady at the counter  me that it would be a large portion.  A friend and I decided to split the meal and let her know that we were intending to do so, I asked if we could have an extra container and she said that wouldn't be possible because they pay 50 cents per container. I suggested that she give me a cheaper styrofoam container  and she considered this, 15 mins later she came up with a paper plate. We waited about 45 mins total for our food and headed back to our meeting. When I opened the bag I saw a tiny container and almost flipped out. Then I began to eat my food and noticed that there were no pineapples. I called them later and told them about what had happened, I argued with the woman who had taken my order for a few minutes on the phone about whether there were pineapples in my order. This was frustrating because I had paid $16 and should have been valued as a customer, not questioned and accused as of lying. Ultimately she let me know that they'd check the cameras and that I could come back in and receive a partial order. I don't think I'll be going back in because I'm not even sure she'll take my word about our conversation, although she has my name and number."}
{"text":"This small restaurant hidden away in Phoenix was recommended to me by a friend a few days ago. Low lighting and traditional decor made the place feel welcoming and family run. I came here with a few friends after visiting a museum and boy the food was pretty good. The menu selections are for the most part traditional Thai choices ranging from curries to steamed fish. For the appetizer, I decided to get the Fresh Spring Rolls and those were great, I wish that there was a bit more shrimp in it however. After that, I ordered the Royal Curry at a 3 out of 5 spiciness and that was really good. They nailed the balance of heat with the coconut milk based curry and while it was hot, it tasted great as well! The staff is friendly and I would recommend this place to people who want to taste a more traditional style of Thai curry."}
{"text":"Made it over to try this place, a few of my Sunday bowling peeps come here and said it was good.  I started off with Angel Wings (stuffed with pork, chicken & shrimp); then for dinner, I ordered Vegetable Pad See Eww (rice noodles) and Gulf of Siam (fish, scallops & shrimp w/lots of veggies and jalepenos).  All level 3 spicy...need to go 4 or 5 next time.  The place is small-medium size seating.  My server/waitress, CeCe was very nice and offered great customer service.  There was another lady there, not sure if she is just manager or owner, but she is equally friendly too!  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A great place for Thai Food. See ice could be a tint bit better, nothing bad just a bit slow. That all as far as my negatives. 

The positives were everything else. Food was great, servers were friendly, we were greeted and seated right away. For appetizers we ordered the fried squid and it was amazing, my sister ordered the yellow curry, I ordered pineapple curry with chicken and my brother in law ordered Pad-see-ew and each dish was great. 

I definitely recommend this place and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Last minute decision to stop in. Lunch rush, greeted warmly by the owner I believe, seated immediately. Drink and meal order quickly. Perfect so far. 

Cup of included soup was very good. Not just weak broth like most. Pad Thai good. Little wedge of watermelon to cut burn was a perfect touch."}
{"text":"Service is EXCELLENT. Food is great!  You can chose a protein and the best part is you can select your \"heat\" level 1-5.  WARNING: 5 made my spicy food loving friend visibly ill.  He comes back all the time but orders a level 3 every time.  My husband's favorite is #11 with beef level 3.  Love the fresh flowers and upscale feel with reasonable prices.  $7.99-$14.99 depending on protein choice."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  My hubby & I found this restaurant about 4 yrs ago when we moved to midtown.  Very relaxing & casual atmosphere...TV's on the walls usually have sports or news going, but at a nice low volume as not to disturb your conversation.  Food is the best Thai food I've found in Phoenix & the staff are very friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"My review is solely based on the customer service I received on 3/4/17. When entering the building there was a woman in her fifties that seemed very...determined. In the parking lot she zoomed in to get a spot which we weren't after because there was plenty of spots and that one seemed to small for our Pilot. Funny enough we end up holding the door open for her as she pushes through. My MIL actually needed to use the restroom when we first arrived and so my FIL let her out before we parked. In turn she put our names in. As we enter our name is called, but the lady says, \"I'm first.\" The hostess is confused and frankly the lady seemed crazy. The place is empty and my FIL said, \"just seat her. It's fine.\" Everyone could tell this lady was crazy. She even complained she wasn't getting her \"normal\" booth. Yet nobody seemed to know her. 
Our waiter was funny about the situation, but never disrespectful. Even when my son spilled water he made a joke about it and took care of the situation. 
Yes the food was good. However, it was the customer service that I enjoyed. The \"lady\" could have put most people off, but our waiter really made us feel comfortable and they were attentive."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. We came for dinner around 7 and the place was busy but not overly so. I liked the atmosphere; it was decorated nicely and had a good amount of seating. Our server was friendly and welcoming. I ordered the pad thai with vegetables and tofu and added eggs. I got a 4/5 spice level and it was hott (extra t for emphasis.) I ended up taking most of it home because I got caught up in storytelling and good conversation. As leftovers, the main differences was the texture of the noodles got softer/mushier and it wasn't as spicy, but the flavor remained tasty. The Thai iced tea was on the sweeter side, maybe too much condensed milk. Could always be improved with some boba. I'd like to come back and try other dishes as they have many to choose from!"}
{"text":"This restaurant makes my top 5 list! The food is delicious! So fresh! The variety of tastes are amazing. My server provided exceptional customer service! He listens quite well. He provided wonderful recommendations. The Thai Tea drink is quite good too. The restaurant atmosphere is warm and welcoming. Very clean restaurant. Thank you for an outstanding dining experience."}
{"text":"Good lawd the food is really good, service was fine, but please move away from the can sodas. In this day & age they should invest a fountain drinks. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were glad we made a reservation since there was a wait, but with the reservation we were seated immediately!  Our waiter Bobby, from Thailand, (the land of smiles) was very friendly & attentive.  The place was a happening with lots of busyness which was an indicator that the food must be good.  IT WAS DELISH!

We ordered the Nam Sod pork salad with lime, which was a bit chewy but with the extra peanut sauce made it was just right, & we also needed more lettuce cups since it only came with 2 small pieces. 

The stir fry eggplant w/ tofu was tasty  The wedges of eggplant were the perfect texture & sautéed perfectly.  My boo gave it a 10!

The Green curry Salmon w/ green bell pepper was one of the best curries we've tasted but the Salmon was a bit overcooked.

The coconut ice cream freshly made from coconut cream served w/ ground peanuts is divine! Same room for that for sure!!"}
{"text":"I'm back again
Addicted

The food is great can't believe you have been open for five years and I didn't know..... lots more on the menu to try

Love the yellow royal curry and thai toast

Soup is best in country tom yum phenomenal"}
{"text":"First time here.  Googled best Thai restaurants in Phx, and this came up.  I agree.  My spouse had pad Thai and I had massamon curry.  Both yummy as were our spring rolls appetizer.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! Quality food and friendly staff!!! Love this place. Shrimp pad Thai!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite restaurant of ours. We like authentic Asian food and after going here for a while we took a trip to Thailand, which we shared with the people at the restaurant, who are from Thailand. The food is quite good and plentiful, along with Thai beer (Chang beer, which means \"elephant\"). We enjoy talking to the owner while there as well. We have taken friends and family to this restaurant over the years."}
{"text":"Amazing. Such nice people and they have the best curry and egg rolls and chili paste and crispy fish with green beans and....everything!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Definitely will be back. We had the Pad Thai Noodles, Pineapple Red Curry, And Thai Tea."}
{"text":"Went with a friend here tonight. He remembers them from Pink Pepper so wanted to go. I can always eat Thai so that was an easy yep. 

I (of course ) had checked the yelp reviews and my mouth was watering before we even made it to the car. I couldn't decide between the sweet basil, the pad Thai, the spicy green beans or the green curry. Green curry won. 

I can't say how phenomenal it was. I got four out of five stars and the heat was great. The dish didn't sacrifice flavor for heat either. Possibly the best green curry I've ever had. 

My friend got the crispy chicken in cream sauce which he said he dreams about. I'd never had anything like it. It was very good. 

The staff was great and service fantastic. I'm so glad I live right by here. I need to try those other dishes."}
{"text":"I typically judge the quality of Thai food by how well they make the beef salad, as was in this case. I ordered the beef salad to go, spicy level 5, which is hottest (I love spicy). The spiciness level is good, they didn't tone down. Overall, though, the balance between sour, sweet, and salty was off - I felt it was more on the sour side, and had to add extra fish sauce from home. The beef was supposed to be grilled where you can taste the charbroiled flavor, but I did not appreciate this at all; it had a more sautéed flavor. The portion was on the small side for the price. To be fair, the owner was very nice. I asked for the kaffir lime leaves (gives it a homely Thai flavor) and she gave me a handful on the side! Arguably the best Thai beef salad I had was Les Ros in San Francisco."}
{"text":"A friend and I were meeting up for lunch and the original plan was to go to a different Thai place we'd been to before.  Unfortunately that place didn't open until 5:00 and we met up at 3:00...fail.  Luckily I used my handy-dandy Yelp app to find other Thai places within a nearby radius and Thai E-San was the closest one and had a decent rating.

It's definitely a pretty nondescript building but I figured that a lot of the time those are the hidden gems that most people don't give a chance to.  We walked in and someone was already waiting with menus (I'm assuming he saw us pull up through the windows) and took us to a table right away.  There was only one other group in the restaurant but it was a little late for normal lunch and early for dinner so I wasn't surprised.  It worked out nicely for us though as our waitress was able to check on us frequently and made sure our drinks were always full and we had everything we needed.

The menu is HUUUUGE!!  There are at least 70+ items to choose from so it's a little overwhelming at first and if you're indecisive like me it's quite the task picking just one thing!  I ended up going with the Spicy Fried Rice with Basil with Beef as the meat.  I also ordered the Thai Egg Rolls.  My friend got something with Silver Noodles, I can't remember what it was listed as on the menu.  The egg rolls came out nice and hot and crispy, flavor was good and I love that they have the sweet and sour sauce in bottles on the table so you can apply it as you like.  The main dishes came out not to long after and portions were very generous.  I ate more than I probably should have because it was so good and it looked like I'd barely touched my plate.  Even my friend who is 6'8\" couldn't finish his plate.  We both concluded that we were happy the other Thai place was closed as this one had a bigger selection and bigger portions so it seems like it was meant to be!"}
{"text":"This is a lil bias because I liv3 down the street and have going to this place for like a year . I've taken , friends,  family , coworkers and clients . So if that's not enough  love this place.  Pad ew See is my jam, thick noodles , chicken egg rolls so dope. Price especially for lunch is unbearable you'll spend 8 bucks for like food for two , soup egg rolls includes . If you are looking for thai  go here . Plus they have huge tv , NBA season ."}
{"text":"Great food, nice location. I wanted to try a new Thai place and the boyfriends coworkers recommended this place. I was definitely impressed and would return. I ordered the drunken noodles with shrimp (spice level 3). He ordered pad Thai with beef (spice level 4). We both enjoyed our meals and prices were great. Lunch special total $23. Complimentary sugar donuts for dessert. Will definitely return!"}

By far my favorite thai place."}
{"text":"the bad part on travelling is: have to keep on looking for a great food.
this place isn't authentic enough to be called thai food."}

The wait staff is always really friendly and the prices are great.... definitely recommend this cute little authentic place. FYI: I really like spicy so I choose #4 out of five and it's perfect"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food had that freshly prepared quality.  We loved our dinner. The meat was lean and tender and all the sauces were superb."}
{"text":"I was desperate, Line Thai... I'll never cheat on you again. Thai E-San was just not the same as you.

The atmosphere was a-ok. I actually like the traditional formal-style Thai dining tables, although a lot of people complain about the awkwardness of it. Distrurbing kelly green wall with faux-finish really ruined the ambience.

Service was reasonable. Quick, not overbearing. I had multiple questions about things that were not on their menu (roti, other desserts) and the owner came over to the table to chat. 

Food was... alright. But not good enough. They market themself as Isaan-style food, which I personally know quite a bit about. They were heavy-handed on the fish sauce and light on spice. Anyone who knows Isaan will tell you that if you ask for it hot, expect to be nauseated by the spicyness. I asked for Thai-hot on my curry and tom yum goong; the curry was not even remotely spicy and the soup was slightly spicy. I am disappointed! 

Drinks were alright. PRICY beers... my god. I paid $4.50 for a Singha bottle :( Thai iced tea was great. 

Not worthy of the Isaan designation. Maybe if you're desperate like I was, you'll have a one-night-stand but eventually go back to a place that is more delicious, less expensive and generally more worthwhile."}
{"text":"Close to my house and had good pad thai. :)"}
{"text":"Food was very good and staff was really nice .... (However, comma)... we came in a large group of about 25 and came in slowly over about an hours time for a party.. yet there were people who came in and were seated in our party first that didn't get food until well after 2 hours of being seated ... the staff had no coordination what so ever when seating and taking orders ... some of the party were asking for their food and even condiments to come out after long periods of times ... food got cold ... orders messed up... and the waitress looked to be scratching her head in confusion the whole time ... and finally had to leave and get food to go ... then got the bill and was surprised to see was charged $8.00 for gratuity ... and then later found out they didn't charge me for all my dishes so they put it on a separate bill and was charged again for the large party gratuity charge on the new ticket because the waitress didn't put all the food on the right receipt ...totally not right !... well no longer will visit there ... and I had such high hopes for this review ... I rated them two stars because the food was good"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pad Thai and egg rolls. Both were served quickly and with friendly service. I look forward to eating in or ordering out from here again soon!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place was great. They do warn you that they are hotter than most places and I didn't believe them and ordered 3 out of 5 for spicy, next time will be a 2 as they were not lying. Food was great, super service and fast."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch!  Gracious owners.  Will definitely be back.  Great chicken basil and the soup and egg rolls are excellent"}
{"text":"I'm no Thai connoisseur but this place was fantastic! Great flavors and great staff"}
{"text":"I went to dinner with a friend here last night and it was my first time at this restaurant. The food was awesome. We had the fried egg rolls, pad thai, and yum neua. All were very good.

The service was wonderful - the server did a great job and was very prompt. The manager even came over to say hello to us and ask how we liked our food.

I will definitely be back. It's not easy to find good Thai in this city and this place is definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"This place is tasty! Had the chicken panang curry which was delicious.  Great lunch special, very attentive and super friendly staff.  You even get slices of watermelon at the end of your meal. The soup is delicious!"}
{"text":"Food: pad see ew delicious. Not greasy. Got spice level 2.. About a Hot level in salsa. Leaves tingle on lips. Green curry love the veggies in it. Level 2 as well. Delicious. 
Parking: private; spacious. On main road. Easy to find. 
Service: professional and fast. 
Environment: clean. 2 TVs. Awesome. Steadily busy on Thursday night. 

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Fine food but I've had way better thai around here. Not sure they hype but the staff has so
Much energy . Great location"}
{"text":"the food here was very good! very fresh veggies and the fish and scallops were cooked wonderfully. light sauces and lots of flavor in all the dishes we tried. i'll definitely be going back to try more things!"}
{"text":"Red curry and Tom yum rock. Level five heat will make you sweat. The owners are always extremely friendly. What more can you ask for? 
Our favorite Thai in town by a good margin. 
15% off at happy hour for the holidays too!"}
{"text":"Love the menu layout- grouped by sauce, seasoning rather than protein. Spice was perfect. Comfy booths- super friendly staff. Definitely a favorite!"}
{"text":"Not to knock the lunch special (cheap, tasty, generous portion size), but the dinner menu is even better!

We had the Thai coconut soup with shrimp. The broth was spicy and rich and flavorful with lots of mushrooms. The six shrimp were large, plump and juicy. Too many restaurants overcook these little guys, but not Thai E-San. Word to the wise:  order a couple of sides of rice to add to the soup. That's the way the natives do it. And the rice soaks up all the goodness of the broth. 

We also had the chicken larb. It was quite tasty, the chicken just cooked so it was juicy and flavorful. The dressing was minty and spicy. Wow, just, wow.

Between the soup and larb (I think it's on the salad listing), we had a full meal and left quite happy."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I eat here quite often.   The service is quick and the staff are attentive .The food is amazing, I have never had a bad dish here. I usually get the Royal Curry (3 or 4), but the Pad Thai is wonderful as is a dish I have only had at Thai Rama called Pad Se-Ew (so good). I always enjoy the soup and after your meal they bring you either a refreshing slice of watermelon, or a small cinnamon sugar doughnut to cleanse your palate. The prices are quite reasonable.  I highly recommend trying Thai E-San."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch, the waiter was hilarious. We had a group of 9. We all ordered a variety of foods. I ordered a dish that was similar to Drunken Noodles. it was good, but I feel the food could have been warmer. The chicken satay was very flavorful. We ordered a hot pot that was really spicy. Overall the restaurant was clean and had good lighting."}
{"text":"My family is from Northern part of Thailand, therefore I was happy just by that AND they have STICKY RICE!  And I've been to many Thai restaurants around town, and I judge them by how the prepare Thai Steak Salad..THE BEST IN TOWN!!!  Of course with Sticky rice!  

Yes, the service can be slow at times, but it's authentic people, and home made! Its not supposed to be a buffet or quick service, enjoy the food....enjoy the friends and family you're dining with....huge tables-it's awesome....enjoy the experience, enjoy the fact it's not a chain restaurant, or made by American standards, it's Thai..spicy and uber tasty hotness..... enjoy the fact it's in central Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"I love Thai. It is usually gluten-free, and can easily be made vegetarian. They finally got smaller tables and are more comfortable!

The owners are always incredibly nice and love to make sure we enjoy our meals! Thai E-San has superseded ThaiRama as our favorite thai restaurant. Everything is delicious, and they are very accommodating to your needs!"}
{"text":"Oh Thai goodness!!  Was in the area and had a strong craving for some good Thai. Yelp to the rescue and Thai-E San did not disappoint.   

Ordered a few dishes around medium spice level. All were excellent.  Maybe even a bit spicer than medium, but that was a yum surprise as I love spice.   

Ordered the Chicken Larb ( it comes with lettuce, but life hack here if you can get your hands on cabbage wraps=mind blown ). Also ordered the Pad See Ew with tofu. Crazy goodness here folks.  Finally ordered the Royal Curry (yellow curry) with chicken.  

This is easily going to be a repeat location when I want Thai, which is very often. Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in the valley! Definitely get the drunken noodles. So awesome! I always get them extra spicy. They don't do \"American\" spicy, they do \"Thai\" spicy. It's really intense. My fiancé really likes the Thai toast. The curries are also really great, can't go wrong with any of them. Their dishes range from 1-5 scale of spiciness. 1 is low, and 5 is max hot.  They ask you how spicy you want it and customize the dishes to your liking. The lunch prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. We don't live in the neighborhood anymore but when we did, we used to go all the time."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! I had the Phad Thai and coworker had the Thai Fried Rice, lunch portions were very generous and as I had already said it tasted very very good. Restaurant was very clean and owner and staff was very friendly. If you like Thai food it's a must to go..."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend and we ordered the coconut soup with chicken and the red curry with beef. Both were delicious and came in generous portions!  The presentation of the soup was also cool with flames shooting up the middle.

They had a great homemade sweet-and-sour sauce on every table. Upon request, they bring a caddy with 4 different condiments (smoky ground chili peppers, jalapeños in vinegar, Thai chilis in fish sauce, and sambal).  The sambal especially was very good!

The staff was very friendly and took time to explain menu items to us even though they were very busy. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Every time my boyfriend and I come here we are more satisfied than the last time. And that is saying something because it was awesome the very first time we came! The service is fast and friendly; the food is fresh and super delicious. The lunch special is quick and tasty, and it's a perfect option for date night dinner too! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So yummy! They even made stuff Vegan for me. I have loved everything I have tried. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome and very authentic taste, every single dish was delicious and the coconut ice cream tasted real. Definitely among the very top Thai food I have eaten, service was on point, I recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! We are so hooked, we've become regulars. The chicken coconut soup is awesome, the chicken teriyaki is great, the masuman curry is fabulous, spicy fried rice is great, but my favorite is the spicy green beans with pork or chicken. Honestly the list goes on and on....

So much flavor in each dish, and always consistently great. Even the Thai tea is the best we've had. We tried a ridiculous amount of Thai restaurants here in AZ this beats them ALL hands down, on food, service, presentation, everything!!! 

The service is always great and attentive. The owner is so sweet and takes time to ask everyone there how their food was and generally cares. 

This place is one of my favorite restaurants here in AZ!!"}
{"text":"My friends go there all the time , so we decided to it a try as well , didn't get disappointed , great food and awesome service , we ll be back! I had stir fry with mussels, they let to pick how spicy you like on scale 1-5, I love spicy food and picked 3, it was little too much for me , so be careful with selection :) next time will go with 2"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. Their lunch specials are an insane value, and includes soup and a fruit plate for dessert. Their panang curry is some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I can admit when I'm wrong. Someone from Thai E-San responded to my previous yelp review informing me that MSG is not used in their food and to give them another try. Well, a couple of weeks ago I placed an order for pick up and did NOT have a headache the next morning. 

The reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because my order was wrong. I will continue to dine here, but when picking up an order I will open the bag and look inside."}
{"text":"Hard in da Paint by Waka Flocka Flame probably encapsulates the Thai E-San experience most accurately. 

\"Hard in da Paint\" describes the effort exerted by the staff. Whenever I arrive for pick-up, there's always a line, the phone is always ringing off the hook, but I never have to wait more than 5 minutes for my food. That line moves quick, orders get taken, and my food comes out hot and fresh. Not only that but everyone is so friendly too. Food is never served with a grunt.

\"Waka Flocka Flame\" provides two meanings. First, that food fire. Heavy hand with the heavy heat. For curry, I can do that Thai-spicy bc the coconut milk in the curry acts as a blessed life raft amid the sea of flocka flames. But when I go pad thai, there's no raft. You gotta be the Michael Phelps of Spice in order to swim out that tsunami or itll fold you like origami. As such, I can only go 4 (on their 1-5 spice scale) in that dish. But you know what, guys? I've never had a new years resolution before. So why not now? I'm doing this. I am going to work my way up to Thai-spicy by the end of this year. THIS. YEAR.

FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS 

(I know I said \"Waka Flocka Flame\" had two meanings and only really explained the first. I got too carried away with my spontaneous? news years resolution?, but the second meaning is basically that repetitive? FIVE STARS line, except it would have been more eloquently articulated and there probably would have been another Phelps-reference)"}
{"text":"Thai* E-San is a very sensational place! I learned of E-San from friend that loved their curry and of Thai food. And if you know me I love to try new Thai places, love the culture and spice. Right when you walk in you get greeted and seated. It's a cute small place the interior is dim well light well decorative small lights and very Asian influenced. Menu has a wide selection of eats from appetizers to main dishes noodles, rices and salads of sorts. They also have a lot of authentic Thai dishes, that a person of Thai or Laos person like me would know of. Our service was delightful and on point, food came out wonderful and Thai Hot is very hot, I wanted to finish cause it was so good, but it was too hot. Definitely recommend coming here and bring friends of course. So if you aren't a fan of hot, the taste is defiantly here as well, I would say get at least a 3 or 2 hot! Remember stay hungry Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Our Thai food craze continues...We were searching for a place close to Lux and saw this place. It's in this shady little strip mall thing, if it even can be classified as a strip mall. I'll just call it that for now. Anyway, we walked in here and the place was cute. It had an old feel to it. It was pretty empty. There was one other Person in there besides us. 

I got something with beef. As I usually do. I love me some cow. And my friend got the sweet and sour chicken, of course. Everything was super tasty and delicious. Service was good. And prices were good. We left satisfied."}
{"text":"It's good, not 4.5 stars good. The tea was awesome but the service was slow and the food I had was just okay. I wouldn't recommend driving out of your way for this one. 
I feel like I ran into one of those situations where you are expecting something to be awesome because everyone is raving about it so I came in with to high of expectations."}
{"text":"The area is a little rough, but the food at this restaurant is DELICIOUS and the service was great.

Once inside, the decor is ethnic inspired and bright.  The establishment is very clean.

The menu has plenty of vegetarian options packed with thai flavors.

I ordered the veggie pad thai with steamed tofu and lemongrass soup with shrimp.

The soup - Served in a huge pot with a traditional flame in the middle, the shrimp were huge and cooked to perfection.  The broth is robust with a kick to it. 

The veggie pad thai -  Very good and authentic flavor with a great mix of noodles and tofu.  There could have been more veggies in the dish, but overall, I loved it.

The only bummer of this place is being from out of town, I had no way of taking the left overs home which there were plenty of."}
{"text":"Seriously, I've been here like every other week for 2 years and still love it.  This deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Phoenix, period. 

I would recommend not playing it safe with the Pad Thai; the curry is really where it's at. They don't mess around with spice, go a little light if you want to enjoy your food. The coconut ice cream is also totally to die for.  

The service is going to be just okay, always. But who cares when the food is incredible!!?? 

This place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Ok yelpers...let's get one thing straight here. As far as FOOD is concerned, Thai E-San definitely has some of the best out there. My roommate is Thai and this is one of the only places she hits up on a regular basis. 

Food: AMAZEBALLS! All of their servings and portions are SUPER HUGE. The Spring Rolls are the size of cucumbers and only $3 for two of them. The Chicken Satay was also tasty with 6 skewers for about $8. Between the two of us, I think we've ordered about 1/2 of the menu, but I really enjoy their fried rice, pad thai, the stir-frys and the chicken curry. As a BIG fan of spicy food, I love how I can control the level of hotness for EACH plate. You can rank them from a 1-5, and the 5 is quite spicy and YUMMERS!

Service: YES....YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT!! The food is prepared TO ORDER and unfortunately, the owners don't trust anyone else to make the food, so there's only ONE COOK!! I've never gone on a super busy night (because I KNOW better) so the longest I've ever waited was about 30 minutes, but since the food is SOOOO good I don't mind. 

The waitresses are really nice, but if you want assistance, don't be afraid to flag them down. They're happy to help."}
{"text":"Ordered take out twice from this place. Only tried two dishes so far but I thought they were pretty good:

Chu Chee Roasted duck - duck pieces are variable. The first time I ordered there wasn't a lof of meat but it was much better the second time around. The curry sauce is delicious with the right amount of cream and spices.

Chicken Tom Kha (coconut soup) - ordered it medium spicy and while the broth was really tasty, it was too spicy for me. Next time I will go milder for sure. Definitely a treat for the tastebuds!

Staff is nice and friendly, I appreciate that they give me an accurate waiting time for take out orders depending on how busy they get (and they are often busy which means lots of people like this place as well!)
And yes they do take credit cards."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai in this area. I have not had anything bad here, the service is friendly, and the seafood entry we had was amazing. I can't remember the name but it was delicious: another favorite is the cashew tofu (not fried). My other go tos are the coconut soul with tofu and shrimp and the chicken skewer appetizer. So good, I may stop in for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"We arrived from the phx airport and we were hungry. This place wasn't our first choice because a different restaurant was closer in proximity. When we visited that restaurant, it was a dump so we left. Yelp brought us to the Chanpen. As we entered, we could tell that this place was going to be good. The decor was a red wood and Asian art with plants. The smells were fantastic. The restaurant was clean and organized. We were seated and ordered off of a vast lunch menu. I ordered the Masaman curry with 3 of 4 spiciness. The waitress warned that it would be fairly spicy, I told her it was ok. She said, that if I needed more; there was spicy chili's at the center of the table. Everyone of us had a different order, different spiciness and a separate bill. I could not have asked for a better restaurant. The food was served hot and was very flavorful. The portions are not as big as my favorite Thai restaurant, but when away from home; this is a great alternative."}
{"text":"On a Monday, I decided to catch up with an old friend from my law enforcement career at San E-Thai (616 West Indian School Road, Phoenix, AZ 85013), one of my favorite inner-city hangouts. We met for lunch and shared the lemongrass soup with shrimp, papaya salad with shrimp, shrimp salad and a side of white rice. This healthy meal featured large, juicy prawns and fresh vegetables. The flavors illuminated my palate and worked quite well together. We ended the delicious meal with an order of the establishment's signature, coconut ice cream. The service was excellent and included a visit to our table by the owner. The facilities were exceptionally clean, and parking was readily available."}
{"text":"Always good food and great service and just a really nice place to be with family and friends"}
{"text":"This Thai place is bomb had the pineapple red curry and it was amazing. Coconut ice cream was outta this world. Very friendly staff! They also have Chong beer which made my boyfriend feel like he was back in Thailand! Very happy!"}
{"text":"Heat seekers, Thai E-San and Thai food in general knows how to serve up the heat!

For Thai food, I always order a soup, some kind of noodle, Thai tea and dessert. So to start, I did share with my room mate for dinner so let that be known before I am deemed a glutton. We did the Seafood Tom Yum, Pad See Ew and Mango Sticky Rice.

The Thai tea was good, sweet and strong (I didn't sleep till 3AM).
Seafood Tom Yum had good flavor, not MSG laden, filled with seafood (mussels, scallops, shrimp, squid) 
Pad See Ew with beef, yummy flat rice noodles with strips of beef, savory and spicy!
Mango Sticky Rice was good, though the rice was a bit too wet for my liking and the portion I felt was a bit small for the price point.

For all the food, we asked for Medium heatwise and I thought it was perfect! I do like spicy food though, but there is a burn!

All in all, Thai E-San puts out solid Thai food. The owner came by to talk to us and also made sure everything was alright with the food. The food tastes pretty authentic to me!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I would totally recommend this, I love theirPad Thai! This review is from my 9 year old daughter"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have Thai food!  Every dish is great! My favorite is the silver noodle Pad Thai. But we enjoy all of the different dishes.  Prices are reasonable, and service is very good.  We visit often."}
{"text":"Been living in the area for almost five years now and there a several great Thai restaurants in the area... and Thai E-San continues to be my favorite!  The Massaman Curry Chicken is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and it was awesome. Chicken Pad Thai is my go-to at Thai restaurants and this was my favorite. On a scale of 1-5 of spiciness, I did 3 (medium) and it was hotter then most places - but I really liked it. Like loved it. There was so much flavor and the lunch special was a great deal, $8.99 for the entree, spring roll, fried won ton chips, and free soup of the day as an appetizer. They also give you a free dessert which was 3 mini donuts? I don't know for sure what they were but they were similar to sugared donuts. They were good. 
This place was really busy, we went at peak time around 12:30 but the service was very fast and the employees very friendly. They found us a table quickly and the food and drink came out fast. It's a comfortable atmosphere. 
Definitely would recommend, but if you're afraid of spice go lower on the scale!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I have ever had! The Thai toast is a bit odd, but everything else was Awesome! Great service too!"}
{"text":"You know the food is going to be good and authentic when Engrish is involved, the online menu lists \"Stirs Fries\" and \"Fried Rices\". My hope is that ethnic food is as authentic as possible since it's an opportunity to experience the food and culture of somewhere I might not ever get to go. And Thai E-San does not disappoint.

The menu is expansive, with something for everyone, tofu, fish, chicken, squid, duck, beef, pork, vegetables, rice, noodles, you get the idea. The ingredients are fresh and high quality.

The prices are reasonable (especially considering the portions are enough for two meals) and they have great lunch specials.

The staff is courteous and friendly.

I just can't get enough of Thai E-San. It's some of the best Thai food I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"The curries I enjoyed, but the thom yum soup lacked depth and authentic fish/shrimp stock. Portions are a good size. Thumbs up on that! Overall really good, I was just disappointed with the thom yum. It tasted really just like a very plain hot and sour soup. Thai Basil is still my favorite!"}
{"text":"Always quality food and very filling, staff is friendly and always willing to help out. Yellow curry and red curry are the best here!"}
{"text":"it was okay...I got tofu Pad Thai with the spice level of 3 and all I could taste was spice it didn't taste like any other flavors but maybe next time if I get it all add extra bean sprouts and onion and veggies... I just assumed those things came with it but it was basically just noodles, tofu and hotness. We also got crab puffs that were almost burnt! I am going to go back because they have curry which looked good based on other reviews...so I'm gonna give em' another try hopefully it'll be curry for the WIN!"}
{"text":"Amazing coconut soup!  Love their curry and they have real fresh flowers at each table!  Super great food."}
{"text":"We started out with an order of Chicken Satay and the chicken was tender, juicy, and perfectly spiced, and we received 7 sticks, which was a great value for the price. I had the ping gai for my entree, and again, he chicken was perfectly prepared, and the peanut sauce was delicious and NOT overwhelming, which happens sometimes with this dish.  All around, A++++ would dine again!"}
{"text":"the best thai food with the best service..... 
check it out. can't say enough about this place. 
amazing."}
{"text":"We were in the area and weren't familiar with the thai restaurants. Yelp directed us to this lovely place. We had just finished up the Pompeii exhibit and we're ready for some food. This was about 10 minutes from the science center, so not a bad drive from where we were at. It's off a pretty busy road, but we entered from the alleyway. There was plenty of parking in their lot - always a plus. Upon entrance, the restaurant itself gave me Midwestern basementy feels if you know what I mean...kinda dark, kinda dingy. But has its own charm for sure!

We ordered our thai staples...Massamun and pad see ew. It was very delicious, definitely on par with the best thai places we have been to in Phoenix. The prices were right and the portions were ample. We had enough to take some home too! We will definitely be back when we are in the area! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The curry and the pad Thai were so good! Defiantly added to our list of favorites! Thanks:)"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. Absolutely amazing food each and every time I go there. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is a must to satisfy all your Thai needs. The food is fresh, the service is more than friendly almost like family. The owner makes sure every guests 100%satisfied."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in the valley! The customer service is the best I've had by far! And the food is really good. I love Thai food, and being from Portland, Oregon where there are a few great places that measure up to the food I had while visiting Thailand, I feel I can give an accurate opinion on this cuisine. The E-San's cashier has even wooed by fiance into loving this place, which is nearly impossible. I usually get the red curry with tofu, my fiance has tried multiple noodle dishes, pad thai, and tom kha soup, and he has been pleased with every dish he's had. We have tried multiple Thai restaurants in the valley and have mostly been disappointed, so now we just stick to ordering here."}
{"text":"Simple, delicious and just awesome. If you like heat, tell them to make it as hot as possible and you're in for an amazing fiery treat! Definitely recommend this."}
{"text":"Had the curry which had a good flavor. Also had the steamed vegetables with chicken which was a welcomed taste. The white rice was a great add on and they gave you a good amount to combine with meal. Did Thai level 4 and was mild to some others I have had but the taste was good."}
{"text":"Have gone here a couple of times for lunch and the food was great. Service was a little unfriendly from one of the servers, who looked like she really didn't want to be there, but that was for one of the visits, so maybe it was an off day. I usually order the pad thai with chicken lunch special when I am here. It's one of the best pad thai dishes I've tried in the area and comes out with a fried wonton, spring roll, soup of the day, and at the end, a slice of watermelon. The interior has a low, dark ceiling, which makes the place seem somewhat small, and every time I've walked in here it smelled like cleaning supplies; but maybe that means they clean the place well at least? Either way, you can't go wrong with the food/price at this place, especially for lunch. I would recommend it for anyone looking to have Thai food."}
{"text":"In the area for a football game and stumbled on Thai E-San. Holy crap this place is good! I travel all over the country, and have had a lot of Thai food both good and bad. This place is up there with the best of them. I wish they had a location in Chandler because we would be regulars. Don't hesitate if you like Thai food, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love Thai E-San! Fantastic food in generous portions and the staff is always super friendly. Quick pick-up for to-go orders."}
{"text":"Thai E-San is a gem. My husband and I have been to over a dozen Thai restaurants in AZ and this one is definitely our favorite. It has Thia-tea, incredible Pad Thai, and very warm service. It is worth a 30-minute drive. The cuisine is unique among other Thai restaurants in rich flavor. We recommend not missing the Pineapple fried rice, or the massuman curry... also their coconut ice cream is ridiculous. Like it is insanely good. All in all, you will not regret coming to this awe worthy restaurant. Lucky to have found this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Phoenix and very friendly staff. Environment is calm and relaxing  -  though I have only done take out"}
{"text":"Ordered the mixed veggies with chicken. It came with an egg roll and fried wantons. Very delicious. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. 3 is legit spicy. Pad Thai is very saucy which is unique, but not my preference. Staff is friendly. Thai toast and the dressing they give you is my favorite."}
{"text":"My brother took me here for dinner.  Our meal was excellent.  Some of the best Thai I have ever had.  I had a coconut curry chicken dish that was very flavorful, the chicken was good quality and not overcooked, the sauce was spicy and creamy - very very good.  I live in Tucson, but will visit here again next time I am in Phoenix.  Give this place a try, you will like!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the greatest meal I've ever been served in my most entire life. The waiter had the most exquisite poise I've ever witnessed in my entire reality. As if he had been crafted solely for the purpose of making me the most satisfied human being that has ever stimulated his palate with finely cooked Asian cuisine. Thai E San had an atmosphere so satisfying, one could have married his long love, and have their partner feel as if the moment experienced was so good that he almost shouldn't have picked Thai E San because, it's practically obvious how amazing it would be for said event."}
{"text":"After a recent \"ugh\" experience at wild thaiger, I thought I'd try something different today while in the area.

Man, this place is just not good.  2-stars only because I unfortunately have had worse thai in this town.

For what it's worth I had pad thai, and it was horrible.  Soup was ok, and staff was adequate.   Other than that, my search for a good, or at least passable thai restaurant will have to continue......"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant with a friend who highly recommended it and I was not disappointed!!!  My meal was a thai tea, red curry with beef, and mango sticky rice as the dessert.  Service and attention to customers by the manager and other servers was impeccable and made me feel welcome and appreciated.  The food was absolutely out of this world!  Do try this gem of a restaurant if you want a great intimate dinner."}
{"text":"Always good service, and good food.  I am a curry fan and they do it right.  Tons of flavor and just enough spice to add that dynamic, but not to overpower the dish.
YUM!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Flew in, looked up best Thai and boom, they were very close to my hotel. Staff were very friendly. Had the veggie spring rolls and pad si ew with tofu. Excellent, quick and put everything in a box for easy carry out. Thai iced tea was good too."}
{"text":"Loved it so much we went back two days later! The red curry is some of the most flavorful I've had. And I'm particular about my thai food."}
{"text":"I love that food and decided to give this place a try. Very clean and the food is amazing. W ordered the sweet and sour chicken for our daughter and she enjoyed it  we ordered the royal curry with chicken at a level 5 (it was very spicy).My husband had never tried that food now he is a fan. The prices are reasonable as well. We will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in the area hands down. Super friendly and attentive staff and is super cute inside."}
{"text":"I have attended a B-day dinner with J on a Friday night.  This time around was better.  At least, we got our foods a lot quicker.  The appetizers were good combo.  The fish patties were the best.  I had ordered the BBQ chicken since last time they were out.  The chicken was too dried and salty for me.  I have better BBQ chickens at other Thai places.  As for the service, they still need work on it.  At first the waitress attended to our large group, but when it was time to pay, somehow she seems not to like us.  Maybe, it was the coupon I gave her for the wine after the bill came.  I showed her the coupon before ordering so she knows to discount the bill.  Of course, she forgets to discount it.  It took at least 15 to 20 minutes for them to recalculate the bill for us.  The kiddies were getting a little loud.  I had the feeling that they wanted to kick us out.  When we walked out, there was no Thank you or Goodbye.  I'm still a fan of food not the service. I am dropping a star for their service."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Phoenix so far. Pad Thai is always amazing. Although, 2 times out of however many times I've gone I've gotten sick, not sure if it's from the soup or if it's just something not agreeing with me but I'm almost instantly having the runs . Doesn't stop me from going back tho."}
{"text":"Out of school and starving boyfriend and I headed to thai esan with high hopes and empty bellies. We eat thai basically daily and we happen to work at a really delicious one. 

When I saw the outside, I wasn't expecting much. The place looks pretty divey and you would easily miss it. Inside is way different!!! So much decoration! Really interesting to look at everything! 

The service was helpful although when my boyfriend ordered thai hot, she assumed he couldn't handle it and said she would give him a level lower hahaha. The food definitely wasn't spicy enough!! But everything was reaaaaallly great. Prices seemed to match the quality and portion we received. 

It's on the way home, we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great! The curry and PadThai were delicious.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly.  The owner/staff was so kind and respectful to us and made time to connect and chat with us.  It definitely had a family feel."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and they never disappoint! Such amazing food and service. The staff is very friendly, family owned. The place is immaculate and very clean. The decor is wonderful. It's hard to find a good Thai place as clean as this. The food is wonderful too. Lunch specials is a great price ranging from $8-$12. They have a soup of the day that's always amazing. I love their coconut ice cream also. I always want to go to this place when in the area and hungry for Thai food! It's always busy when I come in. Don't be angry if the staff isn't that attentive they are just busy but very nice people! Love this place and love Thai food."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Great welcoming service by Gigi and phenomenal green and red curries with a spiciness that left me goofy with delight!. Prices are very reasonable and the service is super fast. Will be back!"}
{"text":"When driving by, i am usually nervous of places like this. However, after checking reviews on Yelp, my family and i decided to stop in. After amazing service, amazing food, and fair costs, I would highly recommend this place to anyway who loves Thai or wants to try it for the first time! Thanks!"}
{"text":"So San-E-Tize (as I like to call it) has been staring at me every time I go to F&E and I finally convinced my wife to try Thai food.  We went over here on a Saturday night and I was totally excited for a new place.  But then the bad service started.  We were seated, then ignored, then we got drinks, and were ignored again.  Then we were asked if we were ready to order (which we were) and then ignored again.  This was getting a little old.
I finally ordered a Sweet Basil something with chicken.  It was a runny mess that was lacking in meat.  It needed noodles or rice or something to thicken the dish up.  It really just wasn't very good.
I ordered it with a #4 spicy level and it was about there (maybe a 2 or 3 in my book).  I don't know if the 6 is insane or not but I don't know who would be willing to ruin their meal just to try and find out.
In the end, I wasn't really impressed.  The large tables are just comical, the service is sub-par, and the food was just blah.  I posted a picture of my meal just for reference.  I might go back and try something with rice next time but this was just not what I wanted."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Thai food. Their Royal Curry is incredible. The Thai Iced Tea is perfect. The rice is exactly how you want it. The Pad Thai is perfect. Everything i try i like. The people are really sweet that work there and I have always had great service. I've taken a lot of my friends to this place and they ALWAYS like it and want to go back. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I felt a little like Honey I Shrunk The Customer sitting in those large chairs at these massive granite and wood tables. Community tables are so risky as most people do not like them. I, on the other hand, enjoy them. We were seated at one end and then joined soon after by a very nice couple. We bantered back and forth a bit and he realized he knew me from my restaurant. Love that!

So, as I said above we were seated. And then waited. And waited. And. Waited. Some. More. Eventually waters were dropped but no beverage order was taken. Again, waiting. Cue the Jeopardy theme music. Finally one of the two servers came by (and in all honesty, they were pretty busy) and dropped off soups, which come with the $6.49 lunch special. Yummy! I ordered tofu fried rice and Rickie had sweet and sour pork. Mine was fantastic, though sadly they neglected to include my spring roll. I would have flagged someone down but I was consumed with worry over my table mate's missing food. They served her friend's food yet hers took at least 10 minutes. Strange. Rickie wasn't pleased with his dish as it was pretty teeny tiny!

Two lunch specials. Two beverages for $18. Not bad. Oh. The decor is so Thai...bright green and gold speckled walls with beautiful Thai rugs. And. Then. For some odd Asian reason...like at China Chili random pieces of scrap paper taped to the walls saying \"Dessert. Mango Sticky Rice\".

With a little gay spray I could bump this baby up a star!"}
{"text":"Quite good! We read the reviews and decided to stop in while in Phoenix. We did a green and red curry. Not the best I've ever had but still tasty. Would come back and recommend. Decent food and service."}
{"text":"The reviews do not do this place justice. The food is super bomb . Get the soup ... any soup its all great. Really cant recommend this place enough"}
{"text":"Always amazingly delicious food and beyond superb service. Best Thai food hands down, my family and I only go here."}
{"text":"Service is wonderful and the food is authentic. The server even gave suggestions for next time. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I rarely give reviews but this place deserves a good word. Great service, genuine and friendly servers, great food, and clean! 

And a bonus, their water tastes amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Having just returned from traveling through Bangkok I'd been craving the local flavors. They nailed it. So happy I found my new Thai spot."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family. Staff is very friendly and even let us in 10 minutes early. Food is excellent, I had the spicy noodle with shrimp and it was delicious! Will definitely come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The coconut soup is a little over powering with their robust hit of lime. The Pad Thai is so very yummy (i prefer the tofu, which is flavorful and crisp) and it is a healthy size portion. My favorite thing on the menu is the royal curry #3spice. So very delicious and even better when it's cold the next day."}
{"text":"I've gone to this restaurant at least a dozen times for lunch the quality has always been outstanding. We are coming for dinner one night and I think I'll find the same quality as I've had for lunch."}
{"text":"We've wanted to try Thai E-San since they opened, and we finally made it down.  The ambiance is very nice.  The music was soothing and appropriate, but the food left something to be desired.  We started with the pork satay.  The pork was very good and perfectly cooked.  But the peanut sauce was bland and chalky.  I couldn't taste the peanut.  For our entrée we ordered the Panang; Chicken with carrots in coconut milk and peanut sauce.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't like the spice that makes your food taste like lemon cleaning fluid.  Is it ginger? I don't know really.  But the Panang had a lot of it and that was all I could taste.  The service was good and the other patrons seemed to enjoy their meals, so to be fair, I would have to reserve judgment on Thai E-San until I've tried a few other things on their menu.  The problem is, we really like Thai Lahna and they aren't much further away."}
{"text":"Good sized portions. Decent prices. All the Thai flavors we love and expect right here in midtown. We had fried wontons, which did not live up to my standards, but they redeemed themselves on the main courses. Pad thai and pad see ework. Delicious and spicy! Yum"}
{"text":"Even though I arrived 10 minutes before they opened, I was happily seated and promptly served. My red curry was the perfect amount of spicy (medium) with all the complex flavors as expected in Thai food. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was friendly and speedy."}
{"text":"First time and will return. I ordered a lunch special for carry out. Great deal and fast service! I got the spicy noodles and basil with shrimp. It came with lemongrass soup, wonton chips, and an egg roll. I liked that you get a little bit of everything. Also ordered their Thai tea. Everything was delicious and I will be back for dinner. Their seafood hot pot sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food. We love their drunken noodles, bbq spare ribs are awesome, and their sticky mango dessert is great. :)"}
{"text":"The husband and I got take out from Thai E San on Saturday looking for some delicious Thai food. The food was alright, but nothing to write home about. We each got a different curry, I had the green curry (4 star spiciness) and the husband got the red curry with pineapple (5 star spiciness). The flavors on both were good but neither were spicy.... like at all. That was a huge disappointment. I will say that the portion was large and the price was reasonable. I don't think I'd be back as there are other Thai restaurants in the area that I like better."}
{"text":"Since I been passing this place n I always see so many cars I had to try it out. Came here tonight for the very first time w my husband for a quick bite. Very cute n clean interior. All the napkins were perfectly folded n propped up on all the tables n they had TVs going so in case you wanted to watch a game etc. 

We started off w some hot tea. My husband got the garlic stir fry w beef spicy level 3 (spicy levels 1-5 like usual Thai places) and I got the house pad Thai which comes w shrimp n chicken spicy level 4. 

Both dishes were very flavorful. The service was impeccable n very attentive. 

N we finished off w mango sticky rice which i wasn't a fan of. I just don't like sticky rice n it was covered in some sauce which I didn't care for. But since my husband ordered it I had a bite.

Overall, will definitely b coming back. Excellent Thai food!!!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have had in Phoenix. We read all the bad reviews on here before I went- but was desperate for Thai food later in the evening so we still decided to go. 

We were pleasantly surprised! It is better than Thai Elephant and Thai Basil. Definitely more authentic and more flavorful. We are picky and eat out frequently- so it's saying a lot that we loved this place.

We tried the hot and sour soup with beef, the silver noodle soup, and the drunken noodles. The drunken noodles were literally the best either of us had ever had. My soup was probably one of the best I've had (hot and sour) with WAY more flavor than most places. My boyfriend said his silver noodle soup reminded him of an authentic dish his filipino mother used to make. 

Also, the staff was super friendly in that we-are-all-family-and-we-welcome-you-with-open-arms kind of way. The lady at the front was also hilarious. She and our waiter checked on us several times and were very good about explaining the dishes. 

Last- the Thai iced was great and the place was beautiful.

Yes- the tables are rather large and a bit awkward, but it was no big deal. 

Also, the food did take awhile but this is a small shop with authentic recipes that were well worth the wait. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is crying. 

Seriously. Not hyperbole.

Okay, he's had a long day, but the awful pad thai and sweet-and-sour seafood curry just pushed him over the edge. I don't forgive places that hurt him. If I say I want this place to have an accident in a back alley, can that be used against me in court? 

There are half a dozen decent thai places in the area. There's no excuse to go to Thai E-San."}
{"text":"Craving authentic Thai food? This is the place! The price for food is fair and the food is extremely delicious! The employees here are very friendly and try their best to remember repeat customers. Service is wonderful and is a reason why I will continue to return here (also because of the food, of course!) I was skeptical to dine here my first time around but let me tell you, after my first time dining here, I was hooked! Returned here anytime I was craving Thai food, and will continue to come here! 

From their appetizers to their main course/entrees everything is great!"}
{"text":"I'm afraid we have given this place more chances than they deserve. Although the service is friendly the food is bland, portions are skimpy and not impressive. They put a minimal amount of seafood and chicken in their dishes and throw in a bunch of inexpensive onion and green peppers. No beautiful, colorful, quality veggies at all. My last and final order was Thai basil with squid. Squid is not expensive but they charged me $16 for about 10 bites worth smothered in white onion and they threw in two token mushroom pieces. They looked like scraps.  To top it off The rice tasted like it had been scraped from the bottom of the cooker it was mushy with crunchy dry pieces in it. I had to toss it. I called the restaurant back.....the man that answered the phone was nice and apologetic, but said there was nothing he could do for me because he's not the manager and there wasn't going to be a manager there until Wednesday. I'm done.....never going back!"}
{"text":"They just revamped the interior and it appears they can now fit more people in.  We always go in or lunch and getting a 4 spice is just fine for my above average gringo tongue.  Food is continually good... Service is always around... Owners always make you feel like family.  I can't just suggest one meal for all have been stellar."}
{"text":"Worse service I had.  Waited two hours and never was served food.  People that came one hour after me got their food before me.  I will never come to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We are a big fan of this place. We love the egg rolls, the jalapeño pepper chicken, cashew chicken, garlic chicken. The staff are always helpful and super for customer service. The owner is a nice lady when she recognizes you as a regular she always says hello to you. Food is reasonably priced and most everything I have had here is very yummy! The restrooms are a bit scetch but it could be the age of the building. I hate the parking that would be one change I would make it sucks. However good food trumps parking every time so there ya go."}
{"text":"Best thai lunch we have found in this part of the valley.  SUPER delightful staff.   Had the panang curry lunch special. Friend had the Pad Thai and said it was awesome.  Really good.  We will definitely go back.  GO LOCAL!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai restaurant that I've found in Phoenix.  The food is excellent for a reasonable price.  I have brought a few friends here that like Thai food, and everyone else seems to enjoy it, also.

At the restaurant, you can pick your dish, and add your choice of meat/fish/etc.  My favorite dish is the spicy sweet basil with scallops.  Also, I highly recommend their soups.  I have never tried something here that wasn't delicious.  One word of warning, the food can be extremely spicy so if you are sensitive to spicy food, make sure you order accordingly.  This restaurant is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Definitely the prettiest Thai restaurant!  I walked in to meet with one of my favorite girls, Ayesha S., and saw her sitting at a HUGE table.  Huge.  For two of us.  It was a big, round, marble monstrosity but very stylish.  
We started out with the spring rolls with shrimp.  They came out and they were gigantic!  That must be the theme here.  Definitely fresh ingredients and nothing in it was overdone.  
Service was a little spotty at the beginning, but improved during our meal.  They refilled out drinks a few times without having to be asked.
I got the spicy mussels.  They came on a big (HUGE) platter with a few sauteed veggies and a spicy sauce.  I know mussels aren't very good as a leftover, so I ate them all.   I didn't feel stuffed like Thanksgiving at the end of the meal, but properly sated.
I will definitely be back again.  I'd like to try a few more items on the menu.  Like Ayesha, I'd like to see more heat.  \"If it don't make ya cry, why would ya eat it??\"
I'd also like to meet the owner.  I mean, since everything is so huge...maybe it's a reflection? ;}"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite Thai restaurant in town. I have become rather picky about my Thai food and this place takes the cake. I highly recommend the basil catfish, the eggplant tofu curry, pad ce ew, and the mussamun curry. As an added bonus, when you ask for your food hot or Thai hot, you don't see lashings of ground chili strewn across the top of your meal, but, rather, the extra chili is cooked with the food, giving a much more satisfying experience.

In sum, go to Thai Esan, order a Singha (or three), a pad ce ew Thai hot, and enjoy your evening."}
{"text":"After hiking at Squaw peak, my friend and I were famished and really felt like having Thai food. The place didn't look very promising from the outside but the interior's good. The owner is friendly. Egg rolls were fresh and crispy. The red curry with pinapple was delicious!! Masaman curry tasted great too. Food was finger-licking good. Definitely want to go here again!"}
{"text":"We got take-out and they were very short-handed. It was very busy on  a Sat night and they only had two servers that also doubled as a hostess. What was supposed to take 20 minutes to get our food took 35 minutes. We also had to return the food because what was supposed to be a #1 spicy was actually more like a #3. My husband, who loves spicy, couldn't even eat what was supposed to be the most mild. When I went back (after first calling them 15 minutes before to notify them I was coming in), I waited in the lobby for 10 minutes before being acknowledged. The lady responded that they were busy and seemed inconvenienced by me. I was the one who had to drive back and get my meal remade! I was very disappointed at the response and reluctance to fix the issue. The remake of the Beef Salad was slightly less spicy but at least we could eat it. I really enjoyed the entree but having my food wrong the first time and the bad customer service ruined the experience. We also had the fried appetizer sampler that was just okay. My husband goes there very frequently and loves this place. The portions are very large and prices very reasonable. I will go back and hopefully, this one experience was an isolated one."}
{"text":"Best thai food in phoenix - and they know it. The pad thai is delicious and the sticky rice with mango is mouth-watering. That said, this place gets more expensive every time I go. Last time I went some pad thai was $14. Seriously? It's almost worth it, but they're pushing it."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is perfectly located for my needs, the staff is always friendly and the food is fantastic. It is super easy to order anything vegan or gluten-free and where I have had trouble communicating the level of spice I want at other Thai places, that is never an issue for me here. Their Coconut Soup with Tofu and the Mas-Sa-Mun Curry with Tofu are my favorite."}
{"text":"Went back after two years since I live all the way out in Gilbert.  Found out they got buffet on both sat/sun and it is absolutely delicious.   Phat Thai, various Thai curries, basil chicken, beef stir fry, cocanut chicken soup, Tum yum, and salad.  Order Thai coffee which perfectly complimented the brunch well.  Nice to be treated like a king once more by wonderful staffs who remembered me."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant , it's a little hidden but it is worth a visit. I got the Pad Thai with level 3 spice and I was salivating the whole time. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"So far, I've had the Pad Thai and the basil noodle dish and have enjoyed the taste both time.  The people are friendly and want to make sure you come back.  The coconut soup looked amazing as I caught a passing whiff of it as I was waiting for my next Thai takeout fix.  Thank goodness this awesome restaurant is nearby!!!"}
{"text":"I like the comfortable atmosphere here. Prices are reasonable and food is good! The lunch specials are great deals!"}
{"text":"Would give a  6 star if there  was one. I wasn't big on Thai until we  tried  this place.. Now are a there two times a  week..Prices are very  reasonable, , best  service in town..   We have  eaten many of the items on the menu and  have  never been  disappointed,(fish dishes are awesome, they cook it perfectly.)  Save room for  the coconut  Ice Cream,, the sticky Rice w/  Mango  is awesome  also.. Very impressed , believe me , this will be your go to place,,  I must say,  I am addicted to Thai-E-San!"}
{"text":"Our office is down the road and we have been wanting to try Thai-E San forever! Well, we finally did today. We were seated immediately and the service was fast and friendly. The food was delicious and a great price. Then came a piece of watermelon for dessert. Well, my co-worker does not like watermelon and it was not ripe enough for me so we pushed it to the side of the table. The plates probably sat at our table for about 5 minutes when one of the waiters came by and asked if we were going to eat the watermelon. We said no so he picked the plates up and walked away. The problem with this is he walked right up to the cooler that is visible from the seating and stuck both those plates of watermelon right back into it! Then, while we are still sitting there in disbelief, he takes the same two pieces of watermelon that sat on our table back out of the cooler and served it to a table that was one down from us...DISGUSTING!!! If they do that with the watermelon then what are they doing with everything else that is not eaten or finished? Think about it?! It took all my restraint not to blow up that situation right in the middle of the restaurant and, actually, I really regret not blowing it up knowing that a lady was eating my piece of watermelon as I left. I am sure she would not have been happy. WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Had the chicken pad thai, sticky rice, and Thai iced coffee today. Everything was delicious. I really appreciated the cup of soup and spring roll that came with the pad thai, it really made it into a feast. Also appreciate how big the portions were. I split the noodles and sticky rice and ate it in two sittings. Looking forward to trying more of their menu!"}
{"text":"The food was allright but tasted a bit plain. Pot stickers need a bit more flavoring but the sauce makes up for it. It's sweet with a spicy kick in it.The curry needed more seasoning salt and pepper for one. But once you add those it's good. 

Even with the shortcomings food wise the staff is very friendly and the decor is nice."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Phoenix. I've tried them all and this is the only place that satisfies a craving for Thai. Green curry and cashew stir fry are my favorites."}
{"text":"My sister has been here before and she said the food was great and the fact that my parents are very picky eaters, Thai E San serves soups to noodles to rice and entrees!

Me and my friend shared the combination seafood rad nah and the papaya salad with crab E San(if I can recall) in medium as well as tom Kha with chicken that can be shared with up to 4 people since its served in a hot fire-y pot. We got the tom Kha non spicy since my mom cannot eat spicy but was perfect since they have chili sauce that can be added on the side for those who love some kick! The rad nah tasted perfect as well! As for their papaya salad it was tooooooo salty for me, and my friend agreed as well. I tried a little of my sisters red curry and it was seasoned well! Had a nice sweetness to it, as well as a nice kick! 

And of course to end the meal with some mango sticky rice! Small portion for one person, but if you have a doggy bag then it can be shared with 2 people. I made sure to ask the waitress in the beginning if they had it available since usually most restaurants don't have it since it's not in season so I made sure I saved room for that yummy goodness! =)"}
{"text":"Real Thai Food. Great  drunken noodle. Prices are very reasonable. It's not a \"fancy\" or trendy looking place, but if you're looking for very good food at an affordable price, look no further."}
{"text":"Thai E-San is a hidden treasure. Conveniently located close to downtown and across from Natural Grocer. The spring rolls are the best I've had, no exaggeration. I will be coming here again and again. If you love Thai then this is a must try."}
{"text":"My first experience with Thai food was eating in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant back in my hometown run by a Thai woman who would never let anyone come through her kitchen doors and who was famous for her tantrums which would close down the shop unexpectedly.  The sole waiter was the Thai woman's husband who met her when he was abroad in the military back in the day, a grizzly old white guy who told horrible jokes.  The restaurant did very well despite the sometimes spotty closing hours.  Needless to say, my expectations for Thai food are very high.

I've been searching around different cities trying to find Thai food as good as the food from my first experience and have been disappointed until I tried Thai E-San.  I don't know what it is, but there's something special about the aftertaste at Thai E-San that sticks with you.  This is excellent Thai food.

We had the 3-star spicy Pa-Naeng Curry with Duck and the Red Curry with Shrimp.  Both were spectacular and had the perfect combination of spice and flavor.  Portions were big enough for at least two meals or for two people to share, which is how Thai food should be - it often taste even better the second day.  Although we did take-out, the service was very friendly, and the smell... the smell inside this restaurant made me want to sit down and just sniff.

I've definitely found my new Thai place."}
{"text":"WOW... what a disappointment !!   I ordered for pick up.... Prawn Salad, Chicken Salad, Squid salad..... Pad Thai, and Tom Yum soup.    The salads were a wedge of iceberg lettuce with cold, boiled shrimp and squid.... just tasteless and boring.   The pad thai was bland.... no flavor.... and the Tom Yum soup?   OMG... one bite and I had to spit it out!!   It was SO un-believelably salty I thought I was being punk'd !!   Went right down the drain!!      I am in a desperate search to find great Thai food in Phoenix.... I keep going back to Thai Basil.... but there must be a stand out.   Any advice?    Thai E-San was the worst I've had yet.... and EXPENSIVE !!    Stay Away!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Cute decor, friendly staff. I thought the pad thai with tofu was a bit sweet - I like pad thai a little spicier, and it was greasy. Portion size was fair. Red curry with tofu was also too sweet. Perhaps that's the personal taste/preference of the owners.

I think my other staple Thai restaurants in Central Phoenix were closed for a holiday and Thai E-San was open, I wouldn't mind stopping in, but I don't think I'd make a special trip of it. However, if you like sweeter Thai dishes, Thai E-San might be a good way to go."}
{"text":"Small little snook but very clean, food is delicous with great service, think I just became a regular !"}
{"text":"The food here is ridiculously good. I ordered the lunch special, which was 8.99 for a basic meat combination meal. Great bang for your buck, had lots of leftovers for later. The service is great, and the staff is friendly and ready to help you decide on a meal. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"As most reviews seem to say, the atmosphere is the highlight.

 Had chicken pho. It was a couple of dollars more than the average place, had less broth, broth was so so, not salty like most places. Noodles were ok. The veggies they bring on the side plate were of minimal variety and was a lot of bean sprouts, and some basil leaves. Onions were already in the bowl with some more sprouts.

 Staff was friendly, prompt, checked in a few times. They have A ratings posted from the county. Of the 5+ pho places I've been, the food is 4th, the service is 2nd, atmosphere 1st/2nd."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley! A must try! And I have tried many other Thai food places. This is my fav."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, thanks everyone for the recos. The restaurant looks nice and clean, everyone engaged. 

We had the egg rolls to start, light and crispy, really good. No Coke zero, so we had diet. For  the main dish, the red curry with beef, spicy 4 on a 5 scale. So creamy, simply  delicious! We also had the eggplant tofu dish and wow, so flavorful.

This all explains why people kept showing up to pickup to-go orders.

We will be back for more..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. I've eaten here several times both for take out and dine in. I've never been disappointed. I've had the Pad Thai, Green Curry, and the Short Ribs Special. It's all been great. Watch out for their Thai Hot, they don't mess around! It will burn you. The owner is a very nice lady and will be sure to make sure you are taken care of."}
{"text":"I've never had coconut soup before and it was amazing. The fried rice was just as good as this place in paso Robles. The staff was amazing and so friendly. I will return."}
{"text":"While there seems to be a saturation of Thai restaurants in the Central Corridor, I'm not one to complain when something new comes along the pike. And Thai E-San is a welcome addition to the eateries in our area. And being opened less than a week didn't stop us from trying this place out. 

For starters, Thai E-San took over the former Big Wong space. Since I'd not been in there in ages, I'm not sure if the new tenets did a massive overhaul or if they moved into this clean space. It feels more like you're visiting your Asian aunt than walking into a restaurant. The tables and chairs are so huge, I felt dwarfed by them. The multicolored lights cast interesting hues in the room. But it is a little too cold, temperature-wise for me. 

Okay, on to the food. Robert M ordered the crispy pork with Chinese broccoli; I ordered the beef Mas-Sa-Mun curry. Robert's meal wasn't exactly what he expected, which would have been cubed pork chops battered and deep fried. Rather, it was pork with the skin still on and crispy. I liked it. The Mas-Sa-Mun was beef stewed in a coconut milk sauce with potatoes, green onions and peanuts. I'll get it again, but hotter than mild as it lacked the kick. But, I ordered weak so that's what I received. 

There were a few hiccups: service wasn't very attentive, the dishes came out at different times, another table received soup instead of fried rice (but the guy was a nimrod who insisted on eating with chopsticks and proceeded to holler at the staff from across the room), and the bill was delayed in its arrival. All things that should iron themselves out as the staff--which appeared relatively new to waiting tables--grow more accustomed to their craft and the kitchen becomes better choreographed. The prices seems a little high, but in these times I feel like any amount could be construed as \"too high.\" 

I'll definitely be back, but to order different items and find their signature dishes. I'm thinking their \"Special noodles, Soup\" items are looking mighty fine and the lunch specials sound like a great bargain, starting at $7.95 for a lunch dish, fried wonton, egg roll and cup of soup."}

{"text":"I love this place! The food is really good and the ambiance is amazing. 
The outside is very plain looking nothing nice, but the inside is wow. They have a lot of booths and each table have a real rose on it. It's dim in here and they have a lot of red decorations so it gives the intimate feeling. 

 I ordered the spicy basil noodle but I got it without noodle and add in tofu. It was delicious! The Thai tea is really good as well. 

This place has really good customer service as well. People here are nice and friendly. They are doing a promo where if you write a review on yelp, you get free coconut ice cream. 

This place deserves 5 stars. I would definitely recommend who hasn't been here to try it!"}
{"text":"I'm going to let you in on a little secret: I am an absolute weenie when it comes to trying new places with foods I've never heard of before!  It's true.  Yes I have managed to review over 400 places before ever trying Thai food.  Weird, right?  Anyway, my New Year's Resolution this year was to be more adventurous when it came to dining, and I am determined to embrace that resolution.  I'm doing really well so far, I mean, I ate Thai food!

As we were walking in, I started freaking out a little bit, because when I get scared of food, I order something really lame, and then I get really grumpy.  I kept telling myself that this was just a different version of Chinese food, which I love.  Once we got inside, I had to stifle the laughter upon seeing the epic tables.  Each one could literally seat 10 people.  They don't have anything smaller.  Seriously.  Anyway, we sat down and were kind of ignored for a while, got menus, got ignored, got drinks, ordered, got ignored, got food, ignored again, paid, then left.  You get the idea here?  The service is pretty horrendous.  

I didn't know what to order, and I found myself gravitating towards familiar things.  I told myself that ordering familiar would be pointless, so I went with Beef Pad See Yew.  I was definitely avoiding the spicy after seeing the table next to us sweating and crying after eating some soup that was a level 3.  Sheesh!  Once my dish (beef, broccoli, fat rice noodles, and bean sprouts) came out, I pretty much devoured what I could.  the portions were huge, and I ate about half.  It was really good!  I still don't know what I think of Thai food, but I did eat the leftovers the next day and still enjoyed them.

I probably won't come back here to dine in just because the service is a little much to handle, but it could be really fun with a big group.  I think take out would be the way to go."}
{"text":"Best Thai place I've gone to in Phoenix since I moved here. Lunch specials are so perfect and nicely sized and each time I've gone they've come with a little treat after. Would 100% recommend. Everything I've tried is spot on"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in town. The chicken larb and beef salad are amazing. I'm a regular for thier takeout. Overall the food is great and the staff is friendly would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely has a lot of character. There are strings of Christmas lights and plenty of flashy decor on the walls, but the best part about this place is the food! We started with the tofu appetizer and it was served lightly fried and extremely hot. We ordered a side of peanut sauce, but as it turned out the chili sauce that accompanied the tofu was actually better. I ordered the green curry with beef and was very satisfied with it. I like a medium amount of spice, but I asked for mild because Thai food tends to be 10x spicier than any other type of food. I'm glad I did because the mild was plenty spicy enough. I wasn't fond of the beef in the curry dish, next time I'll opt for vegetarian or tofu instead. My guest is a picky eater and she ordered the pineapple friend rice with cashews and seemed to like it as well. I'm pretty sure it was mixed with a yellow curry powder, so beware picky eaters! All in all very good Thai food and I'd definitely return and recommend this place. The food was piping hot and served fresh from the kitchen!"}
