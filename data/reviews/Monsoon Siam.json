{"text":"Great service, great food, and incredible fried ice-cream!  I like the sun dried beef a lot.  Happy to have this place in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I was so happy with my entree,  I wanted to go back the next day and have it again.  Two of my other dinner companions were just as happy with their entrees. I had The roasted tofu curry, and got it with less heat then was listed. Our waitress informed us that they could change the heat on any dish, which was great to know.  I widpsh we had known that when we received our menus, I would have looked closer at the spicier dishes.  The spring rolls were so-so, but the fresh roll was very good.  One person was very unhappy with her dinner, she had the Chef's special-Tofu Angel.  There was nothing angelic about it.  The chef's special sauce appeared to be a pool of extra salty soy sauce.  It was almost inedible.  My friend is not a complainer, so she ate what she could and shared some of mine.  Other positives: The waitress was very friendly, and it was kind of fun to watch the goings-on in the kitchen.  Negatives-their mixed drinks aren't on the menu and a request for a drink list was never fulfilled,  it was quite noisy, and it is very small.  Luckily we made a reservation.  Personally, I can't wait to eat their food again, but will probably get carry-out or delivery."}
{"text":"This place is amazing -- and I want to shout it from the rooftops so that their business is successful and they stick around (though not so successful that there's a 3-hour wait on Friday nights...).    As far as I'm concerned, ALL of the other Thai restaurants in Madison serve a terrible approximation of Thai food, but this one is the real deal.  We ordered the Papaya Salad, Ka Pow Crispy Squid, and a chef's special called Southern Heat.  It was a lot of food for two people (and less than $30) but it was so good, we ate every single bite. (Except for the steamed vegetables on the side, which I think the kitchen might want to reconsider, as they don't add much to the meal.)   The restaurant itself is fine (nothing special, but comfortable and clean), and the staff were super-friendly, but the real reason to go is the fresh, flavorful, authentic food.  You know when you can hear someone hammering away on a mortar and pestle in the kitchen that it's going to be good!   I agree with the reviewer who said they would give it six stars if they could, mostly because great Thai food has been so sorely lacking in Madison, and I'm so happy that Monsoon Siam fills that gap."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Thai place amongst many good choices. Nicely executed dishes ranging from the expected to the unexpected. That crazy-spicy fried tilapia thing is great--wow. Drunken Noodles are excellent too. Tiny little space, but service is good. Even take-out Pad Thai is really good. Been here four times and it's 4-for-4."}
{"text":"This has become a standard answer to the question, \"Where do you wanna order takeout?\"(We've also never had trouble getting a table for two or four people.) This is a very safe place to try something new because they do the flavors so well. Here's what we love: * Curry squash * Papaya salad * Tom Kap soup (so much cleaner tasting than at Madison's other Thai restaurants) * River Monster (so good, this is the dish that made me fall in love with Monsoon Siam) * Kapow Jae * Sticky rice with mango for dessert (if you have room!)"}
{"text":"Really sad to say but a horrible experience. I ordered through the yelp Eat24 service (that part gets 5 stars) for pick-up and got my pad thai lunch special home to the other side of town and found 2 hairs in the food. Super bummed cause now this place, despite it's great reviews, is ruined for me :-("}
{"text":"I expected a lot after reading the reviews and hearing raving recommendations from close friends who share the same likings for food. And it was with great anticipation that I came here with a bunch of friends on my birthday for lunch.   The experience was meh. Not that the food wasn't ok, I thought the food was actually pretty good. We share the lemongrass tofu, the green curry, drunken noodles, yellow curry and red curry. For most of their dishes, especially those curries, they offer custom level spiciness to suit your taste buds and adventure. We were not that brave to try the highest level of spice, but we had a 3 star for the green curry, and 2 stars for the red and yellow. I love spicy food, but that said the 3 stars was a little too spicy for me, bearable, but 2 would make it less painful to go through the entire bowl of curry I feel, just fyi ~~ But that said the curries were delicious.   I love the tofu! It was so soft on the inside. The lemongrass sauce and bok choy really enhances the taste of the tofu being light yet fragrant. I'm glad that lived up to expectations. We also tried their thai iced tea, but were not too impressed either.   So what was the problem? Service. There was only one waiter the entire time. Since it was lunch period they were busy and one person simply could not handle the crowd no matter how efficient you are. He forgot about one person's orders and also a thai tea as well so we had to remind him. Also, we had asked for split checks, but the waiter mixed up almost the entire table's orders. So what was written on the receipt was completely different to what we were actually charged on our cards.   It was such a mess, and overall not the best experience."}
{"text":"My Thai was fragrantly and flagrantly delicious. Our group of three asked our server for unusual entree selections because we wanted to challenge our taste buds (rather than compare their version of Pad Thai to dozens of others that have gone before). She knew the menu well and kindly recommended Southern Heat, Edamame Noodles, and Crispy Squid. Great insider information there! Entrees are served on large, square, white plates - like a blank slate on which they create food art. I would have gladly eaten my veggies as a kid if they came presented like Monsoon Siam's are, beautiful garnishes that make the dish even more visually appealing. Alas, I had an Irish dietitian mom and the veggies were a sad soggy afterthought to overdone meat and potatoes. Hospital food, but it kept us going.  Anyway! Others have said it's cold in there, and I agree. It's a design flaw that the restaurant can do nothing about unless they do not use the front door facing Atwood. Which would be bad for foot traffic business, which would be bad for the restaurant. So yes, every time anyone ventures through the Atwood door every diner is going to get a cold blast from now until May. Do everybody a favor and enter the back way, wear a cute hat, and you'll be okay. The food will heat you up very nicely indeed.  The owners have streamlined the interior design from the late, great Surge restaurant days. How I loved that place! The best $4 veggie wraps anywhere nearby, and their from-scratch yet cheap soups were also delicious but the price point was just wrong I guess for them to survive. A Milio's also went down in that space. Let's not do a three-peat! I recommend eating here early and often. If you are fortunate enough to live close enough to get delivery, I envy you.   Monsoon Siam's Facebook page is amazing. How I wish I could have been in two places on Halloween. Also wish I'd been at the Tibet Temple, and at Olbrich. Good folk. Good food."}
{"text":"The food at Monsoon Siam was delicious. There were enough quirks and drawbacks in the service and ambiance, however, to make it unlikely that I return soon.   We ordered tom ka soup with mushrooms as a starter and the spicy roasted tofu with basil and the spicy eggplant with tofu for entrees. The soup came with one spoon and I asked for a second. It came from behind me as the server passed it over a wall dividing the dining area from the kitchen over my shoulder, which was really awkward. I ordered brown rice ($1.99) with my meal, but white rice ($0.99) came instead. It took a long while before the server checked in so that by the time my brown rice did come, we had nearly finished our meal. Our plates were ice cold (though the food was hot) which wasn't a pleasant sensation.  The soup and the entrees were all quite tasty, though the tofu in my stir fry was more deep fried than stir fried (as advertised). The portions were adequate, but I had no leftovers like I usually look forward to at Lao Laan Xang. The roasted tofu entree comes with a side of steamed carrots, snowpeas, and cabbage that were essentially a flavorless plate filler.   A final drawback: the restaurant was freezing. It was so cold that we ate in our winter jackets and stared at the video playing of a fireplace hoping it would help. The kitchen staff and some of the servers were wearing hats and gloves to stay warm, and other patrons were dining in their big winter hats. Given that I had sought out Monsoon Siam for a hot, fiery meal to ward off the January cold, a cold restaurant was definitely a turnoff.   I'd order delivery from here in the future, provided they remember my brown rice. I'll likely wait until summer to try dining in again because I just don't want to be that cold when I'm eating."}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews I got so excited to try this restaurant so I convinced my boyfriend to take me there today, I even showed him the pictures posted here on yelp so that I could get him into the mood, hey, some of us have to work a little bit harder to get to places you know.  Once we headed there the address got a little bit confusing for us, we had to call the place to guide us. It is a very simple place, however, food was neatly presented on each plate, nice portion sizes and it really felt made with love and care.   To start, we had to have the papaya salad, it was wonderful, sweet, tangy and spicy (we had teared eyes) but I don't mind, I would definitely order it again, it was so fresh and the shrimp on top was really good (it had like a very light tempura breading). For our entrees, My boyfriend had the River Monster (he joked saying\"I hope I don't have to ask for a bigger table\") but he didn't have to, it was a \"monster Jr.\":)  anyway, this fish smelled and looked very good (he really enjoyed it to the last tiny bone), he had a cilantro lime sauce on the side and he liked it also. I had the Rama Tofu, the tofu was breaded and it came in a bed of broccoli with a delicious thick peanut sauce on top and some fried onions. On the menu it says the tofu it's crispy but it wasn't and that dissapointed me a little bit, for me, the star of the dish it's the sauce, if it wasn't for that it would have been bland. Our waitress was really nice. I'm sure we will come back hungry for more."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in Madison. I was introduced to this place by a friend who lived in Southeast Asia for many years (including Thailand). She marveled that anyone in Madison ever goes elsewhere for Thai, and now I understand why. For Laotian food, go across the street to Lao Laan Xang. For Thai, it's Monsoon Siam.  I've become a regular, and every single time I'm there I get the Num Tok. It is just unspeakably tasty. The menu mentions that it's made from \"frank beef,\" which I'm nearly certain is intended to read \"rare beef.\" It's seared on the outside and medium-rare in the middle, and always high quality.  As others have noted, the drunken noodles are particularly tasty. I also really like the Southern Heat (ground chicken with tasty herbs and green peppercorns in a fried, carby shell. My description doesn't do it justice.  It's not perfect, but it's reliably very good. I eat here way more often than I'd like to admit."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh Thai food. Had the drunken noodle. Spicy, just as described, and very tasty. Boyfriend says it's the best pad Thai he has ever had! :-)"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Madison. It makes me want to move a nearby apartment so that I can have lunch there everyday! Lunch special is so cheap!!"}
{"text":"Looking over my other reviews, it seems I really only review a place if I love it or hate it... I guess I just can't get it up to review unless I'm swooning or pissed.  So, I feel just compelled to review this place, despite the plethora of 5-stars they've received in their short time here. I also have the urge (despite my annoyance at myself) to relate that is likely the most \"authentic\" (cringe) Thai food I've eaten in Madison, despite the prevalence of Lao-Thai-Vietnamese food all over town. The waitstaff made a point of letting us know that it's the only Thai-owned restaurant in the area (with so much Lao food here, which we love, I don't doubt it). It definitely conjures up flavor memories of traveling in Thailand, the same way other places bring back memories of Laos, and that's all I'll say about that...  We've eaten from Monsoon Siam twice now, once in the restaurant (they must have been just recently opened as we were the only people there) and once getting take-out.  The food was excellent both times... so far we've had: fried spring rolls, the ka pow crispy squid, massaman curry, the pad thai, pad fresh ginger, drunken noodles, papaya salad (best in town!),  Everything was fresh, well-presented, and amazing. The fried squid was a standout, with a fairly light fried texture and spicy-sweet coating. If I had any gripes, it would be that take-out is just under the amount needed to really pig out multiple times, but 2 meals provided enough for dinner and lunch for 2 people, so what am I talking about?  The waitstaff was super nice both times (even when I was just picking up), but more important they were ON IT and damn EFFICIENT. I don't know if they brought any staff up from NC (except for the owner-chef) when they opened this branch, but these people know how to run a restaurant.  We'll continue to visit our favorite Lao-Thai places (Sala Thai 4eva!) in town but the addition of Monsoon Siam to the roster has taken it up a notch."}
{"text":"Great food, really friendly people. If you want real Thai food, this is definitely the place you want to go. I am Thai, I love eating and I have been eating at every Thai and Thai-Lao restaurants in Madison. This is the best!!  We ordered 4 dishes, and one of them was my favorite but it was not on the menu. I asked them if they might have it. They said they can make it, and It was wonderful! It feels like home. We were excited for food and we enjoyed talking to the staff, so I didn't take any photos. Everything was great. The portion is not too big, which is great because I can order many things. Monsoon Siam2 just opened one week before me and my boyfriend moved from Madison, which is sad, but we will be back every time we are back in town! Promise."}
{"text":"food is ok, service is terrible. Refused to separate the bill for six of us and automatically put 20% tips."}
{"text":"So the food was good... But when they delivered my order they forgot my Thai ice tea and when I called they told me that they were to busy to bring it out me! Then I asked for a refund and they said that they would take my name down and give me free one with my next order... Good food weak service!!!"}
{"text":"Best Drunken Noodle I have ever had....best Squash Curry my wife has ever had.  If we are ever in Madison again, Monsoon Siam will be a sure stop!"}
{"text":"Love the sundried tomato beef appetizer and chicken panang curry is the best in Madison. Go for lunch specials where you get the entree, soup or salad, and a mini spring roll."}
{"text":"I came back with friends and was really impressed with the food this time. After an initial bad experience, it looks like everything is great here how.   Our group had a mix of entrees and they were all great. Really stunning dishes with great fresh flavors."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from Monsoon Siam which was an easy process.  Note that Eat Street and Grubhub have slightly different menus (Eat Street doesn't list all of the specials).  The fresh rolls were not what I had hoped.  I was envisioning cut up fresh spring rolls, but I felt the fresh rolls lacked flavor and were heavy on the lettuce.  The tamarind peanut sauce was less of a dipping sauce and more of a chutney.  The Pad See Eaw with beef and yellow curry with chicken, however, were amazing.  So full of flavor, so comforting.  My boyfriend and I shared the two dishes with the intent of having some leftovers for lunch the next day...oops, we ate it all.  I will definitely be ordering from Monsoon Siam again to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"More love for Monsoon Siam! The food was delicious, and the waitstaff was kind and attentive, without being overly so. You could tell this was the kind of place that the owner and employees were proud of. And with good reason!   Most of the food we had was great, but the real stand outs were definitely the papaya salad (as others have said!) and the khao soi, which might be my favorite one-dish meal ever (the only other place in town I've been able to get it is Sa-Bai Thong, and there you have to know to request it, as it's not on the regular menu). Our table also ordered the spicy eggplant (good, but not amazing), the pad ginger (lots of good ginger flavor!), and the lemongrass chili tofu (beautiful presentation, but the tofu texture was lacking--really the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5).   Oh, and we also had a baby with us, who was treated kindly, even amid some fussing.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I thought this day would never come, but clean, fresh Thai food has finally come to Madison and I am greatly looking forward to eating my way through the Monsoon Siam menu.  Spicy basil fried rice (a/k/a Kao Pad Ka Pow which may be one of the most fun to say food names ever!) is one of my favorite things in the world, and I am pleased to report that Monsoon Siam's is delicious and by far the best I've had since moving to Madison 8 years ago.  Everything I have tried so far has been delicious, the drunken noodle being second runner up to my beloved fried rice.  There are always too many things I'd rather eat than curry so I haven't tried any, but my lunchtime companions have all raved about the curries."}
{"text":"Great addition to the rotation. Friendly staff, pretty authentic Thai food and they'll spice it up for you if you ask. I've enjoyed what I have had so far, with a highlight being the tasty Panang Curry...can't wait to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Our meal was fine, but the decor was very spartan. I don't honestly remember much about this meal, so A-Ok it is."}
{"text":"Hmm... Good Thai cuisine, but so far not great. A bit of sticker shock, particularly once you see the entree portion/serving size for carry out, relative to similar restaurants in the area dishing out generous servings at a reasonable price. The dishes were decent, not the best, by no means the worst. We'll try again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it was nasty. Sloppy, greasy, overly sweet and cold. The basil chicken was just bizarre, everything else was underwhelming. The only decent thing in a huge order was the Khao Soi.   Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"The place to go for Thai! I just had the chicken squash curry with red sauce. Amazing!!!! You have your choice to do green sauce but the server recommended red and boy was she spot on. Also super friendly waitress and good, clean atmosphere. You will not be sorry coming here. And don't forget to get the fresh rolls."}
{"text":"We arrived with the idea of getting carry-out but noticed they had nice outdoor seating area in the back of the building.   We were greeted right away by a smiling waitress with water in hand.   We ordered the papaya salad ($8), pad see ew with beef ($9.95),  and drunken noodles with chicken ($9.95).  The papaya salad arrived with two warm jumbo, skewered shrimp, which is a nice addition compared to other Thai restaurants. The young green julienned papaya were crisp,  however was sadly drowned in salt, and too much sauce. There was two shots of juice remaining on the plate. The portion left something to be desired as well.   The pad see ew contained the correct,  pillow-y rice noodles, generous and equal portions of Chinese broccoli, scrambled eggs, and beef. The sweet and savory soy sauce was distributed evenly among the entire dish.   The drunken noodles was done very well. It also contained, cooked to perfection wide rice noodles, and sweet and spicy sauce. It was welcoming to have perfectly balanced vegetables and chicken mixed throughout.   Our dining companions ordered the fried rice dish and really liked it. The spring rolls appeared satisfactory, appearing to have generically identical shape and texture.  I would not think twice about coming here again. Next time I'd skip the appetizers and go straight for the real stars of the show - the entrees."}
{"text":"Someone mentioned that Monsoon Siam was doing a fundraiser for a local elementary school so we decided to order delivery from them. I ordered at 5, and my delivery time was for 5:47. I thought it would be perfect since my son eats at 6 and it will be perfect timing. By 6, there was no delivery, so I called and it went straight to a full voicemail box. I then made my son some food hoping that it would still come. By 6:50 I contacted EatStreet who called the restaurant who ensured me that the food was on its way. By 7:40 still nothing, I called and they ensured me it was on the way. At 8:15 I finally called to see I should give up on the order and the woman informed me that it was labeled as a pick up and was sitting there. I ended up cancelling as I was annoyed that my food was sitting there close to 3 hours.  They're obviously busy today with the fundraiser, and I wanted to do my part as well. But the lack of communication was pretty horrible."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for lunch.. big portions for a good price! We started with the spring rolls. They were fine but a little bit boring. The peanut sauce they are served with is very thick and definitely makes them! They also have a generous chunk of avocado in each bite, which is the other thing that saved the dish. We got 3 lunch entrees and each is served with a salad or a soup. The salad was fresh and tasty, with some sort of a ginger dressing. The soup had chunks of veggies, tofu, scallions and cilantro... my 2 year old son loved it! Our entrees were the Panang curry (I added broccoli), the massaman curry, and the pad Thai. The panang curry was the stand out.. so good with soo much flavor. I would skip the massaman curry, it was too sweet for us and lacked depth of flavor. The pad Thai was good but I always have a hard time judging it against others, as they all seem to taste somewhat similar to me.   On a previous dinner visit I tried the green curry which I really enjoyed.. but not as much as the Panang. If I visit again, that will definitely be my choice!"}
{"text":"The taste was exactly the same as Thailand. It was really fantastic ! Please, order some special menu that the waitress offered, you will have some special Thai meal, which sometime is rare. Also, the service was really great ! They are really friendly. I've dined here for several times and everything is just perfect! THE BEST THAI RESTAURANT IN MADISON !"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service (5 Stars!). Ambiance leaves me a bit underwhelmed and the seating seems a bit tight. If they can eliminate 2-3 tables, it would make for a more comfortable dining experience. We came during their second week of operations and we experienced none of the usual new restaurant quirks (see my review of Graze in 2010 when they first opened!). The food seemed a bit more expensive than what I would expect for the neighborhood- and since there are a number of similar restaurants in the area- the prices did factor into my review. Having said that, they totally delivered on food and service- so perhaps they can command the prices. I wish them great success in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Got lunch Togo since it's the closest Thai restaurant to me, I ordered papaya salad and chicken green curry Togo, good service when I picked up the food, the green papaya salad wasn't as tasty as I'm used to but it comes with two shrimp on a skewer, the chicken green curry was delicious and love the fresh hot peppers, will come back and try other food items on the menu."}
{"text":"Love it!! So glad I visited with my girls, thanks to recommendations from fellow yelpers!!!  Decent clean setup, with booths and tables that can cater to larger groups of 10. Surprisingly it was rather busy on a weekday! The servers and cooks seem to be Thai, so food is authentic. Service was overall attentive, but our server forgot our Thai iced tea and insisted on bringing us after we cancelled it later on.  Food: Sun dried beef - nice marinate and great meat. Not sure I would say its as good as other yelpers have made it sound like but I definitely would order it again Pad see ew - love the fat thick noodles. Sauce is a little bit sweet just like it should be!! Pad Thai - pad Thai was decent. According to my friends, it is better than sa bai thong! Quality and price.  Will be back! They also do take out, which is another option for people in a hurry"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Madison.  Hands down.  So yummy!  Have only had delivery so not sure of the ambiance!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves good authentic flavors. I've not had anything I didn't like from here. It is one of our family's favorites."}
{"text":"I ate here once days after it opened. I was tempted to write a review but decided to try it one more time. I ate here again and again, now a total of 4 times in 2 weeks. I feel adequately prepared to say that this place blows me away. I have never eaten Thai cuisine so expertly prepared and beautifully presented.   I harken back to the first time I ate at Lao Laan Xang on Willy St about 18 years ago. The subtle flavors of lemon grass, coconut milk and galanga were amazing and so new to my palate. Southeast Asian food continues to be my favorite but the general quality of  the food seems to have declined in the past few years. No matter where you go the menu looks the same and presentation is an after-thought. My old favorite haunt has become tired and uninspired.  Monsoon Siam is a different animal. The dishes are new and exciting. I have never seen tofu so expertly prepared. Some dishes are bold and bright, like the Spicy Roasted Tofu with Basil or the Panang Curry.  Some dishes are delicate and sexy like the Asparagus Delight with a light flavorful sauce highlighting perfectly cooked asparagus and shrimp and the Rama Tofu which is a gorgeous sight to behold. The tofu is deep fried, placed on a bed of steamed broccoli and topped with crispy fried onions. The dish has a luscious peanut sauce which enhances but does not overpower the tofu. I have sampled the tofu soup, simple yet delicious, as well as the Papaya Salad. The salad was lovely, light and spicy just to the right level for my somewhat timid partner.   To be fair, I love the Papaya Salad/Chicken dish at LLX  but the presentation is sorely lacking. Monsoon Siam is right across the street from Lao Laan Xang. There is plenty of room for two great Southeast Asian restaurants. I hope LLX will be moved to create some new dishes, throw away the tired menu and spruce up their aging home. They still are very busy and have a loyal following. But the gauntlet has been thrown by newcomer Monsoon Siam. For now I declare the new kid on the block a winner!"}
{"text":"This establishment needs to seriously get a legitimate plan for delivery options. The delivery system for this place is inconsistent and arbitrary. Sometimes they deliver, other times they wont, then they suggest calling Mr. Delivery. I can imagine the amount of business this place loses because of their delivery issues. Very frustrating!"}
{"text":"Monsoon Siam is a great Thai option in Madison and one of my go-to places for delivery (I order about once a month). I typically go for a noodle dish, either Pad Thai (solid, not the best I've ever had) or Drunken Noodle (good flavor, well cooked chicken, pretty spicy). These dishes are pretty hard to mess up, but Monsoon Siam's versions are not greasy and hit the spot. Their specials and curries are quite good as well. For an appetizer, make sure you get the Fresh Roll- very refreshing, light, and big enough to share.   Their delivery service is among the best in the Madison area. The food always arrives in 30-45 minutes as promised and they have yet to mess up an order. I've eaten in the restaurant once and had a good experience. It's a simple, small restaurant but service was great. A good option if you don't want to wait for a table on the weekend."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest and most delicious Thai food I've ever had!   Monsoon Siam is so yummy. My entire family loved everything we ate. Only comment was that the food was a little spicy, but we tend to have a pretty weak spice tolerance, haha.  For appetizers we ordered the Cigar Rolls, Papaya Salad and Sun-dried Beef. The Sun-dried Beef was our favorite for sure, and a bite of that and the Papaya Salad was the bomb. For our entrees we ordered Pad Thai with chicken, Green Curry with pork, Crying Tiger and Spicy Roasted Tofu with Basil. Like I said before, everything was delicious. Our waitress recommended the Roasted Tofu dish and Crying Tiger and she definitely steered us in the right direction. The Roasted Tofu was my favorite dish, followed by the Green Curry as a close second.   And last but definitely not least, dessert. Let me just say that if you go here, YOU MUST GET THE FRIED ICE CREAM! It's amazing! I've only ever had fried ice cream at Mexican restaurants where it's more crusted. But here it's actually fried with a yummy dough around it. Somehow they manage to make it light, yet fried dough-y and totally delicious. I would return just for this dessert in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Nice service. Fried spring rolls had no substance, but Tom Ka soup was very good. May go back to try more :) hoping menu items as good as soup. Not the best I've had, but good."}
{"text":"really good authentic asian food in madison.  Love all their dishes."}
{"text":"Food is superb. Two in our party had curry dishes, which were excellent. I had the drunken noodles, which was outstanding, but a little bit hot. Atmosphere was clean and friendly. We will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Sooo..I came here on a very empty stomach, after not eating a thing at all for the last 22 hours, I was very hungry.  My roommates suggested this as soon as I got home, I was so very down from some Thai food.   We started our meal off with the Chicken Satay, that came with a cucumber relish that to me resembled almost like a vinaigrette, and as well as a peanut sauce, which I wasn't too fond of, but my roommates loved it. We also got the Cigar Rolls as well which was almost like a spring roll, but had potato, peas, and onion in them, and came with a sweet and sour sauce...fantastic!  I ended up ordering the Kao Pad Ka Pow, a fried rice entree (with three little chili peppers next to its name...so I was of course drawn to that.) Ka Pow had nice big strips of red bell pepper, and onions, and a few smaller bites of chili atop a bed of jasmine fried rice in a garlic spicy cause and a few basil leaves. So so good.   I ended up eating maybe a fourth of it, probably because I was scarfing down the first few bites. But I gladly have my left overs in the fridge ready for tomorrows lunch at work.  I'm giving only 4 stars because the staff was a bit off to me. One waitress had a leopard head hat on, and was on her phone constantly.  But everything else was very inviting, awesome environment, kind of a cozy little place."}
{"text":"First customer for lunch so no problems finding a parking spot on the street in front of the restaurant. Found out later, there are more spots in the back.   Anyway, a friend had dinner here and recommended this restaurant so I had to try it. Server said they opened last Memorial Day and she thinks this is the only Thai restaurant in town where the cook is a Thai.  I decided on the Lunch menu and at first asked for pad Thai. Classic Thai dish to try, right? After reacting to the server's expression, I asked for her recommendations and she suggested pad see yew or Pad pik sod so I choose the latter.   soup or salad, and a spring roll comes with the order during lunch. I picked soup which was tofu soup. I also wanted to use my traditional appetizer to evaluate the restaurant- tod mun. Unfortunately, that's not on the menu so I tried the fresh calamari with sweet chilli sauce.   1) big plus for a nice environment. 38 seats + 8 more by the bar. Clean kitchen with friendly staff. 2) no traditional Thai or Asian music either. I was greeted with songs from an older crooner about London Town on a vinyl player. :-) 3) soup came and I was unimpressed. Looks good because it is a clear broth and you can see carrots and tofu with sprinkling of green onions and a sprig of cilantro. Taste is very familiar - home made beef bullion with water. It was also too salty for my preference and I had to add water to dilute it.  4) spring roll is nice and compact but too greasy. My recommendation is you let it sit on a paper napkin for a couple of minutes to soak up the extra grease before eating. The dipping sauce is pleasantly sweet.  5) my fresh calamari was battered. That is not a bad thing if done right but in this case, the batter is too thick. So thick that it was still soggy inside on some of them and a couple were stuck together. I removed the batter to eat the calamari. Sweet chili sauce is your usual grocery type, nothing to write about. Few things that will made this better. If using store bought calamari rings, they tend to be skinny so use very light batter, not the doughy type. Use doughy batter is the inside will also be soft, like banana.  6) pad pik sod is simply stir fry chicken with vegetables and a few slices of green chilli, served with rice on the side. Rice is good. I asked for mild spiciness because I was told their average level can be spicy. Vege used is fresh so that's good. Friend said they have wok hey, I  disagree. With some wok hey, the vege or chicken will have some charred areas but none in this dish. More like cooking the ingredients together with the sauce and bringing it to boil. The sauce is also too salty and sweet. Not my type of food. I recommend readers ask for less saltiness when ordering this dish. Otherwise all you taste is the salt and sugar.   I say this is not traditional Thai and the food is average and they have room for improvement."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai places in Madison!! The food and people here are second to none. The food is really authentic, using fresh and quality ingredients. Their noodles in the Pad See U are incredible. Their lunch specials are an amazing deal, with good portions, an appetizer (the salad dressing is unreal) and great prices. The owner is Thai and she is so nice and welcoming. The staff is incredible and Gwang is an amazing server!"}
{"text":"We tried Monsoon Siam for lunch today. It was a pretty great experience overall.  There is plenty of parking behind the building. We entered through the backdoor and walked through the back hallway to the main room of the restaurant. It's not a very large space and it was about half full when we arrived at 11:45. Our waitress told us to pick a seat wherever we wanted and brought over water and menus. We ended up ordering the Guay Teaw Moo Soup and the Pad Cashew off the lunch menu. Each dish is served with either soup or salad and we both chose salad.  Within a few minutes our waitress delivered our salads. These were good sized bowls with lettuce, shredded carrots, ginger and a light vinaigrette. It was extremely tasty. Even better it was served with a tiny egg roll and ramekin of dipping sauce. Excellent beginning.  The soup was noodles in a spicy and sour broth with pork, bean spouts, peanuts and lime. It was delicious! The spice level was not overwhelming but it definitely crept up on me as I kept eating. I loved it.  My dining companion ordered the pad cashew with chicken which was sauteed with cashews and scallions in a sweet chili paste sauce. It was tasty but a little too sweet for me.  My only complaint was getting the bill took a long time. As I looked around, the restaurant had completely filled up. They were very busy. We finally flagged down our waitress but it still took awhile to get the check, pay, and get out.  Overall the food was amazing, the price reasonable, and for the most part the service was good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great taste! Authentic as well. If you like somewhat spicy but fresh Thai food, this is a great small place to go!"}
{"text":"Food tasted good. Fast and friendly service (5pm on a Saturday). Only reason for 1 star is because the sign outside said it was happy hour with discounted prices but when we got our bill, no discount was applied. When we asked, the server said that happy hour is only M-F, which would have been OK, except the sign outside didn't say that. They didn't seem to understand why it was a problem to keep the sign up on the weekend."}
{"text":"We had the cigar rolls, Tom yum with shrimp, green curry and pad pik pow. Best was pad pik pow- it was very flavorful. Tom yum was good but not as complex as others I've tried. Portions are large. Everything was fresh, spicy and tasty. Good service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Papaya salad was too sweet for my taste.  The Tom Yum was delicious!  My sister ordered the drunken noodles which she thought was a bit salty.  My fiancé got the prik sod which he liked with the exception of biting into a few very spicy pepper by mistake.   Overall food was a 4 star.  While our server was friendly, the service was extremely slow.  We waited 30 minutes to order, an additional 30 minutes to get our food.  Which was sad because the people that arrived after us got their check at the same time we did.   We waited 20 minutes to get our check.   I might order take out next time.  Only dine in if you have plenty of time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is excellent. I have been here for both lunch and dinner. They have variety of options and they serve quality food. Spice level is great as well. They don't dumb in down- they serve you authentic Thai food. I specially love their red and green curry. Drunken noodle is superb as well"}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded expectations.  -The servers were friendly and the service was fast -The food tasted great and seemed authentic -Well priced (dinner entrees were only around $12) They even made us fried ice cream that was delicious for free since it was my brother's birthday.  Overall I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a relatively fast, inexpensive, and tasty meal"}
{"text":"It wasn't as good as Ha Long Bay. My food was pretty good. I had a beer. They drew a heart on our reservation sign. Oh, whatever that appetizer was was really good. We had to go down a creepy alley after we parked and we got lost on the way back. They did not allow dogs."}
{"text":"Very good depth of flavor on all of the dishes I had. I liked the glass noodle with crab and bok choy the best. Quality and attention to detail in the food was outstanding. Only disappointment was the rice. Mine was a little mushy.  But this can be easily fixed. Ordering online for pick up was super fast and packaging was superb."}
{"text":"Absolutely my new favorite place to eat! First time we tried this place we ordered take out, the order was ready at the time we asked for and it was piping hot when we got home. They also do delivery and it was fantastic when we tried that out one night. Order was delivered in record time and just as good as getting take out. The food is amazing, I haven't been disappointed with anything I've gotten from there. The cigar rolls taste just like another app from a different restaurant that has slowly been losing my business over the year. I would highly recommend MS to anyone, its worth it."}
{"text":"Kapow Crispy Squid - the dish I will forever compare all things spicy and delicious to.  It is so unbelievably delicious.  It is truly what I hope my dreams will be made of.   Cigar rolls and papaya salad are lovely, Thai iced tea is, too.  I'm not in this area often enough but dammit - I'm about to be!    My dinner date and I were already planning our trip back before our plates were empty."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in Madison!  The drunken noodles were flavorful and spicy.  Pad Thai and basil chicken were perfect too.  I consider these the staple Thai dishes and monsoon delivers!  It'd a good atmosphere here too.  Modern decor, good service, clean and full bar."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery mid day. It came super fast, still hot. We ordered pad Thai and pad garlic. The lunch specials came w amazing little egg rolls and tasty soup. Both entrees were delicious, better than expected. We will absolutely order from here again!"}
{"text":"The drunken noodles are the best. Just the right amount of heat and good saucy oiliness.   My husband got the Poo goong ob, a clay pot filled with vermicelli noodles, shrimp, mushroom, napa cabbage, and some crab meat on top. I'm not sure all the ingredients were cooked in this clay pot but the seasonings with ginger and sesame oil was good. For the price of $14 though, we knew we were mostly paying for the seafood in the dish.   Service was attentive with checkins and water refills."}
{"text":"People be buggin about the sun dried beef. So I ordered it.  It's aiiiiiiight.  The texture is great but I was mislead when I read Sriracha on the description. Thought it was gonna be marinaded with it, not get it on the side.   Drunken noodles was the litmus. Was good. Not about to slap my mama over how good it was...but not about to slap the chef for a refund either.   Those cigar rolls looked unappealing. Looked like Mutombos long ass fingers. But they were solid. Wished for more spice in that curry, but the \"demographics\" prolly wouldn't be down - and you gotta keep those door open for business so I feel ya on that.   Papaya salad was BOMB. And why? The fish sauce dressing was what I hoped for and it was there. Don't serve it to those vegetarians without it. Treatin papaya like noodles is genius.   I'd hit it again but dine-in this time."}
{"text":"Came here hoping for a quick takeout lunch. The restaurant was fairly full and seemed a bit understaffed but I had heard good things about the food so I thought I would give it a shot. After being quoted a 25 minute wait, I thought I would hang out for a bit and then be on my merry way. The wait turned out to be 45 minutes. If I had known this before I would have gone with another option.  The food, however, was pretty good. I had the chicken massman curry lunch special. It came with a soup and an egg roll. The curry was nicely creamy with a nice serving of chicken. Food wise it is probably closer to 4 stars, and I'd be willing to revisit my review if I have a couple more positive experiences in ordering/waiting for food."}
{"text":"Chicken pad Thai was uninspired and chicken was dry as dessert. Didn't taste fresh at all. Ordered tom ka soup and it had two rubbery shrimp inside. Way overpriced will not order again"}
{"text":"Born and raised in Thailand and as a foodie, I can tell you that this is the only authentic Thai restaurant in Madison. The taste is actually like what you would get when you visit Thailand. The service is very impressive yet sometimes slow due to limited number of staffs. We ordered Kao Soi (with beef is recommended), Drunken noodle (3 stars may be too spicy if you are not familiar with Thai chilli), Mussamun curry, and pineapple fried rice; everything was delicious. I would definitely go there as often as I could. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"I did NOT like this place. The food wasn't good. I ordered the Thai sausage for appetizers. It was small and it tasted like it was old. I also got the chicken pad thai, which didn't taste like pad thai at all. In DID saw that the food wasn't made from a Thai chef, so that explains it, but I do like how friendly the employees and owners are. The environment was welcoming, it's just the food isn't good. AND there was this one guy who kept coming into the store asking for something. I felt uncomfortable because he was waiting outside of the restaurant. He seemed like a beggar."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend for lunch. The lunch special prices ($7.99) were what really lured us in the door. It was a sadly mediocre experience.  You get a lot of food for your money, which I was excited about. But when I started eating my Pad Fresh Ginger, I noticed the flavors were all over the place. One bite was way too salty, another bite was funky. The quality of the chicken seemed to be pretty good, and was plentiful. But overall, it just tasted unpleasant and was very greasy. The lunch special came with a cup of soup and an egg roll. The soup tasted fine, but was only sparsely adorned with vegetables. The eggroll was a greasy, bland little nugget.  My friend ordered the Ka Pow, which was equally greasy and underwhelming.   Our server was fine, and the space was inviting enough. Too bad the food was pretty forgettable. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Got delivery from here. The time estimate was correct (30-40 mins) and the delivery guy came up to our apartment instead of making us meet him outside which is always appreciated. The drunken noodle was WAY too spicy, though, more than would be tolerable for most people."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Broaden your horizons and don't just sit and order Pad Thai!!!  (It's the equivalent to Chili in the US, there are hundreds of versions of Pad Thai). We have tried many dishes and have not been disappointed.  Curry noodles with seafood-very good.  Ginger chicken, excellent.  I love their fish, steamed with bean sauce and ginger.  Pad Sei Ew - delicious. I would not recommend ordering any dishes with beef, the flavor is too harsh.  Stick with chicken, pork or seafood so the delicate flavors come through!!"}
{"text":"This unquestionably will be my new fav go to for Thai food.  Took the fam there for late dinner. What a pleasant surprise to say the least. They close at 9:30 and we walked in after nine and they were super friendly and welcomed us with open arms!! We started with fresh rolls like cold spring rolls. They were different and delicious with carrots lettuce and mango with a peanut spread. Then Tom yum soup, thee best I've ever had. We all tried different entres which were delicious. Everything tasted fresh and the portions  were large. I had Thai tea with lemon, like an Arnold Palmer with more flavor, it was a real treat.  We will definatly be back in fact my daughter said since they deliver to have the food ordered next time she's in town.  I noticed they have lunch specials for 7.99. Can't beat that.  The place is small but prices are reasonable and the place looks clean. They have beer and wine and a large selection of nonalcoholic drinks which I really liked.  Their menu has a great selection for anyones taste buds."}
{"text":"Got take-out from here last night and was MOST pleased. My friend and I ordered online, which made it really easy. The bag was right on the counter when I arrived. I grabbed it and off I went! In summary, very convenient!   The food was fantastic. I ordered the Pad Thai with pork. I made sure to order a side of peanut sauce (because I'm obsessed). For $3, I got a HUGE container of peanut sauce, which I gladly smothered all over my Pad Thai. The food smelled and tasted delicious. I also thought the portion was great (this was the first time in a while I wasn't able to finish my entree).  I'd say I had a hard time finding the place, but that might just be my pregnancy brain. The parking in back was nice and made pick-up a breeze. Definitely plan to order from here again. Maybe even dine-in?"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place, yet???  This place is consistently great! Thai is my favorite food. I used to drive to Rockford if I wanted a decent Thai meal. Now, thanks to Monsoon Siam, I no longer have to make that trek.   Basil chicken (Kao Pad Ka Pow Gai) is my absolute favorite dish on the entire planet!!! It's pretty close to the real thing that you'd get in a sidewalk cafe in Bangkok. Nowhere else even comes close...believe me I've tried. I can't get enough of this place or this dish.   I've also had their Panang Curry which is also fabulous. It's a very close second. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"For an appetizer, i had the cigar rolls which tasted exactly like deep fried wonton wrappers and nothing else. Then I received one of the chef's specials, Summer Spice, which is an eggplant and shrimp dish. It was insanely salty. I had a hard time eating it, I mostly ate the rice on the side. There looked to be some unique items on the menu, too bad I won't be back to try them."}
{"text":"The first time I went I was impressed, the second time it was closed when Yelp indicated it was open (Sunday it is closed between 15:00-17:00). Still I plan to return because I think there is a lot of potential here. Third time is a charm, I got in for lunch tried two new dishes and the papaya salad all were great. If you are going exclusively for Thai in my opinion this might just be the best Thai place in town"}
{"text":"Don't let the mini-mall exterior fool you, Monsoon Siam is a real treat. Yellow curry with beef and potatoes - inexpensive and phenomenal. Food presentation was fun and everyone ate in silence for half a plate. Looking forward to returning to try many other dishes.   Service was super slow but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"In town for a week and decided to have some thai. Very glad we did as we both had the best curries we've EVER had!! Loved it so much we went back the next night for more. I would have licked the bowl if it wasn't inappropriate."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the food is excellent! Our favorite Thai food in Madison!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night. They were super packed and had only 2 servers for the whole place. Service was super slow but the food was great! The food did come out pretty fast given how packed the place was.  We got vegetarian fresh rolls to start. It was cut up like sushi (very cute presentation and perfect bite sized portion) - the peanut tamarind dipping sauce it comes with is excellent.  For the main course my husband and I split pineapple fried rice and vegetarian red curry. The red curry was spicy and very very flavorful. I would have liked a little more pineapple in my pineapple fried rice though. There were no leftovers - I pretty much wiped clean that red curry bowl. The seitan in the red curry sauce was a dynamite combination. Better wrap up this review I'm beginning to sound like guy fieri.  Great Asian food but not the best Thai in Madison. I will be back to try their noodles."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, good beer selection, helpful staff and mostly quick service at a time when it was packed. Will go back. Lot's of great choices on the menu.  Easy to find parking, great bars nearby."}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant is Monsoon Siam, Compared to other Thai restaurants, this one's the Grand Slam! The staff are so attentive and sweet, Whatever you order it's bound to be a treat, And the papaya salad is the bomb, it'll make your mouth go ka-blam!"}
{"text":"Monsoon Siam is the kind of place I'd like to eat lunch at regularly. If only they were in Denver. Gah!  Corey D took me here for lunch on a recent trip to Madison when I said I wanted to eat something that wasn't too heavy and preferably vegetarian. I ended up ordering a Chef's Special which was so, so good. It was called the Tofu Angel and came with pan-fired marinated tofu, Bok Choy. carrots, mushrooms and scallions topped with spicy, sweet, and sour sauce and was served on steamed wide noodle. It was the perfect portion size and cost $13.  We also shared a fresh roll which consists of lettuce, avocado and carrots wrapped with rice paper, and served with a peanut sauce. Also delicious.  The food comes fast, it's fresh, and the service is nice. It's all the things I could want in a lunch restaurant and I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai in madison. Wasn't too busy and were seated right away on a Tuesday night. Get the cigar rolls!  The chicken squash red curry was very good and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. One of the best Thai places I've eaten at. I can't wait to try more. The sun-dried beef was crispy and flavorful, but I was a little disappointed by the quantity. I also got the Kao Soi. It was smooth and flavorful. It was a little sweet following the beef dish, but I really enjoyed it. And I really appreciated all the ingredients/toppings. I did add some extra spice. I can't wait to try more dishes from this place!! And Barley Pop next door is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Chron Jon!!!  Super fast and friendly service. A+  Way better then anywhere else around!   Must say way to make my day!"}
{"text":"A group of four of us tried this place for the first time and loved it. It's small, but cozy and the staff was very friendly. We all had different dishes from the red and yellow curry, to the soup and all was delicious. Their fresh rolls were quite good as well. This is located in an ever growing hip and trendy neighborhood on Madison's east side. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food here.  I tried some of the apps and then had the green curry.   Papaya salad and the sun dried beef were the appetizers that stood out. Papaya salad was fresh and tangy and just spicy enough without being overwhelming. I Was surprised by the lack of fish sauce, which instead I have seen in many traditional Thai places (including in Thailand). I have to say, I like this departure from tradition. Makes the salad more palatable for me. Sun died beef was just good food. Chewy and sweet and salty and generally good.  The green curry was delicious! Layer on layer of flavor and a spiciness that slowly builds up, while not overpowering the aromatic flavor of the Thai basil. I would recommend extra rice and a friend to share the pretty generous serving of curry.  My only complaint is that they did not have any Asian/Thai beer, only craft US bier. I realize this might be a plus to many, but craft beer to me are just not that good: way too heavy and often very flat.  Service was very friendly: both the chef and the manager are very cheerful and their passion for the food shines through when they talk to customers.  Will be back for more thai!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here but what I had was not great. Some of the negative experience of eating here is the delays, which can be annoying. There was only one person waiting on tables but she was also doing the cash register and busing tables as well. She could have used some help. Out food came pretty fast once we finally got to order but our salad and egg roll was forgotten  somehow and we had to reminder her of this. The lunch menu on the back of the regular menu does not say what comes with your order. It did come with the salad and egg roll but I had to ask. Both were very good. The Pad tai with seafood came with muscles still in the shell. I have never seen that before and it was interesting. It also had a couple of shrimp and some other things that may have been squid but I am not sure. It was a little on the sweet side not not to much.I would like to try some of the other things on the menu but would choose to go when they would not be so busy. We were there at noon and the three people in the kitchen were very busy with take out and the inside diners."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in town. The taste is authentic, the ingredients are fresh and of high quality. The service is a little slow, but is compensated by very nice servers."}
{"text":"Great food, ordered for pickup and they had our food ready quickly. We had pad Thai with seafood and tofu plus chicken satay. Great light sauce paired with peanut sauce!"}
{"text":"BEST most DELICIOUS  and FANTASTIC thai food in madison hands down! having lived in nyc for 10 yrs and travelled through thalland this is EASILY my FAVORITE THAI PLACE IN MADISON my litmus test for any thai place is chicken pad si ew. they knock it out of the park. everything else is solid we have explored the menu since their opening  and we have difficulty finding anything we dislike favs: papaya fries pad si ew ginger chicken pinapple fried rice red curry whole fish CRISPY!!! beef salad crying tiger  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! we do take out once a week....yum!  also:  wait staff is friendly accommodating and prompt"}
{"text":"Review for catering only:  I have had them at many business events and private parties, the food was always very good, and the service on point. Professional demeanor, timely, generous portions and fair prices. Happy to work with you on dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Ha Long Bay for takeout curry in the Wil-Mar neighborhood but Monsoon Siam can definitely hold its own in a 1on1 battle.  On a Friday night for takeout, the order was ready in 10 minutes and their staff was kind and efficient in quickly saying hello and checking me out both on the phone and upon my arrival.  The chicken red curry was delicious with a pleasing amount of kick. It was pretty slow inside for a Friday night but upon reading another Yelpers review, I wonder if folks were enjoying the beautiful outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Since it has opened, Monsoon Siam has quickly become one of my favorites in the area, and it's now on my regular visit rotation. Although their service is good, the staff is nice, and the prices are reasonable, I keep coming back here for two main reasons: The dishes, and how fast they come to the table.  Concerning the food: There's a lot more variety on the menu than one would expect. Some of the specials are interesting and unique concoctions, like the lemongrass tofu and tofu angel. Otherwise, there's a lot of classics to choose from as well, like the Pad Thai, and the selection of curries. One aspect I really like is that in the dishes where you can choose your protein, you can pick a tofu BALL, which is different from your regular old tofu in that it's deep-fried and packed with herbs. I very much recommend trying those at least once.  And all of this food comes to you FAST. Like I put in an order with 1 other person, and the dishes came to us in 4 minutes. It's almost too fast, because it makes me wonder if they're even made to order. But they're delicious regardless, so who cares? The speed of the service always makes me consider Monsoon Siam when i'm in a pinch for time and am feeling too lazy to cook.  With all that said, I can say that even if you think that there's too many Thai places in Madison, Monsoon Siam is still well worth your time to check out."}
{"text":"Really good food with really slow delivery. The first time we called, they put is on \"hold\" for a few minutes before hanging up. Hold is in quotes because you could tell that someone just put the phone on the counter. The second time we called we got a message saying that voicemail wasn't set up for the number. Third time's the charm, and we actually managed to place an order.  They told us delivery would take 40 minutes and it took over an hour and a half to arrive.  4 stars for the food, 1 star for the delivery service."}
{"text":"Was unimpressed, to say the least. The Spicy Red Curry was a misnomer, as the dish was not at all spicy. Unfortunately, the soup was lackluster- it looked and tasted as if they just dropped in raw veggies just before bagging the order. It was akin to a meal that would be served inflight, in whatever is below economy class, en route to Bangkok."}
{"text":"We ordered the sun dried beef as an appetizer.  I got the Southern Heat and my dining partner ordered the Andaman noodles.    The sun dried beef was just okay.  I didn't love it.  I was expecting an intense burst of flavor, and while flavorful, I just wasn't impressed.  The meat tasted too beefy for me and I felt that the flavoring came mostly from marinating in soy sauce.  My friend liked it and said he would order it again.  My dish, the Southern Heat, had minced chicken stir fried with lemongrass and other herbs.  The menu displayed 4 peppers next to it and it was SPICY! I love my dishes spicy and it was a thrilling kind of heat, but probably much too spicy for most people.  The dish reminded me of the Hmong dish laab.  I liked it, but found it heavy on oil.  It came with some steamed bland vegetables, and the minced chicken was in a fried shell that was dripping with oil by the end.  A side of rice helped the spice and oil.   My friend asked for the Andaman noodles to be made spicy.  He requested it to have 3 peppers, but there was barely any spice when we ate it.  Their spice scale seems to be exponential rather than linear.  The Andaman noodles were a curried noodles with shrimp and shredded crab meat.  I felt that the crab meat was unnecessary.  The curry flavor overwhelmed any crab taste.  Neither of us was a fan of this dish.    They have a full bar it seems, but the server never brought a drink list or beer list.  I would also really like them to have a stronger fan since my clothes and I came away smelling like stir fry."}
{"text":"My partner and I ordered two dished and cigar rolls. He had curry, which was ok, nothing amazing. We were really looking forward to visiting this place, it was a bummer. I had a dish with shrimp and crab, it was pretty decent... the biggest let down was when I hopped on my bike to go home, and once I got home I received a call stating that my cigar rolls were not put in the bag. So, back I went to Monsoon, to get THREE cigar rolls for $5. I should have just stayed home, so if you get the cigar rolls, let it be known you only get three."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, once for lunch another for dinner. This is a HOPPIN' place and be prepared for nearness of other patrons and a little wait during busy hours! Parking can be tricky but check the rear lot for room!! The staff greets customers right away and is always happy and smiling! I ordered the Massaman Curry with chicken (they offer a choice of proteins, $10): AMAZING!!! This might be my fav Thai curry dish to date! This dish is loaded with flavor, generous with ingredients and the sauce is heavenly! This dish is noted as \"spicy\", however, I'm not a lover of a lot of heat and it was just hot enough for my liking. They happily adjust this as requested! Monsoon Siam serves Singha beer, which is a nice, easy-drinking Thai pale lager...which went beautifully with this dish!"}
{"text":"First of all-DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY!!! It was AWFUL! It came an hour and a half later. I wasn't honestly as angry over that as I was annoyed.  We are staying at the Lowell center. The delivery woman called and said she can't come upstairs to the elevator. She described something about a conference room and only an elevator that had no floors on it? After talking to her, we offered to go downstairs to meet her at the front desk. She ended up just leaving our food on a random bench, we stood there downstairs wondering where she is. After waiting a bit and asking the front desk about the bag, they said they weren't sure if it was delivery from monsoon or not. I felt weird but checked. Sure enough- it was our food. Who does that?? Who abandons someone's delivery food on a random bench?! The front desk at the hotel saw the whole thing, asked for the bane of this restaurant to put it on a do not recommend list for delivery. I called and there was also absokutly no resolution for any of this. I'm not asking for free food but I def wanted our tip at least refunded..   Other than this fucked up delivery service- the food was pretty good. If you want food- go there rather than waiting a really long time and getting your food left in a random area.  we won't be ordering here anymore. Food was good but there are plenty of other Thai food restaurants who make tasty food too. It's such a shame."}
{"text":"Had chicken satay and fresh rolls for appetizers, then pad Thai and mussaman curry for entrées. Delicious! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves thai food! Good price, fast service"}
{"text":"The chicken red curry was the highlight of the meal. Good flavor and just the right amount of spice. Serving size is less than many other Thai restaurants but still plenty. We were disappointed by the cigar roll appetizer. They just didn't have much flavor you basically just tasted the wonton wrapper. The pad Thai was good, not much tofu in it though. What tofu was in it was prepared well and tasted really good. We ordered it extra spicy and it was definitely spicy but the spice didn't overpower the flavor. The drunken noodles with beef had good flavor and spice. A little on the salty side though. The beef was good, not chewy or fatty. We got everything delivered and it came in about 45 minutes."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and was very pleased. Their green chicken curry was AWESOME. Be ware, it has a MAJOR kick!! Holy spicy, my tongue and lips are on fire. But so good you just cannot stop. We also got the shrimp fried rice which was also good but the green curry sticks out most so I will have to try another curry next time. Delicious! The curry is 5 stars for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit, a take out order -- the drunken noodles with chicken is fabulous!  So much flavor and nice amount of heat.  Perfect combination of a bit of sweet with hot chili.  My mouth is toasty, my face sweating and I am super happy with my choice.  Reasonably priced.  Fresh taste!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison while attending a conference. Ordered take-out and was given an expected delivery time. The food was delivered hot 15 minutes early by a friendly and courteous delivery driver! Ordered: 1) a house salad which was fresh and the side dressing was a DELICIOUS peanutty vinaigrette that was just right! 2) Cigar Rolls - which I thought by the description would be a Thai version of Indian samosas - NOT. Actually they were too thin (more like pencil thickness than cigars) to taste much of anything of the filling that was rolled inside. Disappointing, but not terrible, just not what I was expecting. 3) Drunken Noodles with Veggies - same yummy sauce as I've had when ordered this dish at other Thai restaurants out west, which included fresh green beans, fresh broccoli florets, carrot slices, bamboo shoots, onion, red pepper, cabbage, Thai basil, fresh minced garlic, tomato wedges (didn't like those), and noodles. These noodles were different than I've had elsewhere - they were long (like lasagna length) and thicker than any other noodle I've ever eaten. Not bad tasting but a bit unwieldy.  Overall, a very tasty meal. Would definitely eat here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Yum! Monsoon Siam's food is really special. We ordered Pad Fresh Ginger with beef which had a deliciously complex sauce - very memorable and we will no doubt order it again. We also had Green Curry with chicken with a one chili hotness rating. Again, the sauce was full of deep flavors. All of the ingredients were fresh and it was fun to see the cooks at work and smell all the delicious dishes they were cooking up. I am so happy they are in the 'hood!"}
{"text":"4 star review with 5 star food! This is my favorite Thai place in Madison, to be honest I won't go anywhere else because I'm disappointed. My favorite part of the menu is the curries- they're super flavorful and they can put in some heat as I like. The roasted tofu curry is absolutely delicious!  When I've come here with my family/friends, they have really enjoyed the drunken noodles, and the cashew chicken. My little brother is obsessed with the chicken satay and we always ask for extra peanut sauce, which a waiter graciously brought us a full bowl of.  During peak hours you may find yourself waiting for your food a bit longer than you'd like. The staff is very kind and some of them are very good, but others may not be as experienced. Then seating inside is quite limited as well.  Overall, I am a huge fan of Monsoon Siam and I'll be ordering takeout for my late study nights."}
{"text":"I am so glad I live so close! Their green curry is the best I've had! Portions are great and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here last night with some friends, and it was awesome!   We called a few hours ahead to make a reservation. It's a bit small inside, so a reservation on Saturday night was probably helpful because there isn't really a good waiting space.   The food: 5/5. I had the squash curry (red), and it was superb. Super flavorful and delicious. If I'm honest, I seriously considered licking the plate, but then I remembered I wasn't alone on my couch in curry heaven.  My friend had the Panang curry and loved it as well. We agreed they both might have been the best curry we've ever had. Mine was a little creamier, but they were similar. Both were spicy, but I like spicy food. Not overwhelmingly spicy at all. Her boyfriend had the Southern Heat, and he said it was really, really good. Next time, he'd probably order it less spicy because it was a LOT. My boyfriend had the Ka Pow, with a similar story (yummy, a bit too spicy). Amazing all around! YUM YUM YUM. Portions were very reasonable but not enormous, like lots of Thai places are. We definitely didn't leave hungry.   Only con: We also ordered the Kanom Jeeb, and sadly I think they forgot about it. Our waiter brought it out after our food, but we were pretty full by that point so they took it back.   Other than that, our waiter was really nice and helpful with questions and giving us recommendations. Food came out a little slow (one, then the next, then the next), but that's okay. Prices were also very good.   Will definitely be getting takeout from this place soon. Can't wait to try more off their amazing looking menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. Had the chicken satay, dried beef, and pad cashew nut. I couldn't get enough of it all, so delicious! The staff is super friendly and sweet. Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is we tried to order delivery a bit late and were told we could from the restaurant and to call a different delivery number, but the delivery number said they were not open. A bit complicated with no result!"}
{"text":"First time here. Very nice server. Easy to read menu, answered questions easily. Had the large bowl of Tom Yum soup with shrimp. Huge fresh shrimp, fragrant delicious broth with lots of ginger and lemongrass. Not very hot."}
{"text":"Really great. I was surprised. Probably some of the best Thai food I've had in Madison. One item came slightly too spicy when we ordered it less so, but everything was delicious. We particularly liked the yellow curry which was creamy and coconuty."}
{"text":"Well, I started with the soup that came with the lunch special. Pretty much flavorless broth with a few overboiled vegetables and plain tofu (not the lovely tofu that you find in good Thai places). The soup of my nightmares. If you want better lunch soup, go to, well, anywhere else. Just .8 miles in either direction are Sala Thai and Ha Long Bay, featuring complex amazing soups and entrees, and across the street is Lao Laan Xang. Trust me, you won't regret it the extra walk/drive.     Then the \"penang curry\" came out. I don't know what this was, but it wasn't penang curry - almost no lime leaves, bizarrely sweet but yet flavorless sauce.   And the service? I had to find the waitress (who didn't seem that busy) to get something hot to spice up my \"medium curry\", and after she gave me the check she didn't come back for 10 minutes to pick it up.   If you are looking for better Thai, go anywhere in the entire city. I had thought it wasn't possible to screw up Thai food, but apparently I was wrong..."}
{"text":"Overall an enjoyable meal. I'll certainly will go back. I ordered both the drunken noodles with pork and the yellow curry with chicken. The drunken noodles were prepared with a rich spicy garlic sauce - but I thought a bit too salty. The yellow curry with chicken had a bold slightly sweet flavor profile. The potato was slightly undercooked. The curry sauce had a very smooth and satisfying texture.   I didn't specify a hot or spice level. Both dishes came with what I'd call medium spice level. While I thought the drunken noodles were overly spicy I found them very satisfying - I couldn't keep my chop sticks out of them. Both certainly had enough spice to get a good brow sweat going.   If you wanted more spice a 3-dish condiment \"rack\" was available. I didn't indulge - but companions did. One seemed to be a red chili spice powder, another a vinegar based chili sauce and some sort of red chili oil.   Bonus: Brown rice available for $1.50 up charge.  Round Two: this time we ordered for delivery. I'd have to say the delivered food was better than our previous sit down experience. I re ordered the Drunken Noodles and Yellow Curry - This time both with Chicken.  During my first dining experience I thought the dishes were a bit heavy handed with the salt. Not so tonight - great flavor balance and profile."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai restaurant with absolutely fabulous flavors. Their fish dishes are the best. Also I never order Pad Thai (I feel it's usually a bland dish) but theirs is very good. Friendly staff. This is my favorite Thai restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Quaint little place in the downtown neighborhood of the Barrymore Theater.  We dropped in for dinner before a concert and enjoyed some delicious chicken satay, yellow curry and pad thai.   It was a bit HOT in the place, but they gladly adjusted the AC for a more comfortable experience.  Nice, friendly service and staff.  Was really great to find this place so close to the theater.  We ate with the locals and enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Monsoon Siam is incredible - their curries are the best I've had in Madison (yes, better than Sa Bai Thong and Ha Long Bay!). Although many opt for the safe pad Thai, I would strongly encourage you to order the Panang curry or the Kao Soi - they are incredible (and a steal!). Throw in a Thai iced tea, and you're set. The lunch special is a phenomenal deal - a good portion. Ask for the salad instead of the soup - it comes with a great peanut sauce. Also, the fresh spring rolls come with a peanut dip that is perfect.   I am ride or die Monsoon Siam, if I can pick a Thai restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and curtious! Inside was cozy and guests get a view of inside the kitchen and watch our orders being prepared. The food was delicious and FRESH! I will be going again, oh and parking is a breeze."}
{"text":"I guess this place was okay but after reading the reviews for this place I expected a lot more.  My first disappointment came after reading that they had a full bar only to find out that they only served beer and wine.    My other gripe was the portion size; everything was a bit on the small side.   I asked for extra rice and got a single scoop.  Since I'm complaining I will also say that the  restaurant felt a bit cramped.  In regard to the food I thought most was just okay.  We ordered the cigar rolls, tom yum, and a couple other non memorable dishes.  The tom yum was good but that was the only thing that really stood out.  With so many great Thai options in the city I doubt this is one that I will be rushing to try again."}
{"text":"I order a chicken pad thai & it was the worst pad thai in my life. It only seem to contain chicken & rice noodles with a tiny amount of crushed peanuts. There wasnt any flavor at all and i was pushed to the point of going to the grocery store to buy already made pad thai sauce to add in so i wouldn't waste my money."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have had good food and service in the past. However, I went last night and it was awful. It was busy when we walked in, I'll give them that, but it thinned out the longer we were there, although we were only there so long because of the terrible service. I've never had to wave down a server to take our order but after sitting there for 20 minutes while the servers went to every other table, we finally had to flag them down. Food was pretty good, although my shrimp dish was mediocre best. The entire time we ate though, no server. They were at every other table but ours. I never got the sauce I asked for, twice, for two different items. Again, had to wave down the waiter to get the check. They seem far more focused on phone/delivery orders than half their customers in the restaurant. Terrible service, I won't be back. Get your business in order and take care of your customers who are actually there."}
{"text":"I agree with Grace's review.  The food is tasty and authentic and the $8 lunch special is a great deal.  I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"PROS: Excellent entrees  CONS: Disappointing appetizers  As appetizers, the cigar rolls and nam tok were underwhelming --- not worth reordering. The cigar rolls had essentially no filling --- just crisply fried spring-roll-eqsue shells, and the nam tok was oversalted. However, the pad see ew and the tofu ball panang curry were pretty amazing, probably among the best I've had in a while. So the moral of the story is: Order the right dishes and the food will be awesome."}
{"text":"The drunken noodles here cannot be beat, and the tofu is cooked perfectly.  Sometimes the service is slow, but always very friendly.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Only authentic Thai food in Madison. I am addicted to the kow pad kra pow (basil fried rice), pad prik pow, ka pow with beef (love the garlic). High quality ingredients, great chefs."}
{"text":"THANK YOU cool yelp eliters for guiding me to yet another wonderful spot. I've passed this on Atwood but it never stood out enough to convince me to take a night off of my usual Thai places.  The reviews all are correct - the food here is fantastic. It's super casual so it's somewhere I would go if you're really just looking to treat your taste buds for a low key dinner. I want to try ordering delivery, but the fees are such that I would probably only do it with a large group. Here are some of the highlights:  Tom Kha soup: this coconut broth soup is a favorite of mine and something I use to compare Thai restaurants because it usually doesn't vary so much. Monsoon Siam probably served the most unique version I've ever tasted; it was tangy and I want to say citrusy! I also liked that you could order mushrooms with this instead of the usual tofu or chicken.   Sun dried beef: ordered this because of a yelp review that claimed people \"sing praises\" to this dish. After one bite, we were singing praises. It's sooo flavorful and not overly dry! A lot of food for $7, easy to share with at least 3 people.  Red curry: spicy (be warned if you can't take the heat) without losing the inherent flavor of the dish. Very brothy, which I personally prefer. I got the tofu because of a yelper who said they don't typically love tofu but this tofu is an exception. I totally agree; the texture is sophisticated and it really takes the flavor of the dish.  Pad see ew: fluffy noodles! Great with tofu. My friend who ordered this was so happy!  My friend is a huuuuge Ha Long Bay guy, and admitted that Monsoon Siam's food is better! Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice since it opened, and it is our new favorite Thai restaurant in Madison! The location is ideal in the neighborhood, and the staff is the most friendly you'll find in town.   The fresh rolls and cigar rolls are both excellent appetizer options. My favorite dish is the Spicy Roasted Tofu with Basil on the vegetarian part of the menu. The tofu is seasoned to the point that it tastes like actual meat, and it is perfectly spicy without being too hot. We have also tried the Pad Thai and Pad See Eaw and both are great, as well.   Try this place out, you won't regret it. I really hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and have been very pleased each time.  My two favorite dishes are Summer Spice and the Kang Som (very yes very hot) with Talapia.  Your tastebuds will sing with happiness.  This is a place to be adventuresome and try something new.  The appetizers are just okay so save yourself for the Chef's Specials.  Have a glass of wine next door at the Wine Table as an aperitif."}
{"text":"I got Monsoon Siam for takeout the other day and it was quite good! I got the Ka Pow (or something like that, I forgot the name) and it was deliciously flavorful! On the greasier side, but really tasty with decent portions. I can't really comment on the service, but the takeout was simple and quick. I would recommend this place if you're a fan of Thai food!"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times when in town. The food is fresh, good and the host team are awesome. The papaya salad and the Southern heat are two exceptionally well prepared dishes, apart from the appetizers and the other curries. A friendly atmosphere with ample parking behind the restaurant attracts lot of locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"Monsoon Siam is taking the Madison dining scene by storm, raining down a variety of authentic Thai treats on area diners.  My initial visit to this new East Side eatery left a favorable first impression, with its friendly service and well composed Asian cuisine made with fresh ingredients.  While only open for a couple of months, the restaurant has quickly hit its stride, as the chef (Pooh Wonglaka) operated a Thai restaurant in Charlottesville, VA before moving to Madison.  I'm not Thai, so I can't speak for whether the cuisine is authentic or not, but I can state the plates I tried during my visit were well composed, masterfully marrying the flavors of the fresh ingredients in a healthy, balanced manner.    Our group of six had a 7PM reservation on a Monday evening.  When we arrived, the restaurant had a handful of patrons.  Within 15 minutes, an influx of Thai speaking diners flooded the restaurant to near capacity.  Despite the crush of customers, our effervescent server (Kitty Ashi, the co-owner of the Charlottesville restaurant), visited our table often, making sure none of us ever went thirsty and clearing dirty plates as our group worked our way through the menu.  While there was some confusion with some drink orders, our group appreciated the option of getting separate checks.  I noticed that Kitty spent the entire night conversing with all the patrons, making sure that they felt right at home during their stay.  The restaurant is relatively small, with a lot of tables densely packed together.  Despite that, the it was not difficult to converse with my table mates.  The open kitchen allowed us to watch our food being prepared.  The restaurant also gets high marks for cleanliness.   Here are some of the highlights of the evening: * The papaya salad and the sun-dried beef appetizers were exceptional.  The papaya salad expertly balanced the slightly tart flavor of the green papaya with the spiciness of red chili, the saltiness of the fish sauce and the bright citrus flavor of the lime juice.  The curing process intensified the beefy richness of the sun-dried beef.   The meat is then deep-fried, but there is enough moisture left in the beef to optimize the interior chewiness - exterior crunchiness quotient.   * The deep-fried tilapia served with garlic chili sauce was another exceptional dish.  Again, the kitchen nailed the texture equation, masterfully balancing the flaky interior with the well-seasoned exterior crust.  Complimenting the fish was a well-composed sauce, perfectly melding the flavors of the garlic and chilies.  * The green curry continued on the theme of balance, masterfully layering the warmth of the curry with the aromatic Thai basil.  It's easily one of the best curries I've had in Madison.  * The delectable drunken noodles (wide rice noodles stir-fried with string beans, bamboo shoots, tomatoes, basil, red peppers, and chili, in a spicy garlic sauce) were also a pleasure to eat.  Things I liked, but not loved: * After the papaya salad set the appetizer bar extremely high, the bland vegetable spring rolls were a disappointment.  While well prepared, they didn't offer that same explosion of flavors provided by our other dishes.  * The same can be said about the Crying Tiger entrée (Marinated flank steak, pan grilled, sliced, and served with a spicy dipping sauce).  After enjoying the intense Asian flavors of the sun-dried beef, this dish paled in comparison.  Since flank steak is toothsome to start with, it really needed to be thinly sliced to help combat the chewiness of this cut of beef.  * Due to the heat of the June evening we visited Monsoon Siam, the beer taps were not working, leaving us with a very limited beer selection.  In the month since my visit, the restaurant now has a full liquor license and now has a comprehensive list of cocktails and wines to enhance the dining experience.  These small flaws did little to rain on our dining parade.  If you are looking for well-executed Asian cuisine using fresh ingredients, Monsoon Siam should be near the top of your list."}
{"text":"Hands down the best best BEST ---delivery was HOT, delicious, and correct as ordered.  The cigar rolls were crispy, not greasy and the dipping sauces were light, infused and beautiful!! The curry was spot on-I can't wait to order this again next time I'm craving some yummy curry..."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a Thai friend of mine. The place is fairly small and they only had one person working the floor on a Sunday. That said, she did an amazing job seating new patrons, taking orders, delivering food to the tables and busing the tables! The menu was good with a decent amount of dishes and the prices were comparable to other Thai restaurants. The food was delicious and made with quality ingredients, was served HOT (temperature wise), and the portions were acceptable. I highly recommend Monsoon Siam!"}
{"text":"We ordered kao soi through Yelp's EatStreet plug-in, and it was exactly what I was hoping for. I'm resisting the urge to go back right now!    The service wasn't terrible: there was confusion about the EatStreet functionality, but we just explained and it was fine. Apparently, they also work through Mr. Delivery, and assumed we were the driving service. In any case, we weren't upcharged for using the form, so I suggest it if you have issues with the phone service."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the thing. Monsoon Siam has become my east side jam. I'm here at least once a week it seems for meetings, solo lunches, take-out, whatever! It's just sort of a perfect place! And the fact that they totally did the outdoors up for Halloween just makes me smile!   Recently I've fallen in love with anything that includes tofu. Not normally a soy fan, I have to say these folks know how to cook it, and they know how to sauce it up so it's plate licking good! The fried tofu is insane, and the lemongrass tofu on the fist page of specials is just plain nuts. Deep fried lemon grass? Yeeeeeassss. I like that lunches come with your choice of soup or salad and a small lil spring roll. It's a good amount of food for around seven bucks, and faster than a speeding bullet. I sat down and placed an order last week and could barely get comfy before my order was up."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in town.  It's authentic according to my friend from Thailand.  My favorites of all time are Pad See Ew and Sukiyaki.  The lady who owns this place is super friendly.  Always enjoy chatting with her about how the food was prepared and the culture behind it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a mid-week work lunch and there was plenty of seating and they were doing a lot of take out business. There is parking in the back behind the building if that might be an issue.  I shared with my lunch date and we had the spring rolls, Tom Yum soup and a beef dish. It was just the right amount for both of us, one of whom was fairly hungry!  I was underwhelmed by the items which were average but not excellent. I was hoping for more flavor in the soup especially as it is a favorite at other places but it was simple (flavor wise, rather than complex) and milky but not in a good way. I would try it again but I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Looks like I might be the only person that doesn't care for this restaurant.  That's cool, but I after my 2 visits, I won't be back.  I found the dinning area to be very small and loud, the service is spotty, and worst of all, I didn't love anything I have ordered.  It's all...ok.  The flavors are nothing special, the portions are small, and I think there have to be better Thai restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place between meetings. When you enter you are greeted by friendly weight staff. I was seated right away. i ordered the Panang Curry with chicken, which is my go-to in Thai restaurants. The portions were large and the food came quickly. The prices are also reasonable. Of the various Thai places i've been too in Madison this curry was the best! (better even than hay long bay - which is where I normally go for Thai - fusion) In fact the curry reminded me of a Thai restaurant that I frequent back in New York. I look forward to coming back to Monsoon Siam again and trying some of their other dishes.  Update: since writing this post I have returned a few times and the food was not as good. I don't know if the chef has changed or the recipes, however the curry has become milder and less flavorful. Don't let the Midwest change you! Let your spicy flag fly!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the InnTower Best Western Plus and ordered take out Pad Thai with Tofu. The delivery was fast.   The Pad Thai was a bit two sweet for me and there wasn't enough peanut and bean sprouts available to mix into the noodles.  The noodles and tofu was excellent. The fried tofu has was fried thinly on the outside with a soft center which how I prefer my fried tofu. The noodle was chewy and a good consistency.    Worth a try if you're looking for delivery options."}
{"text":"Spectacular food. The best papaya salad I've had in the states. Green curry is wonderful as well."}
{"text":"I am really baffled by all of the positive reviews on here. Stopped by recently at dinnertime on a weeknight with my family.  While the staff were courteous, helpful, and service was fairly prompt, that's really about the only positive thing I can say.  The restaurant itself was filthy- surfaces (floors, tables, everything) were sticky. We were seated next to a window and the sill and glass were caked with grime. I was hesitant to even order food, but at that point we were starving so we threw caution to the wind.  The food itself was not necessarily BAD, it was just incredibly bland.  Nothing really had much flavor.  The peas in our fried rice were hard and crunchy, like they'd been re-hydrated, and my noodle dish consisted mostly of just noodles and a few pieces of chicken- there was very little of any of the other ingredients listed on the menu.  With the abundance of good (and clean!) Thai food places in Madison, we will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Immediately shot to my top 5 restaurants in Madison, which is no small feat considering how much I love so many other restaurants in this town. We've been 4 times, each time trying different dishes (6 total), & all have been uniquely delicious, but the massaman curry, squash curry & drunken noodle are truly exceptional. Friendly/quick/attentive service, fresh ingredients, & masterful preparation/presentation. Literally no complaints. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Seems like this place isn't talked about enough. The Pad See Ew, fresh rolls, and spring rolls are amazing. Definitely recommend this place just as much as Ha Long Bay."}
{"text":"I can tolerate bad service in an Asian restaurant, if the food is good.  This was not.  Dry, bland, \"Americanized\" Thai food.  How does a Thai place screw up Pad Thai?  Walking in this place was a mistake we won't make again."}
{"text":"The location is great for pre-shows at the Barrymore or for visiting with Eastsiders and Monona folks.  The space has a nice number of tables.  The food flies out of the kitchen fast.  It seems to be a popular take out place in the neighborhood.    I ordered the papaya salad and the yellow curry with chicken.  The papaya salad was fresh and was just spicy enough for me.  The curry had potatoes, onions, and chicken in a rich curry sauce.  I don't know if the potatoes weren't seasoned when par cooked or if they were just bland but it brought the curry down from a 4-5 star dinner to a three.  The spice level in the curry was good and the chicken was well cooked.  I was able to fix the flavor in my left overs.  My friend had the fresh roll and I took a bite.  It has a nice fresh taste.  I would add cilantro for a extra layer of flavor.  Her Pineapple Fried Rice was good.  But she found the tofu lacking seasoning.  I would like to try this spot again on another night as their special dinner menu sounded very good."}
{"text":"I only gave this place a 4 because I have never actually dinned in. The food is sooo good. I have done take out a couple of times and constantly crave the green curry. It's actually spicy too. As someone who grew up on Thai food, it is very hard to find places where 'spicy' is actually spicy. Would recommend on food alone!"}
{"text":"Small venue with huge taste! 2000 miles from my favorite home Thai food and found a GEM! Food is fantastic, staff is great and wait (if any) is worth it!"}
{"text":"This is not Thai Food. I would characterize it as Asian Fusion. The fresh rolls were put together well, but the \"peanut sauce\" seemed to have Soy Sauce in it. Chinese cabbage, carrot slices, and one broccoli floret was contained in the small order of steamed veggies. The Chicken Cashew was not Thai and again there was more Chinese cabbage, cooked in some sort of Chinese sauce(?) Not sure what it was. On a small note, they forgot the water. Thanks for delivering the food on-time in proper containers, neatly packed."}
{"text":"Very solid, quick take out Thai food. Go for the lunch special: it's really affordable and you get a lot of food for your money. The woman that runs the place is a bit brusque, but it works for her. I personally think it's way better than Lao Laan Xang."}
{"text":"Excellent everything - including the service!  Seriously, you won't be disappointed.  Stopped here while in Madison for business."}
{"text":"I went to Monsoon Siam with the Madison Review Crew meetup group with the intention of writing a review.  Then, a day before, a member of the group writes that he can't come,  but is looking forward to hearing if it is indeed of authentic Thai quality,  since he is Thai,  and he cooks traditional foods here at home.  So.  Is Monsoon Siam authentic Thai?  Is it Thai traditional, fresh, authentic, vivid?  I have no idea!   It could be authentic Serbo-Croatian for all I know - - I have never been to Thailand - - but whatever it is, they should not change ANYTHING,  because this is splendid cuisine.  The presentation - - just the very looks of the meal?   You will be tempted to let it sit getting cold on the plate for 45 minutes,  staring at it,  just because it LOOKS so gorgeous.   If you were really small, or got down really low to the table, and looked at them, it would be like going to Disneyland for the first time - - it would be that colorful and fantastical.  And same with the flavors.   The three dishes we got - - one was big, broad, flat, floppy noodles that were sublime delicious (with just a touch of sweetness);  another was crispy squid done up luscious with smatterings of fresh herbs and veggie touches, and you just wish that the dish was big as a house, instead of just a regular portion, because you could eat it nonstop for a month;  the last was minced chicken with spices in a thin flaky-formed shell that was super hot but unlike anything else anywhere.   All three dishes were electrifyingly interesting, pretty, and delicious.   And did I mention the cigar roll appetizer?  No, I did not yet mention the cigar roll appetizer.  It was like egg rolls, but actually FUN.  The texture was the thing - - it made life more interesting and alive, just sharing one of the three cigar rolls in this appetizer.  When was the last time you could say that about an egg roll?  Service was great, because these were (also) real people, enjoying themselves, and being themselves, and loving what they were doing.  (BTW:  the company was great too!)"}
{"text":"This is nice little Thai restaurant. Unlike many of the Southeast Asian restaurants in the area, it's not a fusion type restaurant, but we wanted a true Thai restaurant so that was a good thing. We had the fresh wraps, Tom yum soup, River monster, and lemongrass tofu. All dishes were good...and a little different than what we were expecting. The fresh wraps had avocado, which is an unusual Thai food ingredient, but it worked. The River monster was deep fried whole tilapia with a sweet fish sauce, basil, cilantro, and red onions. The fish was cooked perfectly, but I would've liked a little more sauce. The lemongrass tofu had a stronger tamarind than lemongrass flavor, but it was still pretty tasty. Overall, very satisfying."}
{"text":"Hello Hello hello.... A new Thai restaurant in town! How ecstatic I was upon hearing this good news from my Thai friend who recommended this place to me almost a month ago: \"Try it, Nelly! You'll love it. I can say the food is authentic.\" I had no doubt about her suggestion, the only thing stopped me from coming earlier to this place was my schedule! It sucked! Weeks after that, Yelp brought my attention that we have a new Thai restaurant in town. I was surprised that Yelpers have reviewed it. Wow. So quick. Reading one of the elites' reviews, I couldn't hold it any longer: I had to give this place a try.  It was yesterday, after a long day and Madison was still raining, hubby and I drove to the east part of Madison. While we're familiar with the area, we happened to miss it. It's smaller compared to other Thai restaurant in town. We passed it so we had to make a turn to be finally able to find it! We parked at the back of the building- very convenient.  We ordered the sun-dried beef, which was GOOD. It reminded me of an Indonesian dish which is very similar. My tongue can recognize the taste right away.  As the main dishes, we ordered chicken green curry and drunken noodles. We were happy! The sticky rice and mango was another goodie. It was coming in a decent portion- not too big, but the taste had it all!  Try their hot Thai too! It comes in a big pot and tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"Incredible. The roast and fried tofu was the best tofu I've ever had. It was better than meat. All three of us cleared out plates completely. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff! We had the papaya salad and mussumun, both were great. The fried papaya appetizer was really interesting."}
{"text":"Just had so add if I haven't said this before: Best. Seitan. Ever. I believe any item referring to \"roasted tofu\" will involve it. Last check-in involved a party of five, and the selections ran from vegan to seafood. The cross-talk on the table diminished as we ate, and I certainly enjoyed my shared bites and friends happy to share their chunks of Serrano chiles with me. Another restaurant that I would be happy to be in any day or time."}
{"text":"Okay.. What took me so long to try this place out?  I've been on a Thai kick lately and was craving some curry. There aren't any Thai places near my work, so I decided I would order something for takeout and make the trek over to where ever I needed to go.   I was just at Ha Long Bay the other day, and I wanted to make a point to try something NEW, so after browsing reviews and relative drive time, this is what I decided to go with.   It was a good choice.   I got an order of the Fresh Rolls from the appetizer menu. These little buggers were tasty. But really, it was the Tamarind peanut sauce that stole the show. YUM. I could probably put that on just about anything.   I ordered the Panang Curry from the lunch menu. Although a \"lunch\" portion, it was still too much to finish. Good deal there. I got it mild. It was the perfect amount of sweet and spice for me. I don't really like spicy things, so I was super happy when I took my first bite and found that there was still some heat in there, but not so much that I would not enjoy the meal. They offer the dish with no spice, but the spice is critical for the overall flavor. And, that being said, the overall flavor was YUMMY! It was really good. Definitely recommend.   My meal came with a little baby-sized veggie egg roll. It was good. Really greasy though!   I also ordered a Thai tea - You'll notice there is no photo of it. That sucker didn't stand a chance. Didn't even get back to the office before I had it finished. It's like liquid candy deliciousness. They do it well here, lots of flavor.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I had ordered the Chicken Ka Pow and felt it had a great balance in sweet and spice you get in Asian cooking. Normally when dealing with Asian cooking the sweetness overpowers the spice and tends to ruin the flavor. Their chicken and egg fried rice were also really good. They were well made and presented but for me seemed to lack something."}
{"text":"We went here a couple weekends ago for dinner.  IT WAS EXCELLENT! Followed Matt W's suggestions.  We had the papaya salad, and the sun dried beef for our appetizers.  Man, were they good! For our entree's, we had the Drunken Noodles w/chicken, and the River Monster.  I loved both, hubby said he would of rather had another order or two of the sun-dried beef. We will definitely be returning!  I'm thinking the Tofu Angel next time....."}
{"text":"Way back in the 20th century, when Thai food had just made it to the West Coast, I used to eat lunch at a Thai place near the Space Needle in Seattle. They served a Thai seafood noodle soup, a pungent fermented tofu base, electric pink broth with watercress, rice noodles and a whole bunch of squid, shrimp, fish balls and mushrooms. On cold rainy winter Seattle days, this bowl of rich satisfying goodness, called Yen Ta Fo, hit the spot.  Over the decades, in the many towns I've lived, I always ask for it and am usually told that Americans wouldn't like it, it's only for Thai people. Occasionally I would find it, always a bit different. Spinach for watercress, different mushrooms, once it even had tomatoes in it!  I'm a regular at Monsoon Siam. They are really the only Thai place in Madison that even comes close to good Thai flavors and ingredients. Imagine my surprise when, noticing a seafood noodle soup on the specials board, I asked if it was Yen Ta Fo and was told, \"No, but we make Yen Ta Fo. It's not on the menu but we make it!\". How could I not know that???  Well, they did, I ate it, it was good and I'll go back and have it again and again.   They said they make all sorts of stuff that's not on the menu so, if you have a hankering for some special Thai dish, ask for it, you may be surprised!!"}
