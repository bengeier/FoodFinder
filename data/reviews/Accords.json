{"text":"It was my second time dining at Accords.  My initial draw to the restaurant was that they were able to accommodate wheat/gluten allergies (I have celiac disease), and they have items very clearly listed on their menu that do not contain gluten. But what drew me to the restaurant again was the welcoming atmosphere, attentive--but not overbearing--service, and creative but unpretentious cuisine. Instead of ordering off the à la carte menu on this visit, we opted for the chef's tasting menu + wine pairings.  I'd strongly recommend doing the tasting menu. We were treated to four, perfectly-sized courses and wine pairings that just got better and better as the evening went on.  The meal began with braised baby Boston lettuce with duck fat potatoes in a leek cream sauce, paired with Champagne.  (A delicious pairing of a homey dish with a luxurious wine.)  Next, was Gravlax served with baby button mushrooms and herbed mustard butter, which was paired with a subtle red that was really bursting with cherry notes.  (It paired surprisingly well with the delicious salmon.)  Then, came a delicate poached cod with 3 types of broccoli (roasted, pureed, and blanched) and a flavorful razor clam sauce.  It was perfectly paired with an oaky white wine.  And finally, my favorite dish of the night: a seared hanger steak served with black currant compote and roasted endive in rich chicken stock.  The meat was so tender and perfectly done (a little pink inside, perfectly seared on the outside), and the compote provided this sweet and tangy counterpoint to the richness of the meat and stock.  It was paired with a big, bold red that had lots of fruit.  A truly inspired \"big finish\" to a great meal. Also, the pacing was perfect.  The servers did a great job explaining the pairings and dishes and had a knack for knowing when to check in and when to let us nosh. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"come here for a good night with friends and chances are you're going to enjoy yourself.  i enjoyed the wine cellar atmosphere and they did these funky things with edison bulbs and lab beakers and flasks.  we were only in for drinks and wanted to get a good sampling, so we asked the sommelier to build us a flight and after a little dialog we had an array of 10 glasses with 2 oz tastings each, and the line up was even prepared moving from lighter to more complex. paired with a dish of sweet bread we were more than happy with our experience. good with with great service.   Asking for more may just be asking too much."}
{"text":"C'est un restaurant que je vais retourner de temps en temps. Oui, c'est dispendieux, mais bon, c'est une expérience. Je vais dépenser plus pour un billet de hockey. ;-)  Pouvoir boire de l'excellent vin au verre, différent à chaque plat, ça coûte pas mal plus cher quand on le fait dans un resto. Sinon, l'alternative c'est de se contenter d'une bouteille. Mais combien de fois on va prendre une bouteille dans un repas mais que le vin va bien avec un plat mais pas avec l'autre? Ça arrive trop souvent. Pas chez Accords.  Chaque plat te suggère un verre de vin en accord typique avec le plat, et un plat en accord non typique (en désaccord).   La nourriture est excellente. Les huitres en entrée sont superbes. Je vous conseille de prendre un verre de scotch en apéro, un Lagavulin 16 ans, et mettre un peu de scotch dans chaque huitre, c'est superbe.   Les entrées sont succulentes. Le rack de bison est débile. La cocotte de saucisse se liche jusqu'à la dernière goutte. La poitrine de pintade est tendre et juteuse.   Côté ambiance, c'est très beau, très élégant. Un peu trop éclairé à mon goût, mais juste un petit peu. J'aime quand c'est moins lumineux, mais ça c'est personnel.  Bien entendu la sélection de vin est débile mentale, mais il y a un bar complet. Quelques scotchs, mais pas assez. ;-)   C'est un restaurant qu'on se paye une fois par année. ;-)"}
{"text":"Oh joy! Oh joy! Diners and gastronomical enthusiasts everywhere - rejoice!  I have found a French restaurant that will put fire in your belly, contentment in your heart, and bliss in your palate- a restaurant to exceed all others.  Hyperbole? Wait until you savor their pork belly with mussels and devour their baba bourbon. If tHeir beef tartare does not make you weep with joy, then surely their blood sausage \"boudin\" will elevate you to another world.  Be warn.  Their heavily Gaelic inspired cuisine is not for the economically faint of heart.  You will have to shell out big bucks for this sensorial immersion event.  But then again, what is money when your palate has just experience a transcendental event like what I went through today.  Enough said.  Tis time for thee to make a reservation."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a wine bar, this is it. Great selection and extensive options. I remember the server saying that this bar has the largest amount of wine selections in the country. The service was a great and knowledgable. Also ask about their cheese plate, they don't have it on the menu but is available!!"}
{"text":"Cadre fort sympathique, assiette de charcuterie à tomber, pieuvre grillé excellente, tout comme la mousse de chocolat blanc. Petite deception sur le fondant au chocolat qui n'avait rien de fondant. Les accords de vin proposés par le sommelier étaient parfait. Service à la hauteur."}
{"text":"Accors est un bar à vins principalement, je vous conseille de prendre un bon vin (ou plusieurs!) avec un plateau de fromages vous ne serez pas déçus!  Puis le restaurant semble délicieux aussi avec des menus gastronomiques alléchants!"}
{"text":"I just finished dinner here and I can tell you that it is a wonderful place. I ate at the bar as I was by my self on business and the lovely lady at the bar took care of me like I was at her house. I had the cheese platter and then octopus and a wonderful pumpkin flan. Everything was paired to a wonderful glass of wine. You must give this place a try. And to the staff, merci for a great night. I will be back when I return to Montreal."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here after walking thru Old Montreal for the day and scoping out the other restaurants.  It was raining so we couldn't sit on the patio.  We decided to wait and sit at the bar until the weather cleared up.  The entire staff took the time converse with us for the half hour wait.  The host was very welcoming and explained the menu to us.  We decided to do the five course with wine pairing off the menu.  Three of the courses were a fish or seafood dish.  I'm not a fan of these foods but I was pleasantly surprise how good the dishes were.  The wine with each course was spot on.  The last course was dessert and I think it was the best dessert I ever had."}
{"text":"Quel bel endroit!   Une ambiance calme (peut-être plus occupée certains soirs, mais en début de semaine c'est parfait pour un souper en amoureux).  Pourquoi on y va? Pour tout: service impeccable, plats mémorables et très grand choix de vin.  C'est un bar à vin... Évidemment, le restaurant propose une carte des vins bien remplie. Des bouteilles prestigieuses sont exposés sur un des murs du restaurant. Le plus plaisant? L'expertise des serveurs à l'aise de répondre à toutes nos questions.  Les plats... Wow tout simplement! Savoureux et si bien présentés! (Mention spéciale pour le tartare de canard servi avec foie gras et figues: un délice!)   De plus, on nous a offert des digestifs à la fin de notre repas! Pourquoi? Aucune idée... mais ça a rehaussé encore plus le bonheur de la soirée."}
{"text":"We held a large event here and were extremely impressed with the beautiful setting, quality of the food, and relaxed atmosphere. Jean Martin was very attentive both in the planning stages and on the day of. I highly recommend Accords for both larger business lunches/dinners, as well as smaller, more intimate gatherings."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this lovely restaurant last night and had the most wonderful meal.  We sat at the bar and we're waited on by William, who was so knowledgeable about wines & guided us through some beautiful wine selections.  The oysters were fresh & sweet, the salmon entree was cooked to perfection, the fresh tomato salad was a perfect mixture of tart and sweet.  We lingered and made this a dining experience.  Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great setting for a nondescript outside. The outdoor seating (tucked away in a courtyard) is beautiful. Wanted to try everything on the menu as it all looked good and not what you would expectl. Also a great place to just get a bottle of wine and a local cheese board (plus the delicious homemade bread!)"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for a place to eat in Old Montreal.  As soon as I saw the cute outdoor seating, I knew this was the place!  The decor is absolutely beautiful, outdoor seating with wrought iron railings, plants and beautiful ambient lighting.  The food was delicious!  We had beef tongue to start and the steak and duck for entrees.  Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  For desert we had the macarons which were on the smaller side but still very tasty.  Overall, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience at Accords when I visited Montreal this summer. Our concierge at the Marriott Chateau Champlain recommended this place saying it wasn't too expensive (after going all out at Au Pied de Cochon the previous evening, I was looking to give my credit card a break) and mentioned the wine pairings, and my lady and I were in. When I checked the menu beforehand I was surprised at her definition of \"not too expensive,\" but I have no issues shelling out $ for good food.   As a price measure we skipped apps and started with mains as wine pairings (as others have noted each dish is paired with an accord - classic wine combination, and a discord - a pairing that still works, but its a little funky, meant to get your taste buds working). I would recommend getting half glasses of both the accord and discord (I actually preferred my discord with my fish). The lady got the Surf & Turf, lobster, lobster stuffed pasta and seared sweetbreads (she liked the sweetbreads until I told her what they were [mistake!]). I got the Pomo Dore, seared pike w/ tomatoes, clams and mozzarella.    Both dishes were beautifully presented and perfectly composed. The broth in my fish was superb, and the wine pairings really brought my food to a new level. I must admit, though I dine out quite often, I was never much for wine pairings, thinking concept a bit contrived. After Accords, I'm on board.  At the (excellent) recommendation of our waiter we shared the San Domingo Dingo, a chocolate and cherries dessert w/ black forest ice cream that was expertly paired (thanks again, mr. waiter) with a delicious dessert wine. All in all, a great experience. Fresh food, clean flavors, pretty plates and good service. Ambiance on the outside terrace was relaxing, romantic and not too pretentious. A great date night/white tablecloth place in Montreal to counter funkier spots like Garde Manager and Au Pied Cochon."}
{"text":"My friend and I are in Montreal for the weekend and we picked this place because it had good Yelp reviews and we could get a reservation on Opentable. When we arrived, the entire restaurant was completely empty - that should've he been our first clue.  Our next clue should've been when the bread arrived...still frozen in the center. We asked our server for new bread, and he abashedly took away the offending bread and brought us a new loaf that was cold, but not frozen.  Then, we ordered. I don't eat any pork, so I asked if the guinea fowl dish could be made without any lard, and the server assured me that he could do that. Shortly after, he returned and told me that the guinea fowl is actually baked with lard under the skin, so they couldn't make it totally pork-free. I changed my order to the squash dish - which my friend had also ordered, and added a half-pour of the wine they recommended to accompany the dish. The wine was delicious - and the source of the second star - with the squash dish, and while the squash was tasty, it got boring quickly.   The server was not particularly attentive, which was weird since we were literally the only people eating there, and I felt kind of uncomfortable not speaking French. Then, without asking us if we wanted dessert, handed us dessert menus and wandered away for five minutes.  I live in a suburb of New York and attend school in Cleveland, so I'm used to New York-quality food at New York prices and Cleveland-quality food at Cleveland-prices, but this was Cleveland-quality food at New York prices."}
{"text":"We were expecting to find great food in Montreal, and this place met every expectation.  The cellar atmosphere was comfortable and fun, the service was friendly and attentive, and the food was fabulous.  Among us, we had deer, cod, sausage, mushroom ravioli, smoked trout, goat cheesecake, and rhubarb sorbet, and it was all imaginatively wonderful.  The wine pairings were excellent, too.  Given the quality of the dinner, it was a huge value, as well. We ordered drinks, appetizers, wine and dessert for three and barely broke $200."}
{"text":"The boify picked this place for us to relax during our Montreal trip - from a guidebook, no less! Awesome choice, boif ;)  We arrived around 5pm on a Saturday and we were the only patrons. Since the place is pretty booked for dinner, they let us know that we could only stay for 2 hours, which was fine for us as we were just stopping by for some vino. The indoors is decked out in cork/wood and I felt like I was inside a wine barrel! The outdoor seating is so intimate and relaxing...absolutely perfect!  We asked the sommelier to help us choose a refreshing, not too fruity, white wine within $30-40. His choice was good - albeit  little dry and tart - & affordable. We had a lovely time there just soaking in all of Montreal's beauty. When we left, the outdoor area began filling up with dinner patrons...must be a popular place!  Oh, we heard the manager of the restaurant giving the entire waitstaff a little pep talk before the dinner rush - so cute! ;D"}
{"text":"Such a cute quiet spot with tons of options for wine. We stumbled upon Accords while coming from dinner in the area and were drawn in by the adorable looking outdoor patio area. It was closed for winter, but the inside is equally adorable. It was very quiet on a Thursday evening which is appropriate for the ambiance of the restaurant.   We didn't get a chance to look at the food menu, but the service was excellent and wine was great. Our bartender was extremely knowledgeable about the selection. We tried a variety and enjoyed talking to the bartender about his wine experience and knowledge. I can't wait to visit again and try Accords again in the warmer months!"}
{"text":"After returning late from QC, staff at our Hotel Le Place D'Armes suggested a wine bar and small plates restaurant around the corner but by an incorrect name. We stumbled upon Accords quite by accident and what a wonderful surprise it was! The team from chef, sommelier, and wait staff are superb. For the best experience, select the menu carte blanche paired with the wine selections. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The place may serve its purpose for some - it's upscale and refined and offers an interesting journey for a discerning oenophile, but that journey will cost you a pretty penny.    The food was underwhelming and the restaurant cold, so despite the good but expensive wine it was rather a let down.  I did not love the buffalo, it was too gamey and my husband's fish dish was miniscule, it looked like an appetizer and did not come with any sides, he left hungry.    All in all we were unsatisfied with the dinner and proceeded to find another venue to to dine immediately afterwards."}
{"text":"This was our favorite restaurant (of 4 we visited) in Montreal.  As others have noted, the menu emphasizes local Quebecois ingredients with contemporary French technique and lots of creative farm to table choices.  There's a small but well curated list of wines by the glass (my husband barely drinks, so I can't comment on bottles). The location in Old Town is convenient to many hotels and sights, but the restaurant itself is on a quiet street, and the outdoor terrace, tucked behind an iron gate, is a very sweet place to sit.  I was puzzled by the complaints about service--we visited early-ish on a Friday night, so things were not too crowded, and we had consistently excellent, friendly, attentive service.  The woman who took our orders may have been the sommelier--she was very knowledgeable about the wine list and recommended a pairing that was fantastic, just right for everything we ordered. I can't emphasize this enough, in response to the other comments: At least when we visited, SERVICE WAS THE BEST WE ENCOUNTERED IN MONTREAL, FROM THE START TO THE FINISH OF OUR MEAL. And this in a town where restaurant servers seem, on the whole, to be a pretty professional bunch.  We ordered four dishes: a cheese plate with two local cheeses that were terrific, a generous green salad that we easily shared, sweetbreads in a coffee-based sauce, and the house-made agnoletti wth guinea hen confit.  All were fantastic.  I consider sweetbreads to be a true test of a kitchen's abilities: they are delicious when well prepared but an obvious disaster if the chef cuts corners on the prep or doesn't know what s/he is doing. These were spot-on.  Ditto the housemade pasta, with a light but creamy sauce and that fantastic confit guinea hen. Portions are closer to the tapas end of things, but given their richness and flavor (and the crazy super-sizing of meals at some other Montreal places we visited), that was fine with us.    We ordered two desserts: a plate centered on a delicious, deeply flavored rhubarb semifreddo, and another featuring white chocolate, lime and sesame.  The latter was a little subdued for my husband's taste; more acidic notes would have livened things up a bit, but it was still delicious, just subtle.   Highly recommended.  I think this place deserves another look, and would be willing to bet they have taken Yelpers' service complaints to heart.  This is great food, fairly priced, with a terrific front of the house staff."}
{"text":"FOOD IS FIVE STARS! Come for the food and consider the wine a bonus; let's hope they improve the service.  In detail:  I was incredibly disappointed in the food and drink scene in Montreal, which seems to be trying to be a foodie town and charging ridiculous prices for it. I come from the San Francisco Bay Area, where Michelin-starred restaurants are QUITE a bit more affordable, and our sales tax is only 10% and not 15%...for such expensive excursions I wanted to be in culinary wet panties land. So so SO didn't happen here (and I flat-out refuse to pay more than $27 for an entree--I eat only fish + vegetarian).  Accords WAS AMAZING. VERY farm-to-table oriented with a creative menu that rotates with the seasons and farms. Everything well presented. Had I been in Montreal one more day or week I'd have returned at least once to experience more of its offerings (LOTS of delicious seafood options, as well as veg too) and get some quality.  The ambiance is lovely--woody, subterranean, atmospheric, very quiet on the night I went. Would be nice to avoid the rowdy and touristy bar crowds.  My one complaint is the service. Normally I would actually knock off a star for this but I wanted to keep the 5-star rating to praise the food. It was almost empty when I went, and three different servers could have helped me get water/acknowledgment/order taking sooner, but it took foreeeeever, especially due to how empty the place was. I was parched and should not have waited for water AND a menu AND getting my order taken when people who arrived after me were attended to sooner.  I was very insulted by that, and if I come back and it happens again the rating will be adjusted. But OH the wonderful FOOD! And nice wine selection too."}
{"text":"Had an outstanding business dinner experience.  Had a salad to start, the halibut entree, and the Fidel's Choice for dessert (no idea why they called it that, but it was great.  Perhaps the Chef is named Fidel - dunno).  We sat on the \"patio\" - really the alley which is actually really nice.  Beautiful stone walls, nicely lit, had great weather.  Service was awesome.  Our group had a French pinot noir and a pinot blanc which were both really nice.  Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time...  I spotted the charming stone courtyard from the street, humming with the chatter of patrons beneath the vines and I immediately looked at the menu. Moments later, I found myself in said courtyard, greeted by friendly hosts and waitstaff. I ordered the grilled octopus appetizer with cucumber, fennel, yogurt, and lime. When the dish arrived I was so pleased, not only with the presentation but with the large pieces of octopus (definitely not grilled baby octopus, which is pretty much all I've had as of recent). It was one of the most amazing dishes I think I have ever tasted. The fennel and cucumber worked so nicely together against the grilled meat...and the citrus of the lime plus the cool yogurt only added to the experience. I then moved onto my main entree, for which i ordered the Quebec mackerel with gherkins, cucumber, wild garlic, and fresh dill. This was also amazing and I savored every bite. I especially loved the unexpected use of gherkins, contrasted against the fresh dill and cucumber which was like a deconstructed pickle.   Overall, the experience was fantastic. I tried the desaccord pairing and had a very nice glass of rose with my appetizer and the Barbera Piemonte with my main. I was absolutely enamored with how fresh all of the ingredients were.   I would highly recommend this spot to anyone."}
{"text":"Une surprise comme on les aime. Nous avons choisi ce restaurant sur les simples avis Yelp. Nous n'avons vraiment pas été déçus !  Nous pensions prendre un plat chacun avec un verre de vin. Il s'avère que les plats sont en fait de taille \"entrée\" et que n'en prendre qu'un allait être juste.   Nous avons donc décidé de nous orienter sur le menu à 45$ composé de quatre plats, avec le supplément \"accords\" d'un verre de vin par plat pour 30$ supplémentaires. Très bon choix ! Le nom du restaurant prend tout son sens à ce moment là.   Le sommelier était vraiment passionnant à écouter, bien qu'après le troisième verre (bien chargés) nous n'étions plus vraiment attentifs ...   Les plats du menu sont inconnus, c'était une surprise ! N'hésitez donc pas à signaler toute allergie ;-)  La cuisine était vraiment excellente, fraîche et raffinée. Je n'avais pas envie de faire de grand dîner ce soir là, j'ai regretté de ne pas être venu plus tôt.   Toute l'équipe est très serviable et souriante, l'ambiance est douce et idéale pour un souper romantique en tête à tête !   Vous ne regretterez absolument pas votre soirée, et même si cela peut paraître un budget important, il en vaut vraiment le coup.   Foncez !"}
{"text":"Amazing wine bar. The sommelier here was fantastic. The service was superb and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a good glass of wine or two or maybe the whole bottle."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING was perfect, from the food (we had the tasting menu) to the wine (pairing wines) and the staff was extremely nice and professional. The outdoor dining area is pretty and cosy. We had a wonderful experience of Montreal's food scenery! Thanks to our friends living in Montreal who brought us there ;o)"}
{"text":"We went here for their excellent wine selection and weren't disappointed. If you love French food, you'll love their ox tail offerings. The decor here tells you they are serious about their wines, wooden cabinets full of wine. The menu has a rouge priced at $700! Excellent place for a date but be sure to review the menu beforehand unless you're accustomed to eating French food."}
{"text":"This was by far our best dining experience in Montreal. We chose the wine and food pairing and it was out of the world. The wine pairings were perfect and the staff were incredibly kind and knowledgeable about the food and the wine. I tried some foods I normally would not have and loved every bite. If you have time you have to eat here. Safe some time, we were there a couple hours but it was worth it. Everything was paced perfectly and each course was delicious  And again I can't say enough about the staff. Welcoming and wonderful"}
{"text":"If you enjoy an elegant, well executed, unique meal- look no further. Excellent presentation and service. Food was exquisite, perfectly cooked. Mind blown. I had a scallop and bone marrow dish off their new menu."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. I love the old stone walls. Feels like I'm dinning in a wine cellar. Staff are knowledgeable, food is exquisite, and wine selection is incredible.   I love this place & always stop by whenever I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Staff was attentive and excellent The food was interesting and good The wine was fab. The manager came over and discussed the types of wines we like his recommendations were spot on. Pre game and post game here"}
{"text":"This was my last stop in Montreal, I was looking for something upscale but low key and I found  it at Accords.  I walked in with no reservations, but for a Monday night I did not think I needed it and I was correct.  I was offered to dine inside or outside in the patio, I chose the outside option as the weather was nice.  To begin I ordered the  mozzarella bufala from Quebec with tomatoes.  The tomatoes were delicious, however I was a little disappointed with the amount of mozzarella.  I also had the fish tartar and grilled octopus.  Fish tartar was good, however not exactly what I had in mind.  The grilled octopus in the other hand was really good.  I ordered pasta of the day, which had a nice creamy sauce and prosciutto.  Overall is a good place to have dinner, very reasonable prices considering the ambiance the extensive wine choices and very good food."}
{"text":"Very extensive wine list with knowledgable staff. The service was great. We shared some small plates. The ambiance was very nice."}
{"text":"Nous avions réservé une table pour 3 personnes pour un lunch entre collègues. Nous avions précisé que nous souhaitions avoir une table sous l'alcôve. À notre arrivée, ces tables étaient prises. Ils ont admis ne pas avoir lu la note spécifiant la table demandée. Peu importe, nous nous sommes attablées ailleurs. Nous avons commandé le menu midi, pour 27$, accompagné d'un verre de vin à 14$. Bref, un repas un peu plus dispendieux qu'à l'habitude mais c'était vendredi... on se gâte. Nous recevons nos entrées, nous mangeons tranquillement. Nous voyons, sous la table, une souris. On se lève, sans crier. On avise le maître d'hôtel de la situation. Ce dernier s'adresse à nous de façon excessivement irrité. Il nous indique que l'exterminateur ne peut venir à ce moment. Il nous demande ce qu'on souhaite faire avec les plats. Nous avons quitté. La réaction du maître d'hôtel a été impolie, maladroite, et sans aucun respect pour le client."}
{"text":"Being from wine country in Northern California, we chose Accords for the food/wine pairings.  It was an outstanding experience.  Everything was first-rate: the food, the wine, the service and the ambiance. My boyfriend and I were seated at a quiet table at the back of the very romantic restaurant where we could observe the activity of the restaurant but had some quiet and privacy.    We decided to order as we went along, rather than order everything upfront, as we usually do.  The wait staff was perfectly ok with that.  We started with the cheese plate, for which the menu did not suggest a wine pairing, so we asked our server, Caroline, for suggestions.  She recommended a white and a red so we ordered a glass of each.  The wines on their own weren't our favorite, and not wines we would have enjoyed sipping on their own.  But when the cheese plate arrived, the wines were perfect with all three cheeses.  Caroline's suggestions were spot-on.  The cheeses, especially the blue, we're wonderful, and very generous portions.   We then ordered the rabbit sausage and pork ribs appetizers, both of which were outstanding.  We got the paired wine with each, and asked Caroline for a suggestion for a second glass of wine with each dish. So we had four wines with the two appetizers, and they were all paired perfectly with the food.    We finished with two desserts, both of which were superb and very creative. One was a butternut squash combination (a seemingly odd ingredient for dessert, but the pastry chef worked magic with it), and a variation on a deconstructed tiramisu.  Some of the best desserts I've ever had.  And of course Caroline paired them with the perfect dessert wines.  I would highly recommend Accords to anyone who enjoys creative, perfectly prepared and presented food, and appreciates the perfectly paired wine, where the overall combination is one where both food and wine are enhanced by the other.  The service is friendly but refined, attentive, and not rushed. The wait staff clearly know their wines.  All in all, a truly memorable meal."}
{"text":"Pairing food & alcohol is always a fun dining experience for me. While visiting Montreal, I wanted to take my mum to a restaurant that was a little more quirky than a regular eatery.   We shared 2 plates of oysters, paired with a glass of bubbly. Then we shared the \"Crunchy Smokey\", along with a glass of wine they paired with the dish.   The oysters were small & well cleaned. Big oysters make me gag, so does a rouge piece of shell. They were served on salt, with a lemon wedge, but with no side. Had to ask for hot sauce. Granted, the oysters themselves had a wonderful flavor, but I do like a hint of something on my oysters. The glass that the bubbly was served in was kinda neat. The bubbles streamed up in the glass in one solid stream. It was nifty.   The \"Crunchy Smokey\" was interesting. It was paired with a glass of IGT Sicilla, Grillo 2011, Italie. We started by tasting the wine before the meal, and it completely transformed with the food. Crunchy Smokey was good, but not fantastic. It was a fairly earthy dish, that tasted pretty good when you combined all the ingredients together. I'm not sure if I should say it was bland... there were flavors that stood out, but nothing that really popped. Kinda one note. Didn't really excite my pallet.  I would have ordered something else on the menu, but I was sharing my meal with my mother, who only eats fish.   The setting was lovely. Rustic, dark & underground. A take on a wine cellar. The woman's washroom had a lovely art installment of a mirror that also had moss within it. Very unique.   Overall, I don't believe it was worth the price we paid. I understand that the wine's are of a higher caliber, but for how much we ate & drank, it was a very expensive dinner. Not entirely sure I would suggest it, maybe if you're with someone who's willing to foot at 300+ bill."}
{"text":"Well it was our first night in Montreal and the service was great but the food wasn't amazing as we would hope  Wine is really expensive.  I'll give it a five star for atmosphere and location."}
{"text":"Incredible resto... The place is very nice and great atmosphere. The service was PARFAIT. Everybody was incredible.   The food? Amazing and great choice... And the wine selections? Just phenomenal."}
{"text":"This wine bar / restaurant was recommended by a local friend, but we had a very bad experience. Summary: Excellent food, decent wine, poor service.   My wife and I were seated with menus - and no wine list. At a wine bar. We had to ask for the wine list twice and the waiter, who seemed overwhelmed with everything, said something about having trouble finding one -- at a wine bar.   Service was slow and inattentive. After finally getting some wine and ordering some cheeses to start, we ordered four small plates and asked them to be brought out two at a time. We had already been there an hour before we finally got the busy waiter to take our order beyond cheese.   Things were taking too long (we had budgeted two hours for wine and food before a concert) and the first small plates were taking too long, we asked to cancel the last two. They tried bringing all four at the same time even though the table wouldn't have been big enough.   The place was hardly full at 8 pm yet the waiter and apparently the kitchen seemed overwhelmed. Again, food was excellent and creative - once we actually got it."}
{"text":"The hotel staff raved about this place saying it was not too expensive and was French food with Quebecois uniqueness.  It is located in old Montreal and although the reviews raved.. I thought it was just d'accord.  The place is posh.. and the wait staff reflects that.  They had a snobby air about them where they seem like they are mad at you if you don't want to order a whole bunch of wine.  Tried the crab appetizer since all the other appetizers that we wanted were out.  It was good.. no way was it worth $18.  Then we each had one of the main courses.  He had the pig.. unfortunately, it was so saucy.. covered up the real taste of the food.  I had one of the stews.. bone marrow.. no sauce at all.. opposite dishes.  The redeeming part of the meal was dessert.  We got some sort of cream that was good and served in a mason jar.    Didn't thank us.. didn't even say bye.  I think I could go somewhere else.. the food isn't all that."}
{"text":"Some colleagues and I had supper tonight at Accords last night.  It was really nice inside.  I debated about whether to order the Smoked Paprika Guinea Breast or the Beef Shoulder.  Our server suggested the beef so that's what a lot of us got.  I swapped the beets for potato.  We all found the beef chewy, kind of tough and tasteless ... a couple didn't eat theirs and sent them back.  I ate a bit of mine and passed the rest around for others to try.  When we commented about it to the manager, she tried some and said that she found it was tender like butter (!!??).  My colleague next to me had the guinea breast and I tried a bit ... it was delicious!  I should have gone with my first instinct.  When we got back to our hotel afterwards, we had a drink in the bar and ordered snacks."}
{"text":"Wanted some French food, and this is where we ended up based on a local's recommendation. Decor was sexy and lowly lit. We were seated immediately. We ordered, and waited a while, then asked for a bread basket. Why didn't this come out automatically?   Ordered: Veal rib - they didn't ask us how we liked it, so it ended up coming out very rare, not to our liking. The salad it came with was way too oily.  Duck - too chewy, even for duck. Otherwise, decent.  Malbec - why did they fill up not even a quarter of the glass?  Octopus appetizer - Really good, fresh, and well-portioned!   Couldn't wait to get out of there and go make some actually good food. Enjoyed the octopus, but everything else was a disappointment."}
{"text":"What a fabulous dining experience...where do I begin?   The four of us were half an hour early for our 7:15pm reservation but not to worry, we were seated immediately and enjoyed cocktails before we ordered.  We decided to sit inside but there is an outdoor option. I was there for the wine so I asked her for something different that I can't just get anywhere. She was very accommodating and brought me 4 ounces of Cotes Catalanes, Riberach número 8 (10 dollars). I thoroughly enjoyed it. The girls wanted cocktails so she also made something called \"j'aime la vie\". I tasted the fun purple drink that came and it was quite tasty.  We ordered 7 plates for the table and shared everything. Makes it a bit hard for pairing with wine so we got a bottle for the table and ordered 4oz each of the pairing that went with the agnolotti described below. For 50 bucks she suggested a bottle called Langue La Ferma. Great recommendation. The wine pairing that went with the agnolotti described below was an orange wine (what?!?!) called \"Que Pasa\" from France, domaine leonine which was 13 bucks for the 4oz. Very enjoyable, especially to my friend who tends to prefer white over red.   Now for the 7 plates we ordered! All incredible...nicely plated and so delicious.  Mushrooms flaky pastry salsify purée, cipollini onions, crispy Parmesan. The favourite at 18 bucks.  Agnolotti stuffed with guinea fowl confit, green olives, gre des champs cheese, gunpowder mixed spices for 15 bucks. We ordered two since it only comes with 4 agnolottis.  Cornish hen, flageolet beans, fried sage, sauce perfumed with juniper berries. 18 bucks.  Trout declination. (Three ways). Caraway rillette, gravlax, unilateral cooked, confit garlic yogurt. 17 bucks.  To get our veggies in we ordered the Asparagus 2 ways for 15 bucks and had the most delicious quail eggs.  Duck tartar, black fig, foie gras in a cloth. Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar reduction for 15 bucks.   I loved that they split the bill into 4. Before tip the bill was 73.30.  Excellent food, wine, service, knowledgeable staff...can't get any better!"}
{"text":"Amazing terrace. Their lunches are very good, so is the dinner menu. They have interesting wines and good service, but the price to me is a bit expensive for what you get. Still, cute and cozy place in the Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Food is really good. The small portions are not not very filling unless you eat really slow and savor every bite. Which we highly recommend. The menu changes often so the yelp pics dont match the entree's but irrelevant because its is a truly great taste. Menu is simple yet creatively tasty.   Service is good, but heading out now for another small meal or great dessert, bcs it wasnt enough."}
{"text":"Went here in July with colleagues; was surprised it was not listed on Yelp!  So, this is my first time to add a new restaurant for others to discover.  The food was excellent.  And the star of the experience was the unique approach of dual wine pairings - one which is an expected match (the accord) and an unexpected match (the discord).  Everyone enjoyed their food, the staff was quite cordial and the wine was, indeed, a nice fit to the culinary experience.    Check this place out and be one of the first Yelpers to see what you've been missing."}
{"text":"Everyone in our party was really pleased with their food. The presentation was pretty and the portions were just right. We shared a bottle of wine and it was amazing. The waiters were very friendly and helpful. They made us laugh a lot and helped us out with finding a place to dance and have drinks. The only thing was that there were not too many options, but then again it's a wine bar so the emphasis is on the wine, not the food."}
{"text":"La terrasse est sympas mais les tables sont trop rapprochées les unes des autres. Ça manque cruellement d'intimité ! Les guirlandes sont des guirlandes cheap à led. On aimerait avoir quelques bougies et un peu de végétation pour une place qui ne se gêne pas à donner les prix les plus prohibitifs de la région !  Aucune originalité sur la décoration surtout en intérieur ou il n'y a simplement rien du tout. On dirait une chaine de restaurant US de base.  Les vins ne se commandent qu'en bouteille ce qui n'est vraiment pas pratique quand vous n'êtes que 2 et une honte pour un bar à vin qui se respecte. Par contre, la sélection des bouteilles est gigantesque.  On peut vous faire goûter des vins déjà ouverts pour en avoir au verre mais vous ne découvrirez le prix que sur la facture. C'est vraiment étrange qu'on ai aucun prix sur la carte mais qu'ils arrivent à fixer un prix... à la fin ! C'est clairement du gros foutage de gueule.  Le service est TRÈS long et IRRESPECTUEUX. 2 / 3 fois les serveurs m'ont totalement ignoré dans ma face en regardant droit devant. Il serait bon de placer des clochettes sur les tables dans ce cas là ou une putain de trompette.  C'était vraiment insultant, d'autant plus qu'il n'y a pas tant de tables à servir.   On accepte des serveurs / serveuses tatouées. Vraiment pas classe pour un établissement qui veut tapper dans le top des prix.  Les points positifs sont que le plateau fromage était vraiment bon et servi à bonne température avec du bon pain. Idem pour les vins qui sont bien servis devant vous depuis la bouteille mais la sélection des vins ouverts n'était que du vin ordinaire.  Donc une grosse déception. 2 verres chacun de vins ordinaires et un petit plateau fromage : 90$ boom dans ta gueule.  À ce prix là je me prends une bouteille de champagne sur un penthouse.  Je ne remettrai plus les pieds dans cet attrape couillon. Pour le prix, vous trouverez 10 fois mieux ailleurs !"}
{"text":"Amazing location, fabulous terrace and wonderful service (not to mention, a rockin' wine list. ) Loved this place so much during my last visit that I went twice: once for lunch and once for dinner. The fish was cooked to perfection and the desserts were out of this world.  One of the nicest terraces around."}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely experience.  It was our Thanksgiving tonight (means nothing to Canadians), but the meal was as special as you would expect on a holiday. Fabulous smoked trout and cheese and pate appetizers, a beautiful scallops and pork belly plate, a roasted bison rack; and a perfectly spicy Spanish wine to compliment the meal.  The service was both formally impeccable and warm.  Quality."}
{"text":"The food had so much flavor. The oysters, duck and pineapple desert were delicious. In addition, the staff was extremely knowledgeable and provided great wine pairings with the food! Absolutely amazing quality food and service."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after dinner to have a glass of wine before heading home. We had read that they served natural wines and were interested to see what kind of a selection they had.  It was really quiet on a Saturday night around 10:30pm- two other couples were seated at the bar. But, it's a good thing, because it's a small bar :) None of the small tables were occupied, so I think we were the only 6 patrons. I wish I could recall our bartender's name, but he was great. He was knowledgeable and clearly passionate about wine in general and also about the natural wines this location sourced. They only purchase wines with less than 80g of sulfites, which can be pretty hard to find in french wines. We tasted a very nice Bordeaux (Chateau Grenet), which was a blend of malbec, cab, and merlot. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and appreciated his recommendation based on what we told him we were in the mood for. It was about $25 CAD for the 2 glasses, which I thought was reasonable for a more upscale experience. My husband really enjoyed geeking out about wine production and winemaking with the bartender :)  We didn't have any food, but it looks good, and there's a cute outside area that you can sit in when it's not too cool."}
{"text":"Tout à fait correct, sympathique et agréable mais pas original ou mémorable non plus. Une option parmi d'autres pour un lunch d'affaires. Pour une soirée, pas sûr."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful, helpful staff.  Had the tasting menu and it was great, the wine pairings were spot on.  Finished with a poached peach for desert...something I never normally order...awesome!"}
