{"text":"The \"Other\"  Vientiane .....    The other Vientiane is waaaaayyyyyy  better than the Vientiane near the University.  The only reason to frequent the other place is proximity to the university.  This Vientiane has:  better food.  Friendlier service.  Onions will not constitute 50% of your meal.  It's clean.  You will not need immediate access to the bathroom after eating here. It is also spicer - under no circumstances should you attempt 4 stars.  Consider yourself warned.  I've been here many, many times in my time in Madison.  The best dish by far is the curry squash....  Also good is the ginger strip dish, the spring rolls, and the Singapore noodles..."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The cook is funny. Number 20, three stars, is a great meal for anyone."}
{"text":"This Vientiene is horrible - the owner is a cheap shrew and the food is subpar - even compared to her sister's fare at the Vientiene close to campus.  The owner of this Park St location - I hear they have now moved to Sherman I believe - was arrogant about the fact that their Pad thai tastes like ketchup - unlike the Pad thai at legitimate restaurants - could this be a cheap shortcut to the use of tomato paste and other seasonings? The owner said - \"that how we do it here! we use ketchup!\" She explained that the reason the other Vientiene was different pad thai is that the other one is owned by her sister who does not use ketchup in the dish.  Then the cheap woman accused us of merely not wanting to pay for the food, when it was being sent back to the kitchen.  The \"sister\" at the Vientiene by campus cannot smile to save her life and you will come out of there smelling like their kitchen, but the food is better so go there and get it for takeout."}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived in Madison for 6 years now and we are certified foodies...eating out in Madison-area restaurants 4,5...even 6 times a week...rarely have we both experienced worse food than what we did here...one snowy afternoon.  We started with Tom Yum soup, which was pretty good, actually. But that's it!  I had the curry squash with chicken which everyone seems to love and my wife had the ginger chicken....the taste of the sauce was at best worth 3 stars...but the chicken was probably a week or so old..and I have no idea what they did to it when they cooked it...but after one bite, neither of us touched it again...my wife actually had to to spit it out on a napkin coz she would have had 2 puke otherwise. The ginger chicken had enough ginger in it to make the Gingerbread man feel repulsed!  We barely ate half of what was given to us...mostly the sauce and veges and politely declined boxes for the rest."}
