{"text":"One of the most creative and inspiring dinner experiences we have had in the past year.

Enjoyed the 7 course tasting menu: Was blown away by all but one course
served family style with the feel of farmhouse cooking
Highlights
Mackerel in Sunflower Oil
Potato Tournadoes in Dijon
Sweetbreads
Rabbit Sausage
BobumRhum Cake w Salted Caramel - Heavenly

Only miss - but still was seasoned and prepared well - the seared Ahi Tuna - felt like someone dropped off some sushi in our eastern spain/ western france farmhouse dinner

Impressive and would go back and recommend to others looking for a memorable meal 

Reasonable price for food and ambiance"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I last posted, but I felt that this one would be warranted...

Currently sitting in Edulis, waiting for our last course.

Our reservation began at 7pm and it is currently past 11:30pm. We ordered the 7 course tasting menu along with 2 bottles of wine (special occasion, it's our anniversary!). 

The food is amazing. Very seafood forward with the last course being duck. The home made bread is fantastic. They even own a duck press - they take out the breast and legs and press the rest - sounds amazing, and it really is. You have a choice of a cheese platter at the end and it's totally divine.

However, it's been almost 5 hours and I'm still sitting here. As entertaining as my boyfriend is, I have to work tomorrow. And to make things worse, they removed my wine glass, when we still had wine left in the bottle. I miss my puppy at home and I just want the damn bill. It should not take 45 minutes per course."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends, scouting out the \"best of Toronto\" for friends visiting.

After hearing good things from the ether, and a warning from a good friend whom I trust, I was curious to see what the \"Real deal\" is.

My friend said they did not order any of the \"pre-order\" items that seem to be the house special dishes, so we ordered the chicken and 10-week aged ribeye.  

 The roasted and raw beet appetizer with goat cheese was executed well enough and generally good.  The special hay chicken ($70 for 2) was  nice and tender, but completely bland  and without any sort of textural contrast.   The ribeye ($90) was grilled, though quite rare throughout and completely lacking in the delicious crusting that forms through either a proper sear or grill, the beef flavor was a bit grassy but otherwise, was lacking in any 'enhancement', either form some nice Maillard chemistry on the surface or some nice salt and pepper or rosemary.  Bland again.  The accompanying au gratin potatoes were fine.    When everyone at the table is trying to push the remaining portions to everyone else, you know there's a problem.


Of the two desserts we had, the vin sante poached pear was good, while the chocolate pudding with noxious oil was an epic failure (how do you @#$ up chocolate?)

Call me crazy, but if the gimmick of the house is to have expensive pre-reserved entrees, they better be pretty darned amazing.  These were not.  The food might have been passable at half the price and the inclusion of salt and pepper grinders on the table."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations after reading a number of reviews.  We eat out frequently and I was really hoping that this might be added to our list of favourites. Unfortunately it was a let-down. 

The space itself is cozy and the service was great. However the tasting menu had a few dishes that we did not enjoy. 

One dish in particular was terrible - smoked mackerel with kale.  Too much bitterness and fishiness in one dish. I must give credit to the service staff though - the kitchen was nice enough to give us an extra course without us saying a word (they could tell we didn't enjoy it). 

I appreciated the thought that went into the tuna starter but the flavours didn't quite work together - beets, apples, bitter greens  and tuna didn't mix well.  The sausage and sweetbreads were ok but nothing special, same with the bouillon. The goose, our last dish, was good but a little too late and not enough to make up for the rest. 

The dessert was really nice - the ice cream and cake were great but nothing spectacular. 

I feel like the restaurant's staff and owners really care about the place. I just think that the food wasn't our thing."}
{"text":"Edulis continues to combine consistent quality of food and service with never ending variety of dishes changing daily according to the freshest and highest quality ingredients sourced locally as often as possible. The chicken is free range, the corn is specially sourced non genetically modified, the cheeses are from the Cheese Boutique, etc. The best available ingredients go into the meal. Michael and Tobey are always in the kitchen which explains the 'consistency' part of it. On the other side are the efficient waitstaff keeping the dishes coming in a relaxed, laid back style for a place with high food standards. Meticulous attention to detail from music selection to choice of dishes and cutlery help the small, intimate place feel cozy and relaxed, occasionally loud but in an animated way. The food is ...eclectic. Greens and herbs or fish which require a dictionary at times but it all tastes sooo good. Never the same so the surprise is on us. We are not young but we feel excited to go there. This review is the result of a few dozen visits by us two or parties of four with our various guests."}
{"text":"....The flavours were discernible by the menu descriptions, and nothing came off as pretentious or over-reaching.   Hearing that the Carte Blache (their 5 or 7 course tasting  menus) was comprised primarily of menu items, we decided that we would prefer to choose our dishes to ensure that we got our must-have dishes (hello, foie gras, I'm talking about you). This is what we had:

 
Bread Basket
Simple and delicious with a fluffy rich white bun and a heartier whole grain selection.
 
Mixed Wild Mushrooms with Spanish Fried Egg and Brioche Toast
The flavours here were flawless.  The mushrooms were cooked and seasoned perfectly, a celebration of earthy deep flavours.  Cut by a bright parsley garlic olive oil, the egg and brioche brought a rich, decadent element that did not overpower the mushrooms.  I had only wished that the egg had been cooked a little less (the yolk did not run as I'd hope), and the brioche had been toasted or seared well enough that it maintained some of its integrity rather than becoming an indiscernible disk of soggy carbs at the bottom of the bowl.  My other criticism was that the dish was served luke warm.  Unfortunately, this was actually true for every dish we had at Edulis.

 
Fresh Istrian White Truffle with Soft Eggs and Onion Puree
Probably the best truffle dish I have ever tasted.  The onion puree had a sweet, slightly smokey flavour, with a pleasant mild acidic note.  The eggs had a really comforting texture, gingerly speckled with fresh herbs to cut the richness.  And thank you, Edulis, for doing truffle right.  A delicate shaving of white truffles adorned the eggs so that the umami-rich flavour was distinguished, but not overwhelming.

 
Poached Foie Gras \"Facon Michel Guerard\" Du Puy Lentils, Smoked Apple Puree For someone who ordinarily is not a huge fan of De Puy Lentils, this was a stellar dish, and worth holding out on the Carte Blanche for (or ordering it in addition to the tasting). The foie itself was generously portioned and incredibly buttery, contrasted with the supple pop of the lentils beneath.  I appreciated the sweet and acidic note of the apple, and the salty crunch of the chicken skin. Way to make a girl love lentils.

Glazed Beef Cheek with Black Trumpets, Parsley Root Puree, Sunchokes, Herbs
The beef cheek was meltingly tender, and its deep rich flavour was complemented beautifully with the trumpet mushrooms.  Both of these elements worked well with the nutty, sweet sunchokes and lustrously smooth puree.

 
Kale and Duck Leg Meat Ball with Stewed Potatoes and Hazelnuts
This was probably our least favourite dish, but by no means and failure.  The meat ball lacked the moisture and the sumptuous mouthfeel I would expect from anything made of duck legs.  The stewed potatoes and hazelnuts, however, were a dream.  The potatoes were tender and beautifully seasoned, while the hazelnuts lent a contrasting crunch and nutty aroma. This would make for a beautiful holiday side.

 
Vin Santo Roasted Pear, Walnut Toffee Cream, Salted Caramel
Sitting before us looking like a Bon Appetit magazine cover, this was a light, yet indulgent and elegant dessert.  The pear had slightly caramelized exterior, that when plunged into the caramel and cream below yielded a perfect bite of sweet, salty and richness.  As someone who has poached many-a-pears, I found the roasting technique easier to eat (with a bit of care, you could cut it easily with a spoon), but a little bit more grainy in texture. Regardless, I literally ate everything in the bowl except the stem.

Spiced Apple Sorbet
Another light and refreshing end to a meat-heavy meal.  The sorbet had all of those memory-evoking holiday spices, and without the weight an ice cream, I could actually appreciate the bright acidic apple flavour.  A rendition of this may make an appearance in my freezer sometime soon.


So, for 5 savoury dishes, 2 sweet, 3 cocktails, 1 glass of wine, sparkling water and a cappuccino, the bill came to $250, a bit more than we normally spend, but the quality was testimony to its worth.  I will definitely come for a return visit, and when I do, I'll plan for an all-nighter, tuck into a 7-course Carte Blanch, and try to spend some time chatting it up with Tobey.  Congratulations Edulis on your recent success and accolades.  There is definitely good reason why you've been voted number one!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to give Edulis a try based on all the hype and past positive reviews.  We both had the large tasting menu.  I really wanted to like this place, but my experience is best summed up with one work: meh.

None of the dishes was horrible, but none of it was very good either.  Most of the dishes had muddled flavours where one couldn't tell what the main ingredient on the dish was.  The cooking also revolved around just a few notes.  The only flavour spikes we experienced were with the first two courses: the olvie amouse bouche and the fluke app.  Otherwise, everything tasted flat, muddled, and maybe even under seasoned."}
{"text":"Cozy and friendly restaurant. The servers were extremely accommodating, considering my friend got stuck in traffic and we were an hr late for our reservation.

We ordered the 7 course carte blanche and the food was delicious. We just wished there was a little more of it than one bite per dish. The courses came out slowly and the meal lasted a good 3 hours. Considering it took about 2 minutes to eat each dish, we felt the meal was a little dragged out, although we really weren't complaining as we hadn't caught up for a long time so we used the time to do so. 

Overall delicious meal, but when after considering for cost vs enjoyment, I probably wouldn't return any time soon."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come to Edulis because of its reviews and ratings. Sadly, this restaurant was so bad that I honestly don't feel like adventuring out again. It was absolutely terrible. Outside of the staff, who were very attentive and detail oriented, this place did not work at all. 

We started with the hedhog mushrooms cooked in duck fat. This was good but nothing amazing. However, at this point it was a starter so I wasn't expecting amazing. It was good but nothing I can't do at home. 

Next came the sweetbreads over polenta. I tried the polenta plain, and it was the worst polenta I have had in my life. This is saying something since I eat out excessively. The polenta was bland...it tasted as if it was boiled in plain water with nothing else. The sweetbreads were overcooked, too crispy and had a terrible after taste. It was awful...truly truly bad. I eat a lot of sweetbreads so I am well versed in how they should be prepared and how they should taste. 

Next was the duck. The duck was overcooked, it was medium well done. Duck is always supposed to be medium rare. If people dont like it that way, you ask them, you dont change the dish. The duck was a little chewy but it was ok. The citrus on the duck was nice. They also put whole beans in the sauce, which were undercooked and had a very bland after taste. So basically there was an overcooked duck on top of a sauce with undercooked beans...I can't say this was terrible like the sweetbreads but it wasn't good. It was ok. 

The final piece was the pulled halibut cheek with truffles. The truffles overpowered the fish and the fish seemed a little overcooked...it was slightly on the rubbery/chewy side...thirty seconds more on the stove and it probably would have been ruined. The truffles completely overpowered everything, the waitress said that was the center piece of the dish...I disagree with this. Truffles are an enhancer, they enhance flavor and bring the dish up...they aren't supposed to overpower the dish so you can only taste truffles. 

Overall this was awful. I don't understand why this place is booked solid. The only thing good about this place was the staff."}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere where all outstanding! I went here with my boyfriend last night and had the 7 course tasting menu. Although we were tempted to add the additional white trifle risotto course, it was an extra $85/plate and you had to order 2 portions because that was how the ride was cooked. When we arrived at the restaurant the table beside us had just received the risotto plate and there was an over generous amount of truffle and the smell was exquisite. I spoke to our lovely waitress about the extra cavier and truffle dishes and she mentioned that they are on the menu at cost to make them more accessible to patrons. With that said, I will definitely be going back to indulge in these delicacies!
The 7 course meal that we did have was mainly seafood and vegetables which is the restaurant's specialty. Every dish was very unique but had a similar light, crisp, fresh taste, that got richer as the meal went on. My favourite of the evening would be the mackerel which had a side of greens in a vinigrette dressing. My second favourite would have to be the first dessert course (since I have such a big sweet tooth). It was a spice cake with a citrus sorbet and pestacio cream. This course had a great balance between light, rich and citrus. The last course was the rum bubba cake which was almost like an angela food cake doused in a rum syrup and served with a Chantilly cream. They also pour extra rum syrup at your table when the dish is served which I wasn't a fan of because the rum was too strong for me but my boyfriend still enjoyed it! 
Overall amazing. Definitely in my top 5 of restaurants in the city and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. 
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height 
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight...

EDULIS
You are my one true love.  You never let me down. Sundays are our special time together. 
You surprise me with your amazingly sourced product, each succulent course a beautiful surprise. You tease me with your vegetables, mesmerize with your confit and sous vide and lead me into temptation with dessert. 
I wish I had three friends to share Frédéric Delair inspired pressed duck....maybe one day. 

You always leave me wanting more, and sadly you are at times elusive to see and play hard to get, especially on Sundays."}
{"text":"Dinner last night at Edulis was nothing short of perfect.

Four of us decided on the Carte Blanche tasting menu, they offer it in two iterations: 5 courses for $50 or 7 courses for $70. We went with the 5 course which was plenty.

After ordering our server brought out house baked bread & olives stuffed with sardines on a toothpick with a crouton soaked in olive oil.  Tasty, really enjoyed the olives.

We went with Riesling ($45) with dinner, wine list is short but very reasonably priced.
 
1st course: Lightly smoked Herring \" a l'huile\" : essentially smoked herring with carrots & onions in oil. Doesn't sound very interesting but the flavor was incredible. The olive oil was so good we finished off our bread sopping it up. Served with a side of fingerling potatoes in a delicious cream sauce. Everyone at the table said that it was something they wouldn't think to order & were surprised at how much they enjoyed it. Dish felt very Scandinavian.

2nd course: Smoked veal tongue \"Tonnato\": shaved thin served with crispy garlic & tonnato: essentially a mayo based sauce with anchovy, olive oil & capers. Loved it. Was a bit saltier than I would have liked.

3rd course: Light fish course consisting of Seared Albacore Tuna & a Heirloom Tomato salad dressed with a sunflower seed vinaigrette. I'd never myself pair fish & tomatoes (would never think to do it) but it totally worked. Many in our party thought it was their favorite dish.

4th course: Muscovy Duck roasted breast, braised leg & smoked wing with summer beans, squash & romesco sauce. Honest to god the best duck dish I have ever eaten. The braised leg was crispy, smokey & delicious, the breast tender & flavorful. I could eat this everyday for the rest of my life.

Bonus Course: medley of mushrooms with foie on toast & sweetbreads. This dish was the key to my heart, every one of my favorite foods in one dish. Super rich, super delicious.

5th Course: dessert consisted of Blackberry Ice Cream with a spiced sugar cookie & a large piece of Baba Au Rhum: a pound cake soaked in Appleton Rum syrup served with Chantilly cream. The rum cake was super boozy & moist, perfect.

The room is small & comfortable. Service is casual and pretty lovely, like you are in someone's home. Sometimes empty plates sat too long, water glasses sat empty, but the charm & mood of the restaurant totally made up for it. We never felt rushed, like they were trying to turn our table.  Our meal lasted 3 hours & we enjoyed every minute of it. 

One of the most memorable, enjoyable meals I have had in Toronto in ages."}
{"text":"I'm agreeing with reviewer Brandon M. on this one, Edulis should have at least a 4.5 star rating; our meal last night was nothing less than a 7 out of 5 stars! 

I'll admit I was a bit nervous with some of the mixed ratings on here about portion size, but my fiance and I each had the 5 course carte blanche menu and were more than stuffed by the end. There are no neon lights here people, no free refills on pop, or crayons on the table... this is not East Side Mario's, the food will not fall off the side of your plate. In fact, the food is a smidgeon of art work; I felt so bad destroying its perfect placement each time a course came out. But then again, the flavours were incredible, so I didn't feel bad for long!

Like another reviewer on here, I can't possibly describe the intricacy of the courses and do them justice. There were NS Bay scallops (a big maritime hug goes out to the waitress who pronounced \"scallop\" like she was from Digby!), Fluke, Ham (not just regular ham, but super ham) and then duck breast and duck sausage, which was honestly the best dish of the whole crew. It's the mix of flavours that get you, you\"ll be tasting things for the first time with every bite. So well done.

Dessert was a lemon tart with kiwi berries, and I'm telling you, this lemon tart was delicious!! Lemon tarts usually bore me with their tarty, dry filling, but this one rocked my world for a little bit. The lemon curd was soft and pillow-y and the shortbread crust was perfectly cooked. I would have asked for seconds, but I had to remind myself we were at a restaurant and not my grandmother's house.

This is a cozy, intimate place with a heavily euro-feel. In a way I felt like I was in a small town in Europe, the service was speedy, attentive and proper. The atmosphere was boisterous but not overbearing... get yourself some reservations at this place, choose a wine and then sit back and let the chef surprise you dish after dish. What could be easier!? :)"}
{"text":"Heard so much about this resturant, had it on the to do list for sometime. 
Finally went there for my birthday. I was suprised how intimate and tiny the place
was. The service for our table was excellent. We ordered the 5 course dinner.
Bread came first with butter and stuffed olive and bread cube, enjoyed that very much.
Next came the raw tuna dish, which was decent nothing really mind blowing.
The Fish dish that followed was superb, fish was well cooked, had mushrooms and some cream sauce, which I cleaned off the plate. The squid and black sauce, was again good, I enjoyed the sauce much more than the squid. The 4th course I loved the most, super tender pork loin which was so soft and buttery, it had some bitter green vegetable and bits of pork sausage. A must try! :) Lastly the peach shorbet and sweet cream was very refreshing and tasty. Overall it was fantastic and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Blew my mind. A western version of omakase or even kaiseki."}
{"text":"Just back from Edulis. I had to come and read the reviews again in case I was missing something...
No, I was not. The food was just really bad. I can't, for the life of me understand the stellar reviews.
The food was not generous to begin with. Not only in portion size but in taste. We felt we needed salt on everything. Everything tasted stingy.
We had the 7 courses menu + a bottle of wine.
I don't think we had 100grs of protein all together...We had a lot of vegetables...either undercooked vegetables- baby zucchinis, potato, etc., or overcooked ones- tomatoes, fava beans and green onions.
We had small, and I mean magnifying glass needed, portions of fish. 
We had nuts and some kind of sauce on every dish.
Nothing cohesive. Tastes jumped to our mouths discordantly.
The pièce de résistance, the last dish, a thing of squab with onion puree tasted exactly like army food...the feeling of having had too many onions...
I'm still shocked, shocked at how bad it all was.
As for the service...our wine was poured way too fast, or we were ignored all together. Guests that knew the chef got \"special treatment\", their food brought out by the chef herself. 
We finished our bread and were not offered more. When we asked for some more, we got that, 2 pieces and no extra butter. Trust me, even after 7 courses you'll need the bread...
The dessert was  just sad. Blueberries that were reportedly from Ontario but tasted of nothing. Corn that was either scraped from the cob uncooked or straight from a tin, some pecans and a squirt of cream...
The whole evening $270. 
Please, stay away, there are better places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Third time a charm? Unfortunately, it was abit of a disappointment. We had the 7-course dinner, and there were some definitely good dishes and misses. The main chicken & lobster was our least favorite. The dessert crepe was unappetising, the cake too wet with rum. While our overall experience, service, atmosphere was good, it wasn't exceptional like our first time here. Rated down to 3.5

Review based on dinner and Sunday Lunch with 1/2 price wine. Great wine recommendation.
The food was excellent, deceivingly simple but prepared well.  Space is intimate and cozy, service is the same. Its a special place, I almost don't want to recommend this place since its been so difficult to get a reservation here."}
{"text":"We had the 5 course menu. It was unreal! 3 fish dishes, duck for the 4th course and desert for thw 5th.  Every dish was made with care and each dish was delicious! The service was great. The atmosphere was very comfortable. Hands down one of the best meals in toronto."}
{"text":"Please note this review is written with in mind the price range and expected the semi-fine dining experience. Had the 5 course set menu with no wine pairing. It was overall a good experience, though I had higher expectations due to high reviews on the spot from friends and online reviews. Service was not the most attentive but it seems like it was just a lack of experience. 

The first four dishes were good but didn't stand out. Our last dish which was supposed to be the anchor to the entire show was a chicken based dish and was slightly underwhelming. The flavoring was off and not balanced and the texture of the chicken was not very tender. Might give it another shot for lunch, i think we were partly unlucky and encountered the relatively less impressive set of courses."}
{"text":"well.... I think I was expecting a lot more for a restaurant that needed 1 month advance reservation. I think the price/portion/decor is suitable for its location. We were group of five and had the set menu. The food and service was not bad, but was not great either..... everything was kind of.... average."}
{"text":"We went for the Sunday lunch, $40 pp. One menu, six courses. Other than dessert, you share each dish. I like this concept and brings back a little euro feel. Bottle of wine is half price on Sunday, which is a steal. Since the menu changes, no need to go into details. Let just say I had high expectations going in. The meal was good but didn't wow  me. The ingredients were fresh, but a couple dishes came out a bit burnt. 

The service was just ok. There was a gap in service between regulars and new guests. I should have given this place a 4* but they really didn't provide a comfortable dining experience. The place was cold! Half my body down was cold. They had heaters all around but that didn't work. As such, the food also got cold quicker. 

At $40, the meal is good value. The service needs some work. They should definitely fix the heating issue for winter."}
{"text":"Time after time, Edulis thrills, it exceeds expectations. In response to some other reviewers, no, it's not Alo. It doesn't pretend to be Alo and doesn't want to be Alo. To compare Edulis to Alo, you may as compare it to Jack Astor's. 
Edulis is in a class of its own, from the comfortable atmosphere, the professional service, the excellent and inventive food, they eye-opening wine pairings, the affordability ... A place like this you'd find in any Spanish, Italian or French city or town or even village. For Toronto it's a rarity. Edulis is a special place. Long may you reign!"}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5 stars
Overall: Lovely, delicious food with a good price-to-quality ratio with European-style, gentle service and cozy space reflective of the co-owners' personalities. Would go again.

Food: Seven-course tasting menu with additional courses of truffled egg with maple cream and cheese tasting plate. Only two \"eh, could be better\" dishes in terms of execution/combination of flavours and the rest were very solid to excellent. Dessert was unique, incredibly delicious, and memorable -- rhubarb in a bruleed blood orange sabayon with star anise meringue. Whoever is their saucier should be applauded. Even when the sauces weren't paired well, they were always superb -- silky smooth, coated the palate well, and an excellent balance of flavours. Their cheese selection is wonderful and currently they have an American Artisan cheese special going on.

Drink: We brought our own wine, but they serve Q water. Coffee needs improvement -- no crema on my espresso, bitter, one-note, and way too many grinds leftover at the end. 

Service: The service is more European, i.e., a beat or two slower and mild, gentle, and soothing. It almost verges on languid. Our nine-course meal took four hours, sometimes with more than a few overly lengthy waits for food. We thought they forgot our dessert at one point. People looking for lengthier explanations of where the food comes should temper their expectations, especially going to a place touted for its local sourcing of ingredients. We had to pour our own water many times and we got a bit thirsty when they took the pitchers away and forgot to return them filled. However, they kept the bread coming, which came in very handy to mop up those delicious sauces.

Atmosphere/Space: Cozy, almost verging on cramped, but it's almost like you're having a dinner party at your friend's house, so you wouldn't mind as much. The chairs get hard after 4 hours of sitting. Casual and it feels like those many BYOW (which you can do!) restos in Montreal littered across residential neighbourhoods.

Price: $90 for 7 courses with additional supplements for other courses. Very reasonable for the quality of food you're getting."}
{"text":"Huge hype, disappointing results. Perhaps they were too distracted serving Martha Stewart that night."}
{"text":"We had a phenomenal dining experience at Edulis. We got the 7 course tasting menu and were very impressed with 6 out of the 7 courses. The food was very unique and the ideas the chef came up with were really interesting. We really enjoyed the attention to detail - really delicious experience. The ambiance is very cute as well. And the service was excellent.

We went on a Sunday night and the restaurant was quite empty so it didn't feel crowded or rushed and we got a lot of attention from the servers. And the food was well spaced out."}
{"text":"Four stars: price is a bit high but you are definitely full at the end - did the $80 prix fixe menu and really liked it, but there was a lot of fish (so you need to be into that). The rabbit served in a later course was a *little* tough but that might be a preference thing. Our reservation was for 6:30 and for a large portion of the night, we had the restaurant to ourselves so it was nice and quiet. Around 7:30 the restaurant filled up and got super noisy. 
Five stars: service was wonderful, staff was knowledgable and friendly. The timing of each course was well done. The final course was baba au rhum with chantilly cream and it was amazing. 

Worth the experience."}
{"text":"Rarely does a restaurant transcend banality, leap beyond trend and showmanship, and take a diner on a journey to an unexplored culinary experience.  Edulis did this, providing fun, laughter and comfort along the way.   My dinner will be added to my most memorable restaurant experiences.  Edulis is one of the best restaurants in the world, deserving of multiple Michelin stars.

Consisting of two, low ceiling, candlelit rooms, Edulis discards hip for warmth.  Our server, Dana, was charming and knowledgable, helping us navigate through the meal with pleasure.  We added a gorgeous $80 bottle of Alsatian Sylvaner to our meal and settled back for the five course prix fix dinner. A seven course experience is also offered, but we wanted to add the 60 dollar supplement for the white truffle risotto dish, and that was plenty \"over the top.\" Edulis is expensive, but you get what you pay for.

I couldn't recount every dish if I wanted to, and besides, Edulis changes the menu nightly. Let it suffice to say that every morsel was amazing, and I exclaimed with pleasure in a Rabelaisian display of gluttony.  The last meal that transformed my being was in Marseille at the Michelin starred AM Alexandre Mazzia, and Edulis equaled that indulgence of a \"died and gone to heaven\" dining moment.  This was the highlight of my trip to Toronto and Edulis makes this Canadian metropolis a culinary destination for any \"foodie.\" Bravo!"}
{"text":"What a great find in Toronto!   A colleague and I had the seven course tasting menu and other than one of the dishes had sweetbreads (I just can't go there) everything was incredibly flavorful and delivered with attentive service.   To my surprise, one of the courses was a very wintery type dish that was made with Duck, which I normally hate, and I couldn't get enough of it!   Parking can be a pain, but we parked only a block down from the restaurant.

I admit I was skeptical of a 7 course meal selected by the chef with no ability to \"pick and choose\", but given the"}
{"text":"Seriously, how good can a seemingly over priced meal be? Friggin AMAZING!!! The intricate flavours working together to give your palate an orgasm. Definitely should come here if you're a Torontoian as this is easily one of the best restaurants in our growing city."}
{"text":"Overall the experience is OK, but not powerful enough for repeated visits.

My first visit is with my mother.  

The ambience is cozy and romantic.

The service was great, absolutely nothing to pick on.  We ordered warm water, and they brought us a cute owl shaped teapot.  

The food is fresh, and daring.  I could tell the chef put a lot of effort in preparing the ingredients and the meal.  

We both ordered the 7 course meal.
I will summarize the experience was like a rollercoaster ride.
In general all the seafood dishes and fresh.

The bread on the table is decent, but not to the level for me to finish the mini sack.  It is not hot/warm, something I take notice as a must for restaurant that cares about their customers.

The first fish dish was with sour apple dice.  Not a big fan of it.

The second scallops fish was to die for.  If I can order, I will eat 30 order by myself.   My mother agreed with my assessment.  It has the hint of yazu.

The 3rd dish is another fish dish with eggplant and mushroom.  Nothing special, unless you count the server pour in the soup at the table (something Canoe did already).

The 4th dish is pike, and amazing.  The surprising element was the almond nuts.

The rest of the dishes are not worth mentioning.  The stuff squid just have special ink appearance.  The squid nor stuffing taste good.  The duck was salty.  The cake and cream we took 1 bite and didn't finish.  The cake is drowned with rum.  The cream was over whipped.     I would be happier if you just give me a piece of chocolate.

Overall the portion is on the small side, and will not be enough for any big eaters.  Luckily we ordered the 7 and not the 5 course meal, or else I will not even get to try the yummy scallops.

I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"If there's one restaurant in Toronto that deserves a 5+ star review it's this one. The food is complex yet works out on your palette perfectly. You can tell the chefs put their heart and soul into each dish. Service, atmosphere, and location are all superb. Such a lovely experience, through and through."}
{"text":"Luke warm welcome but service improved considerably . Hay smoked chicken great.  Inconsistent size with plates made it hard to share.  Dessert and cheese excellent."}
{"text":"Edulis never disappoints! We love to visit for their Sunday lunch/ brunch and always have an enjoyable afternoon! the service is perfection and the food is a delight- always something new and different. 
The half-price wine bottles is a wonderful touch and certainly helps with the overall experience :) 

While we have had dinner there, we much prefer the lunch option for the pricing and relaxed ambiance. The overall experience is like an afternoon stroll in a small French town."}
{"text":"Chef did a great job with plating and the ambience is awesome.  Food was well made but expect portion to be small.  Every dish that it came out gives you a little surprise because of the beautiful plating and the use of colour.  Feels like eating a piece of Art.  The poached Goose Liver was the best I ever tried.  Highly recommended to try this place if you are willing to spent the money."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's best places to dine. Food, atmosphere and service are all exemplary.
As a seafood lover there were many options on the menu and some specials in addition. 
Family run with a tight staff who work well together."}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal I have had in Toronto. Every dish was perfect! It's obvious that they go to great lengths to source the freshest seafood, and vegetables at their peak. The service was also impeccable. Plan to spend 2.5 to 3.5 hours for dinner.... it's well worth it."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst tasting menus I've ever had.  

First course:  Bonito with cucumber and black garlic - way too much vinegar in the cucumbers which burns your throat and overpowers the delicate fish. 

Second course - Lightly smoked lake trout with white asparagus and vinaigrette- too lightly flavored in my opinion. 

Third course - Scallop with scallop roe - the scallop was too tough and chewy, which means that it was cooked too long.  Poor technique.  

Fourth course - Soft shell crab with ramps and romesco - Absolutely awful.  Meager piece of crab that was over battered, tasted like oil and fried stuff, could not taste the crab with all that batter. There was hardly any romesco sauce.  It came off like a really bad piece of shrimp tempura.  I've had better soft shell crab in a sushi roll.  

Fifth course - Saucy rice with halibut cheeks and mushrooms - This dish was way too salty.  It might've been enjoyable if not for that.  

Sixth course - Lamb with chorizo and asparagus - The lamb was cooked medium rare but still was tough and chewy, not to mention flavorless.  We swear that the meat must not be good quality. 

Seventh course - Rhubarb sorbet on rhubarb compote - Believe it or not, this was the best part of our meal.  Sweet and tart of the rhubarb was perfectly balanced.  

Rhubarb tart with tonka bean cream - The filling was too sweet.  The tart shell was a little hard.  But the tonka bean cream was delicious.  

All in all, my friend and I were hard pressed to decide which was the worst dish of them all.  It just went steadily downhill from the first savory course to the last.  We couldn't figure out if the ingredients were of subpar quality, or the chef lacked skill, or if we just got really bad dishes.  We were highly disappointed, especially considering that we paid $100 each for the meal.  Would absolutely not come here again."}
{"text":"The food & experience was wonderful. But, skip the truffle addition option as it was highly overrated (we were barely able to taste them).

French style locavore fine dining is definitely hard to find, but this was a good one.  If I had to do this over, and it wouldn't bother me if we did, I'd just choose the small 5 course option instead of springing for the extra 2 courses with truffles. Funny, the large option with the truffles made for double the tab!

If I had to choose for fine locavore dining in Toronto: my choice is still Woods."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Had been meaning to come here for a while, finally made it for lunch.

6 course meal, $120 per person, and lunch took about 2.5 hours (a bit longer than should have been warranted).

But the food - absolutely amazing. Their butter was fantastic. The lobster was the best I've had (pushing past my previous favorite- a sashimi lobster). And the \"excessive vanilla bean ice cream\" was also the best vanilla ice cream I'd ever had.

All in all, absolutely delicious. Considering how expensive other places can be, absolutely worth it.

The lowpoint was their lack of a plum soda (though it was on the menu) - zounds."}
{"text":"Amazing food and incredible service. Our server was fantastic, made great wine pairing recommendations for us which were much appreciated. The atmosphere was cozy and intimate, perfect for the double date we were on with friends. 10/10 great experience!"}
{"text":"Top notch. One of the best meals I have ever had in my entire life. Service was flawless. Food was mind blowing. The ambiance was very intimate and nice. Would have paid whatever they wanted for that meal. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Do you have an open mind and are you willing to eat whatever is served to you?  This is the premise here at Edulis.  Seasonal ingredients prepared in a variety of ways.  It's nice that they ask for allergies or preferences at the beginning of the meal.  

Essentially, there are two choices:  a five course tasting menu for $50, or a 7 course tasting menu for $70.  If you like truffles, for an extra $40, you can have an additional course.  

For my anniversary dinner, we opted for the 7 courses but no truffle add-on.  We are not huge fans to begin with.  

Filtered water is by Q and the charge is $2 per person.  You have the choice of flat, sparkling, or tap.  There is a solid wine selection.  I decided to try three of their house-made sodas and they were all uniquely refreshing!

The bread was amazing.  Our friend suggested we eat as much butter as possible and it was totally worth the delicious calories.  

If my memory serves me correctly, these were the dishes for the evening:

-Kampachi sashimi with heirloom tomatoes (last of the season)
-Eel in a vinegar broth with a mini seared rice ball and finely sliced mushrooms and a piece of cucumber 
-Sockeye salmon with the leaves from Brussels sprouts and an almond purée. 
-Albacore tuna 
-Pickerel with frisée and mushrooms 
-Lamb stewed with seasonal fall vegetables
-Strawberries and cream with fennel

Just after the sixth course is cleared, you're presented with another menu if you're still interested in adding a cheese plate and/or after dinner drinks.  We were stuffed (thanks to the bread).  

Honestly, the portions are very small.  For some people, one dish could amount to only about 3 bites.  Keep in mind though, the tasting menu allows you to sample so many flavours and textures.  The freshness of the ingredients really stand out.  

We enjoyed each and every dish.  Actually, I think the dessert was the weakest link.  The texture of the fennel just threw me a curve.  

I was slightly disappointed that in our reservation we had stated it was our anniversary but upon arrival, it wasn't actually noted.  We didn't hold this against them though.  Service was truly outstanding.

Out of respect, I took no photos during dinner as they asked that cell phones not be used during dinner.  I think that was a very reasonable request.  

I'm definitely interested in their brunch menu."}
{"text":"BIRTHDAY REVIEW!!!!
We made this reservation 2 months in advance and still could not get a spot for Friday (my actual birthday). With a wait like this, one can only imagine the anticipation that was built up for last night's dinner.

Arrival was a bit awkward-- there was only one other table eating in this small restaurant when we arrived at 6:30 so it was a little uncomfortable to be seated directly next to them and have to squeeze in when all the other tables sat open for at least an hour. I felt like we were crashing their private dinner In fact, it didn't really fill up until about 8:30. This made it that much more awkward because there wasn't a lot of background noise to soak up our respective conversations.

We began with a glass of Cava and some warm bread. Then the gildas: Olives stuffed with anchovy and a soft cube of bread. I thought my boyfriend would hate this as he's not a huge anchovy fan, but to my surprise he gave it a big thumbs up! The perfect little mouthful with a glass of sparkling wine!

We were very pleased with how seasonal the menu was. The chef made wonderful use of local ingredients like fiddleheads, wild leeks and morels (always a birthday treat for me!) The seven course carte blanche was very heavy on the fish dishes and all were prepared exqusitely. The standout was the wild caught BC salmon with a pesto of mustard greens and wild leeks. The skin was cooked separately from the fish and presented as a crisp, shattering garnish. The fish was cooked to a soft medium rare with two fat, foraged morels. This dish was honestly a piece of art-- like a painting of a stream with all the fresh ingredients playing a colourful role.

The sweetbreads that were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The lamb was slow roasted and very tender and while the accompanying porcini sauce was tasty, this dish was not our favourite. I kept thinking that something was missing- maybe a little fruit or acidity to balance the earthiness of the mushroom?

Dessert was a mishmash of contrasting textures. I don't remember what the server called it, but it was a pistacho cream with little shards of meringue on top of some orange jelly. I did enjoy the flavours, and the subtle crunch between soft cream and mild jelly-- but I couldn't help but feel that the dish itself had been created from a string of leftovers in the kitchen. A little uninspired, or maybe just not my thing.

In the end, we agreed that the dinner was fabulous and the salmon was one of the most exquisite dishes we've tried. We'd probably go back and try a Sunday Lunch with a bit more emphasis on meat and maybe some foie gras, which was curiously absent from the carte blanche menu.

A memorable experience and fabulous seasonal ingredients highlighting a carefully crafted meal. Why not 5 stars? The seating situation was just awkward, although it felt more comfortable as the restaurant filled up. While the service was mostly great, it was clear that one of the servers was bullshitting her way through the ingredients used in the dishes. She tried, but I'm not sure I believe that there is such a thing as \"wild sauce\". I think there was a noun missing. 

Worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went to Edulis last night with friends having heard good things about this restaurant.

I arrived at about 7 and the restaurant was quite empty but it quickly filled up. It is a small restaurant and basically only seats 2 to 4 people per table. I asked and they will go up to a party of 6.

I now understand what some of the reviews meant by saying this place is \"good, not great\".  This place is no Alo.

We had the 7 course tasting menu. The tasting menu is primarily fish based with one meat dish.  The food is very good and so is the the pace the dishes are served. However, there is no \"wow\" factor with the food.

The service was good. Our server was friendly and answered our questions. 

I found the price of the 7 course tasting menu ($85) to be very reasonable. Also, they had a reasonable wine selection in terms of both price and selection.

In the end, I am happy I tried it."}
{"text":"Without understatement, dining here for my mothers birthday was in the top three restaurants experiences of my life.
Everything from the moment we walked in was extraordinary. The service, the attentiveness, the home-baked bread, the Gilda to start, the wine pairings, the exquisitely crafted tiny plates... Cannot speak highly enough of this establishment."}
{"text":"Edulis is amazing. The food is European in nature and the flavours are explosive yet comforting in nature. The savouries are a revelation. Desserts are good but aren't at the level of the previous courses. Seafood is spectacular. The last main is always a responsibly sourced meat, sometimes dry aged veal or duck or Berkshire pork, served with seasonal vegetable that is absurdly flavourful. Service is wonderful and personable. Really a can't miss place and a totally singular experience. Well deserved top 5 restaurant in Canada"}
{"text":"Edulis is, in my opinion, the best restaurant of its kind in Toronto. 

Over the past 5 years I've enjoyed many Sunday lunches and dinners at Edulis, and every single time they seem to out do themselves. From the moment you walk in, you instantly feel like you've arrive somewhere very special. 

Sunday lunch is wonderful and served family style with half price bottles of wine - which is a lovely bonus. You're served warm homemade milk buns along side your lunch. It's the perfect way to enjoy a Sunday afternoon. Every Sunday lunch is different so you never tire of coming back as each time you are surprised with local, seasonal ingredients.

Dinner is spectacular. We always do the 7 course menu followed by a cheese course. The chef's are truly artists. Everything is expertly prepared but unlike some other restaurants that offer tasting menu's, the experience is not one that is sterile or impersonal, the staff are warm, knowledgable and not at all pretentious which makes you feel very at ease. Often times I will ask specific questions about different ingredients and they always take the time to explain everything to me in detail. 

I can't say enough wonderful things about Edulis, Toronto is very lucky to have this restaurant in our city."}
{"text":"Small rustic french cuisine spot. Came here for the tasting menu with my family for a birthday celebration. Great service overall w/ good explanation of each dish as they arrived! I must say their ingredients were really fresh! Some of the textures ive never tasted before! Overall great experience - should try the tasting menu at least once! Was not a fan of their dessert however."}
{"text":"Did the Sunday Brunch/tasting menu at Edulis. All I can say is that it was simple fabulous and lived up to every bit of my expectation. Service was friendly and top notch. Overall, the place seemed cramped and the small tables could only hold about 2-3 dishes at a time. But who cares about size when quality is all that matters. Parking might be an issue but there is a Green P around the corner about 2 blocks away on King Street. We paid $10 to park on a weekend and we were at the restaurant for about 2 hours. I highly recommend Edulis."}
{"text":"We came on Dec 29 for dinner after hearing good things about the restaurant and weeks of trying to book a table. The overall experience was positive but not amazing and we were a bit of disappointed with the service. One person from our group has been there before and she said it was great last time, so it seems it's a hit or miss from time to time given the menu changes a lot. 

The 5 year aged Jamon (add-on) was delicious. The first 3 courses in our set menu was great and they were focused on seafood, which is what Edulis is known for and what came for. For the main, we had a chicken and mushroom dish which was a bit of disappointing. We didn't expect to have a chicken dish as main on the set menu from a restaurant known for seafood. For the dessert, we had a bitter orange sorbet which wasn't my type of dessert but the rest of group enjoyed it. 

Essentially the food was worth the price but the portion is definitely on the small side. The service was what really made us a bit disappointed. It wasn't that busy on that night, but the service was slow. We also didn't get the menus even when we have sat down for like 20 min. We had to ask for the menu and didn't have enough time to read it before we ordered. It would be better to have the menu published somewhere on the website or in the venue so the guests could have a better idea what to expect before coming in on that day."}
{"text":"Pros: good wine selection, one great fish course, delicious dessert.

Cons: sat next to entrance and froze, half the courses were forgettable, indifferent service, upto 45 minutes between courses, prices have gone up since our last visit, reached out to restaurant to discuss experience and no response after 2 emails.

Verdict: Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Edulis is named one of Canada's best restaurant by EnRoute Magazine in 2012. You can see why when you try their tasting menu. The 7 course tasting menu is inspired and reasonably priced.  

The dining room is small. It is a great place for a date. It dining room has a rustic - romantic feel.  The service is attentive.

The food is exceptional. Seafood is a huge part of the tasting menu. If you are a fan of seafood (like me), you will love Edulis. The seafood is fresh and flavours are enhanced with unique ingredients. 

I would highly recommend Edulis."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check out Edulis for sometime, even before enRoute magazine named it the top new restaurant of 2012.  However, my list of \"must-try\" restaurants seems to never die, but I finally made it.

There are several approaches you can take with the menu; such as a 5-course tasting menu for $50; or the larger 7-cousre menu for $70; or simply à la carte.  We ordered 4 dishes, 1 dessert and 2 drinks (1 non-alcoholic) between 2 people and the bill came to about $120 including tax and tip.

It should be noted that the menu does not differentiate an appetizer from a main.  The server explained to us that the size of the offering depends solely on the dish itself.  This presents a bit of difficulty in terms of gaging how much food would fill you. I was comfortably full with what we ordered.

I must say that there was not one dish I did not like at Edulis.  Everything we ate here was rich, flavourful, and a mouthful.

I started with a glass of housemade Szechuan Peppercorn + Ginger soda made with filtered Q water ($3) but found it lacking in either of the signature flavours.  It could've been sweet tea for all I knew.

My partner in dine opted for a glass of Coat Albret Cidre Brut from Brittany, France which I thought was a great drink at $6.

A bread basket along with an olive amuse-bouche was brought out shortly after ordering.  While I loved the crust of the bread, I did not care much for the almost injeera-like texture of the centre of the bread.  

To start we ordered a plate of the Black Perigord Truffle Poached Lobster, Jellied Veal Tail ($32) which came with a fair serving of lobster meat, thin slices of veal tail and large shavings of truffles.  This dish was served lukewarm and the lobster held up against the truffles.  NB. Black truffles are less pronounced in flavour than their white counterparts.

Next up was the Octopus Croqueta, Rice Morcilla, Roasted Onion ($13) which I already knew would be good because the moment they set it down on the table the aroma of this dish filled the small nook by the window where we were seated.  Lightly battered and the paper-thin slices of octopus were done perfectly (read, not overcooked and chewy).  

My 2nd favourite dish of the evening was the Rabbit Porcini Boudin ($15) which was a housemade sausage that was very tender, extremely flavourful and had a nice smokey flavour to it.  Yummy!

The highlight of the evening for me was the Roasted Duck Breast ($19) with braised turnips, Black Trumpets, white bean purée + wild cranberry mostarda.  The textures and flavors just married together very well.

For dessert I opted for the Baba au Rhum ($10) with Chantilly cream and Appleton rum syrup.  The cake soaked up the syrup and the Chantilly cream was a nice distraction from the boozy dessert.  

Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Edulis.  While the ambiance is not the most exciting or fun, it makes for a relaxing meal as the chef takes his time to prepare your dishes from course to course.  When asked what style of cooking they would classify themselves as, the term Bistronomy was used and they prefer to think that they are a Continental European joint not being loyal to any one country's cuisine.

I would definitely come back if good food was the goal of my evening - I'd be extremely interested in coming back for the tasting menu as I spied some delicious dishes being served at the large group table next to us who opted for for the tasting menu.  

P.S.  If you don't like mushrooms, you probably shouldn't come to Edulis.  I love mushrooms and so do they.  Most of the dishes I selected tonight came with some sort of mushroom."}
{"text":"One word - INCREDIBLE.  This restaurant is absolutely fabulous.  The food was just out of this world good, delicious and the service was perfect.  I would recommend this restaurant without hesitation!"}
{"text":"To be fair, I think my rating would be a solid 3.5... Not quite a 4, but better than a 3.

My guest and I decided to try out this place because of all the hype. I went because they had Hay chicken!!! It's chicken people, cooked in Hay... unfortunately they didn't get any of their special chickens in SO we decided to try the 7 course tasting menu.

Yes, it's 7 courses but I'm Asian and we are used to 12. You do leave full but not uncomfortably so.

Highlights for me:
- (Free-kinda) Artisan bread, nice and crusty
- Lamb - perfectly done
- Dessert - the cheesecake with this crazy hazelnut pastry, winner. 

Lowlights for me:
- Clear soup - really? Clear soup?
- Seared pickerel... Maybe it's the fish... Did nothing for me.
- Octopus... Maybe if I liked Octopus more, I would enjoy it more. It was fresh but I didn't find it flavourful.  Octopus should melt in your mouth, not kinda smooshy and slimy.

All in all, it's a nice experience. The place is quaint. Blink and you'll miss it. The wait staff are really nice. If you've never been, go check it out. It's always nice to be surprised at every dish that comes... Just let them know your allergies before the food starts coming out! And it's all seasonal and local, which probably means you should go in the spring and summer, where in Toronto, there's more choice for artisan places like this.

Go leeks!"}
{"text":"$370 for two. 7 courses (fixed menu only) with an added cheese course and 2 oz wine pairings. No truffles. 3 hours. Should have been 2 hours. We were served 3 courses in 2 hours and then 4 courses in 60 minutes. Not good. Server was very professional but kitchen was slow. Dishes are very small - even for 7 courses. I informed in advance this was a birthday dinner but no special attention was given. I expected a candle at least (?).  The bill came half way through dessert. Not impressive especially after long waits between first courses and a rushed 2nd half. Flavours were very good and wines were well paired. One course was \"Fogo Island cod tongues from Nova Scotia\" (Uhm... Fogo island is in Newfoundland FYI). The tongues were previously frozen. They were served with a delicious ragu however. All dishes served just above room temp. No dish even close to hot. Cheeses were incredible. Mushroom consume was perfection. Chicken was mediocre. I can't imagine truffles (+$30pp) adding to our experience so don't bother. The ambiance is tight and (on this night) loud. If you're dying to go, get the 5 course menu and order a bottle of wine. You might get out for under $250. PS. Wait for warm weather. The door opens into a very small (30 seat?) room."}
{"text":"Came here several weeks back and LOVED it!  I had been meaning to write a review, but got all caught up with life.  My wife and I had the 5 course Carte Blanche tasting menu, where the chef picks 5 courses (mostly off the menus) to create our meal.  Like others have said, the 5 course tasting is $50 and the 7 course is $70.  If you're not super hungry, 5 courses should be sufficient, but the food was so good I could have easily done 7.  

Honestly, every dish was fantastic.  I can't recall all the deets since it was several weeks back, but I really would just leave it to the chef to pick what he wants to cook and you will not be disappointed!  I can't quite remember all the dishes, but there wasn't one that made me pause.  I wasn't blown away by the dessert - a rum cake - but it's cuz I'm seriously biased towards chocolate!

Drinks were also excellent.  I also had a couple glasses of red and my wife had some house-made Wild Ginger soda.  All the drinks were very tasty!

Service was excellent.  It's casual and homey.  Tobey, one of the owners, runs the resto and was super friendly.  Somehow our table was skipped for one of the courses, so they gave us a replacement course and then also cooked us the course we originally missed, which was served to us by Michael, the chef, with his personal apologies.  We felt really well taken care of in light of the blunder!"}
{"text":"3 letters. O. M. G. You guys and girls made my fiancé birthday dinner hard to top. Thank you"}
{"text":"First time going into a restaurant that has no menu, the only options are \"5 or 7 courses\". They also wrote \"put your belly on us\" so I trust them without asking any questions. There's no disappointment from appetizer to dessert, everything was very tasty. Servers were very knowledgeable and attentive. The atmosphere was very cozy. They change their dishes every month and I can't wait to go back when its truffle season!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Edulis twice and tried both of their 5 course and 7 course tasting menus. I must say the 5 course was a much better meal with a good balance of fish and meat. The 7 course I found the portions of each dish alot smaller and mainly meat courses. Overall the food is good and service is great."}
{"text":"After coming back from a 3 Michelin Star in nyc, my boyfriend and I were hooked. He took me to this amazing restaurant .. tucked in a quiet area of King & Niagara street. 
The restaurant is small and intimate. They have 3 or 6 courses to choose from however everything is a surprise.. they would of course ask if there were any allergies.  
Overall the food, service, and wine was amazing. 
They explained each course up to the garnish and sauces.
Cannot wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Terrific restaurant, one of Toronto's best. Small and charming, with a limited but excellent menu. Very focused on doing a few things well, evening after evening. Bonus: good wine selection."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and definitely special.

The service, they were able to describe each dish with such words that make you  to eat. Interestingly, the five course and seven course are approximately the same amount of food, but just offers more variety.

This place is primarily seafood, we got three varieties of fish that were delicious. Then the main course was such three ways, it was so well thought out.

And cause this is the place to get truffle and we were sold that white truffle is so much better than black truffle, we splurge on the risotto with white truffle. Wow. The aroma of this truffle was spectacular, just wanted to whiff the smell. The taste, not as distinct as the smell but tastes good too.

Then to end it off, cake with rum. And this want a splash, it was like doused it rum. But also interestingly, didn't have a huge rum flavor, was it diluted? Doesn't matter cause it still tested good!

The space is not small, but not big. You can see the different people, some are regulars. Definitely worth the try!"}
{"text":"Overall a great experience.  The service was excellent and so was the food.  The seafood was amazing"}
{"text":"They often say a prophet is never honoured in his own hometown. This may certainly be the case for Edulis. Located at 169 Niagara St. South of Wellington (416.703.4222/ edulisrestaurant.com). Chef Michael Caballo is an old hat in the neighborhood and maybe the reason for opening his new venture at what was the old Niagara Street Café. The new owners have modestly whitewashed the Café, a cozy venue that Anton Potvin, the most companionable restaurateur in the city, made into a wine lovers' destination, welcoming collectors wanting to show off their cellars. Nemeth is now the maitre d', an ebullient welcomer, while Caballo is in the kitchen.
 
This is a place for the adventurous. If you are expecting the ordinary, stay away. There is really nothing you will recognize on the menu, including the names. From rabbit butifarra sausage and porcini on toast ($13) to baba au rhum ($10). The servers don't make it any easier to understand probably because of the unusualness of the cooking method. Everything is generally earthy and lesser cooked - no everyone's cuppa. I would definitely recommend reading all the reviews to see if this place is for you, before making a reservation and coming out $110 (dine for two including wine and tax) lighter in your wallet."}
{"text":"Honestly, I thought it was just OK at best. There has been a fair amount of hype for Edulis and I was excited to check it out. We did the $50 carte blanche. The service was great, and they readily accepted the food limitations for each person at the table. The biggest misstep was the third course where they served us a dish they had clearly burnt. I can't believe the chef let it leave the kitchen! The other 3 savory courses were just \"meh\". The desert, a blood orange tart, was great. 

Also, don't go hungry. The portions are t-i-n-y."}
{"text":"Finally came here on Canada Day for the 7 course tasting menu
Really amazing flavours & presentation
Wine suggestions bang on 
Dessert on the patio with vintage port"}
{"text":"This restaurant provides you with a food adventure delivering complex flavours with an intimate dining experience! We choose the 7 course tasting menu and every course had fresh, seasonal and local ingredients. I loved how they highlight what is fresh for the season and describe each dish throughly before you dig in. From Nova Scotia lobster to rabbit in four different ways, our taste buds were delighted. Save some room in your stomach for their cheese course before dessert, it's divine. The service was warm and their attention to detail was wonderful. I mentioned that it was my birthday and I received a dairy free chocolate cake with fresh raspberries and a candle. What a lovely gesture! We never felt rushed in our meal and had an opportunity to disconnect as they ask that you do not use your cell phone during your meal. The setting is intimate - candle light all around you and you are dining within a living room of a home, it felt homey. Overall this place is magnificent and a must try! This restaurant definitely exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"December 2016 - 5 course Menu $85

Read lots of positive reviews for this restaurant, and decided to splurge a bit for a belated birthday celebration...needless to say with much regret that we will not be returning again, but let us explore why.

Ambiance of the restaurant was dark and perhaps to feign a romantic setting; maybe quaint is the word to describe it. To be honest, more light would be appreciated, since I wasn't able to see what I was eating. 

Service was awful. Miss Waitress must really hate her job because she made minimal communication with us especially when it came to explaining food (She named the dish and that was it. Also didn't help the restaurant was so loud). It was quite intimidating to see how peeved she was at us when we asked for more time to make a decision on our orders (One of us had dietary restrictions, so reviewing the ingredients is justified.) A big part of the experience is feeling valued as a customer; I did not feel valued at all. Needless to say her attitude was sending patrons running for the hills. At the same time, couldn't be too upset with her since she did put a candle on our cake (speculating an emotionally conflicted lady)...

Food was alright, but did not quite fulfill expectations--we ordered the 5 course menu ($85 each) 

[OK] Bread: The edge of the bread was hard as a rock, but the inside was quite soft. And so, had only 1 piece and discarded the rough edges. It was especially good with the homemade butter.

[BEST DISH] Squid: This was probably the best dish because you can actually taste the marinade in this one! Al dente bite to the squid and the crispy thing on top added more texture to it. The portion was unfortunately quite minuscule--think of a golf ball cut in half. 

[MEH] Seabass + sprocket: Fish was not overcooked which was fantastic and the sprockets made the dish look pretty. Not my favourite, but it was good. Definition of good is the following--think of a boiled chicken breast. It is good for you but bland (that kind of good).

[HELLS NO] Fish & beets: Couldn't remember the exact name of this dish, but it was truly the worse one on the menu. Again, bland (probably boiled) fish in beats with lemon juice drizzled in some kind of extra virgin olive oil. There was a count of around maybe 5 pieces of fish the size of paper clips.

[2ND BEST DISH] Rabbit Confit (leg): Friend says this one was flavourful and meat was juicy. Unfortunately again the size was too small.

[MEH] Icecream + orange: Icecream was smooth but nothing out of the ordinary.

[OK] Rum cake: Was good especially with the chantilly cream (fancy name for whipped cream) since it lowered the cake's intensity of sweetness. 

[NOT WORTH $65] White truffle risotto: The smell was really fragrant, but upon first bite there is no aroma of the truffle at all! It was almost equivalent to eating a crunchy styrofoam atop super salty risotto (so that's where all the salt went!). This is not recommended in my humble opinion even though they did give a reasonable amount of truffle.

TL;DR -- Our bill came up to be $352.56 before tip (~$450 after tip)  which is quite expensive but given the circumstance justified in terms of fine-dining experience. I am not sure why there is such a big hype for this restaurant, but probably because the menus were different from our Dec 2016 selection. I suppose this style of cooking is not really to our palate's liking.  The score would have been higher had we received better service, but we will not return again to find out because I don't like having to visit McD for a second meal after spending so much."}
{"text":"What to say that hasn't been said?   Well, candidly, nothing so I will briefly share our experience. 

Approx $400 for the larger of the two tasting menus with a bottle of wine. 

The service is impeccable.  Specifically, I appreciated the professionalism without unnecessary stuffiness.  I believe Patrick was our waiter although that could be completely inaccurate.  

The table beside us, couple celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary, were lovely and we enjoyed chatting with them.    Chatting with your neighbours  is difficult to avoid as tables are very close. 

Food was good, appreciated the nods to the season.  Nothing blew our socks off.   Others have mentioned this, but I will mention again, the menu is heavy handed with fruits from the ocean.   For us, too much so.   The only non water dweller we received was rabbit, which was good, not great and I would have appreciated a \"meater\" dish after so much fish and seafood.  

This has been on our list for 4 years and I am glad we went but it is unlikely either of us will return."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience with exceptional service. We decided to get the 7 course dinner and we added an additional course of caviar which was 55 dollars a plate. We also added an extra cheese course which became on the house due to a delay between our 2nd and 3rd course. We didn't actually notice a delay but the fact that they stand by their service and product speaks volumes to me. All together it came to about 373, which I wouldn't do very often since we came for a special occasion, but I was informed they have a 40 dollar Sunday lunch which I think would be an amazing way to revisit!"}
{"text":"I hate to give such a highly-regarded place three stars, but here goes nothing.

In the thralls of finding a restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday, it was with serendipitous timing that enRoute magazine unleashed its Best New Restaurants in Canada upon the web. Top of the list? Edulis, a local restaurant, thus relieving me of any need to continue my search. (They also made MacLean's Top 50 Best Restaurants in Canada.) A couple emails later, and our table was booked. (They say an online reservation system is coming soon.) 

Cozy and charming, this intimate restaurant is tucked away on a rather nondescript stretch of Niagara St. just south of King. The juxtaposition of the best restaurant in Canada facing onto a large co-op housing complex is worthy of note, and could serve as an archetype for boosters of mixed-income urban planning near and afar. Anyway, I digress.

Debating between the smaller ($50) or larger ($70) tasting menus, our waitress indicated that the former would be sufficient to fill our bellies. We opted for the latter, and were prepared to have to undo a few buttons. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. 

Look, I get that higher-end restaurants skew towards smaller portions; I have no problem with that, and come to expect it. But if I'm ordering a seven-course tasting menu, I expect to be reasonably satiated by the end of the journey. Am I completely off base here? Alas, if it weren't for the constant re-filling of our bread basket (great home-made bread, btw), we all would have left hungry - and it's not like we have huge appetites to begin with. The blame I think is two-fold: First, many of the dishes were protein-heavy, with very little in the way of carbs. This is regrettable, as the one significant starch I do recall (a side of potatoes in a Djion vinaigrette) was phenomenal. Second, there was way too much downtime between some of the courses. Easily 20-25 minutes passed between some of the courses. Had the intervals been a bit shorter, I think we would have been okay.

Not to say that service wasn't exemplary. As soon as we entered service was fantastic. Water was constantly topped off, fresh cutlery was brought out every meal, and the table was kept spotless. Presumably the bottleneck was in the kitchen. 

That being said, the actual food when it came was superb. Of the seven dishes, four consisted of seafood (herring, mussles, tuna, some white fish), two of meat (veal and sweetbreads, duck two ways), and dessert (ice cream and cookie, shared baba au rhum cake). I'd try to describe them in more detail, but would be doing them an injustice. The food was outstanding - I just wish there were more of it.

Next time I think a better strategy would be to order a few dishes à la carte, and share those. I saw some tables adopting this strategy and the serving sizes seemed substantial. It would also eliminate some of the waiting between courses.

{"text":"Oh this is a cute little restaurant where when you get in, you feel like you're in France again!  Edulis, where do I even begin?  

Reservations are notoriously hard to get but we were lucky to snag one relatively easily.  You can also use the DINR app for last minute reservations.  I believe they are hard to book b/c like most high end restaurants, they stagger their tables and do not turn them over. 

They offer two tasting menus, the 5 and the 7 course one.  If you are hungry, definitely go for the 7 course one.  We were offered a variety of seafood dishes, all of which were absolutely beautiful.  Each dish presented flavours, which danced in your mouth.  Their main courses featured a fish dish and a pork dish.  I was a great fan of the fish dish.  The pork dish, unfortunately, was good but not mind-blowing.  The cider marinade that they put on the pork was quite overwhelming and presented a bit of a bitter taste, which was not my cup of tea.  Dessert was a sorbet with a meringue, which was good as well.  

Service was great and we had a very friendly server who introduced all the dishes to us.  We were really quite happy with our experience.  I can see why Edulis is one of Canada's top restaurants.  My recommendation would be to try Edulis before you can score a reservation at Canada's #1 restaurant (Alo).  The latter restaurant really set the bar high for us...like really really high and I almost felt like it wasn't fair when I assessed Edulis because Alo is pretty hard to beat.  All in all, Edulis was a fantastic experience and I will definitely visit again.  

It was also the bf's birthday and they took the extra time to do something special for him, which was just so sweet.  So thank you, Edulis for a wonderful night!!"}
{"text":"The litmus test for whether a restaurant is \"really good\" or not is the question \"Could I make this at home if I tried\".   

If that is truly the case, then Edulis is a really good restaurant.    Everything was expertly prepared, delicately presented and beautifully sized.   Staff were wonderfully attentive and pleasant beyond belief.

The problem is, the food wasn't that spectacular.   

It's that plain and simple.   I wish I could state it some other way.  

Sure, we LIKED it, but we didn't LOVE it.   

Perhaps some of that was due to the human idiocy that was seated at the table beside us.   A woman who seemed to want the whole world to know that she changes her iPhone case according to the season.  

We loved the IDEA of carte blanche.    Unfortunately, in practice this translated to \"let's feed you an orgy of meat\".     

Perhaps we picked an off night?"}
{"text":"I found this place online on one of the best restaurants of Toronto list; it was my dad's birthday so I wanted to find some place tasty. I was pretty excited for the tasting menu and we both opted for the 7 courses at $85 (the 5 course is $65). 

We arrived at 6 PM and don't think left until around 9 PM, the meal took a while, with each dish taking a bit of time before arriving to us. This was fine as it gave us time to savour the dishes and we were in no rush anyways. 

The food was quite good, the dishes were as follow as best of my memory:
1. Nova Scotia ahi tuna
2. Poached lobster with tomatoes and peppers
3. Scallops and leeks in a tasty broth
4. Spanish mackerel in some divine sauce -- this was my dad's favourite
5. Halibut cheeks and Spanish saucy rice
6. Rabbit two ways, porchetta and pressed 
7. Strawberry and chamomile ice cream - seriously amazing
7.5 Baba o rhum cake 

Starting off with the fish dishes they were very light and tasty. I really enjoyed the poached lobster, the sauce was very good. The Spanish mackerel was incredibly good in this fantastic creamy, but light, sauce. I had never eaten rabbit before so I was a little apprehensive, but it was quite tender and juicy, tasted a lot like pork. 

The dessert was also very good, the strawberry ice cream was fantastic. The baba o rhum is a sponge cake that they generously pour rum over and serve with chantilly cream on the side. When I say generous, I mean super generous, the cake was completely saturated with rum! It was good, but a little strong. 

You can also opt for a cheese course before the dessert. We tried 3 cheeses: 1 from Ontario, 1 from Spain, and 1 from France. I liked the cheese, I love cheese. 

It was a pretty good place, I wasn't wowed, but it was very good. The service was also good. 

I would recommend this for a special occasion because it isn't cheap, and reservations are a MUST~"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the real deal. The dishes were thoughtful and perfectly sized. The drinks were perfectly paired and appropriately priced. The service was impeccable but not overly attentive. It was a real pleasure to eat here. Each of the dishes was fancy but not too fluffy. The ingredients were hearty, but not overly seasoned to allow the flavours to shine on their own. You can really feel the chef's heart and soul in the entire experience. Nothing is 'for show', it's very honest.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special night."}
{"text":"Based on all the amazing reviews I've read, we must have experienced an off night.  

The room and ambience are very nice and there is a great wine list.  Unfortunately those are the only positive comments I have.

I took friends there for dinner as these people are adventurous foodies and I've heard such great things but unfortunately, no one enjoyed their dinner.  It was one disappointing course after another.  There was one course that was good but it was far from outstanding. Extremely overpriced for what we got. Our server was rude. I was embarrassed to have suggested the place honestly. Everyone said they would never go back. There are so many incredible restaurants in this city, I felt ripped off and hungry after 7 courses.

I've never done a review on yelp but this experience was so disappointing that I felt compelled to write this."}
{"text":"Had the best experience here recently. This place only does tasting menus and boy are they good at it. I can't say I enjoyed every dish they served but that was more because of my taste rather than a result of poor execution. The intimate atmosphere was seductive and cozy, comfortable. Dimly lit with flickering candles at each table. Casual dressy. Literally 15 tables or less. You choose between a 5 or 7 course menu (menu changes nightly and even so the server cant tell you what the chef will decide to serve or in what order, I noticed tables next to us were getting some things similar some things different). The difference in the two menus is the variety, not the amount of food. Well worth the extra $20/per for the variety. There was also a truffle scrambled egg dish to add ($20/per) or a truffle fish dish to substitute (dont remember if there was an added cost). Here were our plates: 
1. raw fish salad - sorry i forget the name of the fish or the dish lol. but so light and flavourful, and the fish taste was so clean. the vegetables they used were so tasty together with the fish (im not a salad lover generally)
2. potato puree with shrimp - OMG. mindblown. if you like amaebi (sweet botan shrimp japanese cuisine) you would love this dish.. the shrimp is half cooked in the smoothest potato puree ever.. qnd i have a feeling it was cooking in the puree.. a wonderful explosion of flavours and textures in my mouth..
3. the scrambled egg truffle addition - DIVINE. so beautifully plated, really is a small serving but i was at this dish's mercy (does that make sense?). I can't even tell it's egg. There were bacon bits but this flavour did NOT overpower the other flavours.. There were 2 layers of a sort of airy savoury cream with the truffle infused scrambled egg at the bottom.. it was so smooth.. the taste was so mesmerizing.. wanted to crack the eggshell and slurp the inner shell clean.. every $3 spoonful was worth it. the spoon is half a teaspoon in size lol. 
There was also a risotto dish (very nice), a hare loin dish (not a big fam of game meat but still tried it and it was a heavier contrasting taste compared to the other lighter dishes but had a nice salad on the side), a sausage and fried eel dish in apple salad that i did not really enjoy (bits of eel had too much batter and tasted like oil, i prefer grilled eel, and the acidity of the green apple slices with this fatty eel and salty sausage i didnt enjoy, and a dish with japanese charcoal torched fish.. yum. Very different tastes, textures, international ingredients/techniques used. Really appreciated the creativity and versatility of the chefs!! Was a good 2.5hour meal.. no rush.. romantic music.. i easily mentally transported myself to a virtual doppleganger restaurant set in the evening cobblestone streets of paris and on a patio with the music live in front of you. With each course you get a change in utensils and plates. Servers are quick friendly and professional. This restaurant has a mixed ethnicities crowd. the overall vibe i got was that this was an exclusive restaurant that i was lucky to be at and that not many ppl knew about (despite it being rated top 100 restaurants for the past couple years)."}
{"text":"Toronto's chowhounds formulated a list of their top tables recently, and Edulis, who I'd previously never heard of, was very near the top. I was in town looking for one \"big\" meal, and Momofuku Shoto was the other finalist. The fact that it was 3 times the price ($150, vs $50 for the Edulis 5-course \"carte Blanche\") made it a pretty easy decision. I wasn't disappointed. 

I arrived way too early because I was determined to leave ample time to find parking, and with good cause (residential permitting and a crowded area make parking a real challenge). When incredible luck served me up a front row parking spot, it resulted in being 50 minutes early for a 7pm reservation.  If you can find it, the parking is (amazingly) free.  

The venue is intimate, explaining why reservations are essential (weeks in advance would be wise, if not months). Tables had good spacing and this was a rare occasion where I never overheard another table's conversations (or maybe Canadians are just quieter). 

Meals are not listed on a menu, or even printed each evening, because it may change patron to patron, not just night to night. Our 5 course Canadian-focused menu included 1: sashimi-fresh tuna from Nova Scotia, 2: wild Salmon from British Columbia (both beautifully presented with lots of greens), 3: an undefinable dish with a foundation of asparagus, foie gras (yes!) on toast, arugula and sliced ham, 4: quail with morels (yes!, again), and 5: a dessert with fresh berries, their juice, and a pistachio meringue (I'm more of a chocolate lover, so this was the weakest link for me, but an understandable choice given the seasonality of fresh berries). 

Each dish was explained eloquently, but my memory isn't up to doing justice to the complexity of each course. The summary is: fresh and fantastic, and the price is right. I'd love to come back for the 7-course version (said to be equal in quantity of food, but more variety), and for the Sunday lunch (wines half price would be a pretty great deal, though pretty early to have a $50 Rioja, even for $25). 

I'll conclude with a small example of what makes Edulis special: the bread and butter were so fantastic, I had to ask if there was cheese in either - it just tasted so rich and different from anything I'd had before. I was told that the butter was the reason; I think it may be locally sourced, cultured, and very fresh. It's just an example of how even the simplest things get full attention throughout the entire experience. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"-There are two tasting menus available: 5 courses ($65) and 7 courses ($85), each course is tasting portion (tiny). 
-menu is heavily evolve around seafood and vegetables, thus if you prefer meat, you might not enjoy Edulis as there was only 1 meat dish out of the 7 courses.
-Each dishes were not heavily seasoned which allowed the natural flavors of the combined ingredients to shine. The flow of all the courses made sense: from light to heavy. 
-Food was really good. Only complain is the rhum cake. The cake was incredibly soggy as the server was too heavy-handed on the rum.

SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. 
She was condescending and rude toward our table. She essentially treated us as kids. Maybe she had a bad day, but trust me, I was a server previously and I would never treat the customers in such disrespectfully manner. Why? Because the server's performance at the front will overall affect the restaurant's reputation. 

She promised to provide us the menu of the tasting menu, however after multiple follow ups, it has been more than 1 month and no menu provided. 

The bill & payment issue was a mess. For example: the bill was $100, my friend paid $150 cash. The server gave my friend $150 with the $50 bill broken down... How does that even make any sense? She explained that she didn't want to assume tips. The server then accused us of not paying and murmured under her breath: \"Well I'm sorry if this is too complicated for you to understand\" - her exact word."}
{"text":"Dinner last night at Edulis with a friend was cozy and a great spot to catch up over good food.  We both chose the 5-course carte blanche menu over the 7-course; we were told both menus had about the same amount of food in terms of quantity.  I was worried whether it would be enough, but the five-course was just the right amount of food.  

The fresh house-made bread was served with their amuse bouche of anchovy stuffed olives.  I could have ate that whole basket of bread!  Next courses were fish, one served raw and the other was grilled John Dory.  Both were fresh and wonderfully prepared. This was followed by suckling pig and duck.  These dishes were great for a cold winter evening; they had a rustic, simple presentation yet both very tender and succulent.  Dessert was soma chocolate (served like a pudding) served with meringue.  Not too sweet and a nice end to our meal.  The pace of the meal was served perfectly and the progression of food from each course was well chosen.  

We both enjoyed our small feast but just didn't find it outstanding. Maybe it was just all the hype that I expected more.  Nonetheless, the food was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed every course.  I had two glasses of wine with my five courses and was full after our 3 hour meal.  The small restaurant had a welcoming, warm ambiance and we had attentive service.  The five-course carte blanche menu is definitely a great deal for the price for the quality of food and an enjoyable quiet evening."}
{"text":"I Love this restaurant.  This review is just me totaly fangirling this place.  Edulis has everything that I look for in a dining establishment:  top-notch ingredients, unpretentious preparation, and intimate atmosphere.  The focus here is definitely the food and the diner.  It's nice to be able to go to dinner and not feel inadequate because I'm not wearing a skin tight dress.  The noise level is perfect for a social meal; it's a warm buzzing of friendly conversations without heavy bass beats banging my eardrums. Everything about Edulis is perfection because it is so effortless on the part of the guest yet everything that comes out of the kitchen is so ridiculously mindblowing.

Before visiting the restaurant, I called and asked if we could do a special prix fixe menu because I wanted truffles on everything (they have a small and large carte blanche on their menu).  I told them that we could do around $100 per person and the chef said it was doable.  We arrived at the restaurant not knowing what to expect at all.  I have tried a couple of prix fixe menus over $100 before and my expectations were never surpassed -- once I even found myself eating a hamburger afterwards.  Since I told them I wanted truffle errthang, I really thought we'd get dainty little dishes with sprinkles of truffle soot.  

Man, was I wrong (in a good way)!!  I can't recall all the dishes individually because it's been a while since the meal so please forgive me for the lack of gastronomic details (again...this is nothing more than a personal fangirl post).  The first several dishes arrived and all had substantial shavings of truffle.  The truffles really worked well with the other ingredient rather than upstaging them (which is what I usually find with truffle oil) but still maintaining its star status in every plate.  I thought the chef is going to give us a lot of truffles in a few courses ... but the plates kept coming (yehh =D)!  By the end of the meal, I was stuffed but I still couldn't stop eating because everything was sooooo good.  All the flavours were hearty and relatable.  I was glad that I was't paying for foams and painstaking garnishes.  . such a cathartic experience when you can eat something rare to your palate and be able to relate to it and genuinely enjoying the flavours as supposed to eating something expensive and reacting like \"I don't know if I really like this but there's nothing to dislike.  Everyone else seem like love this stuff so I guess this is good food\".  Even writing this review and revisiting these memories invoke the euphoric feelings my taste buds had that night.  It's amazing how a really exceptional restaurant can create the feeling of happiness and let that feeling relive again every time the diner recounts that meal.  That is what that meal at Edulis did for me and I can't wait to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"We just finished a meal at Edulis. We ordered the Carte Blanche 7 course meal for $85 (everyone at the table has to order the same menu-either the 5 or 7, so no mixy matchy). We unfortunately didn't go for the truffle add-on which would have been an additional $40. 

Since everything is seasonal, the menu I had will not be the same next month. Each dish is about 3-5 bites each with the exception of some of the protein dishes later in the course. They have a delicious house bread sprinkled with sea salt that is all you can eat. Make sure you pace yourself on this so that you don't make yourself overly full by the end of the meal. 

I wouldn't say the food was out of this world, but there was a lot of special elements and hard work that goes into eat dish. 

The service was A Class. The servers were on top of their game, and very knowledgeable about all the courses. 

The venue was very cozy with nice dim lighting. 

A great experience for a foodie at least once."}
{"text":"Bookmark removed! I am so glad we finally got to try this place. If you are not in a rush, treat yourself to a wonderful and intimate dining experience. 

The 5 of us arrived for a birthday celebration Saturday at 630. Reservations are recommended due to the small dining area and they can only accommodate up to 6 people in a party. Our coats are taken and we are seated right away. We decide to go for the 7 courses for $85 rather than the 5 courses. We opted out of the truffle add on for $60. We started with a bottle of cava rosee for $80 and then went with a French recommendation for $60. 

Bread and olives are delicious and they will bring more bread if you finish. 

The menu changes with whatever is fresh but here is what we had:

1. Spanish mackerel with citrus dressing and fennel. My fave of the night. 
2. Heirloom carrot, leek, porcini and chrons (tubar -- root veggie)
3. Scallop and marcona almond, broccoli long pepper sauce.
4. Japanese eggplant with smoked bonito smoked over hay....nagi onions and fried onions.
5. Nova Scotia Hagfish, pureed potatoes and cider sauce. Amazing! 
6. Duck with shredded duck wing and chanterelle mushrooms. Beans and sausage with foie gras.
7. Quince sorbet with pumpkin and pistachio...with fresh persimmon
Sent from my BlackBerry 10 smartphone on the Rogers network.

The meal was 4 hours. I love long meals with good friends. Having said that,  I think it took a little too long between course 6 and 7.

Total cost with tax and tip was approx. $715 for 5 people. 

Definitely a great place to check out on a special (or any!) occasion."}
{"text":"It is still one of my favourite  restaurants. Reservations are hard to come by- they work on a 30 day cycle, so go online thinking 30 days in advance. The tasting menu is phenomenal. The emphasis is on seafood and I find that their meat dishes are my least favourite, however I'm a seafood lover. It is a quaint place, quite intimate, and sometimes you may be close to your neighbours which doesn't always let you have the privacy you may want. I have returned there twice and will come back for more in the future. This time, I splurged on some of the extras and again I have no regrets. It can be a pricey night but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"On vacation in Toronto and we were able to score a late seating on a Thursday night via opentable.   We learned about this interesting gourmand site while it was featured on a foodie show in the US.  As the veggie and foodie in the family, I love the whole concept of local, fresh and inventive. I also like that the chef forages and uses wild edibles, particularly, mushrooms.  Rather than go a la carte, my BF and I put our palates in the hands of the chef with the 5 course tasting menu.  (Note: veggie folks, please inform the restaurant before arriving that you are vegetarian to ensure they have everything to accommodate, especially if you more restrictive in your diet. I am ecto ovo lacto, so they were able to accommodate with ease.)  Each course was amazing.  We started with bit  of olives and oil soaked bread.  My favorite 2 courses were the mushroom sauté and then fresh salmon, which was my main.  We finished with  an inventive dessert made with local berries and fruit.  The whole experience was romantic, intimate (via the lighting) and super friendly, e.g.  \"smothered with love\".  We enjoyed the meal so much, we were the second to last table to leave.   They offer a 7 course tasting, but come hungry as the 5 course was quite filling. Foodies put this place on your radar as a must do when you come to Toronto.

{"text":"Arriving at only two minutes late for our long awaited online-made 6pm reservation, my mid-week dinner date and I were very surprised to see that only one other lone diner was there and that we were to be sat immediately beside him on the banquette. However, over the minutes that we perused the aperitif card, every seat in the comfortably cozy little restaurant filled right up. Hopeful walk-ins were greeted with a business card and suggestion to make a reservation ahead of time (which I imagine is at about a month out at this point).

After some debate, we decided to leave the fate of our taste buds to the chef by going with the carte blanche. Taking into consideration my date's shellfish allergy, they were thankfully still able to accommodate the smaller, which turned out to be just right. 

We started with a glass each of Lillet Blanc and Lillet Rouge before moving on to a full bottle for dinner. The olives stuffed with spicy peppers although tasty, proved to not be spicy at all. A steady flow of freshly baked bread and butter interluded our five courses, which included, (pardon my loose descriptions), fish tartar with radishes on shrimp cracker, poached salmon with pea shoots in chicken jus, baked pork saucisson, braised lamb cheek, and dessert of fruit and meringue crumble. 

The rustic decor and side street location paired with the friendly service and delicious food of Edulis made it an understated, yet fantastic experience.

My only minor complaint would be that sitting literally next to the coffee grinder made conversation difficult at times and the constant smell of coffee also mildly affected my full appreciation of later dishes. The decision to seat us in the corner might have been understandable if we had arrived late, but as the second table to arrive, it would have been nice to be rewarded with a more central or window seat."}
{"text":"Blown away by the large tasting menu. The menu was seafood-heavy and everything I tasted was delicious. My favorites were the prawns two ways, lamb and the smoked catfish. Have to admit I shuddered when I heard catfish because it can get fishy if not prepared right, but this was so delicate and mild I wish I had more on the plate! The shallot soubise it came with was so good I wanted to lick the plate...The preserved peach with elderflower jelly had the perfect balance between sweet and tart. This was the splurge meal of my visit and did not disappoint. Servers were very knowledgeable and patient about explaining the dishes and answering questions."}
{"text":"Came here in the dead heat of summer after a 3 week reservation with my other half. I've had this place marked for some time, specifically coming for their truffle menu. We were lucky to experience truffles in the summer months, as they were flown in from Australia. We ordered the extended 7 courses, which felt like a marathon to get through. Normally I'm up for the experience, but 4 hours was a little long... and after a bottle of wine and some cocktails, I was ready to Zzzz. I do want to mention that we received a cocktail on the house, which was was nice gesture. 

Food was well executed, and very seafood-centric. Ingredients were high quality and presented thoughtfully. Not sure why the largest plate (Whole hen served on hay) was served at the end though, I was pretty full by that point. 

Expect some smoke coming from your wallet -  but if you can fork over a handful of Benjamin's, everything is worth trying once!"}
{"text":"I came here for their Sunday brunch (with half price bottles of wine), and had an overall excellent experience. 

The food was generally very good, the ingredients were high quality, and the flavours were all unique and delicious. My friend and I both agreed that their fish dishes were significantly more delicious than their meat dishes, and their vegetable dishes were okay, bordering on good.

Their wine list was great, and our waitress was able to make two excellent recommendations. 

I would highly recommend ordering their scallops as an extra; they were fantastic! As well, we ordered three cheeses with our dessert, another modification that I think elevated the meal.  

We paid $250 for 2 people with two bottles of wine, and extras including cheese and scallops. We left feeling very full and spent 3 full hours at the restaurant. In my opinion, the price was quite fair.

I'd recommend it, and I will be going back for dinner to see how it compares."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating

Essentially there are only 2 options on the menu, either the 5 course for ($65), or the 7 course tasting for ($85). 
The food was good, but i wasn't wow-ed. What I didn't like was all the dishes were very fish focused (3 of the 7), and they weren't much of my liking except for the first course, yellow tail sashimi - very refreshing and flavorful. Second course was the mushroom which was my favorite dish of the night - tiny diced king oyster mushroom mixed in with flavorful dressing. Third course were shrimps, the meat was cooked perfectly, really soft. Fourth course was salmon with asparagus, this was just okay for me - the salmon was a bit overcooked for my liking. Fifth course was a fried cod, but the cod was soggy being served in the sauce. Sixth course was a veal served with sausage and short rib. The short rib pieces were really tough. The veal was good but nothing special. Surprisingly from that dish I liked the sausage the most. Last course was dessert, some kind of sorbet like ice cream served on top of Mascarpone cheese.

One thing that bothered me slightly was our waiter didnt explain our dishes with much detail unlike the other waiters. When I asked him what the main difference between the 5 and 7 course is (in regards to the food options), he couldn't even say....but he's been serving these dishes all night right?
Regardless i enjoyed my experience here. Be prepared for a 3 hour dining if you go for the 7 course tasting."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Edulis after hearing a lot of rave reviews.  We were very disappointed with the March menu and sad to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing. By far one of the best prefixe menus I have ever had. Every single dish was perfection. I highly highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wish I had a quiet, intimate evening sampling the tasting menu. Although it wasn't the restaurant's fault, my entire time there was overshadowed by the rude table behind us who were drunk and talked at near-shouting volumes the whole night (it was a long 3 hours...) There were only 6 tables in our half of the restaurant and it was clear that the other patrons were disturbed by the noise.. 

As for the food, we got the 5-course tasting menu with the chestnut dumpling-truffle add on. I really wanted to try the white truffle risotto but it was just too pricey at $80 each person and I think at least 2 people at the table had to order it. Each course was tiny but tasted light and delicate. The portion sizes left me craving for more... We got scallops, mackerel(?), squid and a lobster/chicken dish. The chestnut dumplings with truffles were really nothing special and I don't recommend getting them. We also ordered 2 cheeses before dessert: a camembert and gouda and both were delicious. The desserts were probably the strongest-tasting part of the meal... we got a tangy citrus buffalo milk froyo (?) and a slice of rum cake to share that was realllyy heavy on the rum flavour. 

The restaurant decor and service were unpretentious. Overall I think this is a restaurant worth visiting for special occasions."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant.  Really lovely atmosphere and ambiance, but the service was decidedly lacking.  I arrived a bit early for our reservations, and they had a table ready for me, but I was completely ignored until my husband joined me.  I would have loved to order a drink, but wasn't even asked.  The serving staff also forgot to bring us our additional scallop supplement... at the prices they are charging, I feel that they can step the service up several notches.  The food was tasty, but not outstanding.  If a couple is going to pay close to $400 for a meal, I expect much better service."}
{"text":"There is no secret that our dining experience in Toronto left so much to be desired.  If someone asked me if I wanted a blank check I would probably say 'yes' at first but after our experience at Edulis, I now say that carte blanche can also be carte blah!

We really wanted to like this place and they really tried hard but I think this was a case where Dr. J and my taste buds are not ready for this type of culinary freedom!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  It's truly one of a kind and I would recommend it to any food lover.  We made reservations for lunch on a Sunday, as they offer a $40 six course menu and half priced bottles of wine.  The food is French inspired (not Spanish like this site says), and each dish is thoughtfully put together.  You can really feel the love that the chefs have for cooking in the dishes.  The restaurant itself is quaint, the service attentive, and you feel far removed from the city.  The restaurant takes you somewhere for a few hours that isn't Toronto."}
{"text":"I have been saving up my Opentable points for my meal at Edulis. 

I love surprises so of course I ordered the 5 Course Carte Blanche Menu ($50). Was it enough food? For me I rather have a culinary experience than just a lot of food if I do I would have go to a AYCE.

Our 5 course consisted of a mixture of fish, pork, rabbit, all prepared quite uniquely. From the light hamichi appetizer to the heavier rabbit main course. Since everything is seasonal so what I had was not really relevant as it might be totally different if I would have the dinner tonight.

The restaurant itself is small and cozy. Service is attentive and the pace is laid back. So come and enjoy good food with your friends over a glass of wine. 

Reservation is a Must! Great for Foodie Date!"}
{"text":"Edulis was fantastic, every step of the way. I loved that it was a fixed menu and they had lots of recommendations along the way for wine & accompaniments. 

Our server was patient, and seemed to really enjoy what she did. Friendly, elegant and observant.  

Each course arrived in a timely manner and was well thought out and tasty. The cheeses especially were excellent, as was the port that was served with it. 

The decor was inviting and cosy, with beautiful flowers everywhere. A lovely jem on the west side of King."}
{"text":"HOW DOES EDULIS NOT HAVE AT LEAST A 4.5 STAR RATING ON YELP?!?!?

One of life's great mysteries. Seriously, I've been here several times and it's easily in my top five favourite restaurants ever."}
{"text":"Easily one of the most beautiful and special meals I have ever had, Edulis easily lived up to every positive review I've read. The dishes were carefully crafted, the flavours were simple and yet stunning, and the service was beyond anything I've ever experienced. 

I could go through and list everything I ate (we ordered the seven course menu), but you won't have the same menu when you go. Some of the plates are smaller than others, but there are some larger protein dishes mixed in. Each dish was exceptional. The bread and butter are the things dreams are made of. I kept trying to remind myself not to fill up on bread, but our server refilled our bread after we finished the first basket and it was so warm and crunchy and the butter had these beautiful hints of, like, i dunno, caramel? maybe ... I can't even. 

By far my favourite course was our starting course - something I can only describe as a ceviche salad with limequat. Apparently my spellcheck doesn't think limequat is a word, but wikipedia says otherwise. Anyways, it was magical. 

I would like to especially thank our server, and while I don't know her name, I think if she were to come across my review she may remember us and see this particular shout out. You went out of your way to ensure we were well taken care of, especially my best friend, and I couldn't be more thankful for your hospitality."}
{"text":"Total rip off. This restaurant was all hype and in the end we walked out knowing we would never get that time or money back.

First mistake was doing the truffle tasting menu. For $150 a head I could have spent my money better at another restaurant. Let me preface by saying I love eating out and have no problem spending money on good food. I love truffles. This was not a truffle meal to love. Truffles were only in 3 of the 7 courses and none of the courses were delicious. I kept trying to find amazing flavor but after each bite came back bland and boring. From the first course I knew we had over paid but since we were already along for the ride I wanted my moneys worth! That did not happen. 

Secondly, it took forever! Our reservation was at 7:30 and we didn't make it out until 10:45. And we did not loiter around, we wanted to get out of there! The service was slow and the meal dragged along in an uncomfortable way. 

My suggestion; don't eat here."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

Their set lunch menu! 

I wasn't expecting much and I also didn't know what to expect because I thought it would be a typical brunch/lunch menu!

This restaurant is really small so it definitely gives you a cozy feeling. I say the restaurant can fit at most 25-30 people. 

Most of their ingredients are sourced from organic farms. I was wowed by their first dish which is their soup of Farro Verde. The ham from El Rincon Joselito was just utterly delicious!! The flavor from that ham was just incredible.

The bread was made in house and was freshly served in a cute bag. Even though there were a lot of dishes, I liked the balance of veggies to meats and seafood. The flavors of the dishes were impeccable. 

We also ordered the scallops which were freshly deshelled to order. The simple addition of garlic and butter with some minced parsley got our mouths drooling because we could smell it from the other table as they were getting their order of scallops! The scallops are additional add ons to the fixed menu though. 

Overall, though this was a filling lunch, I would say it has been one of my best lunches I had in Toronto because just the ham itself, was worth my visit to this restaurant. The Sunday cake that they made which was an espresso cake, was also a great dessert to end a happy meal. 

LAST TIP?!

The scallop is worth the order in addition to the fixed lunch menu because you can smell the sizzling scallops fill the entire restaurant the moment they take it out from their kitchen. If you like ham, you'll like the ham here which is from El Rincon Joselito!! The fixed lunch menu is not cheap ($55 pp) so I recommend you to save this lunch for special occasions!! And lastly, all their bottled wines are 50% off on sundays! Take advantage of that!"}
{"text":"No nonsense fine dining at its best.

Edulis does not try to impress with fancy decor or colours and shiny objects. Rather it puts all of its efforts and focus on what matters, the food.

Each dish is meticulously crafted to bring out and compliment the natural flavours and textures of the seasonal ingredients.

Delicious, simple and memorable. My wife and I went all out and got the 7 course with white truffle for our anniversary. The element of surprise, not knowing the menu made the dining experience a lot of fun and special.

We were there for 4 hours, but they flew by, like nothing,

The only dish that was slightly below fantasticx was the aged duck breast, which was a little cold and chewy.

Yet everything had a delicious earthen flavour, all lead by some delicious root, be it an onion, leek or garlic, sometimes pulses, and greens.

One of the standout dishes was the soup with foie gras and an old hen broth... I had no idea those menopausal birds had such delicious bones... (kudos to the knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff)

Can't wait to go again! (Albeit, not anytime soon, without selling an arm/leg)..."}
