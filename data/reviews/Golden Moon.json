{"text":"I've been here plenty of times and have never once completely ordered for myself. I love the cold milk tea but every time I try to order it, the waiter looks at me like I'm from outer space and my friend takes over for me in Chinese.   Aside from the language problem, food here is quite good. I've tried quite a variety of things but really enjoy their fried rice, beef in black bean sauce, and the stir fried snow pea leaves (I've never had this before until this restaurant).  We like being seated in a booth and usually can unless it's very busy.   Service, aside from my language problems with the milk tea, is pretty good. They bring food out quickly, replace tea quickly and always ask how things are (I'm assuming... they ask in Chinese to my friend). You do need to waive down someone to get the bill but that too comes quickly and things are pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Weekday Lunch deal is really good $6.90 for an entree plate and coffee/tea after.  Curry Beef, spice was good for my palate, but too much for others in our group.   Tomato beef, tasty and satisfying.   Shrimp & Noodle Dish was ok, but under seasoned.   Portions of all the above are very generous, and we had leftovers to take home.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Golden Moon was previously known as Aroma Island. My family and I noticed the menus are quite similar, if not the same.  As far as I know, this restaurant is always packed during dinner hours on the weekends. You'll notice the waiters and waitresses running around, trying to do five things at once.  For dinner, there is a combo menu with about 75 dishes to choose from. You have to pick a minimum of three dishes at $25.99, and each additional dish costs $8.50. Not a bad deal! The combo also includes their daily soup and dessert (usually red bean soup). You can check out their menus here: http://www.goldenmoon.ca/menu.php  It is not the best Chinese restaurant in town, but for its price and and quick service, my family dines there every now and then. We usually go with the combo menu because the portions are decent and the choices are not bad. Our favourite on the list is their sweet and sour chicken (or pork). It always comes hot and crispy, and each piece of meat is always a good size.   We have also tried their eggplant dishes, but they always seem to be too oily. The preserved olive minced pork green beans is good (it reminds me of the same dish at Chiu Chow Man). The salted fish and diced chicken tofu casserole is not bad. However, there is little oxtail in the oxtail hotpot in XO sauce.  We had relatives over on Saturday night, and we wanted a quick and easy dinner, so we ordered delivery. We used to always order from Chiu Chow Man, but we have noticed a change in their food quality for a while now...so we decided to give Golden Moon a try. With only a $3 delivery charge, we ordered sweet and sour chicken, pork chop with pepper and salt, preserved vegetable pork belly, preserved olive minced pork green beans, stir fried Chinese broccoli with salted fish, and beef brisket with turnip casserole. I was a little disappointed with these dishes because it did not taste as good as I remembered. Perhaps it is because the dishes have been kept in take-out containers, but the pork chops tasted re-fried, the sweet and sour chicken was really soggy, and the green beans were stringy as though they were not prepared properly.  All in all, my family and I enjoy eating at this restaurant once in a while when we do not feel like cooking at home. However, we will probably not order delivery again if we don't have to."}
{"text":"This place 100% exceeded my expectations. The parking lot is a little chaotic on weekends, but don't let that deter you. The service is quick, prices are cheap and this is GREAT Chinese food. If you have a craving, don't hesitate to try this place. I ordered the veg fried rice ($7) and I've had it as two separate lunches for leftovers. The won ton noodle soup ($4.50) is also a really big portion. For next time, I think I'll try something in the clay pots. They looked interesting!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the years, can only comment on their veggie options. My favorite dish there (sorry forgot the name) is a tofu/hot pepper stir fry. Very good.  Everyone I have gone with to here liked it -  they were nice the staff, and it's always busy so if going with a group plan ahead."}
{"text":"The most authentic Chinese restaurant in Mississauga. Stansars dishes like wonton soup with shrimp and fried surprisingly delicious. On Saturday night it fills up quickly by 7:00 pm."}
{"text":"Went for a family bday dinner.  The place was packed!  And I think it was a weekday night.  We got a combo dinner and it included:   *Soup (of course! pork broth with chunks of carrot) *Shredded chicken salad (cold and zingy-rice wine vinegar, sugar etc). *Lobster (stir fried with ginger and green onion) *Steamed fish (soy sauce and ginger)  *Sweet and sour pork (self-explanatory) *Green beans with pork  *Stir fried crab (ginger and onion-I think this was an add-on not part of the combo)   Everything was made really well, everything was demolished, the only thing that made the dinner less enjoyable was that it was way tooooo crowded.  Aisles were tight, every table was overcrowded with seats.  This made the room overheated as well.    So delicious meal, too bad we ate with sweaty brows."}
{"text":"Came here for Peking duck and lobster.  Was during Chinese New Years so service was a little slow but the understandable.  But serving of lobster and Peking duck was definitely smaller than what it should be (2lbs lobster) food was decent though. It's good but can go to another place"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best service, cleanliness, and food quality in southern Ontario (Markham is excluded).   They have great fried noodles, fried rice and all classic Cantonese lunch items. There are great milk teas and coffees included in their lunch specials. Classic dessert puddings are available too.   Dinners are quite good as well, but the dishes have gotten smaller to avoid raising prices with increasing price of produce/groceries.   I really love this place because it is a family run, owned and operated Chinese diner that has been consistently good through the years and has not disappointed me yet. The family is very sweet and still recognized me despite my multiple year hiatus.   They accept cash and debit, but bring cash."}
{"text":"Golden Moon is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Mississauga.   I originally found out about this place in 2014. My in-laws wanted to give it ago because or their peking duck combo. The peking duck and rainbow chop did not disappoint.   I've since tried several of their other dishes such as their half deep fried chicken, beef soy sauce rice noodles,  fried pork chops and several of their hot pots.   Every dish I've tried is normally fresh and great quality!   Service is pretty decent too. If you frequent Asian restaurants , you know not to expect much in terms of service. Golden Moon hasn't been too bad, and their staff are pretty friendly.   Another reviewer mentioned the crazy parking lot -  and I have to agree. This doesn't really reflect poorly on the restaurant,  but seriously this plaza typically attracts the world's worst drivers.  If you're looking for HK style Chinese food in Mississauga, this is definitely one of the places to go!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Chinese food we have ever had. We ordered through Skip the Dishes and the food came quite quickly. We ordered ginger beef, sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, a vegetable dish, dry ribs, and spring rolls. There was four of us eating and not one of us liked even one item we ordered, we threw it all away and ended up eating soup and sandwiches instead. The ginger beef was stringy and the sauce bland, the chicken was impossibly chewy and again the sauce was bland. The rice was dry and \"mealy\" and the vegetables were slimy and over cooked. We phoned the restaurant and the response literally was that the food was \"fine\" and we were probably unaccustomed to what these dishes should taste like. Totally unacceptable response and as you can see the dishes we ordered were quite standard and I have actually had better from a mall foodcourt Chinese restaurant. All in all a very disappointing experience and total waste of money."}
{"text":"Service is not that great - even in Asian restaurant standards.  Sat down and had no tea or menus for the longest time.  They don't take away your empty plates (we had a big table - and ordered lots of food so we were running out of space), and don't refill teapots unless you ask them every time.  Food is not good, but not horrible tasting.  We ordered a bunch of noodle and rice dishes, but there was very minimal toppings and they tasted very bland.  90% noodles, 5% toppings and 5% oil.  Yuck.  This might explain why the prices are so low.  Would not come here again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Mississauga. The food is great, the service is considered good for a Chinese place, and it's inexpensive! One of our go places to eat at with family and friends. Our kids love it as well! Always packed and busy, but usually the wait is not too long! The free in house soup is delicious, so is the sweet and sour pork!"}
{"text":"This one of my fav Chinese resto go to place! Hong Kong style black Milk tea is bomb! Friendly service!"}
{"text":"I am completely shocked at the complete and utter deterioration of Golden Moon. Usually, this place is fully packed because of its food (service has always been poor); I should have therefore known that something was wrong when we called to make reservations on Canada Day and they (very surprisingly) had room! In fact, when we entered, the place was quite empty, a stark contrast to its usual hustle and bustle.  The temperature, with humidity, was near 40? on Canada Day - imagine my incredulous surprise when I realized it felt almost the exact same temperature indoors as outdoors! It was like they decided to cheap out and save on AC fees. I have never experienced a more uncomfortable dining experience; as I ate, sweat continuously dripped down my back, neck, and forehead. Unbelievable. It was like they were trying to force customers to eat quickly and get out as soon as possible.  Indeed, we had not even finished our last dish when a waitress hurried over with dessert, saying, \"Oh, it's about time! Have some dessert, you're almost done your meal.\" She even had the bill with her. I don't understand her rush at all, as the restaurant was still quite empty. Service here had always been poor, but this time it felt hostile and rushed.  The food, which has always been the main reason for our return, had deteriorated significantly too. The dishes were much smaller than before - it was almost like they were skimping on both quality and quantity. Their salt and pepper pork chop was nowhere as well executed nor delicious, and the braised beef brisket with radish was an utter disappointment. The brisket wasn't tender, and the flavours lacked depth. The XO oxtail pot was good, but there were few pieces of oxtail.  Will NEVER come again for dine-in!!"}
{"text":"Simply put, Golden Moon is not good and it's not terrible per se....it's edible, pretty 'meh' food. I did not eat in the restaurant, but ordered it off of Skip the Dishes. I ordered sweet and sour chicken, beef and broccoli, dumplings, and veggie spring rolls.   The dumplings were the so called highlight of the meal, but did not come with any edible dumpling sauce. There were two sauces in my dumpling box - one I assume was supposed to be sweet and sour sauce that smelled like terrible alcohol and the other, a spicy paste.   I prefer when my sweet and sour chicken does not come pre-sauced so that the breading on the meat doesn't get soggy, but this is my personal preference.  The beef and broccoli was extremely mediocre. The beef looked old and haggard; and the seasoning was something left to be desired.   It's also worth noting that none of the food came with rice. Perhaps this is the norm in Calgary, but now where I'm from in Houston, TX. Although, I never eat the rice anyways, but this may be an important point for some people.   Despite the subpar food, it did come within a reasonable amount of time and it was piping hot. However, this is not enough to persuade me to eat from this establishment again. Save your money and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery form here four times and have not been disappointed yet. The food is hot and fresh. I've enjoyed all of it from appetizers to rice  and chow mien. I'm getting hungry just writing this review. So I hope you found this helpful."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch several times and the food has always been good. They have decent lunch menus, including a beef brisket soup noodle for less than $5 (insane!). Most lunch menu items average around $7, and come with a drink (HK milk tea, HK coffee, etc). The service is fast and friendly, and the place is clean. The bathrooms are a good size (but no change table for babies).   Some of the highlight dishes include an XO chicken stir-fried udon, and their chicken curry. Their staple stir-fried soy sauce beef rice noodles is also a favourite, judging by how many come flying out of the kitchen. I personally like their chicken wings too, but I'll be honest and say I haven't sampled a lot of chicken wings in the Mississauga and Toronto area.  Would I come here again? Probably. Especially since I'm here almost every other week with my in-laws. Ah, maternity leave."}
{"text":"Tonight my family and I have our dinner at Golden Moon for the first time. Parking wasn't an issue, since it is inside a plaza with good number of parking spots. I made a reservation at 7 for 7 people. We arrived on time, and the place was packed. That's a good sign already.  To make it simple, we ordered a 8 people special combo (7 dishes and soup) plus a lotus leaf wrapped fried rice. Surprisingly, 6 dishes, soup, and rice were served within 10 mins. The only dish taking a little longer was the steam fish. It made me wonder if most of them were pre-made, or 'well prepared'. In term of the portion, each dish was in good size. In term of the taste, they are pretty decent, especially with its price point. Sweet and sour pork was pretty crispy and yummy. House special shredded with jelly fish & chicken was good too. If I need to pick, Sauteed dry bean curd and tian-mu bamboo with hot chilli was probably what I didn't like. It was a little too spicy for my taste.  Service was good, staffs were friendly. Overall, I think it is a decent place for family dinner with great value."}
{"text":"Family of 7 having lunch now... Quick service and very reasonable prices.  Time to enjoy!!  Delicious.  Disappointed about men's bathroom; rated half a star because stall door wouldn't lock so you had to hold it close, no paper towels or hand dryer, and hand soap. Ugh"}
{"text":"Great food. Reasonable prices. We had sliced chicken  with black bean sauce, curry chicken, sweet and sour chicken with white rice. The black bean sauce chicken was tasty and tender. The curry chicken was good but not something I would reorder again. I'm used to Malaysian curry chicken from the wife. The sweet sour chicken was good too. Again, second night in a row, no air conditioning. Front door was propped open, but it didn't help because it was 36 degrees even around dinner time. Other than that it was very enjoyable. It was very busy there. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different in this plaza for a change.  Oh, and Chi's had a lineup out the door at 1pm...  Ordered curry beef brisket noodle soup,fried rice noodles and beef, braised tofu with vegetables on rice, and some noodle appetizer that my mom wanted.   Service was quick and the food was all good.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Standard take-out Chinese fare that's above average quality. The ginger beef and salt and pepper squid are two of the tastier items."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, and I'm super unimpressed.  I've came here before and I only rated it a 3.  This time it broke my rating to a 2.  The food here is not good compared to all the other places you could eat in the area and I will def not go back to eat there again.  I ordered noodle soup with brisket and my mother had wonton noodle soup a classic Chinese lunch meal. We were very surprised with what they decided to hand over to us.  The service wasn't good. The waiter was upset we didn't order anything else, the soup was extremely bland and watered down and my mother's wontons were obviously reheated from frozen and was still cold inside. Her shrimp in the wonton had a very strange flavor to them AND SHE ONLY GOT TWO. What kind of cheap idea is for wonton soup to only have 2 wontons??   Her dishes were dirty, the plate on the button still had stains and liquid sauce from another use (it was obvious). Both our bowls were chipped heavily. And our cups were sticky.  She stopped eatting, and was too afraid to be rude to the waiters about it. I walked out immediately and swore to never go back."}
{"text":"This place has a great mixture of selections for a range of budgets. Their food is a solid choice for Chinese food; quality and taste is there. We love their meal sets and have spent many dinners there. My only complaint is their portions are ever diminishing...but there's a wide variety to be had. I love the goat hotpot (although they advertise it as lamb?), their shrimp stir fry and sweet and  soir is quite tasty. An easy choice for lazy days/dates"}
{"text":"You know those typical Chinese restaurants? Where everything this is loud and happening? That is exactly this place but a bit smaller.  Really good food actually, I don't know the names of the food I ordered in English or in Chinese either. Usually my mother knows some special menu where she orders great food.  Still would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Okay service has improved.  Ordered fried tofu and salted fish and chicken fried rice.  Food is decent, good for family dinners but nothing extraordinary"}
{"text":"Two of us arrived at Golden Moon on a Saturday night feeling tired and hungry.  The restaurant is pretty busy, bustling with activity (usually a good sign for Chinese restaurants).  We ordered their 3 dish combo (comes with 3 dishes of your choice from their combo menu, plus soup and dessert) with two white rice.    The dishes we ordered are: -pork chops with onion and sweet sauce -tofu plus three kinds of mushrooms -Beef brisket soup wok with turnips  The dishes came quickly and the food was tasty (worth noting that the plates were pretty large).  The pork chop was sweet and tasty and I liked the texture of the tofu and sauce in mushroom & tofu dish.  The beef brisket soup wok tasted good but not particularly memorable.  For starters, we got the pork bone and chinese vegetable soup and for dessert we got the tofu with sugar water.  Both items were yummy and in line with my expectations.  They had a lineup at the door when we finished eating, so the waitress pretty much rushed us the bill and then rushed (kicked) us out the door.  Excellent Chinese food, poor Chinese service, cheap prices.  I recommend them for their food if you don't mind lousy service.   3.3 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Back in the days before Yelp the good old fashioned way to find a new restaurant is just follow the crowd and see which place is busy.  Well searching for some dim sum in Mississauga near my house I came across this exciting new find but apparently I'm not the only one. They have dim sum from the menu (no cart service) and since I'm not a traditionalist let's try this I say it. The crispy tofu was a hit good and almost gone. The crispy noodle wonton soup with shrimp dumpling was excellent.  The pork dumplings only ho hum and the weak link was the fried octopus which was to rubbery and greasy.  For only $20 we had enough food for almost four people.... Portions are big.  I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Large menu with plenty of options, lots of seating, and quick service. Overall, a good place to grab some authentic Chinese food.  We tried a variety of their noodles-- beef brisket chow mein, pickled cabbage rice noodles, and silver noodles. We also tried their fried chicken appetizer, which was crispy and salty! My favorite was the chow mein, though all were good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great quality chinese food with a reasonable price too.  On average about $9 a dish.  The quantity is perfect and we are usually able to finish everything without being too filled.  This place to quite busy on a weekday too."}
{"text":"Craving for fried rice so we came to this place for lunch because the other place we wanted to go was very busy. We ordered Yangzhou fried rice, it was big portion and it actually tasted good.Also we ordered dumplings and salty pepper deep fried chicken from appetizer menu. 6.50 dollars you get 12 dumplings and they are not frozen from supermarket. The chicken was alright.   Don't order the curry beef briskets. Does not taste thatgood and not worth the price.   So we seceded to have dinner here tonight. For the fried rice lol. We ordered fujian fried rice, it was so tasty as the other fried rice. Also sweet sour pork was amazing too. A little crispy outside and the flavour was just right! Hk style clams was so good as well. It's a bit spicy, with minced pork on top. I like this place now. Food is so good! They serve free soup and dessert at dinner!"}
{"text":"Alas, the Yelp page for Golden Moon is officially on the website. I have previously visited the restaurant with friends and family.  Today, I ventured here during a cold, winter night with an empty stomach and a desire to eat great Chinese food. Equiped with my trusty Android phone (Yelp app downloaded), I was ready to Yelp serious. We were greeted by the waiter and was told we were to wait. After waiting approximatly 5 minutes for a table, we were seated near the windows.   Opening the pages of the menu, we quickly decided our dishes to order. Our dishes consisted of: sweet and sour pork, curry chicken, gai-lan with stir fried beef and steamed seafood rice.  As the dishes arrived steaming hot, we started devouring in. The sweet and sour pork tasted great, with enough sweetness and a nice crunchy, fried bite in the pork. The curry chicken was flavourful, with sauce of perfect consistency and fresh ingredients. The gai-lan tasted great (surprising since gai lan is not my preference) and a good 'wok hei' taste. The special, steamed seafood rice, tasted great. The rice was flavoured from the seafood and the seafood itself tasted delicious. The food filled my stomach and satisfied my hunger.  With great food, requires friendly service. Golden Moon provides consistant yet average service. The wait times for the food was acceptable. The waiters/waitresses were responsive.  The decor was nice and consistant. The atmosphere is a great for families.   Golden Moon is serves delicious food, at a affordable price. The service is average and the atmosphere is family friendly. Golden Moon deserves 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend this restaurant to families seeking great food."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat Chinese food without having to drive all the way to Scarborough or Markham.  It gets busy in there but I have not had to wait as long as I have at other Chinese restaurants in the area to eat.  The food is good, especially the Chili Calamari!  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Golden Moon is my favourite Chinese restaurant. Service is good and fast. Food is delicious and cheap. Their meal combo are so affordable. Best place to bring your family or big group as they have those big round tables that could fit 10 peoples. Their sweet & sour pork and Tofu & fish pot are the best! And I like how their meal always come with house soup and dessert. I recommend this place to people all the time."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. The specials are a pretty good deal for the price you pay. Had the Peking Duck special and comes with a few other dishes and it was $50.00 before tax. Recommendation: House Special Sweet & Sour Pork"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the past reviewers on here have had much Chinese food or if my order was placed during a busy time period where it was neglected and rushed, but my experience with Golden Moon was quite subpar. Sure, the price is right, but when it comes to buying food already prepared, quality always trumps quantity. Having never been into the restaurant to rate the service or ambiance, I can only review the delivered food I ingested.   The Sliced BBQ Pork, coming in at $11.95, consisted of a heaping portion of pork large enough to feed a small family. Unfortunately, the pork had fattier cuts, some almost inedible as they were essentially just chunks of pork fat. The soy-and-oyster-based sauce they used was minimal. The key here is hoisin, a key ingredient that I didn't taste in this dish. Have you had unsalted fatty pork before? It's an accurate way to describe how these slices tasted - chewing on flavorless fat.  The Chicken in Curry Sauce ($12.95) was not much better. The sauce was watery, bland and once more lacking adequate sodium to bring out the flavour. A lot of people love to hate on MSG. I'm by no means claiming it's good for you, but that Umami flavour it brings out in Asian dishes is half the reason you keep coming back to the buffet. Dare I ask yet another question - have you had unsalted curry sauce on meat before? It's totally vile, seeing as how curry is naturally bitter, so it absolutely must be balanced out with salt. Back to the dish - the veggies tasted pretty fresh - albeit totally flavourles - and the meat was not under or overcooked. 3/5 for this one, but it could have been a 4 with more flavour.   The Special Fried Rice, ringing in at $10.95, was filling but nothing memorable at all. It was slightly soggy and sticky - a losing contender to real fried rice. The shrimp was definitely overcooked and the pork chunks were hard as a rock. I tossed half of it away after eating the meat.   With so many restaurants offering a variety of Chinese food, I find it extremely difficult to understand how places like Golden Moon stay alive. The food was boring, tasteless and unimaginative. I don't order take-out or delivery simply for the pleasure of dropping $50 on food I can make at home out of very few pantry ingredients and a frozen tray of meat. The restaurant business is a competitive one and run-of-the-mill Chinese establishments should start taking themselves more seriously in an ever-changing market."}
{"text":"As of this writing, half of the reviews of Golden Moon say it's fantastic, and half of them say it's terrible. I wanted to come in and be a tie-breaker, but unfortunately I can't, because Golden Moon's neither fantastic nor terrible.   Picture the westernized Chinese food that you'd get in a shopping mall food court -- that's what Golden Moon provides. Don't order it if you're expecting authenticity; do order it if you're craving enormous portions of meat coated in sweet, sticky sauces. That's what I was looking for, so I finished the meal satisfied, with at least one entire extra meal's worth of leftovers."}
{"text":"Hidden amongst the rest of the restaurants, there is Golden Moon. Decent decor for a Chinese restaurant. Been here a few times and each time I look forward to come. Service is good. House soup is a great starter. Sweet and sour pork will stop you from eating the mall crap. Order the Braised Beef Brisket and with a side of Minced Pork green beans. Silky tofu dessert however wasn't silky nor did it have enough of the stick and sweet ginger syrup.  Can't go wrong so lets hope GM stays the same."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in mississauga solid chinese food everytime.   House special soup always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"I don't usually venture out to Sauga for food (since the GTA area often has better Chinese food). But I happened to be in the area and tried this place out.  Overall pretty solid Chinese food! Got the $25 for three dishes, soup, and dessert. I especially liked the beef brisket & radish dish because the brisket was really lean (the way I like it). Price is reasonable compared to other Chinese places."}
{"text":"I came here twice recently.    On time during dinner it was quite busy, we ordered 4 items, 2 of them came wrong.  Once I came for lunch, ordered the lunch special, the noodle dish was cold, so they took it back to make it hotter.  It came back smelling burnt but the food was not burnt.  They didn't clean the wok which caused the food to absorb a char smell.  Sounds like one offs but not very impressed."}
{"text":"Golden Moon is one simple Chinese restaurant that does foods the legit way, at reasonable prices.  The hand-shredded chilled chicken and the oxtail stew in a sizzling stone pot are very tasty that I would highly recommend.  Brimming with flavor, the oxtail stew is seriously a must-have!  I had to order an extra bowl of steamed white rice so that I could pour the broth mixture of the oxtail stew over the rice, which made a delicious hearty meal in itself already!"}
{"text":"Went there last weekend with a group, and the food was what you'd expect from a restaurant at this price point. Ordered 3 items from the combo menu, but didn't have the best experience: at the end of the meal, the last bite I took had a piece of rigid, metal wire lodged into the meat. Luckily the piece was horizontal, but still hurt as much as one would expect when biting down on metal using the force of your molars.  Placing 1 star not just for that, but because of the service afterwards. Although the server was apologetic, the manager did not even come to our table and did nothing more but instruct the server to give us 5% off on the bill. We also did not receive the dessert that accompanies the combo, but by this time we were pretty repulsed to ask for it.   There are plenty of other restaurants in the same plaza, so I would rather take my chances elsewhere."}
{"text":"We ordered a three dish combo and one bowl of rice to share. The bill including taxes was only around $34. The combo included an appetizer soup and a sweet tofu dessert.  Now onto the food, the Hong Kong style shrimp was great! This was deep fried shrimp with crispy white chips (not sure what they are), chopped bell peppers and ground beef (I think it was beef but also could be pork). I also enjoyed the king oyster mushroom with snow pea. This dish was just stir-fried king oyster mushroom and snow pea. There was no soy sauce or oyster sauce taste to it. For our third item, we got the Kung pao chicken, which was too spicy for my taste, and contained some very small chicken bones and chopped ginger that I had to spit out.  I've eaten at this restaurant few times, and I can say that their Peking duck was decent. There was more skin than the meat, (apparently that's what authentic Peking duck is like) and the pancakes to wrap the duck along with pieces of cucumber and hoisin sauce were one of the best that I've ever eaten. I've tried their sweet and sour pork dish, which was okay. I didn't think it was any different or special compared to other Asian restaurants that serve sweet and sour pork. Overall, many dishes I've tried were good, but I wouldn't order that Kung pao chicken again, and watch out for chopped ginger in some dishes, because that has a strong taste.   Service can be slow and inattentive, and despite English menus, it may be difficult to order any food items if you don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin. You will have to pay cash if you order a combo."}
{"text":"I've come here numerous times already but my latest visit was anything but a dining experience worth returning to.  Service here was never the greatest but it seems to have reached an all-time low.  Usually, there are older female servers who despite not understanding english well, have basic knowledge regarding customer service and etiquette.  However, my latest visit was hosted by a particular younger male server who was extremely pushy and rude.    I came here with my parents for Christmas dinner and he kept trying to push us to order specific combos for our large group with fixed meals that we did not want to order.  He would not listen to what WE wanted and kept trying to upsell other meals.  Also, since my parents do not enjoy nor do they frequently eat out, they wanted me to order for them.  This wasn't possible since he kept grabbing the menu out of my hands and addressing my parents on what to order.  This occurred PLENTY of times during our visit and is unacceptable for any business.  Me being younger does not equate to me being less knowledgeable about the food we are eating.  As a paying customer who had expectations for a lovely Christmas dinner with my parents, I am appalled with the disrespect and prejudice towards my age I was regarded with. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I wanted to try different Chinese take-out places in the area and found Golden Moon which opened fairly recently.  Golden Moon is a take-out only place so if you're expecting a nice sit-down dinner then look elsewhere.  Their menu items range from Peking-style pork chops, palace-style prawns and Cantonese chow mein; throw in there Calgarian staples like ginger beef, sweet & sour pork and salt & pepper squid.  The lady who took my order on the phone was quite nice to talk to and understood me well considering we had some allergy issues and I noticed they have cashews on the menu.  She assured me extra care would be taken with the food prep.  We ordered: Ginger beef, salt & pepper squid, Cantonese chow mein, hot & sour soup and two orders of steamed rice.  Our bill came out to just a bit over $50.  Long are the days of Chinese food being inexpensive in Calgary.  I'd say it was worth ever penny.  The food was nice and fresh the ingredients were well chosen and you can taste the flavours of the ginger in the ginger beef unlike many places that just pile up the sugar.  After two full bellies and lots of leftovers I'd have to say we were quite happy with the new place we tried.  We asked for no MSG which was great because we weren't downing full glasses of water afterwards.  Their food was never too salty either, it was mostly about the flavour.  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that my Polish fiancee would go to for authentic Chinese food. We always order the dinner specials. You can pick 3 dishes from over 50 items, and it comes with soup and dessert. While the portions are small, the flavours and quality more than make up for it. Our favourites include the deep fried squid and beef tenderloin in black pepper sauce. We've also had the lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork (really crispy and saucy) and the seafood vermicelli casserole. We always have enough leftovers to last us another meal!"}
{"text":"Why is this food like a drug? I'm not joking.. this is serious.. I mean, okay, let me tell you.. like everything I tasted, it was so good, that I was trying to look for one thing to go against it and Nothing. Every dish I had tasted like my taste buds were going to leave my mouth for another relationship.. I know that's weird but that's what it felt like, lol.. I'm ripped. Anyways, this is what I ordered. Smiley face:  Yang Chow fried rice Chicken wings Lobster (Ginger & Onion) Me and my sister asked for 'Chili Fish' we got Jelly Fish instead and we knew from the texture and look of the fish, plus the lady told us over the phone.. if we would of known, we wouldn't have ordered it.. Good thing we did.. it seemed raw but very delicate and different, I can't explain it but it was both me and my sister first time trying it out and I don't regret it.. although it wasn't bad.. it's a bit to Jelly for me, lol but try it for yourself you might like it. I forgot to mention I got spring rolls too and everything was delicious!! You need to try it for yourself and let me say Amen to the delivery guy and restaurant.. Bonus because you guys know chinese take out can well over be over an hour for delivery to arrive. Not this place!! They arrived within 20min with everything.. the lobster is good, and comes with a decent amount of meat. This had to be the Best Chinese food take out I've ever had.. I thought the one was in Owen Sound but never mind that. It's here! I have to come here again. I also forgot to mention, we got curry chicken as well because of somebody posting a photo of the curry chicken on here!! It was so so good.. I don't Ever order curry chicken from Chinese but it was so flavorful and a little kick of spicy and Alot of gravy and meat!! Easily enough to share with 3 people. Me and my sister both Loved it."}
{"text":"The food is hit and miss but the hits make this place wortwhile. They hands down have THE best sweet and sour pork. And I'm usually not into sweet and sour pork. It's crispy and they give you fair chunks of pineapple. Amazing stuff. The HK style shrimp was great as usual. Avoid the fish in this place though. It's not their expertise."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is in the central area for Asians. This is one of my favourite restaurants to go eat dinner with family and friends. Service is great and seating area is rather large. We went here for lunch and they have a special lunch menu ranging from $6-8/meal. Each lunch meal comes with a drink and I usually get a cold milk tea (cold drinks is an extra 75 cents). Food came out quickly and everything was fresh. I got beef and chow mien - a little bit too saucey for me, but I didn't mind it too much. Note: to use debit/credit machine, your total needs to be over $20 and lunch menu is debit only."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this restaurant through a family friend. Typical HK Cha \"Chan tang\" kinda place but it didn't disappoint. The prices are a steal for the amount of food you get, but that's typical of all Chinese restaurants like this. They have cheap lunch specials that come with a drink (lemon tea, milk tea or soya milk). I really enjoy the beef ho-fun here but not so much the Cantonese style chow neon (these two dishes are my staples I usually order). The \"Ha Moon\" vermicelli is good too.   Came here with the family last week for dinner and we were all pleasantly surprised. Waiter recommended the set dinners as we were getting indecisive about the single dishes. Set dinner for 4 came with chicken, steamed fish, lobster and bok choy for 51.99 I believe ( was too tired to look at the menu and just let my parents do the ordering). Everything tasted great! I'm MSG sensitive and he starter soup didn't have as much as other restaurants. The lobster wasn't overly salty and even my brother enjoyed it (literally finger licking good). Overall we were very impressed and the parentals even suggested dining there again the very next day! (Rare occurrence). Would come again for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty good (maybe the best) Chinese food in Sauga. I'm highly critical since I'm from Markham. Been here for the lunch specials and dinner combos. No wonder it gets pretty packed now"}
