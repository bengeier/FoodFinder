{"text":"Tried to eat here three times during a convention at the hotel, it was way too crowded and we couldn't find a seat. Staff didn't try to help or acknowledge us for a good 15 minutes that we wandered around looking for a table. They should at least change the whole \"seat yourself\" concept during a convention that thousands of people attend, doesn't work well."}
{"text":"Took awhile to get someone to take our order. When my burger came out, it was undercooked. By the time it was returned, my companion was done eating and had to wait for me to finally eat. Very slow service. The place was pretty much empty but it took us an hour and a half for lunch on a week day."}
{"text":"This place is your average sports bar. If you are looking for good beer and bar food this is the place to go.
The service is really good and very helpful. I only got an hour for lunch and they were quick and efficient. 
The downfall is the food it's definitely bar food for a reason. I had a chicken club and it wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! I had the wings and truffle fries. It was hot and delicious. I only wish they had speciality drinks on the happy hour special. Overall a good good and beer stop."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Burger cooked wrong and it took 20 minutes to get it replaced. Definately not a place to visit if you have less than 2 hours for lunch.  Entree prices good but $3 for regular ice tea :("}
{"text":"This place sucks. Disorganized, overpriced, burned food, and \"service charges\" on my receipt all mean that I won't be back."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Hyatt while attending a sci fi convention across the street. Networks was the place we would go when hungry or thirsty in the evening hours. The food was good and we tried several dishes. The sushi and seaweed salad, spicy chicken wrap, blackened fish sandwich and sweet potato fires were all delicious. The drinks we had were expensive but the waitress Valerie told us the ones that gave us the most bang for our buck. She was great! At times the crowds were horrible due to the convention but we always found seating and would get served fairly quickly, so not sure why this was an issue in other reviews."}
{"text":"Worst service ever guy in pink shirt! Waited 45 mins for tacos. Food is good when you can get it. Gave the place two tries for better experience."}
{"text":"Probably the worst food i have ever tasted, i physically gagged after attempting to eat.  The service is terrible, the waiters were very rude and snobby, and i saw one picking their nose- that cant be sanitary, as he manhandled everyones food as he dropped it and spilled constantly. Overall, if you want food poisoning and snotty service, go here."}
{"text":"Poor service & dirty glasses.

Asked server for a wine recommendation of the \"biggest\" wine they have. She said, \"They are all the same size.\" !!!

Ordered a bottle of wine and server gave us the bottle with the cork still in it. Waited another 10 minutes for them to come back to uncork it. 

Glasses have lips smudges on them even after they were clearly washed because they gave us them soaking wet. 

The. Worst."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Hyatt for the 2013 comicon and my group ate here twice and drank here every night of the con.  As the food goes I do not have a single complaint.  It was all extremely good and none of us had a bad thing to say on that front.  But the service was severely lacking.  Also, the drinks are really expensive for the amount you're getting.  I don't mind paying $10-$17 a drink but I'd like more than just a swig of mixed alcohol.  If you're downtown looking for good food and don't mind slower service check this place out."}
{"text":"Guest of the Hyatt Regency for the last 5 days. Had an hour to grab a quick lunch. Ordered chicken tenders. The worst food I had ever tasted. Very dry, no flavor. Ate it anyway and left the roof of my mouth sore from the dryness of the food. Disappointed as I was hungry.  Slow service.  The final kick is when the waitress refilled my iced tea. She didn't wash her hands from cleaning up the other guest table because she left a mayo stain on my drink glass(see pic)."}
{"text":"I remember coming to this place for happy hour a decade ago when staying in downtown Phoenix as our office was nearby... I remember liking the downtown Ally McBeal happy hour crowd (sans the suits, of course).

So, when recently staying at the hotel and stumbling back after bar-hopping downtown, we decided to have a night cap here. Now, a scotch is a scotch after 5-6 of them (to me anyway) so there was nothing special going on with my drink. BUT, when I asked how soon until the kitchen closed, the bartender said 5 minutes but was insistent that I order whatever I like... I verbally expressed that I felt bad that I was ordering so late but he was really cool about it and said the cook would not mind...

I just thought that was really cool... I was actually expecting him to be a dick, but he was really, really cool... my bad... Nevertheless, I politely ordered something easy to cook - a chicken quesadilla... 

Uh, oh... bad choice... for a Hyatt hotel bar, I would expect something a lot better. How do you f up a quesadilla, guys? It was so soggy and bland that now I wonder if the cook DID mind and served me something from the garbage. Too late to complain, I was already in my room... Let that thing stink up the hallway...

4 star bartender
0 star quesadilla"}
{"text":"A good place to eat if you want a quick bite.  Service was very friendly.  Lots of television monitors.  Food was adequate and filling.  I had a turkey wrap that was quite satisfying.  Our server was a funny guy.  Just came for a meal and not for the drinks."}
{"text":"Two people I met here stand out in an extremely positive way. Kevin behind the bar and Taylor serving the tables have refreshing attitudes, great skills, and genuine care for the respectful customers. And while no one should have to experience disrespectful customers, I saw both of these individuals treat disrespectful customers with nothing but respect. Whether it's training that influenced this (not likely) or just two people demonstrating skills that very few people have, I hope the decision makers for the Hyatt corporation recognize that they are blessed with a couple of gems. 

The atmosphere is noisy, casual to dressy, food is typical for a restaurant/bar atmosphere. If that's what you're expecting, you will leave here feeling like you've won."}
{"text":"I'm thankful this place was up for grabs on Groupon! Had it not been, I would have never ever even thought of walking in to this upscale looking bar craving a mouth watering $10.50 veggie burger! The service was friendly and professional. Burgers came in huge portions so I recommend skipping an appetizer. I was sad that i couldn't finish my fries. And I'm a total sucker for fries. I'll waste just about anything but not my fries. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Better than average hotel bar.  Food is decent (why can't places with chefs make fresh French fries?!  Arrrrgh!!!) 
Bartenders are really good guys.  Decent booze in the speed rack.  For those not in the know, that's how you judge the class of the establishment.  If Smirnoff & Jim Beam are well, it's a place that values good booze.  Attend during happy hour for this to earn 4 stars, otherwise it's 3."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest serving place in Phoenix. We are still currently sitting at the table. It took us 15 minutes to get water, another 10 minutes to place an order and now it's been another 30 minutes and we still don't have our food!!!!!

If I wasn't so hungry, I would get up and walk out right now.  The service is so slow that we decided to go ahead and pay her bill, yet we don't have our food yet. I don't have time to be here for the next two hours.

I cannot imagine what it would be like trying to get in and get a quick breakfast before you head out on your day if you're business traveler. It would be much simpler to order room service, or just go to Starbucks.

So, before you ask the obvious question... The restaurant is only about 15% full. LOL"}
{"text":"Very average Place. Its part of Hyatt Hotel, and totally looks like a Hotel bar/restaurant. If your in the area, and your starving, or if your staying in the hotel, it will do. Service was not very friendly, overall very \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Decent sports bar in the city. OK bar food and plenty of beers to choose from.
Service was always good."}
{"text":"A guest of Hyatt hotel for business. Just arrived to town and needed a quick bite before our meeting started. Great service. Checked on us mutliple times. Wait time for food was decent. Has the south west salad. Clean facility."}
{"text":"Food is standard for a bar. Nothing to write home about, yet better than a lot of Phoenix restaurants which isn't saying much. Phoenix has hands down the worst food and service in any city I've visited to date. 

I ordered take out from the bar. The young bartender was flirting with these two ladies from out of town. I paid the check via credit card and was waiting for it to be returned. However he couldn't find it. He somehow misplaced it within the one minute of him having it. After 10 minutes of him checking everywhere for it, he finally found it. He had given it to the girls he was flirting with."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's just been an ordinary average sports like restaurant. Not bad but not the greatest that is until the other night. The service was soooo slow, thought the waitress forgot our drinks. We ordered apps and it tasted like it was defrosted in the microwave. My friend ordered a basic lemon drop martini and what was brought was this itty bitty $13 tini that was way over priced. Totally not worth t especially when you can get a bigger glass, better quality and better made tini upstairs at the upscale Compass for equal if not less than what Networks charged. Very disappointed... Won't be back for a loooong time. New management maybe? Something needs to be changed... And bring back the cheese curds damnit!"}
{"text":"Before I make my complaint about why I gave this place two stars,  I want to say that I ordered a cheeseburger with fries and it was one of the most delicious burgers I have had in a long time.  The bun seemed to be a brioche bun,  perfectly cooked beef as per my request with a nice char-y taste.  I did have to send it back to melt the cheese, but when it came back it was perfection to me.  The fries were not made well done as I asked but they were tasty fries.  They probably ignored that request because the place was filled with people attending the Phoenix Comicon.  Too busy to bother.

My chief complaint was the RUDE, ARROGANT, ALL-KNOWING, older, african american man tending to the bar (I was seated at the bar because I couldn't get a table.)  Made a face when I asked that the cheese on my burger go back for melting and then went on a rant after I started eating it.  So nasty and rude that I don't know how this bar could keep him employed.  I ignored him and ate. BTW,  when a customer asked for another napkin, he turned around and grabbed about 20 napkins, slapped them down on the counter next to the customer who had requested it, and said: \"how's that?\" The answer to  \"how's that\" should come from the owner of this establishment.  That generosity with the napkins, which was repeated by this bar person twice while I was there, does not fare well for the owner who is LOSING MONEY because he is giving away an unnecessary number napkins.  If he does that 100 times a month, go figure.  Businesses are won or lost by pennies at a time and not dollars.  
I really didn't not appreciate this man's attitude so even though I totally enjoyed that burger, I will resist going there again."}
{"text":"Haven't had the chance to eat, but I've definitely had a chance to drink here!

They make this pomegranete mojito and martini, which is delicious!!!!  The bar gets really tight and noisy especially when there is  a convention going on, especially when there's a HAIR SHOW going on.  All the educators get drunk stupid, hyphy!!

The bartender we had was JP and he was so attentive.  Scott was cool too, but he wasn't as attentive as JP was.  When we were dry on drinks it was easy to get another round!!"}
{"text":"Anthony was an excellent server and made a lovely suggestion for food and drink. The chicken sandwich with fresh avocado was amazing. This restaurant is definitely a nice attribute at this Hyatt."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with a dive bar menu. Cold beer, good service and decent burger.  Surprised they don't elevate the food."}
{"text":"Good food but sad service. Stopped here for lunch today before the opera. I can't fault the server but it took us 40 minutes to get served. They need more cooks or something. What would have been a special afternoon turned out to us having to \"woof\" our food down to get across the street to the opera on time. Too bad. My Reuben was pretty tasty and Susan liked her fish sandwich too. We have been here many times but this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a nightcap late one night on our way to our room.  The bartender was friendly. We just had drinks and they were just okay - definitely not very memorable.  I had the pineapple jalapeno margarita and I wouldn't order that one again. My husband had the Cadillac margarita and it was pretty good"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good downtown spot for sports, drinks, and bar food favorites, look no further! The quesadillas are particularly delicious!

Kyle is the best waiter in the whole place with his friendly fun and attentive style. He's really the reason why we keep going back!"}
{"text":"Only reason we ate here (amongst all other downtown Phoenix restaurants surrounding us) was because it was in my hotel lobby and the Elite 8 basketball game for Uconn and U of A was on. 

 Food was alright, nothing too WOW! Although their Tortilla Soup was pretty good!   Drinks were normal priced $12 bucksish  and no happy hour on weekends."}
{"text":"Service with a SMILE! Warm and inviting, and the food was ok for finger foods if you're not interested in having a large meal and just want to pick.  What topped the icing on the cake was that the Manager would come by your table and ask if everything was to your liking...now THAT deserves 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Not a bad Turkey wrap and plenty of TV sets focused on football as they have the Sunday Ticket. I was just wandering around the area after the auto show and found this place attached to the hotel. The wrap (with a few key substitutions) was loaded with lots of turkey, veggies and Russian dressing and the fries, although frozen, were hot and fresh. Did not have any service issues at the empty bar and the guys were pretty talkative who were working. All the games were available for consumption and the wrap was reasonable at 11 bucks for a hotel bar kind of place. Not worth a special trip, but if your in the area, yes go for it."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, just horrible.  People that came way after us got food long before us.  Waitress never really checked on us, and we waited a long time to even place our order.  Based on prior reviews this appears to be a perpetual problem.  I won't return, everyone has bad days but when you have a string of reviews like this and nothing has changed you are not worthy of my time or money.  Also, food was blah."}
{"text":"The worst chicken club I have ever had in my entire life. The driest wings ever. but at least the service is good which really doesn't mean anything"}
{"text":"I spent four nights at the Hyatt Regency for a conference this past week, and I visited Networks Bar & Grill like eight separate times during that trip. I hated it at first--it's called Networks, for fuck's sake, with a globe in the O surrounded by arrows. It just struck me as a bleak bore of a conference hotel bar, and when I walked in on my first night at 10PM, the lights were so bright and the noise level so high and buzzy, that I actually turned right around and went up to my room to read.

But Networks grew on me over the course of my stay, even as I realized how depressing it was to spend all my time in a place with literally no atmosphere. (The sports bars in the surrounding area of downtown didn't seem that much better, and hey, this way I only have to write one Yelp review to cover three lunches and four drinking sessions.) There was, at least, plenty of seating, and I hung out at various points at the bar, in a booth, at the high tables, and on the patio. The lights went on strong at night, which was awful, but the space was much more pleasant and relaxing during the day. Service was quite good. The staff did a great job keeping track of tabs over long stays, and they were always friendly and responsive. I did hate their Networks Bar & Grill T-shirts, which boasted corny phrases like \"You can't spell wine without win!\"

I ate three lunches in Phoenix, all of them at this bar, between two and three in the afternoon, when I got hungry enough to roll out of my hotel room and start my day. I think I was the entire lunch crowd every time, though there were always people around (other conference goers, some of them friends, who joined me for a chat or a drink). The food was surprisingly not terrible. On day one, I had the Baja tacos, one shrimp and one wish, which came with a side of chips and salsa. The fried shrimp was kind of tough and stringy, but I liked the fish, which was nicely breaded and reasonably cooked. The tacos came on corn tortillas with jalapeño slaw and a thick drizzle of chipotle mayo. The slaw was heavy on shredded lettuce, but I liked the zip of the jalapeño and cilantro and red onion. The chips and salsa were fine, too. I added some of the salsa onto the tacos, and that worked pretty well. Day two, I had a pulled pork sandwich (part of me thought I should eat healthy for these total throwaway meals, but the other part was starving by 2:30 in the afternoon). This was probably the most successful of my lunches, a mess of slow roasted pork and chipotle BBQ sauce with jalapeño slaw on a challah bun. It came with a side of seasoned fries, which were okay, though totally ignorable. The pork was pretty juicy and smothered in tangy BBQ sauce, which goes a long way towards making something delicious. Nice balance with the slaw, too. Day three, I had the jalapeño burger, a thick cheeseburger stacked with jalapeños, pepper jack, chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato, garlic and aioli, served with the same seasoned fries and some pickle on the side. The patty was decent, and I enjoyed the generous layer of jalapeños.

Mostly, though, I came to Networks to drink with friends, sometimes multiple times a day. It was a useful hotel bar--very convenient and not notably overpriced, with a solid happy hour. I drank a lot of Four Peaks Hop Knots and Kilt Lifters--the local brewery's IPA and Scottish ale, both on tap and $3.50 a pint during happy hour. On my last night, a tall glass of Jack and ginger put me over the edge into wonderfully wasted territory--I ordered a double and got a water glass filled to the brim.

Networks isn't really a 4-star establishment. I'd never seek it out, and unless I go to another conference at this exact hotel, I doubt I'll ever go again. But after so much time together, I've grown strangely fond of the place, throwback Earthlink logo and all."}
{"text":"$13 for a sangria that is subpar and you can't even taste the alcohol in? Ridiculous.. I will not return here. Side note the cheese curds were great"}
{"text":"Limited menu but service is somewhat spotty. That's important because it gets packed when the Hyatt hotel hosts conferences. So, we ended up here three different times during our stay. When it is crowded, you may as well just forget it because the service is lousy. If there is no one in but you and your friends, then the service will be ok ... at least that is our experience. It is expensive for what it is, and there are far better within a very short walking distance of the hotel. But you pay for the convenience if you are staying at the hotel and it is indeed convenient. The drinks are somewhat weak as well ... especially for the price. The fries were good once when they were warm, on the other occasion they were cold, and the service was so poor I did not even finish eating my wrap. The chips and salsa are good, but way way overpriced. Expecially, when you can go across the street and get unlimited chips for 3.00 instead of 8.00!"}
{"text":"I have been staying at the Hyatt this week and have made this place my watering hole. Good prices. Great people. All of the guys behind the bar have been pleasant to talk to. And they will even let you shamelessly flirt with them. Max makes a killer margarita, Ryan pours a good whiskey and is adorable, and Kevin will be your bouncer if a creeper is making you uncomfortable. A great spot if you are conferencing, but I think I would come here often if I were local. I hope I have a reason to return."}
{"text":"Max is the local maximum at this Hyatt's restaurant/bar in Phoenix. By definition, he presents the value of a function at a certain place (or domain) which is greater than or equal to the values at all other points in Downtown Phoenix. His recommendation of bar favorites including the grilled chicken beast with avocado was the bomb. He works his domain well - thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great Food. Not great service! 
We were staying at the hotel and came here for breakfast.  The food was excellent but the service was lacking. We had to ask for someone to take our order after no one had come up to us after about 10 minutes.  They also did not keep our drinks topped off even though it was not a busy morning. She came up once during the entire meal. The breakfast sandwich however was one of the best we have ever had.  They also have a buffet option with hot and cold food.  The hash browns also tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich, cheese quesadilla and two house chardonnays, $44. Food was great but 10 bucks for a glass of wine is too much for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Poor, poor service.  Food was ok.  Waitress Emily had an attitude from the start.  Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Networks Bar and Grille @ the Hyatt can be counted on for CLASSIC burgers, Reubens, cold drinks and a FUN crowd from around the country. Sports Bar par excellance."}
{"text":"Burgers and sandwiches, lots of fried food...thats pretty much all that is here. I was disappointed they didn't have their sushi on the weekends that are advertised in the rooms here at the hotel, but I guess the restaurant worked in a pinch. I ordered a salad with chicken, dried cranberries and blue cheese which was pretty good."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We went here for downtown pub crawl in search of the $1 drinks that had been prominently advertised. By $1 drinks, they actually meant $1 off overpriced glasses of shitty wine (with the \"discount,\" Beringer White Zinfandel was only $7.50!). We made the mistake of asking Jason, the douchebag of a manager, to either honor the printed special or do *something* to make it worth our while to have gone there. Instead, Jason not only turned away our party of eight without offering any kind of special to make up for the false promise of $1 drinks, but also  gave us attitude for trying to take advantage of the pub crawl specials.  I don't think I've ever felt less welcome anywhere I've been."}
{"text":"I loved the huevos rancheros. Different style than I'm used but it was delicious. I would have r liked it to be hotter when it arrived but the flavor was good.

My server, Jerry, was lovely. I real enjoyed her company and conversation. 

I would recommend staying here at the Hyatt and eating in house. Make it easy on yourself."}
{"text":"networks is located in the hyatt regency phoenix. it's a pretty cool sports bar-- they've got several large screen tvs for you to watch any game that's on.

i liked that they had booths as well as high-top tables available in the restaurant. 

we went two nights in a row for some drinks and a snack. my husband is totally ecstatic that they have fat tire on tap! his favorite beer. we can't get it where we're from.

we had the same server both nights. the first night she was pretty chatty (she talked to us for more than 10 minutes about her vacation to hawaii (because that's where we're from)) and it was a little too much for me. i hadn't seen my husband for over a week and i was on a date with him! but, she was really nice, nonetheless. she was very prompt with service and always got us refills, even without us flagging her down!

the second night, it was a lot busier (probably why she didn't stick around to chat) and we had my sister-in-law and her husband join us. her husband ordered a burger, and it was the biggest burger i've seen stacked that high in my life! he said it was really good. i liked the chicken tenders covered with parmesan-garlic. ask for honey mustard sauce! soooooooooo good!!

hopefully the next time we're back in phoenix, we'll make it here again."}
{"text":"Came to this place after seeing a wonderful show at the Symphony. It's one of the only restaurants open before 4pm on a Sunday afternoon downtown and within walking distance from the symphony. Walked in with my mother and aunt and after a few minutes of not being acknowledged, I tried to flag down the server that walked by. \"Excuse me, excuse me, EXCUSE ME!\". She ignored me and I heard a voice from another female voice from behind tell us that we can seat ourselves. We sat at a booth...it was fairly crowded. 

We waited for about 10 minutes when a gentleman walked by and gave us 3 menu. We were ready to order since we looked at the menu posted in the window outside but before we could tell him that, he ran off. About 5 mins later, we witnessed the female server that ignored me earlier walk to every table in front, behind and beside us but completely avoided our table. She did a full circle and pleasantly talked to every other table but ours. At first I thought that she was just making her rounds but nope she never came to the table to even acknowledge us. \"Maybe she isn't our server\", says my aunt. 

About 5 mins later, the male (I think he is one of the managers) that have us the menus asked if he could get us something to drink. We told him we were ready to order and as we were ordering the female server (Emily) walked by and was going to tell him that she could take it but he was almost finished. Emily brings out our drinks along with some paper napkins and requests that we return to her the cloth napkins and silverware that we were provided when we sat down. She said something about we only need spoons. 

Ok, I'm over this story and getting more annoyed as I sit here still in this place that has AWFUL service so I'm just going to close with this...THIS PLACE SUCKS and Emily needs some customer service training (acknowledge your customers!). Never again."}
{"text":"I have now learned to avoid The Network's Bar and Grill.

The main reason is the poor service.

Anytime anyone pops in staff should greet the customer

These folks ignore customers frequently.

SIX times this year I was TOLD that the Downtown partnership 20% discount is NO longer accepted - which is a bold face LIE.

The restaurant staff merely HATES to deal with their inept manager who HIDES the required computer card for this discount from them.

THANKFULLY there are DOZEN'S of options only steps away.

Although I've been to the Networks OVER 3,000 times since it opened some 15 years ago, it now will be my last stop if that."}

{"text":"My coworker and I are staying at the Hyatt for a technical communications conference, and we ate here yesterday for lunch. She had a cheeseburger and I had the Asian Sesame salad. The prices for food aren't bad, but the drink prices are a bit steep (they do have a happy hour, at least... but neither of us got drinks). 

The food was fine, although it took a little while for it to come out to us. The service, on the other hand, was really off. The poor waitress had tons of tables to take care of, and our water ran out, and when our checks came, it was almost like she threw them at us (weird). The salad I had was mostly iceberg lettuce with tons of noodles, but the portions were good for the money. I really expected better service and probably wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a bite to eat when staying at the adjoining Hyatt! Open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Networks Bar & Grill has plenty of options to choose from. They're staff was friendly and the food was good as well. Plus, they have a bar if you're just looking for a place to sit and get our of the heat. I went for breakfast and ordered their pancakes, which were great. The berry/fruit topping was a nice touch, but the seeds were on the hard side and took away from the experience. Fortunately, the flavor still remained after scraping it to the side, so I was still able to enjoy it. If you're in the area, or staying at the Hyatt Regency, I'd recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Hot fresh food and friendly service made this hotel restaurant a convenient and delicious stop at the end of a long day of travel!  Good choices on tap and a hot quesadilla made a yummy dinner. The veggie quesadilla was filled with fried onion and green pepper with generous amounts of cheese. Very basic but good."}
{"text":"Had a huge group of kids. They accommodated us, provided separate checks and were grateful for our business. Doesn't always happen with large groups. Thank you to our waiter, Ryan."}

{"text":"Service so unspeakably bad, that I will Yelp about it instead.

Stopped for a drink before the Symphony.  It was a little busy, but nothing out of the ordinary.  There were a few empty tables...though most were dirty.  Waited for at least 10 minutes before a server passed by and said she would be back shortly.  Shortly turned into unacceptably long, so my husband went to the bar to order.  There the bartender walked by him several times, and again would not acknowledge him, much less take his order.  Keep in mind, he was not rushing to make drinks.  He was cleaning up.  I find it hard to believe we're invisible.  Maybe just undesirable?  Regardless, we left and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

It's kind of hard to peg Networks. Sports bar? Maybe. Uppity? Maybe, at times. Depends on the crowd, e.g., during last year's NCAA football championship it was definitely more \"sports\" than \"uppity\". All I can really say with certainty is that it's a hotel bar. The food is decent. The drinks are decent. The staff are friendly. The atmosphere is not bad, but nothing spectacular. Back in the day, before we had Roosevelt and Lost Leaf (all of like, 6 months ago or something), this was unfortunately one of the only places consistently open late in downtown Phx, so I appreciate its place in history. It does have big comfy couches, with several large screen tv's scattered on one side of its very large space. Elsewhere it features high tables, booths, and a decent bar. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"Told us they were too busy to bring us mimosas at the pool and we had to get them ourselves. A hotel basic fail. Pretty unprofessional. So bring your own at this hotel. The front desk said room service in room dining would answer the phone at the pool and bring us mimosas. The in room dining answered and transferred us to Networks. Pretty useless experience. Can't even do a basic. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"Not very many options on the menu. Service was fast. Our waiter was very friendly. Okay if you happen to be staying in the Hyatt or nearby hotel, but could probably find other option."}
{"text":"Extremely slow, wrong food, 1/2 hour for check.  Too bad because it's very convenient to downtown shows and games.  Been there a couple times and it's awful each time.  Not again,"}
{"text":"We're staying in the Hyatt and we've come in to Networks  many times since the start of our stay. I will split this review in 2 parts- my breakfast experience and my late night bar experience. 

Breakfast: 
I want to start by saying Ismael is by far the greatest server I've had in a long time. He's very personable! We exchanged stories and I showed him pictures and videos from my hiking excursion. He was able to offer advice on things to do in the area (which is always SO IMPORTANT to guests visiting in from out of town). But mainly, he's just a good soul working his ass off to please the people that come in to eat here. Edit to add: I don't know how I could forget about how sweet the hostess was!! (Jade) She's been here every day of our trip and she was very patient when we asked to move like 3 times. Keep it up, girl! You rock. 

Bar: 
The place gets busy at night. When I ordered a drink and the tender asked for my ID, he snatched it out of my hands and walked away immediately. I'm from out of state and I do look about 17-18 but his body language when he turned away said to me \"this girl is NOT 21 so I'm not even going to give her the time of day\" 

just please for GODS SAKE do not snatch my ID then walk away without some type of dialogue. A simple \"I'll get this ID checked and then get your drink out\" would have been fine. Manager came over to confirm my identity and he was very friendly. Bar tender made the drink I asked for and all was well. 

Overall, this place is good if you're staying in the hotel. I can't see myself coming here any reason other than to see my friend Ismael. 

**Also I'd like to add that Chris stopped by and picked up our dishes. He was very friendly and was able to offer suggestions on things to do & places to go as well."}
{"text":"Under-par for even a hotel bar. 1.7 stars

Cost to worth it rating: 1 (martinis for $12 and not a bartender talent level or atmosphere to support it)

Highlights:
- Convenient: if you're staying in the hotel
- Outdoor seating: patio area with misters if you want to be outdoors or have someone who wants to smoke
- Indoor seating: long bar and some tables and couches
- Vodkas: have level as well as Ciroc, Effen, and some flavored options
- White cosmo: ok, not too sweet

Lowlights:
- Service: didn't get paid attention to for a while and long lag between getting drinks that we ordered
- Snacks: sub-par wings and even chips and salsa left a lot to be desired--bland
- Shot prices: $10 each for mixed shot
- Hours: last call at midnight on a Saturday night

Won't be back unless I'm needing a drink and too lazy to leave the hotel."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food was very average. We had their chicken burger and the chicken was cold and undercooked. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's all right. I think there are way better places in the area. It's just it was during a very busy event so it would have been a hassle going elsewhere. Those chicken tenders and burgers were pretty expensive but I guess that's what you get at a hotel restaurant. I think the Sheraton nearby that has a restaurant in it serves way better food. I guess you can say that it's typical bar food and very average but slightly higher price than normal."}
{"text":"Close to 5 star bar food!  Crisp salad with flavorful grilled chicken, pecan, and house vinaigrette was delicious. Huge cheesecake! Fast, friendly service. Dropped a star due to off site gluten free prep. Great location near Herberger Theater and symphony."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast one morning while staying at this hotel, and I had almost instant regret. From the incredibly expensive food to the lack of inequality in service, I won't be back, and almost wish I could get my money back. 

I got here and was sat immediately after being greeted by a friendly hostess. I sat and got myself situated and waited almost 10 minutes before my server decided to acknowledge me. Someone came to take my drink order and brought me my black coffee (which was $4!). There were no beverage prices on the menu so I only assumed it would be half the cost. 

The server who finally acknowledged me was very friendly to the gentleman next to me, addressed him by his name, and was chatty with him and immediate with his requests. She was short with me. I felt like I'd done something wrong because I was being treated so differently. My food came and I ordered an eggs Benedict with carnitas. I could tell that my food had been sitting for awhile (it wasn't that busy- most people were eating the buffet, which I clearly should have considered but I knew nothing about it because it wasn't on the menu and my super friendly server didn't tell me about it) because my English muffin was so soggy I could gently pull it and it came apart. My poached eggs were tiny and over cooked, too. I was supposed to get a choice of side with my dish and my server never asked for my choice so I got hash browns by default. I paid $20 total for my breakfast and I wish I would have gone to the Market in the hotel to get a better quality, less expensive breakfast sandwich and coffee."}
{"text":"We had high expectations because it's attached to the hotel we stayed at, and that was my first mistake. The second mistake was not leaving said hotel to find somewhere better to eat. There's so many places in this area of downtown!
Service was slow, food was decent, menu was limited and somewhat incongruent."}
{"text":"We were visiting downtown, and just wanted a quick bite, prior to an event that we were attending. We saw that they were not busy, so the wait wouldn't be long, as it was a weekend. The waitress came over immediately, and gave us menus and took our drink order. Quite a while later, our food showed up, and she still hadn't brought our drinks! Middle of the Summer, in Phoenix, we were thirsty. It looked to be a nice place for watching sports, but we would've been better off doing the \"30 minute wait\" at a surrounding eatery."}
{"text":"Not bad for bar food. They had a relatively tasty pita and hummus option, and their sweet potato fries were reasonably good. To see vegetarian options on the menu is rare at a bar, so that was a nice surprise. It was conveniently located near our hotel and convention center, and everyone convened at this bar after the events every night. It lives up to the name \"Networks.\""}
{"text":"Wow! I stopped in here with a friend after a stop at symphony hall. We weren't expecting a lot for a walk-by choice, but were quite surprised! Both the food and the drinks were made with great care and perfection. Go for the truffle fries for sure! My friend, who has complex requests and high expectations, actually praised the bartender on his first attempt! I couldn't agree more. My tastes are less complicated, I just like things that taste good. Both my drink and my food choices were spot on and I would gladly stop in here again if in town experiencing some Phoenix culture!"}
{"text":"As far as hotel food goes, this place was pretty boss. We dropped in several times during our Phoenix Comic Con experience to get burgers to go and every time the service was friendly and the prices weren't too bad (location costs, remember.)

I specifically remember their ranch dressing being incredible with their fries so be sure to remember that when you order. But the burgers are huge, and the buns themselves are very hearty, almost pretzel-like in consistency.

Would be 5 stars except the well done burgers I ordered came back very pink pretty consistently."}
{"text":"While staying at the Hyatt (in the same building) for the Grace Hopper Conference (8000 attendees), I ate here multiple times. For bar food, the food was really good. I highly recommend the salads. The Networks burger was really good as well. The staff was great - they were very friendly, quick, and always on top of things when it was busy."}
{"text":"Usually, if I go to a bar & grill restaurant, I just go with the burger because it is hard to mess up.  But I have been trying to eat a little healthier.  I went with the spicy chix wrap which was no bueno.  It was overly salty, rather than spicy and there wasn't much chix.  It was loaded with a sauce and some salad reject items that were not appetizing and was very dissatisfying.  Ironically, the burger would have probably been the healthier choice.  

Also, don't get the tortilla soup.  it is a bunch of stale tortilla chips on a watery mess that no one in good conscience could call a soup."}
{"text":"My family of six ate at Network's after traveling. The waitress was very friendly and patient. We shared meals and she split them up for us without asking. Food was alright. The sweet potato fries were amazing. It was a little pricey, which is why we split, but that's not any different than any other hotel grills."}
{"text":"Located in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency. The breakfast buffet food was cold and I was overcharged. We will not be coming here again"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR!  Networks has great local beers on tap.  I had the Scottish Ale during happy hour and it was superb.  My wife and I split the cheese plate which was $5 off during happy hour.  I suggest coming here for your appetizers before you head up to Compass which does not open till 5:30 p.m.  You will get away with a less expensive bill this way."}
{"text":"I come here after work for a beer and some fries at least once a week and to relax while chatting with friends from work. I like this place, for it offers some good beers (I like Stella on tap) and good sweet potatoes fries. Unfortunately,  the service leaves to be desired,  I wait for my order to be taken for more than 30 minutes and then another 30 to be delivered. Our server didn't seem to care about whether we need something or not, sometimes I had to flag another server to either take or fulfill our order. And then, at the end, we need to wait for the bill for yet another 30 minutes. While they're still going to get my business, I wish they better their service. Gave only 2 stars this time."}
{"text":"We popped in for a small bite and drink. The Diamond Raspberry Lemon Drop was delicious, but it just went downhill from there. I ordered the tomato bruschetta, which was the worst I've ever had. The bread tasted stale and left this weird after taste in my mouth. I had no desire on finishing it. The tortilla chips and pesto hummus was rather dull as well. Pass."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok, if you can get it when they're making it - which definitely isn't all the time. My friend had the turkey \"burger\" which was actually turkey slices rolled up - kinda weird if you ask me. They have a decent beer selection where I was happy to see the Dogfish Head IPA on tap. Chicken tortilla soup was nothing to write home about, but they are very conveniently located in the hotel. Friendly and very attentive staff."}
{"text":"Visited Phoenix for business and stayed at the Hyatt. For convenience, had 3 breakfasts and 2 dinners here. 

Chicken quesadilla was surprisingly delicious although on the greasy side - both times I had it. For breakfast, steel cut oatmeal with fresh berries was huge and decent - cooked inconsistently between days, however, and could use more berries for the large portion of oatmeal. Chick sausage was embarrassingly small and microwaved. Stick with eggs. Fish tacos tasted microwaved. Coffee is terrible!

Service was inconsistent - sometimes great, other times incredibly slow, and for some reason multiple people would come by and ask to take your order after someone already did. Altogether it was fine for travel, but if I lived there I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give no stars, Networks would of earned this honor from me. First off, even with pub crawl happening, the clientel at Networks is your typical hotel bar clientele. Being under 35, and not trying to get laid while at a conference out of town, I felt like an instant outcast. Secondly we came to Networks to take advantage of the pub crawl special of $1 beer and wine but once we made it to the bar we were quickly told it was a misprint and pretty much treated like shit after that. Jason, the \"manager\", strolled over to the bar with a fresh plate of assorted appetizers pizza as most people would call it, with his cheap suit jacket and an earpiece. I am not sure if he felt powerful with the earpiece in but it really helped add to the entire douche vibe. He was short and unaccommodating with our party and not even apologetic for the misprint. Mistakes happen and if Jason was a little bit better of a manager, he could of convinced our party of 8 to stick around and spend some money at his bar even if we did not get the discount we originally thought we would. Jason needs to remove the stick from his ass, the ear piece from his ear, and take a few more management courses before I would even consider returning."}
{"text":"Inside the $200+/night downtown Phoenix Hyatt Hotel, this is the casual dining watering hole for the hotel where mostly out-of-town conventioneers grab a bite and stiff one. 

It has a bar and tables with TVs inside, and a reasonable sized covered patio outside area where you can enjoy the warm Valley of the Sun evenings and watch the car hops park other people's cars. 

If you are here the Friday of Halloween weekend, like I was, you can sit and sip a Zombie while you watch as the Zombie Walk of 700 people come screaming by you with \"Night of the Living Dead\" limping gates and fake blood splattered all over them! Did you order a Bloody Mary?

Otherwise the food is ok for what it is, but the service is slow. I did have the Buffalo Shrimp, and that was good, with 4 very large battered prawns with a spicy buffalo sauce over a bed of finely chopped slaw.

They do have at least 4 red varietals by the glass, and a couple of brands in each for you winos."}
{"text":"Came for a mid-work lunch. I ordered wings (naked) with wild sauce on the side. Wings were nice and crispy. My friend ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries. Fries were a bit soggy but edible. Waiter was very kind and attentive"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! On my first visit, I sat at a table in the bar area for 10 minutes and was completely ignored by bartenders despite the bar being nearly empty (they even looked directly at us several times). We walked out, having never been acknowledged or greeted. On my second visit (I don't know why I came back) it was pretty busy, so this time we were ignored for 15 minutes. I finally flagged down a server who took our drink order, but it was like a game trying to get her attention every time we needed a drink! Hopefully people staying at this hotel  will realize that there are MUCH better bars within a short walking radius... don't waste your time with this \"sports\" bar..."}
{"text":"Ken is a fantastic bartender. I always bring friends in during conventions. He always tells us specials and has a great bar atmosphere as he connects with all his guests."}
{"text":"I really wish downtown had some classier late night options instead of all the sports bars... still, this is the best of the lot."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled vegetable wrap and requested no tomato. The waiter told me that it didn't come with any. The wrap came and looked delicious except there were tomato's in it. I told the waiter that I couln't eat it as I have an allergy. He said he would bring ask the chef to make me another. What I received was lettuce and dressing in a tortilla. All lettuce. No grilled veggies. Apparently, they don't like to redo orders. The only reason they get one star is because the fries were good and my dining companion liked her salad. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Surprisingly very very good burgers. I expected the typical bar Burger but this was just unbelievably good. The beer selection wasn't all that good but the Burger makes up for it. Service was good and fat too."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here three times during this year's Comicon and had great experiences each time. The serving staff wasn't quite as attentive as I might have liked, but it was during an extraordinarily busy time.The burgers and sweet potato fries we had were super tasty, and they do make a very fine margarita.

This would be five stars had the waitstaff been a bit more on top of things (maybe an extra hand or two during high volume rushes or conventions at the Hyatt?), and the prices been a bit more reasonable - $25 for two burgers, two fries, and two sodas is a bit steep."}
{"text":"Opening seating, so don't wait around to be seat.  I had the spicy chicken wrap, and it was well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Located right across from Symphony Hall, we decided to have a drink before a show.   Networks was not that busy with many watching the games on the flat screens.  We sat there for about 5 minutes, no one came by to greet us or take our orders so we moved to the bar and had a quick drink.  Not my first place for a drink downtown!"}
{"text":"Network Bar and Grill..come here for the personal attention. Kevin and James were awesome. Kevin takes time to talk to you, be cool with him he will be more than cool with you. i've only been here once and I and I will be back thanks to Kevin."}
{"text":"As a hotel bar and grill, it is a great place to meet!  Beer selection...OK.

The food is decent (pub grub) and the staff is eager to please. 

Don't forget to check in on FourSquare to receive half off you bill (food only)."}
{"text":"This was convenient as it's in my hotel  but the food was just OK. Nothing special but nothing horrible either. The service was good. Place is big with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and ate at the bar.  Max the bartender was fun and helpful, he did an outstanding job taking care of me.  His beer recommendation was spot on, the Four Peaks IPA was really good.  The hamburger I had was huge and very good. Nice TVs for watching baseball too!"}
{"text":"I'd love to rate this place on atmosphere alone, give it five stars, and call it a day. Me and a friend were able to seat ourselves, and every spot looked so nice I had trouble picking a spot! There were some huge, comfy chairs. Very wide and low to the floor; we felt like we were reclining with ample table space between us. The menu was already laid out, and I sat there admiring the playlist. Franz Ferdinand...Darwin Deez...it's like they hacked into my Pandora Quickmix to lure me in!

My mojito was worth all nine dollars. It packed a punch, and was extra minty. Other bars should try one here and take notes. We started off with the hummus appetizer because hummus pairs well with everything (duh). I couldn't get enough of the grilled flatbread, which I assume was seasoned with rosemary, sea salt, and crack. Too bad most of the basket they give you is...tortilla chips. And the hummus has the consistency and spice of a tex-mex bean dip. I don't know how I feel about that.

We started having second thoughts about eating at the only place to screw up hummus. The descriptions of sandwiches were painfully average. I just can't get excited about the \"local pepper jack\" motif. They boasted some brand of sushi that I haven't heard of, and I'm sure it's well-liked. But do you really want to order some off-site sushi when you can get it fresh within walking distance? 

No disrespect, though. Atmosphere is off the charts, and our waiter was super-cool. I'll recommend this for a great day drinking spot, so it's \"A-OK\" with me."}
{"text":"Came in on a friday to do some work on my laptop. Only ordered coffee. The waiter, Ryan, checked on me several times, was attentive and friendly. This place has a great vibe and they make everyone feel welcome. Ive had their tacos and wings and they're fabtastic. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My lemon drop martini in a tiny martini glass(smaller than your average glass) was $13. Yes....$13!!!!!!!! No prices are on menu for drinks except for beers. Oh and our hummus tasted like it was frozen and thawed out. Service was terrible and there was only 3 tables. She forgot about our drink orders....never asked how we were doing ect. Nobody on staff had a smile on their face. We are NOT complainers at restaurants but $13 for a martini at a sports bar was insane...so we talked to the rude manager who stared at us like we were crazy as we expressed our concern of the price. He said they price match their drinks to the other restaurants in the area. He said...I will discount your drink. $2 off...thanks bro. Wow. So much for customer service. Btw...we went to Compass Room at the hotel later that night. Martinis were $9-$13. $13 was the highest priced martini. Lol. Networks...you are a sports bar. NOT a high end restaurant like the Compass Room. Get a grip. Will never be back!"}
{"text":"I met a group here during Phoenix Comicon and I was very impressed at how Networks handled the utter deluge. Most seats were taken, but service was still good (though understandably slow at times). My group shared several appetizers. The chips were okay, not fresh-made for sure, but the portion was large and they weren't stale, either. The sweet potato fries were good--some of my friends really liked those. I had a few of their drink specials for Comicon, which included a shot of their house-made fireball whiskey; that was spectacular!

I wouldn't mind eating here again during my normal circumstances and trying their full menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Networks twice and each time it's filled with business men and women sipping fine scotch in their suits.  As for me, I had a snifter of cognac in one hand and a cigar in the other as I hobnobbed with Phoenix socialites. 

Okay that was a lie. I was drinking a margarita and felt totally out of place.  If you go, you'll see what I mean.  Although it's billed as a sports bar, I find it to be totally opposite.  It's more of an upscale meeting place for the wealthy business people of Arizona.

I haven't tried the food, but I've heard it's impressive.  If there is an event going on nearby or at the symphony, be prepared to battle large crowds.  But the bartenders are skilled and can still get you your highball in a few seconds flat."}
{"text":"PROS:  Good service, great downtown location, large and uncrowded, lots of TVs, natural light, and good layout, with a traditional bar area or hightop area or lounge-y area.

CONS:  OK food from a smallish menu

PROSE:  I don't know how many bottles of beer
I have consumed while waiting for things
to get better
I don't know how much wine and whisky

mostly beer
I have consumed after

{"text":"The fact that Networks had four stars a few days ago and now only averages three demonstrates the potential impact of not treating your customers well, especially when six out of eight of them just happen to be Yelpers who are not afraid to write about their bad experience. 

I was part of the group of 8 that stopped by Networks during last Saturday's pub crawl (which was featuring drink specials and food samples from downtown businesses). This event was clearly planned in order to generate more business for these local spots, which makes the manager's refusal to give us $1 beer and wine or any sort of meaningful concession (when the downtown pub crawl materials said \"$1 beer, $1 signature wines\" with no \"off\" anywhere in sight) that much worse. 

You are certainly free to check this place out for yourself and maybe these four one-star reviews won't do anything to change Networks' core crowd of patrons, but I can guarantee you that Networks lost the approval (and referral) of five very grumpy Yelpers!

P.S. Congealed, cold pizza cut into miniature slices doesn't count as a \"food sample.\""}
{"text":"This place was god awful. Food was terrible. It was the closest thing we could find open. Burger was dry, fries were stale, beer tasted funky. Will never be back, ever."}
{"text":"I would have given a well-deserved zero (0) for this restaurant but Yelp won't allow me. 

First day here for a conference and we stood at the door for at least 20 minutes when i finally decided to look for a server. I located a server and he looked really busy but accomodating at the same time. I understand they were busy during that time. So my friends and i gave this restaurant a shot. So we stayed, ordered food, and ate our food. He didn't fill our water cups fast enough but we thought he was just busy. 

Then the next day, my friends and i only had an hour for lunch so we decided to come back to this restaurant (we are staying at the hotel where this restaurant is located). BAD IDEA! First of all, nobody provided us a table so i had to locate someone to give us a table. Secondly, the waitress made us wait 15 more minutes for her to clear the table. Then 30 minutes to prepare the food. So by the time we got the food, it was already time to leave. The waitress did not ever fill our water cups. She never asked how we are doing (while she checked on the other people). The other people at another table (who ordered after us) got their food before we did.

Really baaaaaad BAD service here. Can't stress this enough!"}
{"text":"I rather like the food here. They have a pretty standard bar menu, but it's executed well for a hotel lobby bar. They keep good hours, and are always open late. Prices are high, but one should expect so being the location, as most hotel bars are pricey. A lot of people always say oh the hotels just like to gouge people... thats not it, most hotel charges are on expense accounts and people don't care what stuff costs, so the prices reflect that. Just don't try using that revolving door after 10PM or you will look a fool."}
{"text":"My previous review went missing so I'll try it again.  Great burger and craft beer selection!  Very nice and attentive waitstaff. I usually steer clear of hotel bars, but I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Sports bar.  Good happy hour prices, especially for a Hotel bar. $3.25 drafts and $5 select apps (wings and quesadillas included). 

Not super impressed with the service.  Settling the bill for a large group was a complete nightmare.  They wouldn't split the bill and couldn't give us an updated total after several people paid more than enough before leaving.  

Also not impressed with the beer list or how it was described. \"We have a local IPA, blonde, and Scottish ale.\"  If I'm asking about the rotating drafts, I'd actually like to know what beers are on the draft list.  Do you know how many \"local IPAs\" are in the Phoenix are? A lot. 

Definitely enough room for large groups, either at the bar or at tables. And I hear they have a really good burger at lunch, but I haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Overall decent place. I think Networks greatest trait may be it's location and the hours (open more then most hangouts downtown).

I have had several productive lunch meetings here and the food is decent. The nightlife is usually a little slow, and service is even slower. The decor is nice and modern - it certainly looks like a classy destination.

For dining, don't waste your time. For a drink before a game, or maybe after work it's a good call..."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Had lunch here while I was waiting for my room to be ready. I couldn't have had a better experience. The food was excellent. They have gluten-free bread for their sandwiches! My burger was amazing. I also had a Moscow mule that was delicious. Kevin, the bartender, was outstanding. Attentive and friendly. Knowledgeable. Great experience."}
{"text":"Came to the hotel restaurant after a terrible experience at Steves across the street(i also reviewed them). Fatima, our server, went above and beyond. They were done with breakfast but she went to the kitchen to make sure they could make us a plate, which they were able to do. Then she asked for our drink order and i wanted a coke but they had pepsi so i just ordered water. Fatima went and found me a bottle of coke! Above and beyond. Food was good. We had an omelette and the huevos rancheros. Both were solid hotel restaurant fare. The other server Ismael was also very accommodating. All in all a great experience. Thank you for salvaging our  morning"}
{"text":"Ate a hamburger there and was tossing my cookies two hours later. Should have known from the poor taste that it was going to cause problems. Nothing like some food poisoning at a dive bar. Tiny salad served with it after two dollar up charge. TV's are small. Just regular TV's not even as big as those in my kids room."}
{"text":"While the dining room was very busy our service was amazing. Our server, I think her name was Emily, made time to give us five star service and make us very comfortable. Drinks were great. Food came out promptly and it was all amazing (Emily helped us navigate the menu by pointing out her favorites). All in all we were very pleased and will be back!"}
{"text":"Living and working in the area I admit this is one of the places I have no idea why I am not here more often.  Their Happy Hour pricing and offerings are SUPER (Half off selected appetizers and reduced prices on beer and well drinks.)

Having a bit of time before a game I was committed to trying a place for Happy Hour that I had either not been to or don't go to often.  I came here.  Ordering a vodka soda with lime ( Well Vodka is Smirnoff) and Chicken Wings (naked w sauces on the side). My order was taken quickly and the service was friendly.  [Sitting at the bar.]

When the wings arrived, I was impressed! There were *12*,  yes a full dozen, plump, meaty chicken wings and drummies. These were not your typical breaded,  dry, overcooked anorexic 8-10 pieces I have received at some of the other places downtown.   Several sticks of celery and generous sides of ranch and hot sauce accompanied the wings.  

Now you thought my 4 star rating was just the service, quality and quantity of food.  Well it was that, in combination with the price that has me sold.  When I looked at my tab, $4 for my drink and $5 for the wings.  WHAT A VALUE!!! 

Don't let the fact that this is located a very nice hotel intimidate you.  It has a great casual, clean vibe and it has convenient access from the street (corner of Adams and 2nd St).  [You can also go through the Main Lobby entrance and hang a left.]

This may become my main pregame stop."}
{"text":"I stayed in the Hyatt on business so I ate here a few times. The food has been perfect for me every time. The wings are really good and the give you so many. The fish tacos are great, and the fries were good too. The house vinaigrette dressing has a very strong vinegar taste so beware. The breakfast is good too. I read the other reviews about the staff, and from my experience they are either very relaxed so it may seem hard to get service. Or they seem pushy and rushing you to order. Overall I enjoyed the food and the service wasn't bad at all in my opinion. I didn't have any extreme wait times like other people complained either. Definitely get the wings. They are so worth it."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast yesterday and while mine was good, my friend's was not. Our waitress seemed put upon that we wanted to eat and that we had a few questions about the menu and then disappeared after the food came till it was time for the check.
The next day we went to the bar and were ignored by the bartender even though it was dead, so we left. 
It wasn't all bad---the first night we were here, the bartender was friendly and got to us right away even though he was quite busy."}
{"text":"Wonderful environment to watch a game, great ambiance, although it did take a while to get acknowledged when we sat at the bar. Try the Ruben it's outstanding and prices are reasonable. If you have to eat near the convention center and are crunched for time, it's the perfect spot."}
{"text":"Location - stellar! Atmosphere - Decent... Prices - ridiculous. $13.00 for a mediocre (at best) Manhattan makes me think that the dollars from the guests at the conjoining Hyatt are all that keep this place afloat. This was the second time I'd been in here on a weekend and there was maybe a handful of people there, which was a few more than the previous time. Besides symphony-goers I really can't imagine this place appeals to locals.

The service was good and prompt, but if I'm paying $10.00+ for a drink it had better be something to, well, write a positive review about."}
{"text":"At networks I had Great food, great server, and great service! I also love that happy hour is until 630! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was just recently here for a late night dinner after the Suns game.  We just stumbled upon this place coming back from the stadium and there were quite a lot of people sitting outside.

The food was really good, and the service was friendly, and I would suggest it for a early drink and appetizer before or after the game."}
{"text":"THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!!! I was in Phoenix for convention and staying at the hotel. The 1st night we came here and it was OK. Waitress seemed frazzled but she was nice and did her best. Good happy hour but expensive otherwise. So..2nd night we come in sit up in area with couches..it was not too busy when we sat but was getting busier. Waitress acknowledged us about 20min later. We asked if we could order she said let me do drinks 1st. Most of us ordered water. 2 people ordered drinks. About 15 min later she came back with water and ran away. We waited about 15 more minutes and then approached her. She then told us that food was taking 45 minand we should go somewhere else...(now lets re cap! We had been waiting about 50 min already). As my friend walked away the waitress proceded to roll her eyes and tell another table about us. How dare you!! I approached the manager and he was useless. Very agressive and defensive about his staff. I went back to my seat. About 10 min later she comes back..with the same sparking personality. She told us again it would be an hour for food..guess what. We would have been eating already had you done your job the 1st time..we walked out. Oh and she never brought the other 2 drinks. We watched another table walk out too. This place needs to WAKE UP!! Your in a hotel across the street from the convention center!! You cater to convention people whom are usually on a schedule. We waited patiently for plenty of time and gave her, and the manager every opportunity to get it together. They don't care!! That's the bottom line. I think I will stay in another hotel next year just based on this experience! Go to Steve's Grill..they are happy to see you and they have awesome specials!!"}
{"text":"The menu is fine.  The service was horrible.  We were there for 2 hours and the waiter came by twice - once for the initial round of drinks and once an hour later, approximately 30 minutes after our drinks were empty.  We had to flag him down for our checks, and after that it took an additional 30 minutes.  As we were a party of 7, gratuity was automatically added.  Such a disappointment.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"After an overnight stay at the Hyatt Regency Phoenix, we were anxious to hit the road for Sedona. As a matter of convenience, we decided to have breakfast at the Networks Bar & Grill.

First, it took a while to be seated. We had planned to order off the menu and then discovered they were offering a buffet for only $17.95 -- including juice and coffee. At Hyatt we have found that is often a better deal than ordering off the menu. I am not sure if the buffet is an everyday offering or just on the weekends. (We were there on a Sunday.)

For much of the meal, we felt invisible. We could not catch the attention of any server and it took a long while to get a glass of juice and coffee refills. And later an equally long time to get our bill.

The buffet was not as extensive as some Hyatt buffets, but had enough choices for us. Some of the hot dishes could have been hotter. But my sweet tooth always gravitates more toward the pastries, fruit, and yogurt. 

We found it odd that only peanut butter and cream cheese were set out near the toast and bagels. I asked about jams. The young woman who was helping had an \"of course, we do\" reaction. She gave me several options. I opted for raspberry and peach. The peach, not surprisingly, was actually orange marmalade. Guess she just went by color and didn't bother to ever check the label.

Had our stay been longer, we would no doubt have sought out another option for breakfast on other days."}
{"text":"Look for somewhere else.  The bartenders were nice and the drink was okay but when added to the food very over priced.  I had southwestern rolls and they were not very good at all.  Had I paid 7(11.25) for the martini and 5(8) for the appetizer I might be a little nicer but if you want to charge high end prices you need to provide quality product.  With all the choices in the area shame on me."}
{"text":"I disagree that this place is average. Well not the menu anyway. I was really impressed. Definitely not average bar food. The atmosphere is decadent, yet relaxing and friendly. I went for lunch and I have also been at night. Perfect location to just drop in and hang out, have drinks on the patio and people watch. Or after a couple cocktails head up to the Compass Room for a dessert. This is one of those downtown landmarks that I may be partial to, but I happen to love!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Hyatt hotel here and this restaurant is in the hotel. Unfortunately the both times I came here, no one gave attention to me. 
There were workers that looked at me and didn't say anything, there were workers in the bar chatting away, laughing. There were workers across from me chatting away and talking. Until a man that was actually working, which he was coming in the restaurant with a giant trashcan finally asked me if I needed help but I felt bad because he was obviously doing something else. 
Finally got my order but what took the longest was actually my dang JUICE! Why does juice take more than 20minutes? Why does juice even take more than my meal???
I just don't understand."}
{"text":"When I visit Phoenix, I sometimes stay at the Hyatt hotel so Networks is naturally were I eat.  It is a convenient and safe choice n the neighborhood.  Although most of the selections tend to lean towards the fast food genre, you can find comfort in their coconut shrimp, or chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food was decent (blackened fish sandwhich) but like the other reviewers, service is EXTREMELY slow. It was even difficult to order drinks... They are sorely understaffed. Happy hour prices are decent but I wouldn't come back due to the service."}
