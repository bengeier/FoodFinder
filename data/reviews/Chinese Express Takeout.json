{"text":"Ordered from this restaurant for the first time.  It was dinner for 5 women with varying tastes.  All of the dishes were delicious.  I phoned in advance and asked to have the order delivered at 8.  It arrived precisely on time, piping hot, and every dish that was supposed to be there was.  My new \"go to\" Chinese restaurant.

{"text":"This is the BEST place to get chinese food. Honestly. I used to order mandarin all the time whenever I felt like getting Chinese food but one day my husband suggested to me why not try this place. They've been around for years! SO glad I did.  They have a HUGE menu, with tons of delicious food to choose from, including whole meals (dinner for 2-6) which comes with tons of food for the value.  You can pickup or have delivery, I can't say much for inside of restaurant because I've only had delivery.  Delivery is free with a $20 minimum order and their delivery area is from Southdown to Cawthra road which is quite impressive considering they are in between clarkson and port credit.  love, love, love this place, give it a try, it may not look like much from the outside but the food speaks for itself.  5/5"}
{"text":"I know this place has some amazing reviews , but I'm really not sure why. Maybe its the lack of good Chinese food in the area so this place is the best. I've lived in Toronto, Durham, Peel and I can definitely say its been the hardest to find goood late night greasy Chinese food here in the Port Credit end of Mississauga. I'm still on the hunt!  Customer service here was great. I called asked a few questions, than went in and grabbed a menu and went back to my car. Called over the phone and ordered she didn't know it was me and asked if i knew where they were located which was nice.  So My order was General tao chicken ( we usually get chilli chicken but don't like it dry, prefer the sauced up spicy, so this is the equivalent at some places), chicken balls, chicken fried rice, and chicken wings. The total was about 40$, which is fair and the portions were alot less to what I was used to.   The general tao chicken was not even a little bit spicy, even though she said it was so that was disappointing. On top of that the breaded part of the chicken was extremely soggy and the plate was full of soggy over cooked veggies underneath.  the chicken wings were fried and greasy tasted great and well seasoned. Just not like what I'd usually get from a Chinese take out place as it just looked different the way it was breaded and fried. The rice was in a really small container w under cooked pieced of chicken that was very slimy and white and the rice was very bland. I had to overkill w soy sauce and bit of red sauce. Lastly the chicken balls of course 80% balls 20% chicken but tasted fine, just nothing special.  I mean it was cheap and last minute but i definitely feel like i would not have ordered here if i had known cheap or not. They have alot to improve on or mayb they are better at making other items listed in reviews from others. Not sure how they have 5 stars. but hey to each their own right!"}
