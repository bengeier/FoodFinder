{"text":"Last minute dinner plans on New Year's Eve, we didn't have reservations and the owner was kind enough to fit us in :)  Excellent food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  Very friendly, attentive and prompt.  However, I would rate the food average.  The homemade pasta is ok, the Alfredo sauce was run of the mill, chicken was average and the salad was iceberg lettuce. The dressing on the Mediterranean salad was very good and the Caesar was average.  Also, no fresh cracked pepper or fresh grated cheese offered for the salads. For the price there are better options.  At $20 and more for an entree my expectations were higher."}
{"text":"We have been here half a dozen times.   The food here is basic italian. But done really well. The salad is cold, crisp and fresh. Plates are chilled. dressing nearly perfect.  The pasta is also fresh. I am no foodie, but you can tell this is really good pasta. I had the marsala on linguini last time I was there. As good as anywhere."}
{"text":"David and his crew are the bomb. Family friendly with a taste of Italy. This place is the REAL DEAL.."}
{"text":"Our go to restaurant for Italian food in Las Vegas.  The service is great.  Food is great too.  A little on the expensive side for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem of a hole in the wall. It was the first time we have eaten there and it was wonderful. The service, the music/ambiance, food quality, food portions, selections, and price were all excellent! We ordered the chicken davida as well as the special calamari steak with bow tie pasta. We both loved the crisp Caesar salads and cheesy garlicy bread before our meal. Our dishes had fresh veggies, fresh pasta,  juicy chicken and tender soft calamari. This place is right down the street from us and we can't wait for our next visit! Great eat everyone! :)"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! The pasta melts in my mouth. First time here and ordered the lasagna.  The best lasagna ever hands down! ! They make it fresh themselves. Delicioso! The bread was also good along with the ceasar salad. Whenever I want Italian food, this is where I will go."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The polenta was delicious and the pasta dishes \"Teatro and Frank's Favorite\" were divine! Service was on point. Owners are fabulous"}
{"text":"Heard great things about the food and also heard it was Michelin rated.    The food was better than I can ask for.  Pasta is fresh, everything cooked to perfection.  If you like Italian food, this place is a must try.  You will not be disappointed.  Service is amazing.    My new favorite!"}
{"text":"This is a small family operated restaurant that is one of the best pasta places to eat in Las Vegas for many years... They only moved to Henderson last year but we should be very happy to have them. It is a small menu but everything is amazing... The service is great! Gianna has been there for years and is a wonderful server. Try the eggplant!"}
{"text":"Any respectable Italian restaurant makes their own pasta and The Pasta Shop is no exception. When the pasta is fresh, it is meant to be the focus of the dish and the linguine with clams that I ordered was a great way to really enjoy the pasta: linguine with a simple and delicious butter and clam juice sauce. It came with plenty of clams and had the perfect amount of crushed red pepper flakes to give it some spice. My only complaint with the dish was that the clams could have used a little more rinsing.   The basic Caesar salad that came with dinner was lacking. The two croutons on the plate were unpleasant in taste and texture and the lettuce was not picked through thoroughly. The little pieces of garlic bread were tasty.   It is a little more expensive than your average Italian restaurant, but I consider it a premium for freshly made pasta. Not too many places make their own pasta anymore and The Pasta Shop does make some of the best."}
{"text":"We were driving by last night and were attracted to the lighting from the street. Upon entering- the ambience is fun and and inviting. The owner's wife is a talented artist and her wall sculptures and paintings decorate the ristorante .  Giana the manager was the one that waited on us. She was warm and friendly. She seems to really love her job. (we assumed she was an owner)  I ordered the special with scallops (to die for), salmon and a yummy homemade pasta (which Giana actually gave us a sample of to take home) in a white wine caper sauce.  My hubsand ordered the Franks meat sauce pasta. Which he said it was one of the the most delicious he has ever tasted.  This little family ristorante  is a jewel. And we cannot wait to return. Molto Buona!!!"}
{"text":"Food and the people (Annie Gianna Gabby Everybody!!) Always excellent always fulfilling! Food and service make you wanna come back often! Enough food to take home leftovers for breakfast Cuz that's what every Italian does right???"}
{"text":"I saved my shillings and came here during Restaurant Week 2011 put on by Three Square (http://www.threesquare.org).  I had been wanting to check it out but from what I could peruse on the menu online, it seemed, ahem, a bit beyond my normal dinner price range.  The restaurant had a really great, four-course prix fixe menu for $30 during Restaurant Week.  That included an appetizer (polenta), salad (caesar), main course (rigatoni primevera with roasted cashews) and dessert (tiramisu).   I have high standards for Italian food as I spent some time in Italy during college and was spoiled with great food there.  (Ahhhhhhh, gnocchi in Roma.)  The Pasta Shop did not disappoint.  The starter and salad were good but the pasta was DELICIOUS.  While I like the occasional visit to the Macaroni Grill, I find that pasta at big chains tend to be drenched in sauce (among other things).  Here, the pasta was al dente and tasted really flavorful with just the right oils and spices; no additional compensation necessary!  It's also hand made fresh at the restaurant.  Hands down, some of the best pasta I've had in the US since my time in Italia.  The tiramisu was also heavenly.  Sometimes tiramisu can be too dry or taste too alcohol-y.  Here, it was just spongy goodness.  We also had the spumoni cake and that was equally delicious.  Hello, coconut shavings on the edge of the slice!    Next time, I may skip the salad and get down to business with the pasta and dessert.  Simply put, this place deserves a visit!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. My favorite dish, so far, is Spinach Linguini Oil & Garlic add Shrimp. The deserts are delicious too.  They sell fresh, great tasting pasta to take home and boil for roughly the same price grocery stores sell Buitoni packaged pasta.  I like the concept of selling the artwork on the walls. If they sell enough art, I'll have new pieces to look at each time I eat there."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food! Now I'm not a fan of typical \"Italian\" you find at most places with overly sauced heavy dishes. This cute family run place is nothing like that! You can really taste the difference with their freshly made pasta. I loved that each entree is served with a caesar salad and garlic bread. I tried the ravioli bianca and a special lobster ravioli the two times I've dined here. Both were amazing and huge positions. Even with how full my boyfriend and I were we've tried the canoli, white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and the tiramisu (no judgment we had help haha). All three were amazing but the canoli won in my book. The owner came out and talked to my family and I after our meal which was really nice. You've got to try this place it is a rare find and definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Greeted and sat immediately. Drink order taken quickly and filled even faster. Very friendly waitress. The meal was AMAZING!! Homemade pasta and sauces. Delicious garlic cheese bread. Caesar salad was dressed perfectly and served on a cold plate (do the math here). Huge shavings of parm. Crispy croutons. Pappardelle pasta was to die for!! Sausage add on was flavored nicely and had a good snap to the casing. Baked rigotoni in rose sauce was mind blowing. So good I had to pull myself away from it when I saw the waitress walk the dessert tray over to another table. Homemade tiramisu!! I just can't!! We drove from Vegas to this spot and would surely drive twice as far for the food!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Both times the food and the service have been outstanding!  I look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Both my friend and my dish were over salted.  Noodles were under cooked. When she told me who the head chefs was i just laughed. Olive garden was better ..."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Art all over the place. The pasta is freshly made and is amazing. The staff is happy and good at what they do."}
{"text":"What an excellent place for pasta. We had 4 different dishes, all excellent. The best one is squid ink pasta with saffron sauce.  Compliment to the chef."}
{"text":"Anytime I have guests from out of town, we go to the pasta shop.  It's cute, intimate and it has a nice view of the strip (for the tourists) and the food is fantastic.  I try to find the gems OFF the strip and this is, without a doubt, on the top of my list.  First step in, I loved the decor.  It felt cozy and comfortable... feels like home.  And all of the employees make you feel as such- that you are at home and you are all a big family.  When the chef came out to check on us, you could tell he loves what he does and this is such a passion for him.  The friendliness and ambiance won me over.  The food is delicious.  The most enjoyable dishes I have had have always been the specials of the evening.  One night they serve a chilled artichoke with a balsamic reduction.  It was prepared so nicely I could have eaten one of an appetizer and one for an entree.  Five stars all around."}
{"text":"overpriced, under-seasoned, small servings, slow service."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband the other week and had a fabulous time.  The food was very authentic and absolutely delicious.  I loved my pasta and fresh artichoke appetizer.  The service was impeccable - very attentive and personable.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The only problem with this place is that you might get sick from overeating all that out of this world pasta!...Hightly recommended!!...Try the Alfredo it will send you to Pluto."}
{"text":"The pasta portofino is very good and I love the cool down tempo vibe. The Caesar salad and bread make you feel like your getting your money's worth . Seafood tasted fresh and perfectly cooked ."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Fresh homemade pasta, mom and pop shop no franchise here!!! And the place is filled with art! Looove it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mediterranean sausage pasta and it was delicious! It had a lot of flavor to it. Tangy and light! I thought the salad and break sticks it comes with was a nice compliment. The food was also two servings of food almost (I eat an average amount) so now I have food for tomorrow too!   The service was great! Attentive, quick, and friendly!"}
{"text":"My friend and I met at The Pasta Shop for lunch, both of us trying it for the first time. The food was good but the prices were way too high for a lunch off the strip. I may give it another chance, but I'll try dinner instead."}
{"text":"Great place.  Quaint, artsy and warm ambiance.  Food is fresh and delicious; creative dishes and consistently a great experience."}
{"text":"I signed up on yelp just to primarily  write a review on this restaurant. I never liked Italian Food until I ate here last night. Their pasta is full of flavor. We got the Linguine  and Clams which was REALLY REALLY GOOD (Pasta tasted like clams, which i loved) but the Squid Ink Pasta with Saffron Shrimp is to die for! If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Just ordered dinner via Postmates - Lasagna, Linguine with marinara and meatballs with a half Caesar - the Caesar dressing was tossed in the salad (as it should be) with just the right amount of dressing. Everything else came hot and well packaged with a nice cheesy garlic bread surprise. My 7 year old is very picky about her pasta - she ate 3 servings!  The pasta is fresh, the sauces are flavorful. This was the perfect amount of food for a lazy Friday night. I would recommend this spot to anyone - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend to try out this new place. The service and food with fantastic. I got the special, lobster ravioli with salmon with a pesto cream sauce. Heaven. My friend got a more sensible option of sautéed veggies an rigatoni pasta. Everything was delicious. The decor is a little random but you get past that pretty fast when you take your first bite of food!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I loved this place, we ordered the forever salad because my server Gaby recommended it for us t try and it was amazing! We loved the atmosphere in this place. Thank you!"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying I am a bit of a picky eater.. I truly appreciate made-from scratch food.. and this place is no exception. I had the spinach linguini with chicken, you can certainly taste the freshness the flavors were outstanding! The art and decor, which my friend told me the owner's wife made, is beautiful. It has a hip upscale modern feel which was a nice suprise from what you would expect from an  Italian resturant. Definetly can't wait to come back! Oh and my friend that took me there had the the Shrimp Diablo, which  I did get to try, also very rich and flavorful, unique spices, its really no surprise this place has so many great reveiws... Foodies, I recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food.  Cheese Ravioli in brown butter sauce with pistachio nuts, excellent."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I decided I'd like to try a restaurant I hadn't been to previously for my wife's birthday. We both like Italian and so I did a search for restaurants in Green Valley. I saw that the Pasta Shop Ristorante had excellent reviews so I made a reservation. We were not disappointed. Not only was the food amazingly good, so was the service. They serve classic dishes with home made pasta. Caesars Salad is included with every entree. My wife had the Ravioli Bianca and I had the Chicken Parmesan. My wife especially love the pistachios in her dish. We started the meal with an artichoke appetizer that was not only visually stunning but incredibly delicious.   The owner, David, greeted us and introduced himself...made us feel welcome in his establishment.  It was very special treatment and he was the same way with all the other customers. As we were finishing our meal, David spent some time with us after bringing my wife a birthday desert on the house. He then gave me a pound of fresh home made pasta.   This is now one of our favorite restaurants and we will be returning often including tonight (Valentine's Day).  Even if you don't live in Green Valley, it's worth the drive. I suggest making reservations as seating is limited."}
{"text":"This place has the best homemade pasta in town.  It holds its own against the pasta shops I went to while in Rome. The Ravioli Bianca is to die for! Tender pasta cooked to perfection with a delicious brown butter sauce, very light. My boyfriend's favorite dish is the Shrimp Tamara.  We have been here numerous times and the staff is very friendly every time!  I also recommend the Baked Rigatoni and their Caprese."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything is fresh, including the pasta. My friend and I shaqred a lasagna and a salad, we ended up getting an extra of each to bring home. With the Yelp deal that's aqvailable, it was incredibly cheap. We're going bqck next week."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful day kayaking up the Colorado River -- but with near freezing weather, a tired body, and of course, a hungry stomach, my family was looking forward for an awesome meal. Within an hour, we were on our way to the Pasta Shop.   Walk in and be welcomed by the sea of locals pouring in, the regulars -- the owner consistently addresses his loyal customers by their first name, giving some a hug, giving some a free glass of wine. Typical local joint. Definitely a plus.   To begin with, the restaurant has a very creative interior -- it's an art gallery as well. I was also interested to hear that the owner was the former personal chef of Frank Sinatra, but I was even more surprised to see that this restaurant received incredibly high Zagat ratings (27 for food).   I really want to stress that the service here was absolutely exemplary. Out of every single restaurant I have attended my entire life, this restaurant has the best service out of them all. All of our waitresses were incredibly attentive, kind, and willing to tolerate any little change we had -- my personal disliking of cheese was no problem for them, as they substituted my Caesar salad for a balsamic vinaigrette, and my cousins' nut allergy was promptly taken care of. Never once did we ask for more water -- it was consistently refilled. Despite my big Asian family's tendency to order a lot of food and ask for little changes on all of them, our waitresses always smiled and were happy to change it. For example, we wanted to change all the dishes with rigatoni to their famous home-made pasta -- and they had no trouble changing it. Service here is simply amazing.   In terms of food, I ordered the Frank's Favorite meat sauce -- their version of a bolognese -- and substituted rigatoni for home-made linguini. First things first, the pasta is CLEARLY home-made and yummy -- while a little too chewy for my personal preference and not \"al dente\" like I enjoy it, it was still quite good. The meat sauce, on the other hand, was a little unusual. I noticed on the menu that they do not cook meats in the sauce -- they \"finely chop\" meatballs. This was made incredibly salient early on; the sauce lacked the deep, earthy meat taste that it should have simply for that reason. In addition, there was some weird spice -- kind of minty, but kind of lemony -- that just through the meat sauce to an entire different taste that did not feel right. To be completely honest, the food here does not deserve a 27 on Zagat. The meat sauce just did not taste right and had some things missing -- but don't get me wrong, for as hungry as I was, this place definitely satisfied and was still quite delicious. I also tried my dad's Chicken Marsala, which was AWESOME. Order this if you come; the chicken was tender, perfectly well done, and incredibly flavorful.  The tiramisu was ordered for dessert and was also wonderful -- on par with other restaurants and an Italian bakery. Make sure you check in on Yelp for that free pound of pasta too!!!  To be concise, this place is good. But it's just that -- it's good. While the service here was just incredible, I really felt as if the 3.5 star rating was justified as the meat sauce just did not taste right. Definitely not deserving of a 27 rating, but definitely a place to check out when in Vegas or Henderson. Make the trip here, I'm strongly recommending it -- I simply just ordered the wrong thing, I'm sure.   Food: 23 | Service: 29 | Decor: 20"}
{"text":"Fresh Pasta made daily.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a joke, first of all the pizza is not even housemade, it looks like a tomato sauce covered cracker from a 99c store, but charging 16 dollar for half portion puts it to a whole new level of incompetence. Sadly just  another American restaurant trying to be Italian. 100 dollar dinner for a ice cold Chianti and frozen pizza? Really ? Too bad there's no negative rating, one star is not bad enough for this. Good luck Keep on paying good reviews! On top of all this, they didn't wait for us to be done before giving us the bill. They close at 8:30."}
{"text":"Amazingggg! David the chef was wonderful. Homemade pasta at it's best. We will be back for sure. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of 2 things- they don't have a set closing time and that made us feel bad because we were the last customers in the restaurant and I knew they were trying to get outta there. Not having a closing time makes it hard for me because I don't like being that customer that walks in 30 minutes before closing. The other reason was because it is a little pricy to make it a once a week or so place."}
{"text":"Average, in the modern mediocre sense.  We were (still) looking for a new italian restaurant close by, our old favorite having disappeared a few years back. While driving along, I found this place on Yelp.  My only rule for restaurants, especially Italian, is I do not want a food factory. None of the chains for me. There too much room and too much talent in this town to waste time eating in a chain.  We went in and found a strange mixture of modern metal art and bright bud and miller beer signs. Not bad. Not great. Just average.  We were greeted by, I will assume, one of the owners. A pleasant enough fellow. He, nor any of the staff ever introduced themselves. An anonymous group serving us dinner. For the rest of the service we got the bare minimum of interaction. Drink order taken and served. Food order taken. Salad served. Dinner served. Dessert menu and check. Average. Mediocre.  I am usually a two drink during dinner guy. My beer ran out and no one ever noticed. I didn't bother to do their job as hosts and ask for more.  On to the food. A fantastic plate of, well, average. There was nothing wrong with the food. Chicken was well prepared and cooked. The raviolis were still al dente, properly drained and served. The marinara sauce is the only thing to find fault. Tomato sauce you could safely serve your entire family without complaint for too much salt, pepper, oregano, or spice. A flavourless endeavour. Overall my impression was that the chef has lost his passion for food and is phoning it in. Uninspired average fare.   Pricing is where I have issue. Two people with one drink each came out to $30 per person. For what it was, its overpriced. $20 per person is appropriate.  Would I eat here again? Yes, if someone else invited me and bought dinner.  Three nice average stars for this place. No hard feelings but the hunt is still on."}
{"text":"I love the pasta here, home made and fresh!  Get the shrimp and spinach pasta in olive oil and garlic.  It is amazing.  My only issue is the price, it seems a bit to high for the quality of the food.  I also wouldn't mind seeing more specials on the daily.  The staff is friendly, and professional."}
{"text":"Just had such a great meal at pasta shop. We were visiting Henderson for a conference and thought we would take a chance. The staff could not have been nicer and the food was authentic and delicious. A must go if in the area!"}
{"text":"\"Fresh pasta, funky art, fabulous wine,\" read the chalkboard outside this restaurant's entrance.  The Pasta Shop Ristorante delivered on all three accounts!  I think the consensus of fellow Yelpers should give you a good sense of the place.  I was looking to get \"off campus\" from my stay on the Strip.  The Pasta Shoppe was worth the drive to nearby Henderson.    The atmosphere is definitely bistro/casual.     My meal featured a generous portion of fresh linguini crowned with in-shell Littleneck Clams The ceasar salad was a worthy accompaniment.   Add a great wait staff and an engaging owner-operator and my dining experience was complete.  As for the price points, it is all relative.  In comparison to some of the Strip restaurants I'd normally go to, TPS provided real value-and a welcome alternative for my dining dollar."}
{"text":"They have the best food ever! I recommend going here not only because the foods amazing, but the environment in this restaurant is like no other Go check it out you will love it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Italian food, and this place did not disappoint. Service was great, food was fantastic, and the place had a great feel to it. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here tonight with a group.  Everyone really enjoyed the pasta.  I had the grilled salmon with lobster ravioli.  It was so good.  We'll be back here again when we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been to the Pasta Shop for dinner twice. My first experience was fairly good and the first date with my now girlfriend of almost a year. It was only a matter of time before we returned to relive the experience and it was very, very disappointing.  I order the Ravioli Blanca with scallops, which come with a $15 price tag for the scallops. I am a huge seafood fan! To my horror, these where literally the worst scallops I have ever had! Disgusting. They were very overcooked and had a chemical taste. The worst. Needless to say I only had a small bite from each of the 3 hoping only one was bad. All were bad and my issue comes when the server clears my plate and obviously notices I didn't eat the scallops and just takes the plate away. A question at that point could have fixed my awful experience. Fail for service and food. My girlfriends spinach pasta with a garlic butter sauce was bland as well. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Free 1 lb homemade pasta for Yelp checkin. The owner was very nice and you can tell he has many loyal customers. The pasta was great. Worth giving this place a try especially if you live in the area. You might discover your new favorite neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here with the fam. It was one of those nights when we couldn't decide on a place until my husband yelped Italian. So glad we went! Every single dish was fantastic. The squid ink saffron shrimp pasta reminded me of Indian food (love it!). My husband had the chicken marsala, and I have to say it was the BEST I've had. Marsala flavor really came through, and the chicken was so tender. My son had the Frank's favorite pasta and I think it was the best of the night. My daughter had the Teatro. Yum! The salad and bread came out within 3 minutes of putting in our order, and the salad was dressed PERFECTLY. Portions of everything were very generous. Dessert? Yes please! The pineapple upside down cake was fab and the tofutti was good too. The real kicker was the sea salt caramel gelato that they served with the pineapple upside down cake. Delicious!   Service was perfect. The girls were super nice and very attentive.  This will be a regular spot for us! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! It's a small Italian restaurant and art gallery. The decor has this laid back vibe, and you can tell a lot of people that go there are regulars. It was our first time, after reading the reviews and some article about it online we decided to check it out.   As soon as you walk in the restaurant you get greeted by the aroma of homemade sauce being cooked!!!   Our food was amazing the waitstaff was really friendly and bonus if your check in at yelp you get free bag of fresh made pasta, who doesn't love free food lol   It's a little expensive but the food was worth it! Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Our fifth and final meal for Spring Restaurant Week was at Pasta Shop Ristorante in Anthem. They had two price points for the RW menu $30.13 and $50.13. The former was the better deal. The difference between them was the entree and dessert. Seafood vs. Chicken or Sausage and Cannoli vs. Tirimisu. They willingly substituted dessert.   We started with Fresh Mozzarella and Roma Tomato and Caesar Salad. The Caprese was fantastic, simple and fresh, quality ingredients. The Caesar was too lightly dressed, this is a rare complaint from me. I enjoy lightly dressed salads, but the taste of the romaine overpowered any other flavor. Leaves on their own are pretty boring.   The husband had the Mediteranean Sausage over pasta. I had the Portofino with Fresh Shellfish in a Fra Diablo Sauce over Linguine. The sausage was very good with excellent flavor. The linguine was also quite tasty. The shellfish varied, the shrimp and scallops were tender and properly prepared. The clams and mussels were overcooked and very chewy. I also expected the dish to be spicy, but it was not. All in all, the Portofino was fine, but it had the potential to be more enticing.   Finally, we finished with tiramusi and cannoli. Both were enjoyable. The Pasta Shop is great neighborhood find. I'm glad we were given the excuse to give it a try. If in the area, I'd return to sample more of their housemade pastas."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in Vegas, hands down! Annie always takes the time to get to know each of the customers and Gianna gives great customer service as well! The Henderson community is truly lucky to have food this great and genuinely good people."}
{"text":"This review is from a while back, so maybe it's changed since then.  Dinner was fantastic. Great Italian, exactly what I'd expect from the Yelp reviews. We dined early, around 5pm and there was no crowd (just as I like it!) Very hard to go wrong, except the dessert.  Fantastic dinner, mediocre dessert. Definitely on the return list, but I can't imagine ever taking a chance to eat the dessert here when there are so many other dessert options in the area."}
{"text":"This shop is a warm and delightful experience! With a home grown feel, every time I've been in here, the restaurant owner has been in. Of the three dishes I've had, the flavors of the sauces and toppings have been pleasantly subtle to showcase the house made pasta. I mean hello! It's a Pasta shop, not a sauce shop. The flavor and quality of the different types of pasta; spinach linguine, pepper papperdelle, and ravioli Bianca, are tasty pared with a good red wine. A small shop, is busy around dinner and I've not had to wait (at all or very long) to be sat.   There's a whole section for the plant based people of the vegan variety, live music on the weekends, funky art to admire."}
{"text":"Great food , homemade pasta, what's not to love.  Had Tue salmon special with a cream pesto sauce over lobster ravioli, topped with lobster, mushrooms, and pistachios, outstanding.  Chef David is terrific!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding.  Service, food, ambiance. Every dish is freshly made to order. The sauces are also house made. Nothing canned, my friends.  I honestly cannot express how happy I am with my decision to try out this sweet restaurant.  The owner,  David was very warm and welcoming. He takes the time to chat with all of his guests to the point where, as a guest, you feel genuinely appreciated...like friend. The ambiance is perfect for family, dates, friends,  everyone and anyone.  It's casual but very tastefully classy. This is certainly becoming one of my regular spots. Cannot waif to have friends and family in town to bring them here!!! :)"}
{"text":"Right around the corner from where I live, so I tried them out.  I was not disappointed.  Great pasta made fresh.  Service was excellent.  The owner came by and asked me how my experience was.  I have been back several times and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"It doesn't even look like a dining place on the outside, but the food is really up there, even by Las Vegas standards. Prices include salads and delicious warm garlic cheese bread. A \"must try\"."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing food. Walking into this restaurant you wouldn't expect the gourmet meal you are served. Crazy amazing. Home made pasta is perfect, favors are without question some of the best we've ever had. This was our first time here but it won't be our last, matter of fact we think this is our go to restaurant for true Italian. A little bit pricy but your paying for incredible quality."}
{"text":"Moved to this area a year ago and was so happy to find this place. The owner David is always welcoming. The staff and the beautiful art makes it an amazing dining experience. I have not ordered anything I don't like. Its a well hidden treasure."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised the fresh pasta is some of the best I have ever had the sauces are very tasty and delicious it was far above my expectations.  They also had a ton of vegan options my daughter really enjoyed.  Her sister had a soy based meat that tasted exactly like meat it was very good.  The place is clean and service good.  This is a neighborhood gem!!"}
{"text":"This place is a staple...absolutely great customer service and food.  David, the owner, is super nice too."}
{"text":"This is my idea of the perfect, little, family-run restaurant. The service is warm and personable. The restaurant is small and quaint.   While some people may think this restaurant is expensive, it's actually not too bad because they include salad and bread with pasta entrees, and the pasta is fresh! The pasta is perfectly cooked and sauced.   The linguini fra diavolo was good, but I would have liked a touch more spice. The teatro pasta was also good with a large amount of the thin cream sauce on it. The portions are also pretty good. I definitely left full.   Check out this place to support a good local restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and delicious---  I highly recommend to anyone wanting a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Where do I begin, they do provide a complimentary Caesar salad, but failed to provide or offer fresh ground pepper. Also, the salad was clearly prepared ahead of time as some of it was rusty and the plates were ice cold.   I chose the 'linguine' with white clam. Too bad they served fettuccine. Fresh clams, but hardly a hint of garlic (and the hint was more raw than cooked), and although there were a good amount, they were so small it needs more (and a tiny fork to get them out of the shell). Again, no fresh ground pepper. One more thing, I like fresh ground reggiano parmigiana (I know, it's a sin with fish, but I like it)... None offered. Big fail.   Kim chose the chicken parm. Again, a total fail. The 'sauce'... Really? Crushed tomatoes, no seasoning. Boxed rigatoni, way under cooked. The chicken had a previously frozen texture. The parm was melted but totally missed the slightly golden color. Again, no fresh grated cheese or pepper.   Sad excuse for Italian"}
{"text":"I really want to go to four stars, but I just can't. I guess it's another 3.5 for me.  First, really love the atmosphere. A little like the dearly departed Jazzed (moment of silence for one of all-time Vegas favorites.) Friendly, timely service, which you'd expect from one of the owners. Went with a suggestion of mussels ($13) to start and they were awesome. Star of the night - big but not gamey.  The salad course was unremarkable, but good enough. The bread, though, was strong and perfect to clean up the tomato/mussel broth.  We went with an entree (chicken davida, $18) and a big app (half Bianco pizza, $11) for the main course. Go figure: the pizza blew away the entree, which proved heavy and underseasoned. It was fine, just not something I'd race back to have again. The pizza was strong, using tarragon and cashews to create something different and tasty. I'd order it again in a heartbeat.  My wife had a house red ($7) - table wine at best, sweet grape juice at worst.   So I pull a half-star for the semi-miss on the entree and a full one for price. Before tip, we checked in at $55 for what amounted to a glass of wine, two apps and an entree. Quality food, yes, but that's a little rich for my blood for what we ate."}
{"text":"The service was good. David the owner introduced himself and a very nice guy. The linguini and clams was good. The upside down pineapple cake was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Green Valley and was excited to find vegan options available, service was okay, but certainly not over the top especially considering the price.  The server was not very knowledgeable about the menu which is a little disconcerting if you have are trying to follow a plant based diet, and the person serving you does not know what ingredients are in the food.  My suggestion is for some training, I am okay when someone says \"I don't know\" buy not okay with an I don't care attitude.  Service aside could have earned one more star if the food was good, found it to be rather bland, and I ordered a spicy dish."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. Ordered take out and the way the waitress packed my order was senseless. Marsala spilled all over the box and out onto my car seat. The chicken Marsala was bland and noodles were waaayyy over cooked. The complimentary salad had little to no taste and DID NOT taste like Caesar salad. The croutons are good. I will not be coming back to this establishment. It looked promising and the atmosphere was cool, but the price for the food is not worth it! I spent $43 for 2 CHICKEN pasta dishes (that don't cost much to make) and felt robbed AND hungry. Maybe the fact that most of the sauce from the Marsala can be found in my car or on my carpet is the reason for a bad review, but the food speaks for itself.  It IS NOT WORTH IT! To think I tipped the person that inevitably ruined my car and my hallway. Such a shame. Try this place if you like I hope you get better service and food than I did. Good luck!"}
{"text":"What a gem! Hard to see, very very good! Ordered baked rigatoni to go and I wish I had found this place sooner!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Pasta Shop since 2007 when it was located on Tropicana. The food is always outstanding. The pasta of course is amazing. If you have never had fresh made pasta you must try. The texture especially is so different. I've gone frequently with groups and never had anyone disappointed. At the new location I do recommend reservations but we have always had good luck without as well. Always ask about the specials.. the salmon in lobster cream, cold artichoke and calamari are a few of my favorites. The marsala is one of my favorite \"regular\" menu items. The staff is friendly and I love supporting a locally owned restaurant. Every time I've been one of the owners is there. Although it can be a little pricey, for the quality it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! The ambiance is nice with beautiful artwork displayed throughout! If you're looking for an intimate dining experience with delicious Italian food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Good tasting Italian food with plenty of vegetarian options, and even a whole page dedicated to vegan choices.  The food was very fresh, the flavors were really good, the service was on point, and the only reason it's not a 5 star is the price point(around $20 a dish).  I even think it's worth the price for people looking for a quality Italian food, so if that's what you're looking for, give this place a try."}
{"text":"This is not our first visit to the Pasta Shop~     While is is kind'a short on ambiance their fresh made pasta makes up for it.     The Pasta Shop is a cross between a restaurant & Art Gallery. Most of the art wouldn't be on my home, but that's OK!    The menu isn't huge, however it is CONSISTENT! Which is always better than a lot of mediocre selections~    We don't usually go out on NYEVE but their email with the 2 prix fixed menus along with something local (away from the craziness of the Strip) was VERY appealing.     All the food was really good, came out timely (which it always has, BTW!) and tasted DEELISH! (Like always!) their ONLY weak spot would be dessert. cannoli shell quite thick, filling is good tho, sweet but good! Not much imagination however many restaurants fall into weakness in this category.     All the servers are younger gals, very polite, friendly & know the menu. Not constantly trying to upsell every course  which I appreciate VERY much.     Very much a locals kind of place serving VERY good Italian  food. Moe Rocca would LUV it too!"}
{"text":"Beyond expectations. I've had a lot of people refer me here and finally came to check it out. I got the Salmon and Lobster ravioli special and words can't describe the amount of deliciousness. My husband ordered the clam linguini and that was just as delicious. Caesar salad was absolutely delicious along with the bread and shrimp scampi as our appetizer. We will definitely be frequently here more. Bonus for the free bag of handmade pasta to take home...thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Ravioli Bianca is delicious! The browned butter and fresh basil are a hit! The sauce for the spaghetti is wonderful. Not runny at all. Lasagna... Great!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure about this place. Wasn't bad by any means but also wasn't great like I was hoping for. The bread basket wasn't good, they don't have any real appetizers (some foo foo salad stuff and shrimp scampi). When I think pasta, I think of great appetizers. Not here. I ordered the meat sauce pasta and will give it an 7/10. Nothing extremely special. The only item that was absolutely delicious was the Spimoni pie dessert. Absolutely fabulous. I'm going to give this place a 2nd shot and hopefully have a better experience. The waitresses were all beautiful so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Yes, as good as it gets.  Had the salmon and lobster ravioli they are known for, along with the artichoke appetizer and 2 glasses of Malbec."}
{"text":"Fresh pasta. Not too many family run  restaurants make their own pasta!!! You definitely taste the difference. Friend paid $23.45 for clam linguine (gluten free pasta version instead of linguine). She said pricey for what it was, not a whole lot of clams, mild flavor- could use more garlic. But hey, you get what you pay for! Made from scratch! Maybe add more clams? I love the pappardelle pasta, and also the artichoke appetizer. Downer- $6 for a tiny scoop of gelato??! Server could have told us the price of that! Not worth it, lost a star for that."}
{"text":"The absolute best handmade pasta that I have had in vegas. You can tell that they want to put forth only the highest quality product and that clearly shows through in the dishes that we had.. the pasta is of such high quality that even the simplest dish is an experience to be had.."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my pasta quite a bit. They have an entire vegan menu to choose from if you're vegan, and the selection is pretty good. My only complaint is it's super duper pricey. Bowl of noodles and sauce ran me over 17 -18 bucks. My bf had the lunch special which was the same exact dish, only with seafood and it was cheaper lol. Same portion of pasta and sauce. I would love if they threw a vegan option on lunch, that would lock this place down for me."}
{"text":"I can only say that this is one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas! Never a disappointment. Everything is seasoned perfectly, the salad.. garlic bread...sauces.. pizza... and the pasta always has a perfect chew and texture. Try the Alfredo and the Ravioli Bianca. Delish!"}
{"text":"This Italian eatery sports a trendy hipster decor. The walls feature modern art and vibrant colors.   My caesar salad came out quickly and was excellent. Well dressed, which is unfortunately rare among many restaurants. The meal included gresh cheesy ciabatta garlic bread, which was superb. It wasn't overly cheesy or greasy. They really hit the appetizers on the money.  Unfortunately, entrees took a little longer than I'd like.  But the food was well worth the wait. It was easy to tell the pasta was freshly made. It was very well cooked and the sauce had excellent flavor.   Overall, I am impressed. Every other dish at the table tasted excellent.   My one criticism is the delay between getting our appetizers and our entrees. Overall it didn't actually take that long between when we ordered and when our entrees came out. However, having the salad and bread coming out immediately after ordering, then waiting the rest of the time for our entrees was a bit jarring. It messed with the pace of the meal.   Other than that, fabulous meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great catering services! I tried the salmon because I follow a gluten free diet , and it was delicious. If you're ever in the area, this is a must try."}
{"text":"My fiancee took our family here for dinner one night. I loved the decor. The owners wife is a brilliant artist and the environment is to die for. The food was by far the best I had (sausage pasta). The service was spot on from the moment we walked in until it was time to leave. Certainly a great place for date nights or with the family."}
{"text":"Took a friend here for their birthday dinner. Loved the food. Also had a check in on Yelp deal that got me a free pound of homemade pasta which I made the next night at home. Yum."}
{"text":"Quality!  The linguini diablo is almost perfect with huge portions of scallops and shrimp.  Every meal begins with salad and their bread is baked with cheese on the spot."}
{"text":"I found this little gem driving by. I'm so very glad I stopped. It's a super cute little spot for a date night. Great staff. The food was unbelievably good. Extremely pleased. I strongly suggest this spot"}
{"text":"First impression was \"wow!\" when I was waiting for my food to cook. The contemporary artwork and decor throughout the restaurant is pretty impressive. Everything, even attention to the details like the custom made tables, salt pepper shakers and even the toilet seat in the bathroom was crazy cool!  The selections are limited for  lunch but I found a salad and entree I wanted to try; the Fresh Mozzarella and Plum Tomatoes for my salad and Rigatoni Primavera for my entree.   The mozz, tomatoes were fresh but way too much vinaigrette. You cant tell from the picture, but after you get thru the layer of mozz and tomatoes, the vinaigrette filled up the well of the bowl. So after eating 1/2 my salad the other 1/2 was drowning in the dressing  ...next time I'll request it on the side.     The rigatoni dish was alright. Again pasta and veggies cooked right, but olive oil doused over whole dish. There was a nice pool of it left at the bottom. I really like the garlicky taste though. Shrimp was kind of bland tasting and texture a little tough.    My server was pleasant and attentive enough, but as other parties started to come in, it was hard to get her attention after she closed my check. I wanted to purchase some of the custom made utensils and it took awhile to get her attention again.  Well so far it's obvious  I like the art gallery part of it more than the food part of it. I really want to rate this place four stars but the cuisine doesn't quite match up. So 3.5 stars for now.  I'll give the dinner time hours a try next time around since there are more dishes I would like to try on there."}
{"text":"My husband and I are partners in three restaurants in Los Angeles, and we recently moved to Henderson.  The Pasta Shop was recommended to us by a friend.  What a find!  The food is exquisite and the service is beyond excellent.   Saffron cream black squid pasta with shrimp??!!  WOW!  The meatballs are best I've ever tasted.  The chef and owner, David, actually sat down with us for 10 minutes and chatted.  It is so wonderful to go to a restaurant where the owner takes such good care of customers.  We have found our \"favorite\" Italian restaurant in Las Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Pasta Shop Ristorante but carbs and I have been seeing other people lately. I had a recent relapse and ended up here with Bethany E for their Restaurant Week dinner specials. Worth it! The artsy, eclectic location is great for catching up with a friend or a low-key dinner date.   We started with simple Caesar salads and garlic cheese bread, then shared the Shrimp Fra Diablo and Rigatoni Primavera with chicken. The pastas were clearly fresh-made, and the portion sizes were such that our leftovers made another full meal. Though I liked the linguini, the sauce was not at all spicy like I'd expected and seemed to be missing something- maybe adding fresh shredded cheese would have helped amp this up a bit. The Rigatoni dish was light and vibrant with lots of fresh vegetables, making it a healthier guilt-free option. I'm not especially fond of cannoli but appreciated that the version served here was freshly filled to order.  Keeping this spot on my short list of options when I need to eat my feelings or when I'm powering up for a half-marathon. Great neighborhood spot, check the register area for art and jewelry available for purchase. Don't forget to check in on social media for a free bag of fresh pasta!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here during Restaurant Week to try out some Italian dishes.  I wished to be blown away.  I wasn't.    We walked in when they opened for dinner.  We had our choice of seating in a quaint dining room area.  The decor is funky with various artwork.  Our waitress for the evening was attentive and lovely.  She provided great service during our visit.    The restaurant week menu starts with a Caesar Salad with garlic cheese ciabatta bread.  It was good and fresh.  I love the shaved parmesan vs. shredded grated parmesan.  We were off to a good start.  For the second course, I chose the Shrimp Fra-Diablo and Stefany chose the Rigatoni Primavera with Chicken so we could each try a little of each.  The shrimp dish was kind of a let down.  The spicy red sauce wasn't all that spicy. The sauce was a bit bland and needed a little help.  The Rigatoni was not too exciting for me either. The chicken was too plain but the vegetables were fresh and abundant.    For the third course is their homemade cannoli.  Now if you're an Italian place you better get the cannoli right.  They nailed it.  Fresh light crispy shell with an indulgent filling and lightly drizzled with chocolate.    I'm not opposed to stopping in to try other menu items but it's not a rush for me."}
{"text":"Amazing local mom and pop Italian restaurant with delicious food and fun atmosphere, with a little art gallery.  Definitely recommend and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Really really good.  I had spinach linguine with sun dried tomatoes and EVOO.  Can't wait to eat my leftovers tomorrow!  My guy had linguine and clams that he enjoyed. Clams were fresh and presentation was really nice. They gave us a bowl of fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!   Service was great.  The only thing that could of been better was the Caesar salad.  Or was mediocre at best. If I could give 1/2 a star this restaurant would get 4 1/2."}
{"text":"Ravioli Bianca is AMAZING!!  Great service and super great food!!  We've only been for lunch so far, but we're looking forward to returning for a dinner service.  One of the best Italian restaurants we've been to in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food & atmosphere. Good date night spot"}
{"text":"BEST ITALIAN IN VEGAS! I went here for a family dinner yesterday and fell in love! Everyone was extremely friendly and it had a very family friendly atmosphere! I am not an Italian food fan, but this food was outstanding! No wonder it has amazing reviews! The only thing that i didn't like was the fact that we had to wait for a table out side in the heat even though there were plenty of open tables inside."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and great service! The staff is super friendly & work hard to please. Always have good suggestions & accommodating.  The Bianca ravioli is the best ravioli in town.  There is lots of choices for everyone & great appetizers. Highly recommend the artichoke!  The atmosphere is very quaint & great for family or romantic dinner. Been going here 4 years & never a bad meal. Always amazing service!"}
{"text":"This is a little pearl for Italian food.  Artichoke was amazing and the caprese  sandwich was superb.  They even bring you cheese bread to start."}
{"text":"3.5. The salads were great. The eggplant was tasty, not the best ever but it was tasty. The pasta hubby got was ok, the sauce was not what he was expecting I think he said it was to thin.   The service was FANTASTIC. Really good service. I want to go back just because the experience was so positive."}
{"text":"Wow, where to begin? I guess first, as a former Henderson restaurant owner, it breaks my heart to have to Yelp my poor experience at a long established Italian restaurant. We have been going to the Pasta Shop since their Tropicana days. We have been to the newer Horizon Ridge location at least 10 times since they opened. Unfortunately, the last couple of times that we have been here since the Chef owner passed away, the service has been lacking. We have stayed away for most of the last year. Tonight we figured lets try it again with some friends. Well tonight sealed the deal for us to never, I mean NEVER come back!   We were a party of 5 tonight. 3 guys and 2 gals. The meal started with the salads being served to the 3 guys and not the gals, the gals salads took at least 5 minutes later???? Ok so we think maybe just a mix up or something. But still, serve the ladies first! Nope. So 4 of the group finished the salads but I am still working on mine. The waitress tries 3 separate times to take my salad. Wow. Can I finish it? Then, they serve 2 of us guys the main course but nothing for the ladies and my friend??? Then 5 minutes later our lady friend gets her entree? Ok, where is my wife's entree and my friends??? Well then my wife gets her entree 5 minutes later! Ok, by now we are thinking the Twilight zone has arrived. So we ask about our friend's lasagna, where is it??? The waitress says that is being made, mean while, 5 minutes later the table next to us that got sat after us, gets a lasagna. Nice. By this point we are just thinking that this place is not worth coming back. Then the waitress brings my friend another glass of wine and said that there was no charge for it. 20 minutes later the lasagna shows up! The rest of us have waited to eat our meals as our friends did not show up. Well as you can imagine our entree's have now gotten cold.   The ownership/manager never came over to our table to apologize and offer to remake our cold food? Then the waitress shows up to the table with a tiramisu and 2 small bags of pasta to take home with an apology. I ask for the check. The waitress brings our check and my wife asks if they removed the charge for the lasagna. No is the answer, seriously, wow???  At this point my wife gets up and asks for the owner/manager. The owner talks to my wife and is puzzled as to what happened and does not apologize but asks my wife if she should come to the table and apologize? Wow, crazy, you are operating a restaurant and you do not already know that you should have come to the table and apologized at least 20 minutes ago and offered a free bottle of wine or something else for the table while you took 20 minutes to bake the the missing lasagna that you gave to the other table and should have removed the lasagna from the check???  All of the aforementioned happened after we spent an hour telling our friends how good the food is at the Pasta Shop and convinced them to try it!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, arrived 10 minutes prior to 9 pm and door locked, that is awful management to close early, I will never return."}
{"text":"This small restaurant packed great flavors and good service.  We enjoyed being served by one of the owners who took extra time to welcome us and tell us about the restaurant (like they sell their pasta to various Strip locations). We started the meal with the tomato basil polenta - the marinara and cashews gave it a wonderful flavor. The Caesar salad was nothing great but is it ever?  The highlight of the dinner was the buttery, nutty goodness called Ravioli Bianca. A must get!  The Chicken Davida was also very tasty. It was as if chicken parm married eggplant parm.  The side of veggies were divine - as crazy as that sounds. So why not 5 stars?  The desserts - after such a fabulous meal we were hoping for more homemade goodness. Don't be swayed though- this place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pasta place off the strip.. I've been here a few times with my wife.. I usually like to try different things but I'm stuck on one dish, Saffron shrimp saute. Its black squid pasta with tiger shrimp and saffron sauce. I'll definitely be back to try many more great dishes.. Oh by the way I like how the owner comes out  and greets everyone..."}
{"text":"Exceptional food the Italian secret of Las Vegas . Fresh pasta and amazing atmosphere . The Artichoke was everyone's fav and they're new vegan menu is great lots of options."}
{"text":"The pasta is out of the world!  No other restaurant can duplicate the service, food and knowing a family has made this a special place to eat"}
{"text":"Worst thing you can say to a customer \"your the only one who says that.\"  That's why your restaurant only has only four out 12 tables filled on a Saturday night between 6 to 8.  Pasta Shop you have changed since Tropicana.   Menu is worse, food is horrible and service is inconsistent.  We were never told the specials and the table that sat down as we finished were told all about the specials.  The server kept giving vague and odd answers that showed she didn't know anything.  The sauce for the pasta and eggplant parm were way over spicy. The meatballs you gave us in exchange had the same sauce. We paid over 40 dollars to leave hungry. Even my son's spaghetti and meatballs were over cooked.  You used to have creative and very good quality dishes. What happened?  Did you even taste the sauce after or just act like we were making the entire thing up?  Very bad overall to what used to be one of my favorite restaurants in town. Do not eat here.  Between the decor, service and quality of food it reminded me of something out of  Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"Growing up Italian, in New York, authentic Italian is easy to come by. Since living in Las Vegas, and meeting David personally, I was so in love with his concept, I came to try it myself. It's been four years of eating here, and I have yet to be even slightly unimpresssed with anything I have eaten here. Tonight I had their special. Chicken sausage with Porta Bella mushrooms, asparagus, tiger shrimp and butternut squash ravioli tossed in EVOO. This entree floored me. I would definitely make it one of my top three choices when I come here. So impressed as usual."}
{"text":"Came here for a quiet dinner and had a very nice experience.  We arrived about 5pm, there was one only other table seated. By 6 when we left -the place was packed.  Ordered w ease off the vegan menu-treato diablo (spinach pasta w diablo sauce and kale and broccoli). I loved the light aromatic flavor of the spinach pasta. The sauce was the right amount of spicey for this spice wimp. The kale and broccoli were a nice touch. All the indulgence of a pasta dish w very little guilt..I'm sold.  The balsamic that comes on the house salad is really good-not too acidic. And it's made in house.  Very good service and nice ambiance.  Thank you, pasta shop ristorante!"}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend to try this place, since their pasta is homemade. At first glance I enjoyed the atmosphere-cool that they sell art too- it is a smaller place but we were seated immediately. I had the cheese ravioli with butter sauce which came with a side salad and bread. I thought everything tasted good and fresh but it wasn't worth the money...found out later it was $4 extra when I added a little bit of zucchini. I'm all for spending money on quality food but the food was just not as good as I anticipated...maybe I didn't pick a spectacular entree. The service was very good. I would say go and try it out and see what you think, it's worth it for sure! But I may go back to try another dish that was recommended."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! it has a very \"artsy\" bistro feel. When you walk in, you immediately feel welcome. The service was impeccable and of course the home made pasta is as good as it gets. Everything is fresh, and made from scratch. This is definitely a little gem. The best part was the we actually had Glenn (one of the brothers) wait on us due to a staffing issue. Apparently this never happens, well let me tell you.. Of course we will be back because the food was Fantastic, but having the opportunity to sit down and get to know Glenn himself was awesome. I even got some pasta to take home...Delish! Do yourself a favor and stop in for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"The food and service was great!!! There is a pasta shop back in California that makes their own pasta, and I love it. So I thought let's try this place out. It was definitely delicious.  My fiancé and I both got the Alfredo. It wasn't too heavy, so I got to enjoy the pasta as much as the sauce! We also tried the cheesecake, and that was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Hidden away in Anthem, it takes some time to get there from the city but it's worth it. The owners wife is an artist and sells her funky-metallic pieces here too. That may sound weird but it adds a nice ambiance to the place. Seating is a little limited but I like that.  Now for the food...the food, Uh-Mazing! I had the salmon linguine and it was perfect. Annnd, I cannot confirm this is true, but I heard that the Pasta Shop makes pasta for most of the Italian restaurants on the strip, I would believe it. This was some of the best pasta I have had in years.  The chef came to the table afterwards to ask about the meal, which I always love.   For the price this place is worth it a million times!!"}
{"text":"Pasta with mussels outstanding.  Original artwork made by the owner's wife fantastick!!!!  Service par excellence.  Tiramisu like cardboard - could not even finish it."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and each meal has been fantastic.  There is nothing better than homemade pasta.  Service is great as well.  Normally I would rather make lasagna at home but I must admit, the Pasta Shop's is better than mine."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, warm ambiance, great service. David does a terrific job...their Linguine w/ clams is delicious!"}
{"text":"If you want a FRIENDLY atmosphere.Great service and AWESOME FOOD THIS IS YOUR PLACE.Shrimp  diavlo was tops. FLAVORFUL NOT HOT. Linguini done perfectly.  Shrimp large and perfectly cooked.  A must if you enjoy Good food...."}
{"text":"After the long drive home from southern Cali, I just wanted yummy and easy food, and this is exactly what I got, with top notch service.  Artichoke appetizer: cold artichoke is not always my favorite, but this is the best I've had. It was beautifully presented, and I love balsamic (theirs is homemade), so it was lovely.  Cheese bread: perfect cheese to bread ratio   Salads: I could have used more croutons and cheese, but it was an unexpected surprise to get salad as I didn't even realize it was included  Ravioli (we had both kinds): perfectly cooked with light sauces dressing them. We both preferred the one with red sauce over my Bianca.  Meatballs: crispy outside and juicy inside  Cannoli: outstanding! They make them in house and I would even bet they make their own whipped cream - this is not reddi whip.  The price point is a little high, but David (the owner) said they supply their home made pastas to many casinos, and I could absolutely see people paying more for it. This teacher's salary might be reluctant to come back, but when David presented us with some fresh pasta to take home, I was sold. I don't check in on yelp ever, so it was another pleasant surprise.   The service was impeccable (in spite of the fact that there was a 15-person party that was receiving their salads as we came in), and I'd rather pay a little more to a local business than give a cheaper Italian chain restaurant my money!"}
{"text":"The Pasta Shop is my favorite restaurant in Henderson. From creative dishes like creamy-tomato teatro pasta, to traditional Italian favorites like eggplant Parmesan and lasagna, the food is fresh, flavorful and originally delicious. The house- made pasta is just one reason this place is so refreshing. Appetizers like the poached artichoke -- presented beautifully -- stand out from the ordinary fare available at the other Italian eateries around town. The atmosphere is equally exceptional. The walls of the cozy dining room display the vibrant artistic creations of the shop's owner. The Pasta Shop is a treat for the eye and the palate!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Went with the lasagna and would go back. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is that I showed up at 8:50 a few months back and the doors were locked! I guess he was trying to close up shop a little early. It was embarrassing to sit there are the door trying to open it with a bunch of diners still in there staring at my wife and I. Once we were in, they rushed us to get our order in which wasn't pleasant.  After all that, they were nice while cleaning up the store as we were eating."}
{"text":"Awful!!! Went in and asked if they had gluten free dough since I have an allergy... They said yes. We sat down and ordered drinks (just soda). Got our soda and a few minutes later they came to take our order. I ordered a gluten free pizza and they said that they didn't have any. I was kind of annoyed because I asked earlier but I just said that I would leave because there was nothing I could eat. They still charged us for the drinks... Silly!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. They make pasta in house, and it's delicious. Everything is so fresh. We have been several times, including on New Year's Eve. In addition to it being a great local Italian restaurant, it's so close to where we live! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food plus it's family owned! You gotta try the ravioli and the lasagna! Very nice service, amazing atmosphere, and the best Italian food in Vegas! And now they have a new Vegan Menu! Whoohoo a Vegan Restaurant in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant.  It's off the strip a bit, but a good change of pace from the Las Vegas glitz.  Down home restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"Really love it here.  Everyone is so kind to us. The owner is great!  I forgot my hat and left it for a couple months at least. The server remembered and returned it to me.  Yay!!  The artichoke is a MUST HAVE. drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, shavings of Parmesan and cracked pepper. Yum!!  Can't get enough of that soft cheesy bread.    We came in before closing.  They served us, but we had no idea they closed at 8 on this particular evening. If the hours were different I would definitely eat here more often. I could name 7 times I've wanted to come but it was closed lol."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner for Mother's Day and the restaurant was adorable! We ordered the spinach linguini and chicken marsala. The linguini was delicious, but it was a little too oily for my taste. The chicken marsala was perfect though, and the service was great."}
{"text":"It is a readily known fact that I can never turn down an Italian meal, so when the opportunity presented itself to try the Pasta Shop, I agreed with pleasure.  The setting is intimate, location is close to home (good or bad thing, I haven't decided yet), and the decor..um..well.. I can appreciate the fact this venue is supporting local art.  I'm not sure if the decor consists of several local artists or just one in particular, but the walls are covered in very eccentric art pieces.  Lets get to the good stuff.. the FOOD! A table of (7) and I for the most part decided to take advantage of the Restaurant Week set menu which consisted of a delicious caprise salad, Cesar salad, main course (spinach fettuccine in a garlic sun-dried tomato sauce with chicken), and for dessert..one of the BEST homemade cannoli's I've ever had!  Our server was attentive and our drinks rarely were empty and overall I would most certainly make the Pasta Shop a regular venue to feed my Italian food craving.  The price is a little high for standard pasta, but we are not talking past out of a box people, we are talking freshly made pasta daily!  Fresh pasta, delicious ingrediants and the best cannoli in town.. Pasta Shop is your place."}
{"text":"Ate there a few days ago for my birthday.  Went with friends.  Awesome meal as usual.  Great food."}
{"text":"This is definitely as good as it gets and YES...another hidden gem in Henderson! I can't believe I waited this long to try this restaurant.  A strong recommendation from a friend brought us in one night. Now the restaurant is located a small strip mall on Horizon/Carnegie. It's a small place with a very quaint and artsy  decor (which is for sale by the way, as it has price tags on them).  Onto the food...I had the squid ink saffron shrimp pasta...now say that 10 times fast! The pasta is made fresh...yes fresh and you can definitely tell the difference! The sauce was a creamy sauce but just the right amount so as not to make one feel disgustingly bloated. There was a generous portion of large shrimps cooked perfectly (see picture under tips). If I could, ok I did!...I cleared off my dish!...and I will definitely be coming back for more!  So good we had to give the owner kuddos as it was surely due!"}
{"text":"I have seen the reviews for this restaurant for months and wanted to try it. We were really excited to check it out. Read reviews the day before booking. Looked at all the photos for the dishes. And finally decided to book a reservation.  It's a cute enough place, but let's just say for the prices the menu is commanding if you show up for dinner you expect a little more than what it offers as a cute little lunch place. Our final bill with tip was $135. Yet even though we had made a reservation for a particularly late hour (the place was half empty), we were told we could have a high top or the table in front of the door. There were several other tables available, but when we asked about them, the owner said they were \"spoken for.\" Ironically, they remained empty the whole time we were there.  We had the artichoke appetizer. It was nicely prepared and well dressed. No complaints. Our salads came and they were simple but well dressed. Nothing to crow about really. I had the squid ink pasta with shrimp in creme sauce. I was really excited about this dish and it was good. I'm not sure whether it was $29 good, but I'm not cheap so normally I wouldn't care about that if it's a dish I can't get anywhere else. The pasta was nice, dense and the cream sauce was flavorful. It was a lot better than than the linguine and clams in rose sauce that my fiance had, which frankly she hated. We should have sent it back, but she insisted we didn't. But it didn't make her happy much.    What I did care about later were the details. Our waitress was clueless about service. We ordered a bottle of wine - of which there are none below $35. We ordered one that was $44 and you might expect that for that price it would come with someone who actually knows how to uncork the bottle. But no. She fumbled through it. Cute as a button that girl but not a single clue about how to serve a table decently. We asked for parmesan cheese (which she never offered) and she brought us a bowl of shaved parmesan. Which she didn't bother to serve. We asked if they had grated and she said that was all they had. Umm. Okay.   For all the raving about this place, I didn't see much of any of what was mentioned. We were there on a slow night and we never saw the owner once he sat us. He never came by. Our food was served pretty basically for an expensive place, and we kind of treated like they really didn't care if we were there. The food we had didn't warrant the prices. And neither did the wine.   We're big fans of Buon Gusto and maybe have just become way too accustomed to great food served by people without pretension. We should have gone there instead. We would have paid almost half and everything we've had there has been awesome.  As best as I can tell, this place has a bunch of regular friends who are visitors who warrant special seating and write great reviews for them. I didn't see any of the amazing things that people are raving about - and believe me I wanted to because this place is a stone's throw from my house and I was really hoping it would totally blow my mind.   I don't think we'll be returning. If the food was  just okay and the service was stellar or vice versa, that would different."}
{"text":"Last dined here years ago when they first opened, and menu has improved, although protein-based dishes are still high; all things considered($26-$32). \"Claim to fame\" is their \"fresh pasta.\" Personally, if not cooked quickly pasta can come across as \"gummy.\"  Linguine & Clam Sauce excellent as was Eggplant parmagian ( great tasting red sauce).  Made mistake of ordering Pizza at a non-pizzarea(needed more sauce and crust soft & chewy). Full size salad was HUGE.   Will try again and will order Lasagna. This My personal standard for an Italian restaurant. To be balanced, couple we were with love this restaurant and dine here monthly."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in Henderson. We have been going here since its old location on Eastern and have been regulars ever since.  Their staff and food is the best.  A family run business with some of the best Italian food in vegas.  Its pricier than your chain Italian restaurants but its worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I was looking for a place that had fresh pasta, and this place exceeded expectations.  From start to finish, the food was amazing.  I ordered the baked rigatoni and my husband ordered Frank's favorite meat sauce.  Portions were just right and pasta was cooked perfectly.  You must try the mocha coffee cake.  It was big enough to share, but I could definitely finish it myself because it was not too sweet.  Our server was attentive without hovering.  She was super helpful and gave great recommendations.  This is my new go to Italian place."}
{"text":"A great place that you might drive right past. Homemade Italian food with excellent flavor and taste. Unique artwork on the walls that is for sale. The owner is at the door to greet you. All the staff is very friendly.  I can't wait to return and try something else!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Italian meals I've had out. Pasta Shop Ristorante is a little place, that could easily be passed if you're not looking for it. After some debating on a Saturday night we decided to try out this little hole in the wall after reading some positive Yelp reviews. The aroma of the food being cooked in this little joint was unbelievable. There wasn't hardly a table open. The ambiance is perfect for this place - custom art everywhere, lot's of color, and dimly lit to create a quaint, but romantic atmosphere.   But let's be honest, if the atmosphere is great and the food is bad we're not really interested, right? The food was great. My wife and I both went somewhat traditional. I ordered the Lasagna and she ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. Both had cheese melting over the sides, were piping hot, and absolutely delicious. The lasagna had the perfect amount of sauce, perfect amount of cheese, and the it tasted amazing. The parmesan cheese they give you at the table is as good as I've ever had at any Italian restaurant. It's individual pieces cut unevenly off a brick of cheese. Melts right over the pasta and makes it even more delicious. The eggplant parm was as good as my lasagna, and enough to feed two. I would consider ordering that myself next time we go.   The restaurant is moderately priced, but worth every penny. Service was great and it appeared that the manager/owner was working the night we were there and keeping close tabs on all the tables. Our drinks were never low, the waitress was friendly and attentive. All in all a great experience.  Looking forward to our next experience at Pasta Shop Ristorante. And don't forget to check in on Yelp on your phone for some free fresh pasta."}
{"text":"They messed up our order and then the owner came out and acted like it was our fault and gave us attitude.  Then we found out the cause of our mixed up order was the waitress forgot to submit half of our order to the kitchen and then they lied about it and tried to cover it up   and then They ignored us.  We also overheard The table next to us with the same waitress had a similar problem one of their people did not get their food and it looked like they were having trouble with the owner as well. The owner had a real bad attitude towards the customers unbelievable"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night after referrals from two of her work colleagues.  It's a small place and reservations are a good idea, my wife called to place reservations and left a message on voicemail, a little disappointed she could not speak to a real person but she was nicely surprised when David called her back to confirm our reservations and that he was looking forward to serving us. Upon arrival we were greeted and seated quickly, service was excellent and the servers were knowledgable about the menu. We ordered a shrimp appetizer which was delicious (it could have been a little hotter for me, but my wife said it was good).  The Caesar Salad was fantastic, chilled plates, just enough dressing with a nice hint of anchovy and just the right size. Our main dish came out, little neck clams in a white wine sauce for me and raviolis for my wife, with a side of meatballs.  The clams were very good, could have used more garlic for me but then I am a garlic nut, most of the pasta is home made and is probably the best pasta I have had outside of my wife's kitchen.   We will be going back for sure, it's not cheap I would say above average but well worth it.  After we had paid the bill and we just about to leave, David stopped by to thanks us for dining with them and gave us a free ziplock bag of fresh homemade pasta to take home. A great little place with great food, great wine and a pleasing atmosphere.  As a side note, any art nuts out there he has a bunch of cool stuff from local artists around the restaurant that are for sale and are pretty cool."}
{"text":"Good place and decent food. Price was a little bit high but what can you expect when you order the special that isn't on the menu. The best part is the owner came and thanked us and made us feel important. You don't see that too often."}
{"text":"Order d the special with the lobster ravioli and salmon was a decent dish.  Also got rigatoni with sausage.  Both okay would give this place another shot. Liked local to henderson price point ok."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Vegas thus far. The owner and servers are very personable. The owner comes to the table to greet customers. It's a small restaurant so the service is fast and waiters are more attentive.   The food was delicious. I got the tortellini with vodka sauce which was amazing. Hubby got chicken Marsala and that was also very good.  We were too stuffed to have dessert but they have pineapple upside down cake. Can you believe it?! Maybe next time.  To top off our visit the owner gave us 2lbs of fresh pasta without us even asking. (There is deal for 1lb fresh pasta by checking in on yelp.) We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was place awesome we went solely based on the Yelp reviews, and we were completely not disappointed.  The wine list was great, the menu selections were exceptional, and the customer service was fantastic.  It isn't often at a restaurant with food like this that the owner is the one who seats you.  There is no actual kids menu, but they were very accommodating for our little dining companions.  We normally wouldn't have tried a restaurant like this in a little plaza with high expectations.  But it was well worth the try.  We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Very tasty dishes! The cheesy bread and balsamic dipping sauce are very addicting. I highly recommend this place.   The owner is very nice...he gave us a free dessert as a big thank you to service members (my sis is in the airforce). Thought that was really nice. ;-)"}
{"text":"Great food and service but way too pricey. Clams in garlic broth were good but could taste the sand. They need to be washed more. Saffron shrimp had more  turmeric in the broth than saffron. Shrimp was cooked great. Teatro dish was the best and you could taste the home made pasta. 5 on 5 for that. They could reduce the portion size a bit and reduce the price accordingly."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place alone. You could smell the food a block from the restaurant. It smelled lovely. I ordered chicken Alfredo and I got an order of the linguine with clams to go. Everything was fantastic. My waitress was very sweet and attentive !"}
{"text":"What a hidden neighborhood gem and I am so glad we found it!   My husband saw the place when visiting a business across the street. Even though I wasn't hungry I decided to join him for a glass of wine. Next time I will have an appetite!  We walked in, the ambiance is great. Nice and clean with low lighting and incredible smells of fresh Italian food.   My husband ordered pasta with meatball & sausage. Before his entree he got a caesar salad and fresh garlic cheese bread. The salad was nicely dressed and had big pieces of fresh pamesan cheese. The garlic cheese bread, soft, warm and cheesy.   Great presentation of the entree with FRESHLY made pasta.. Tender noodles topped with a flavorful tomato sauce with meatballs and sausage. Yes, it was my husbands dinner, but I did take a few bites and glad I did. I can't wait to go back and try something for myself. All the dishes coming out of the kitchen looked delicious..  Looking foward to trying the clams!   The service was fantastic! Both the owners who are brothers were both on hand. Very welcoming and friendly. Great place to go and to take company when they are in town for a great meal without having to get near the Strip!"}
{"text":"So delicious and adorable. They had fun art, good music, and a very clean atmosphere. Service was great. The girl waiting on us was so sweet; The pasta was amazing and the vegan options!!! We tried a kids pasta with meatball, vegan artichoke, and the diablo Trent. The kale was so good and my daughter kept asking for spinach pasta. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place three times within a month. It's heaven on earth. The owner used to be a personal chef for the owner of the Wynn and he comes out and greets every guest. That kind of customer service is something I can truly appreciate. Plus the food is excellent, something to write home about forsure. Honestly, I dream about it. I get the ravioli Bianca every time. It's freshly made ravioli with brown sugar butter sauce and grilled tomatoes and pistachios. They bring fresh garlic bread to the table and Caesar salad with every meal. My husband has tried a few different things but he's obsessed with the saffron shrimp sauté. It's black squid pasta with tiger shrimp and saffron sauce. Everyone is really nice there. My bank account doesn't like it there but too bad. Oh and desert, don't pass it up. Live like a fatty here, trust me. Ps- check in on yelp and get a free bag of pasta. I always forget to redeem my offer."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place every time on my way to nearby Coronado High School many years ago but never tried this place...until now.  We went here for my dad's birthday (and New Years Day) because we wanted to try something new, and boy we made a great decision. There is very limited seating so be sure to get your reservation in as soon as you can. When we went inside there was live entertainment going on, which lasted half our visit. The 16\" pizza I had was excellent, plus I had the half Cesar salad. Will recommend to everyone. Best Italian food around!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been loooking for a really good pasta place and so far everywhere we went dissapointed us even when the ones that got 4 to almost 5 stars. So when I saw pasta shop on yelp, we dared to give it a chance and crossed our finger that it wouldn't disappoint us. When we got there, we were greeted by a lovely older lady. Her face showed warmth and when she spoke to us, she made us felt welcomed. I showed her my check in on yelp and I got a free bag of homemade pasta. A younger lady was our waitress. She was friendly also. And the food, OH MY GOODNESS! It was so delicious. All entrees come with garlic bread and Caesar salad. My husband doesn't usually eat salad but after he took a first bite he said it was delicious. I ordered the baked rigatoni with chopped meatballs. Loved it! My husband had the chicken Alfredo and it was creamy and tasty. Both pastas were al dente, just how we like it. My son had half of the cheese pizza which was 4 BIG slices and he ate 3 of them. That showed how delicious they were. To finish our dinner we had the cookies and cream gelato and tiramisu and they were all HEAVEN! Finally a pasta place that satisfy our taste buds!!! I can't wait to go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"My wife just took me for my birthday lunch to the Pasta Shop.  It was delicious. Pasta is made fresh. My wife had the Ravioli Bianca. She never orders a dish like this. She loved it. I ordered the linguini and clams. All gone. I joked with Britni that she must see a lot of empty plates.  Most places people always take home leftovers.  My wife had one ravioli left but it didn't make it far.  Definitely come check out the Pasta Shop.  You won't be disappointed. Oh did I mention the service is phenomenal. Both Britni and Gaby made my birthday lunch special.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and right here in Henderson My new favorite restaurant!   Pastas are amazing!"}
{"text":"What a lovely little spot. I asked several people about this restaurant, and few actually were familiar with it. That surprised me because there were so many social media prompts at the site itself. So here goes a full review, with a suggestion: Ambience: Soooo very cute! The tables and walls are art. Not kiddie art, either. There is a level of sophistication here that should be acknowledged. Additionally, there is local art for sale--what a GREAT opportunity. Eating pasta, drinking wine, and shopping. Mmmmmmm  Now for the service: The servers seem to know the food as well as anyone in the kitchen. The ingredients we're relayed and the nuance of preparation was clearly explained.  The Food: My husband had the pasta with sweet sausage in a beautiful marinara. The pasta was perfectly cooked and so obviously fresh. There is nothing better in the world, culinary related, than fresh pasta-- unless it is that that pasta is combined with engaging sauce and unctuous meat. This dish fulfilled that need. I had the EVOO salad with rice & cashews. Nice; nothing spectacular.   Recommendation: I wish there were a \"Healthy/Hearty\" menu. Kind of like Skinny Fats does. I think this place would be packed and everyone would know of its' existence.  The prices were great  and the overall experience was enjoyable. I will be back."}
{"text":"They don't need another person telling them the pasta is WONDERFUL...but I agree with other reviewers....the salad needs a hint of anchovie...it is very bland.  Their parmesan in very good.  They are open on Sundays...another plus"}
{"text":"The restaurant is so cool as a small locals place.  Love the casual dining and the art on the wall.  The food was ok at best, however, it is NYE with a prefix menu.  Order the artichoke- yum!, the salad with dressing in side ( wasn't on side) and salmon medium rare (served fully cooked).  Hoping that the busy night was the reason for the misses.  Definitely want to try again."}
{"text":"Great Italian right around the corner. I had the Italian sausage and my wife, the baked rigatoni.  We ended with a tiramisu.  It was slightly cramped but otherwise clean and updated.  Service was relaxed and friendly and not hurried.  We're coming back."}
{"text":"First night at the new location and the food was amazing.  I had the italian sausage and linguine.  The pasta was not over cooked and the service was excellent.    The owner introduced himself to us early in the evening and never forgot our names the entire evening.  After ordering, our salads came out and our meals did not tough the table until we were done with the salads.  Excellent timing in firing the food to table.  The ambiance was that of a small bistro, very comfy.  I wasn't very impressed with the art hanging from the ceiling that was for sell but if that being the only complaint no reason not to come and enjoy this little jewl of  Vegas."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the mussels but they were out because the supplier provided too low quality product.  She instead had the clams which were superb. Gotta love a place with standards!!  Lunch Was fantastic."}
{"text":"Pasta shop is my favorite! It's very quaint & cozy! Reservation is a must! Love the owners. They always remember your name. The menu is awesome & the portions are perfect size. The art on the walls is way cool. It's a great place for a dinner date."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh pasta. Nothing comes close.   The shrimp scampi appetizer was so good that we ordered a second. Everything we had was amazing. The cheesy garlic bread was served warm and was delicious. Lobster ravioli, squid ink pasta and the Frank's favorite pasta were all perfect and over exceeded expectations.   Now I am waiting for my flourless chocolate cake.... I doubt I will be disappointed"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? We had the squid ink saffron noodles and portofino with some Sauvignon blanc.  Here are notes:  - all their long pastas are made in house.  They are great.   - food is very good.  You can tell you're eating fresh pasta.  - I love the atmosphere. Cute corner of a strip mall.  The inside is sort of a mini art gallery.  - wine list is small but workable.   - meals come with garlic bread and salad.  - kid friendly!   Price point is good for a first date but it's also a nice enough place if you want to stay off the strip but hope to close the deal with a nightcap back at her place."}
{"text":"The roasted vegetables are by far the best in the city. The Brussels sprouts are to die for and they have an awesome vegan menu with the most awesome pasta ever! You won't be disappointed, this place is legit!"}
{"text":"We received a certificate to this place as a gift. Had no idea it existed and we will be going back!!! The house made pasta is the way to go. Amazing spot!"}
{"text":"It is very difficult to find a good pasta place in Henderson.  After looking at the reviews for this place on Yelp I decided to try it.  I ordered the tomato basil polenta as an appetizer and Linguine Fra- Diablo with chicken as my entree.  I picked up the order and was very anxious to try this fresh pasta.  The food was good but not memorable and the sauce had so much salt.  The tomato sauce for the polenta and the pasta was way over salted.  I ended up throwing half of the dishes away because it was inedible.  Great disappointment and over priced.  Would never return to this place."}
{"text":"We have eaten here previously and had an excellent experience. So this time we returned to celebrate a special occasion and it started out terrific with a wonderful presentation of an Artichoke appetizer that was very tasty plus steamed mussels in a nice light red sauce. We chose two suggested specials and things went downhill from there. The so-called tiger shrimp with grilled pasta, broccoli and mushrooms was a disaster. The pasta was almost too hard to eat, the shrimp were just that - 6 very small overcooked tasteless and far from the size of a Tiger shrimp. The broccoli were just very tiny florets and the mushrooms yet even smaller, they were coated in what was a very salty Asian style sauce that did not pair up well with the dish.   The other special was a Salmon with pasta in a creamy pesto sauce. This was a typical presentation, tasty, but far from special. What was special is that we forgot to ask the price before ordering and was shocked to be charged $35 for each of the specials. With the average entree in the $17-20 range this was a bit much, particularly when the specials were less than, well, special. The other dish ordered was linguine with clams which was described as mostly tasteless.  The complimentary salad was very dry chopped romaine that was mediocre.  Desert was not remarkable but was satisfactory.   The bill for 3 was $135 which was a bit pricey for the sub-par forgettable fare. The service, however, was excellent and friendly. We will probably not be returning. Go for the appetizers and skip the over-priced specials."}
{"text":"Bring your Good teeth. The food is to die for, so is the ambience. Friendly service, very helpful."}
{"text":"I went here after reading a write-up in the Las Vegas Weekly.  My wife and I live in the area and are always looking for great little local places like this.  Their pasta is made fresh in house and it is delicious.  I had a seafood pasta dish that was packed with seafood at a great price.  My wife had the lasagna which was also very good.  We were there early so there were only a couple other people in the restaurant and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"First timers and we loved it!  Our 5 and 3 year old split a half order of a cheese pizza (4 slices) and it was the perfect size! And that disappeared like Houdini!   My 14 year old niece had the Chicken Alfredo and I took a few bites and I sincerely enjoyed it.  I had the Linguini and Clams in the Rose sauce! Yummmm!! I cleaned my plate.  My husband had the special - grilled salmon on a bed of the double wide pasta with mushrooms and capers. I took a taste of that and loved it too!   The freshness of the pasta was on point and would definitely come back to try something else next time!"}
{"text":"Small cute neighborhood Italian pasta spot with some great art - I definitely like the atmosphere better than Buon Gusto.   It's a little more brighter but with small, intimate setting.  I could see this definitely being a good dinner spot if i lived on this side of town.    We came here for lunch and had the Shrimp Fra Diablo which came with 4 large shrimp and linguine which wasn't quite al dente as I liked but I enjoyed the fresh pasta and it had a nice chew.   The sauce had a nice kick and it paired well with the garlic bread they gave which they gave seconds.  I would come back for their fresh pastas but if i had to choose one neighborhood Italian spot on the Henderson side i d recommend Montesano's.  P.S - they offer a very generous 1st time check in for a free LB of pasta.  this bumped it up from 3.5 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Such a great experience at Pasta Shop Ristorante. The waitresses were all super friendly and patient even though the small restaurant was packed on Mother's Day. There's art and jewelry on the walls for sale and the whole place is bright and welcoming. They had a special Mother's Day menu but we opted for the Teatro, Ravioli Bianca, and Lasagna. Caesar salads and cheese bread are included, which is everything I ever want with my pasta dishes!  We asked which of the pastas were fresh and they said the pappardelle, linguine, and lasagna sheets. The Teatro was unbelievable. The sauce was creamy but light and the pasta was thick and fresh. The browned butter and pistachios of the ravioli were also a highlight. I definitely recommend this place for an intimate lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome.  As usual.  I have been going here since the Tropicana day's. The artichoke appetizer was delicous.  My salmon with lobster ravioli was amazing. My wife had the chicken parm and she was very happy. Our friend had the eggplant parm and she was bowled over. The wine was awesome and resonably priced. I had the homade tirimasu and my wife had the pine apple upside down cake win dulce dulce ice cream. Chef David has started a dynasty here. We will keep coming as long as they keep putting it out."}
{"text":"Read a review in Las Vegas Weekly so we tried it.  And loved it.  The ravoli is very good.  The Tirimus (sp?) was excellent.  By far the best i've had outside of Little italy (NYC)....  The owner Glen came up to our table to see if we enjoyed our meal, that means alot that he actually cares!  I recomend to anyone....  Will bring my mom and dad in when they visit in July....."}
{"text":"The owners say they are doing very well since moving to their new location on Horizon Ridge Parkway in Henderson. On a recent Saturday night they were slammed with diners and all seemed to be truly enjoying themselves. At our table the food was hit and miss, the restaurant ran out of the dinner special, and the substitution (their recommendation) turned out to be more 'Asian-fusion' than Italian, and was just okay. It's a quaint and friendly atmosphere, and they appear to be trying very hard to please.. so we'll give them another try and see what happens."}
{"text":"I love great Italian hole in the wall restaurants!! They always make the most authentic cuisine!! The Pasta Shop is awesome!! What this place lacks in size the food makes up for it big time!! All the apps are amazing...the tiger shrimp app is my fav.!! All the pastas are great...the linguine and clams is too die for but if you need to try one dish it is the \"Portofino\"( fresh shellfish over linguine tossed in a spicy diablo sauce!!) goes great with a bottle of Antinori Sangiovese!!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars, only Il Mulino get 5 stars, however this place is wonderful and a lot more affordable.    I enjoyed a squid ink home made pasta in a saffron cream sauce with 5 perfectly grilled shrimp.  The entree's come with a great Caeser Salad. Well selected wines by the glass and a killer Pineapple Upside down cake!! Service was  excellent.  Was very impressed with Bianca and Theresa.  Wonderful restaurant with wonderful employees.  Great restaurant to bring a date to. However I am married and didn't bring a date."}
{"text":"Good Italian joint right in the neighborhood.  I understand they make the pasta for Spago, so come here and eat the same thing only cheaper."}
{"text":"Small artsy authentic Italian restaurant.   Had a girls night out and we all enjoyed our dishes. I had the Scallops Fra Diablo and it was amazingly delicious! The scallops were big and tender. The rose sauce was very flavorful and had a hint of heat.   I visited this restaurant before and also tried Portofino, Linguine with Clams and Spinach Linguine with Olive Oil and Garlic. They were all really good. I guess you can't go wrong with anything you order here.   Their homemade tiramisu is a must try too. Very light and the sweetness is just right.   Will be back for sure!  P.S. Yelpers get a free pound of homemade fresh pasta when you check in!"}
{"text":"Fresh made pasta in a cozy neighborhood strip mall. I wasn't expecting the quality of the food to be so good. It's a bistro atmosphere with friendly service. They have good lunch specials and the place is busy. Dinner, especially on a week night, was more quiet."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Italian eatery with an eclectic and artsy atmosphere and freshly made, gourmet dishes. I had the Franks Fantastic Pasta Sauce which truly lived up to its name. A very hearty meat dish over delicious and perfect noodles.  Prices are perfect, especially considering the fresh food and abundant portions.  Well done, Pasta Shop, well done!"}
{"text":"I'd been told that the chef was the chef for Frank Sinatra and Steve Wynn.... so for my birthday, I asked the gals in the office if we could go there!  OMG the food is beyond fabulous!  Fresh pasta!  The atmosphere is fantastic and I'm addicted to the Baked Rigatoni.  YOU HAVE TO GO TO THIS GEM IN THE VEGAS VALLEY!  IT'S TOTALLY THE BEST PASTA SHOP IN THE VALLEY!!  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AND IT'S WORTH THE PRICE!!"}
{"text":"Lots of good reviews for this place, so we decided to give it a try. Not as impressed as the rest of you. The decor was an assortment of wall clocks cut out of sheet metal and painted. They are for sale, $300 for a crudely done piece of a silhouette of four drink glasses. But we didn't go there to look at the amateurish artwork, we went for the food.  My wife ordered the eggplant Parmesan, and I had the saffron shrimp sauté, grilled shrimp in a saffron cream sauce with squid ink pasta. The service was good, no complaints there.     To start, the water had an odd odor, kind of like old food from a freezer. The food arrived quickly. The eggplant was just two thick slices of eggplant covered in marinara sauce and cheese. The eggplant still had the skin on, not that it mattered because it was mush. So it was like eating sauce and (a lot) of cheese with a flavorless mush. The shrimp on my pasta was overcooked and dry. The pasta was good, but let's face it, it's pasta. Not worth the $24 price.   Will not return. And they are moving to a new location on Horizon Ridge, FYI"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and friendly service!! I had their squid ink pasta with shrimp and safron cream sauce...yummy!!! I love the decor (fun art work displayed and available for purchase). They have a good choice of wines, too. Great place!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Pasta Shop restaurant has a electic atmosphere and the wall art is like visiting a gallery. The art demonstrates support for the local artist. Service at lunch was was friendly and helpful. A complementary order of delicious cheese bread was enjoyed while waiting for our entrees. The size of the orders are generous at lunch. The Linguine with Meatballs in a Marinara sauce was very good. Nice rich tomato flavor. The shrimp Fra Diablo comes with four perfectly grilled shrimp with Linguine in a light red sauce, not spicy.   The Pasta's are homemade and perfectly cooked al dente. Both meals provided an ample amount for a second meal. Remember to check in to receive a free bag of pasta.  Only wish they were located closer to home to enable more frequent visits."}
{"text":"Best Italian ever in Vegas! So good! Macaroni and cheese with LOBSTER!!!! Are you kidding me?!?  Go right now! And tomorrow too!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best vegan food in Las Vegas.  The service is okay. Both times I have gone they were very nice just a little slow  The food does take a little while to come out  The interior design is not appealing to me; however, I am sure some do like it.   The live music was fantastic   I don't care how long the food takes, I will be back many times over."}
{"text":"Had a great meal. The food and service were excellent. The prices were good. We were not rushed at all."}
{"text":"Beautiful & quaint restaurant with bright artwork that stands out. Knowledgeable staff that was able to suggest the perfect dish for what I was craving. Now I just need to find room for dessert  can't wait to come back. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Every bite is a delight and savorable. Great for a special occaission as well as a relaxed evening out. You can't go wrong here. Perfektno!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come try the Pasta Shop after reading lots of great reviews about how amazing the fresh pasta was. I ordered the Ravioli Pomodoro, and it was just pasta stuffed with bland, watery, cheese and covered with a really bland and thin marinara sauce.  I also tried the lasagna,the baked rigatoni, the sausage and the meatballs. They were all passable, but so bland and boring. I would rather eat the pre made stuff they churn out at Olive Garden, and spend half as much money.  The service was great and it's a nice little restaurant, but I think it's a place for senior citizens whose taste buds are dead but who enjoy going out and spending a good chunk of money on a nice meal. I probably just caught them on an off night."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little neighborhood restaurant in Henderson, which can be hard to find in Las Vegas. I went with my friend who is vegan (I am not) as she heard they had a special vegan menu. So the restaurant offers options for those who are looking for special menus, as well as delicious offerings for those seeking regular Italian dishes as well. It is locally owned and the owner came to our table to explain the specials as well as the vegan menu and even sent out some vegan salads for us to try on the house. Their bread is delicious and for my friend they brushed it with olive oil instead of butter - it was great! I was eating light that night so only got a salad with grilled chicken but it was very good. They have a cute little patio out front which I would love to try next time as we sat inside this time. Will definitely be coming back. This place is like a breath of fresh air in Henderson and Las Vegas in general!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I really enjoyed the art. The service was great. No wait when we got there."}
{"text":"Good food, prices, and ambience. Nice view. Small place. Make reservations. No kids menu, but they'll make something special."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this fresh, healthy food after doing yoga class a few doors down. They do fresly made pasta in all kinds of ways. The house red wine was amazing. And the art is gorgeous and spiritually uplifting. I admire the daughter who are running it to keep their Fathers legacy alive. Try it!"}
{"text":"2 stars for flavor.   Minus 3 stars for pricing, misleading menu and customer service. We ordered through UberEats the other night. Delivery was on time. When we opened the bag we were sorely disappointed in the portions of the food and what we thought was \"missing\" pasta when in fact we called the restaurant we were told \"oh, no you ordered the shrimp scampi appetizer for $16.95.\" Whoa! More like shrimp \"skimpy\" my husband stated. 4 shrimp in sauce is hardly an appetizer. We've dined at other Italian places and this dish is always served with a pasta - whether spaghetti, linguine or fettuccine. So strange. Moving on, their side dish of Brussels sprouts for $8.95 is another joke because the veggies were soggy and overcooked, there were probably only 3 whole Brussels sprouts sliced up in sauce with cashews. The Caesar salad was decent portion but the romaine lettuce was so white you didn't think it was a salad. There was a small slice of garlic cheese bread to accompany the salad. Overall, for two people and $45 later, you'd think we'd be content or full...we ended up raiding our own pantry to supplement our hunger from the small portions and high price. I would no longer recommend this restaurant to clients, friends and family."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! This was my 5th time at PSR and already planning my next visit. I decided to try one of my favorites, rigatoni primavera, but with the gluten-free brown rice pasta substitute. I knew it would be good, but holy cannoli it was AMAZING!  I've recently became vegan for health reasons. Lucky for me PSR has plenty of veggie, vegan, and gluten-free options that are to die for. Honestly, the gluten-free pasta is just as good, if not better than the normal pasta. Next time I will try the whole wheat pasta!  Overall great spot for traditional pastas and healthy pastas.  Oh ya the art is the cherry on top! bring the family or your beautiful date!  ITS A MUST"}
{"text":"This place has quality authentic italian food. Loved the salad and bread and, of course, the pasta quality was top-notch. The service was excellent, very friendly, and personable."}
{"text":"This is probably my second favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas/Henderson.  I believe the Owner/Chef used to be a personal Chef of Steve Wynn.    The interior decor of the restaurant kind of reminds me of Firefly tapas bar.  It kind of has a spanish/rustic feel to it (even though it's an Italian restaurant) but it's fine.  The owner's wife is a welder (or used to be), so she did all the crafty interior decor of this place.    Very small space.    The pastas are quality and fresh.  I've had the shrimp scampi and the linguine with rose clam sauce.  All taste amazing.  The dishes are a bit pricey, but the quality of food is excellent."}
{"text":"Service is wonderful.  My husband and I are vegetarian, and our server (the owner) gave us several different options and made changes to accommodate our needs."}
{"text":"Love eating here, very small restaurant, with some interesting (but expensive if you want to buy) artwork on the walls.  Best Italian food I've found in henderson, all these reviews saying food is average are absurd. I really don't know what other restaurants you're eating at, please inform us because Olive Garden or macaroni grill don't hold a candle to here. I love the food and this is one of the few places to get fresh pasta.  Glenn and David are very nice, staff isn't the best I've had at a restaurant but normal for such a small place.  Definitely pricey for Italian, looking $20+ per person, but I love coming for a great dinner every few months."}
{"text":"This place is ok, but overall overrated and overpriced. The best part is the fresh pasta which really is the highlight of any dish. My biggest complaint is the lack of flavor. I had the fradiavolo with shrimp and I was disappointed by the sauce. I couldn't taste the sharpness of ripe tomatoes and the dish had no spice. Also, beware as the dishes are overpriced. The difference for my dish with shrimp vs. without shrimp was 24.95 and 17.95 respectively. I got 5 perfectly grilled shrimp. It is up to you how bad you want the shrimp. My husband had the chicken Alfredo, it wasn't flavorful enough either. It lacked either seasoning or more parm. For dessert, I tried the chocolate cake. It is a frozen cake and was good, although I prefer a warm cake. My husband had Oreo gelato bites, he loved them!! Call ahead and make a reservation as the space is small."}
{"text":"The place has a nice vibe, the food well not so good!  Portions are very small.  Prices are high.  I mean come on its pasta, put a little in the plate!  If you want a great authentic Italian meal, Montisanos in Eastern.  Not fancy, but also not expensive.  Great service and most importantly, great food and pizza.  You wont leave hungry."}
{"text":"A few months ago we tried the Pasta Shop Ristorante for the first time and we liked it. Yes a bit pricey for what it is, but still a quality meal. Going back to the first visit my wife ordered the Calamari with pasta and for her it was one of the best dishes she has ever had and she isn't a real seafood lover, $32 but worth it. Today she had the pasta and scallops, but when I tired one of her scallops it was a bit too salty for my taste, but my wife didn't mind. Then I know it boring, but I like plain ole spaghetti and meatballs and it isn't on the menu. Today I did have the linguini and meatballs and it was good. I did have some odd shaped fork that was kind of round and short for some reason and it made pasta eating a chore. Overall a good place and good service, BUT the service isn't perfect. Waitresses are effective but not perfect. I wasn't offered any parmesean cheese at all, but I didn't really care one way or the other, but it should be offered. After the meal the tired looking dessert tray was presented, but no item per item description of what was being offered, just \"would you like some dessert?\" Overall it's quality food and wonderful homemade pasta. We'll be back to try the Calamari entree for my wife if it's available on the specials and I'll have whatever is close to spaghetti. Oh yes, we've never seen the owner or chef come out to the table. Also they do serve Peroni Italian beer, even though the window signs blaze Corona and Miller Lite."}
{"text":"My bf had the Mediterranean sausage it was ok but certainly not worth $16. I had the Chicken Marsala.  Was not good. Little strips of chicken with a sweet watery sauce. Did not taste like Marsala wine. $19. Will return to Bueno Gusto."}
{"text":"So...we read quite a few very good reviews on this restaurant.  It being my birthday, we thought we'd give it a try.  Sorry, very unimpressed with this. Maybe an off day for the chef? I know they are in the process of moving into a new location... So, first off, our water had a very strange odor.  Smelled like stale freezer.  Food arrived fairly quickly.  Service was decent. I had the eggplant parmesan, was sooo gooey.  There was about an inch of cheese covering the eggplant, I wasn't sure it was really in there. Hubby had the saffron shrimp saute with squid ink pasta.  The shrimp was really dry and the pasta lacked a bit of flavor.   Pretty pricey, will not be returning."}
{"text":"The worlds best chicken Alfredo. Family owned pasta shop where everything is made from scratch. Art on the wall is awesome, everything about this place is a must go. Hidden gem of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at how delicious our dinners were with generous portions. It was a little pricy but the food was good. More than you'd spend at the Olive Garden. The stage was really friendly so we left our waitress a $20 bill. We got their at closing time and they were happy to have us. For five adults it was $128. We'll be back. You get what you pay for. I forgot my free bag of pasta on Yelp. Well next time. Wife said wine was cheap and not four ounces."}
{"text":"Loved this quaint cafe/restaurant! Absolutely delicious food. Pasta is made in house and their special with sausage, jumbo shrimp, marinated asparagus/mushroom, and ravioli was out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Am-maze-zing!! Best pasta in the Las Vegas / Henderson Valley! Food is fresh & hot. Love the Caesar salad that comes with every meal and the hot cheese bread."}
{"text":"The pasta shop is the best homemade pasta in Las Vegas. It's a must try. The ravioli Bianca is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Good af. They had a lobster and salmon special that made me want to cry. It was so light and just melted in your. The service was good. The food was fresh and authentic. Best meal I had out in ages. The artichoke appetizer was simple and good. The bread was good. The service was great. The tirimisu was awesome. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for everyone! The pasta is so fresh and I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the best italian restaurant I ever being to. The service and the food was amazing. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"We came here for one of  our friend's surprise birthday dinner.  They were able to accommodate a group of 17 of us.  I ordered the ravioli bianca, and thought it was boring and plain.  I was hoping it would be something similar to Gaetano's sweet potato gnocchi in brown butter and sage...why did I even hope.  This isn't Gaetano.  However, my fiance got the Saffron Shrimp Saute with black squid pasta, it was delicious.   Service was great, and owner David checked on us to make sure we were doing great.  I think maybe I have to come back and try other items, just that Fiance and I are not pasta type of peeps.  However,  when we do feel like pasta, we will return."}
{"text":"Found this place while driving down Horizon Ridge one night looking for a non-franchise place to eat. I'm a sucker for anything with the word \"pasta\" so of course, I was sold!  Small little place, which can be hard to find or easily missed if not paying attention. It appears to be run by a father and daughter who both attend tables, take orders, clean and apparently, the owner is also a painter! He has beautiful art work all around also available for purchase. I was blown away by some of his art! Super talented!  I ordered the Sausage Linguini and LOVED IT! The complimentary bread is also very fresh, home made and delish. Service was fast, however, a tad pricy. The picnic tables outside are awesome for a late night dinner. Definitely intend on visiting this place again.  P.S. Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for a $10 for $20 deal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Such a great experience for Father's Day celebration. They have a great vegan menu and bread."}
{"text":"The food is very good and generous portions. The servers are very nice. Definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Pasta was amazing!! Definitely for our locals town joy family dinner."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL!!! We were on 215 asked Siri the best Italian food around, she recommended Pasta Shop. We hit the JACKPOT!  We've been going back ever since.  We bring all our friends and any company we have.  All are very impressed.  You will love it.  Art work displayed everywhere.  You gotta ck out the bathroom.  Wow!"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a neighborhood restaurant. Everything is made from scratch, and the quality is just phenomenal. Family run, excellent service, definitely worth going there. Love the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, extremely welcoming staff, and awesome food. You can tell that the owner truly loves what he does and takes pride in his business. Even gave us a bag of the homemade noodles to take home :D"}
{"text":"Finally a local Italian restaurant with great cuisine! We had appetizers Brussels sprouts, Bruschetta, tapenade, wonderful garlic bread, Caesar salad ( we ask for a balsamic vinaigrette and it was so light) and shared a Fettuccini with meatballs. Everything tasted like my Italian's grandma's cooking, fresh ingredients, al dente homemade pasta, tomatoes sauce that tasted like the real deal..  Gabby our waitress was so kind, smiley and never interrupted our conversation! Perfect service!!! The pacing of the meal matched our mood too, not too fast, not too slow... will come back again real soon!!! Easy parking, fun artsy decor, go check out the bathroom!"}
{"text":"This continues to be one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  The pasta shop makes all of their pasta fresh onsite and is by far one of the best places you can discover. If you want to bring people from out of town someplace local, this is the place!  The lasagna is my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood Italian restaurant. We went in on a Friday night without a reservation and they seated us as quickly as they could. Although I would recommend making a reservation because it was packed. The food was great, the service was perfect, and the owner was very friendly and even gave us a bag of fresh ground pepper pasta to take home. and it was delicious as well. We will for sure be going back recommending it to our friends."}
{"text":"We tried The Pasta Shop & Ristorante based on their being second on the \"10Best\" of Las Vegas, NV website recommendation, and loved it.  We were staying on the strip, and wanted to get away from the noise and tourists to eat at a locally-owned restaurant.  The owner and staff provided excellent service, which made the already-perfect meal even better....and they serve Coke products, which is nearly impossible to find in Vegas.  One correction to \"10Best\" is that the address for The Pasta Shop is 2525 West Horizon Ridge Parkway, Henderson, NV 89052. The phone and website are correct."}
{"text":"My friends and my family every year for 20 plus years enjoyed the cuisine of this top star restaurant . Food is GREAT FROM 20 years ago till this past Saturday . Thank you for the multiple multiple years of making me eat the best !!!   Love Everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Everything about this quaint spot is AMAZING!! All the pastas are made in house. I had the Mediterranean pasta and my fiance had the lasagna. The sausage made in house was by far the best I have ever had! The sauce in my dish was sweet and robust with kalamata olives with the saltiness to cut thru the flavorful dish. The lasagna was rich in flavor yet light on the palate. You really taste the sun ripened tomatoe sauce perfectly married with thin layers of delicate pasta and cheese.  Speechless.....  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"So happy to find a little Italian joint near my hood! Great spot when I'm craving pasta!! Love love love all of their pappardelle dishes! My boyfriend is a vegetarian and sensitive to garlic, restaurant was very open minded about it (garlic,italian=garlic, lol) and made it all to suit him. I love that!! Other Italian spots in the past have told us then don't eat at an Italian place if you don't like garlic... Rude! So THANK YOU Pasta Shop! =)  With an order of pasta... A salad and bread will arrive... Nice value with great pasta perfectly cooked with very nice taste.   I did order a greek salad and the BF ordered a tomato/mozz salad and both were swimming in dressing which is what leads me to 4 stars... They KILLED it with pasta and it's in their name and the most important part so don't let the salad deter you. NICE PART, I let them know and they asked if I just want a salad with no dressing... I explained I want a salad with dressing but a lot lighter then drenched (I'm talking soggy/limp drenched). They returned with a new one that was better!  The staff were all sweet and made you feel cozy... I really like the vibe there it's comfortable and welcoming!"}
{"text":"If you are craving linguine and clams this is the place. Fresh pasta and a beautiful romantic place with great service."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Great food, great service and lovely comfortable decor. The food here is one of the best Italian food I've had. It's freshly made and it's  so flavorful. The owner and the servers are extremely kind and they go above and beyond to make sure their customers are well taken care of. Overall, I would highly recommend this lovely place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been a fan of chef David for twenty years.  Never disappointed.  A sure winner for lunch or dinner.  The best chicken caesar salad ever.  You owe it to yourself to give the Pasta Shop a try."}
{"text":"The appetizers were really good, not to fond of the ravioli in butter sauce. But husbands dish was very good!"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh, house-made pasta! I love the spinach pasta with shrimp. I've also sampled the fettuccine alfredo and pasta with meat sauce, which were both delicious. I live out of town, but liked it so much I came back the next time I was in Henderson. Make a reservation, because this is quite a popular spot!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to the Pasta Shop and it was great. We had the Greek Pizza, Rigatoni Primavera, Chicken Davida, Papradell Alfredo with chicken, Spumoni, and Cannoli. A little pricey but great food and nice ambiance. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So, I had heard good things about this place and I was always intrigued when I drove by, but it took the recommendation of an old college friend for me to decide to try this place. It was LONG overdue.  The place has decor that reminds me of a coffee house I used to frequent in Mesa,AZ. The art is cool, fun and available. I like places that use locally sourced artists. In this case the artist is a part of the family.    The pineapple upside down cake is incredible. You cannot stop eating. It is addictive."}
{"text":"We ordered the appetizer on special, artichoke. I was extremely excited to try, but unfortunately the server forgot to ring it in. My fettuccini alfredo was more like a soup & the chicken had no flavor. Also, my boyfriend and I were sweating! If it's over 100 degrees outside, you think they would lower the air. It had to be at least 88-90 degrees in there. Which made it difficult to fully enjoy our dinner. We will not be back.--"}
{"text":"Small, family style atmosphere with an upscale menu and artsy things everywhere. Call for reservations.  I tried the eggplant parmesan and of the meager offering for beer, the Stone IPA with a 6.9% alcohol in an IBA of 71. It was pretty good.  Dinners range from $18 to $35 with an average around the $24 range without appetizers and drinks. Dinners include salad and bread.  The Caesar salads that came with our meals were excellent and the appetizer we had, the brussel sprouts, was also very good.  By 7pm on a Saturday evening the place was packed and rather noisy.  I was skeptical. But the food was  marvelous. We would strongly recommended this place for wonderful Italian food."}
{"text":"This is one of Henderson's hidden gems. Annie (the owner) is very attentive, making sure everything is perfect. If you like Italian, you'll love this place. I  started with a side Caesar salad that was so good and yummy garlic bread. My husband ordered the entre Caesar with shrimp and I had the chicken alfredo.  Both dishes were perfection. Very cozy, cute atmosphere. I suggest making reservations! It's that good."}
{"text":"So many Italian restaurants these days are corporate food factories of varying quality, and the prices have gone up dramatically at most dining establishments. So when I eat out I look for quality and consistency, I prefer a small cozy friendly place where I feel really comfortable. The Pasta Shop has a great ambience and a warm and pleasant environment. Great artwork adorns the walls for an added twist on a modern bistro. You walk in and are immediately greeted by one of the owners. Very personable and quite friendly. Makes you feel right at home. The service is quick without rushing you and very pleasant. The food has a home cooked quality with fresh made pastas and fresh ingredients, all cooked to order. The menu is compact but rather unique and tempting. I love the clams and linguini with a rose sauce. The caesar salad and cheezy bread are a great compliment. In all a great dining experience and have been back often with consistently great food and great service. If you are looking for a small cozy quality Italian restaurant with great home style cooking the Pasta Shop will surely satisfy."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to go for pasta.  Homey cosy environment, friendly staff, the owner/head chef is very involved and always there greeting the guests and back in the kitchen cooking.  The pasta is super fresh and made in-house.  The other day I came in and got a bag of it to cook at home later.  It was sooooo awesome.  Everything here is delicious.  My favorites are the Ravioli Bianca (and I do t even LIKE ravioli ), and the linguini with clams with rose sauce... Super light and brothy... Perfect size portions, fresh ingredients, delightful flavor combinations, simple and delicious dishes that never fail to impress.  I love this place"}
{"text":"I started my dinner with the grilled artichoke appetizer. It was simply amazing because it was served with shaved cheese and oil and vinegar which was to die for. For my main course I ordered spinach linguine that also turned out to be great. The thing which I enjoyed the most was when the owner Glen greeted me at the door. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Worst Italian food I ever had!  1.  They did not even any Italian beer..(i.e. Peroni)  2.  Bread was not  even garlic and my wife described it as leftovers...was like oversize croutons all chopped the hell up.  3.  This place claims to make there own pasta and supply the local las vegas 4 star Italian restaurants with it....but why the hell did all they have was linguine & rigatoni style noodles to choose from?    4.  I got the linguine with meatballs and it was horrible.  The noodles tasted like they came out of a top ramen bag, overcooked, and bland taste.   The marinara sauce was runny and appeared to have come out of a can of campbell's tomato soup...no sign of fresh tomatoes or ingrediants.  5.  Wierd music playing...not even any type of typical opera or italian music that puts you in the mood for Italian food.  I don't even consider this a real Italian restaurant....after eating in Little Italy in San Francisco.  Please someone shut this joke of a restaurant down."}
{"text":"Annie owns this place and she's there all the time making certain things are done just right and one of those things is the food.  This small local restaurant is not at all what I expected. I was looking for good Italian food to take out and when I reached the door 30 minutes before the opening time it was the owner who let me in.  Pleasantly surprised, I was seated, offered water if I'd like to wait and when I told her I was interested in a takeout order to bring food to a friend who just broke her foot, she told me it wouldn't be a problem - and it wasn't.  In fact, it was far from it.    She brought me a menu that I swear came from any of a number of Italian restaurants I frequented as a young man living in Brooklyn NY - southern Italian cuisine.  She recommended the Brussell sprouts sauteed and dressed in a delicious vinegarette with cashews - awesome. I couldn't decide on main dishes because the choices were sounded so good, but I settled on the Fra Diavolo (or Diablo - potato, potaato), with both shrimp and scallops.  A second was the Italian sausage pasta.  Home made cannoli and tiramisu topped off the meal along with garlic bread and a parmesan-ladened salad.  Wondering how this would keep with travel to my friends' house, we both were pleasantly surprised that nothing required heating and the tastes were all exquisitely complementary. This reasonably priced diamond in the rough should be on your 'place I need to go for Italian' list.  You won't be disappointed.  Thank you, Annie, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Me and my wife wanted to try a new place so we stumbled into the pasta shop. Fantastic vibe that surrounded us with unique art all created by the owners. We started with the braised artichoke which looked amazing and tasted even better. We then moved on to the linguini and clams and Ravioli Bianca prepared with a delicate ravioli a browned butter, fresh basil and roma tomatoes with roasted nuts. All this while enjoying a perfect glass of Pinot Noir. A definite must try."}
{"text":"The bf and I were lucky enough to be treated to this wonderful gem. Everything was amazing. The spinach pasta was delicious. I had the pasta Ann and I highly recommend it. The shrimp were huge and although the dish is rich, it is not overly so. My boyfriend had the spinach linguini upgraded with scallops, which were huge! I would normally steal a bite from him, but I didn't get any...that's how good it was! The canoli after dinner was perfect. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the family atmosphere. Prefect for family night. Plus they have a new vegan menu!! So yummy. Worth the drive from Summerlin. I'd also highly suggest the flourless chocolate cake. They also sell their fresh pasta, which cooks in 90 seconds. Soooo yummmmy!!!"}
{"text":"went there for the first time yesterday, and i can honestly say it exceeded my expectations! i got the spinach linguini with olive & garlic and i added the chicken. best way to describe it is ORAL HEAVEN!!! and to top it all off, the customer service was superb:) i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Incredible homemade food. There is a very big difference with their hand made pasta and food compared to any pasta I have ever had. I'm vegetarian and eat a lot of pasta this is incredible!!! The owner and his family bring a lot of character and good feelings which make it an experience."}
{"text":"Delicious. Never a bad meal here. Shrimp are large and cooked perfectly.  Salad and bread with all entrees. Pasta is so fresh. You really can't go wrong here. Romantic atmosphere. Great for date night"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to get pasta. The nicest staff EVER! Everyone is so kind on top of having the best food and great options. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fantastic pasta! I love the vibe of this place and the people who run it!   This restaurant reminds me of something I'd find in the Bay Area- down to earth, personable, artsy and GOOD!   Family owned and operated- all pasta is made to order and made in house. You can also buy fresh pasta for home cooking. They supply pasta to numerous restaurants/casinos in Vegas, and I can see why.   All entrees come with a fresh made caesar salad and delicious cheese bread. I love their Spinach Linguine with Oil and Garlic! So awesome! I also like the dessert they change up daily.   If you're looking for good pasta, great ambiance and a personal experience, come here!"}
{"text":"I had my first experience with the Pasta Shop this weekend. The staff was very inviting and attentive. The setting was very unique and had a very personal feel to it. Now on to the food!!!! Great menu options and the specials sounded fabulous. We tried to order a variety without overdoing it. There wasn't a bad item on our table, from the saffron shrimp to the salmon with lobster ravioli, simply delicious.. Will definitely return to try some other items.."}
{"text":"First I will say great location and beautiful space. Our waitress was very nice as well.   Unfortunately our meals were a basic pasta with very minimal flavor nothing amazing. We got salmon Alfredo which had a 6oz or so of salmon and a basil pasta with no meat. Cost was normal for an upscale italian about $60 for the 2 pasta dinners and a single glass of wine. Which btw wasnt poured table side which I think is tacky and a sad thing in such a nice restaurant. BUT as it grew busy and we were just finishing the male waiter asked with menus in hand while 2 guest eyeballed us anxiously for people he wanted to seat if we were done. Everyone....EVERYONE usually gets shown a lovely dessert platter and asked if they like dessert and coffee after. Not us just are you finished? We had planned on dessert and coffee and wanted our left overs that he quickly ushered away to pack up. But no a bill dropped in front of us. Obviously they are much more concerned with turn over than quality and service and MOST important customer satisfaction. Next time we will just trek down to strip to a hotel and go to a Italian restaurant there."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and had hoped this place would be as delicious as the other reviewers, but in it sure if we were there on an off night. All 5 people in our party were disappointed by our food. It was quite flavorless and one dish was quite salty. The service was good, but for all the rave reviews we read on Yelp, sadly, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I don't know. For the price I expected better.  I mean Nora's wine bar is way nicer, food is way better and it's cheaper.  just not that amazing. well, maybe the chef's tongue was off that night but, I don't feel like spending another $50 on dinner to find out."}
{"text":"I know you don't know me, but trust me, you need to try this place. Great Italian food!! Caesar salad and delicious focaccia bread with any entree."}
{"text":"The dinner selections we had, Veal Parmesan and Chicken Marsala, were excellent.  The Caesar salad was light and also excellent.  Bread strips were awesome.  Very nice desert tray featuring made on premise Tarimisu.  Only complaint was amateur wait staff.  Asked for 2 waters, did not get them.  Asked for salt and pepper, did not get them.  She forgot to inform us of the daily specials.    Very cordial, but not well trained.  Cozy and art filled room.  More professional wait staff would definitely put in contention for a 5 star."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food was incredible. A little expensive but worth it if you have the extra dollars to spend."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh pasta,the best in town! Friendly service. I recommend this family owned restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"I stop in whenever I am in the neighborhood. Such a fresh and yummy selection. Unique decor and personable staff. I have only had lunch here but have trued many items and it has all been great."}
{"text":"JUST ate here. So happy with their vegan, and Gluten-free options. All their pasta can he made Gluten AND Dairy-free AND they have a whole section on vegan items!! Will defo come back here!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my two friends.  Collectively, we tried the following:  Artichoke with Parmesan and balsamic vinegar Shrimp scampi Ravioli with white sauce Rigatoni with diced meatballs in a spicy red sauce Squid Ink Pasta with shrimp in a saffron cream sauce  Both the appetizers (the artichoke and shrimp scampi) were quite good.  Using the scrumptious cheese bread they give you to mop up the scampi sauce is a recommended tactic.    For entrees, I was anticipating the Squid ink pasta the most.  Unfortunately, this dish was a letdown.  The pasta was overcooked, so it lacked that al dente texture that you hope for when you visit to a place like this.  The saffron cream sauce was also lacking in flavor.  The clear winner was the rigatoni in a meat sauce.  Very hearty dish with a flavorful sauce and just enough spice.    I'd give the meal itself 3.5 stars, but with the exceptional service (and the fact that Yelp won't let you give partial stars), this place gets a 4/5."}
{"text":"Too much sauce on the pasta. It was served in a bowl and the sauce was almost at the brim. It looked like a noodle soup. I had the squid ink pasta in saffron cream sauce with shrimp."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful birthday dinner here at this wonderful local artsy & colorful place. The art done by owners are a nice way to perk up this quaint restaurant that had a California coast like feel. The service and food are excellent. I definitely recommend their blanched artichoke appetizer, delicious smooth garlic flavor with a hit of the really good aged balsamic in a beautiful easy to eat presentation topped with flecks of Parmesan cheese. We ordered the linguini and clams and ravioli Blanca. The raviolis had a nice light caprese flavor with fresh basil, tomatoes and a crunch from the cashews ( will have to try adding that to my next homemade pasta recipe). The owner David was very attentive ...maybe a little TOO attentive & wonder if he would be so friendly to a hetero couple...also brought us a birthday cannoli and complementary bag of fresh black pepper pasta. They make fresh pasta for a lot of the restaurants on the strip. We will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Great authentic cuisine, friendly people.  A little off the beaten path, but worth the drive.  I would definately try again!"}
{"text":"This probably one of the best Italian restaurant l have eaten at. The ambiance, food, and service are  impeccable. We will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent meal- baked rigatoni was great as was the special- prompt service and friendly staff...  we will come back again soon..."}
{"text":"I loved this place, great & very fast service. I came for their calamari steak pasta special & it was spectacular! I also tried the teatro pasta, which was a cracked black pepper papardelle with a rose cream sauce, sundried tomatoes & portobellas, also excellent. I was pleased with the portion size & you get complimentary bread + salad with your entree. I highly recommend & will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"OMG fabulous! Just glorious appetizers and pasta dishes. Ate here for the first time last week and loved the very friendly service, the pleasant, creative, but homey atmosphere, and the pasta is the best I have had in Henderson in fourteen years of living here. Just scrumptious and can't wait to go back. Also - the prices are very reasonable for such obviously, lovingly-made, gourmet-style cuisine. A lunch here would definitely not break anyone's bank. I ate here for dinner, but want to try the lunch specials. YUMMMMY! P.S. Not sure what to put down for \"Attire.\" I was a little dressy, my friend wore jeans. Guess anything goes, but for this restaurant I would always dress up a little just because I would want to honor the excellent staff and great food."}
{"text":"Really liked the Shrimp Diablo Pasta! Will definitely go back to try their Lobster Macaroni"}
{"text":"Fantastic first experience =) Great service, attention to detail (cold salad plates, hot dinner dishes), fresh pasta and absolutely delicious food.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing. You can taste that the pasta is home made. The only thing is, I have been there many times and the specials are always the same. Cold artichoke,mussels,salmon with lobster pasta and some pasta shaped like pig tails. As,you can see I can almost repeat it. Wish they would change it up. But thats my only complaint."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful atmosphere, customer service, and food-of course! If you are in the mood for some classics, they have it. If you want something more unique, they have it. They also have really expanded vegan options. I love the new Brussels sprouts app! Delicious! All their pastas are homemade and very good! I would recommend a reservation, they always seem to be full!"}
{"text":"The wife read reviews and decided to try them for lunch. First very nice small place that also sells art. Service was spot on. The pasta was good, the wife loved the shrimp I had the clams and they were small and good, the sauce was just right.  Prices for lunch were reasonable.  This place will be on our regular list."}
{"text":"Today I finally made a trip to this gorgeous shop, and I am jumping for joy!  I was amazed at the location, it's  it not too far from my house and it's actually on my way to church... so double win win! The parking is not a problem and there is plenty of it. I was really impressed with the Decor of the restaurant, and I asked the waitress about the theme and said it's a family owned business and the Mother/wife does all the art work- (support your local artist) One of my favorite things about Pasta is the actual Pasta it's self. The pasta is all homemade and cooked perfectly Al la dente!  Don't forget to check in for your free bag of pasta, I can't wait to try to create a dish at home for my kiddo.  I also like that the restaurant has a Vegan selection, I can take my Best Friend to eat here and not feel guilty I dragged her to a place that only serves salad, they have a really good selection. All the salads and dishes look good and I can't wait to try more dishes."}
{"text":"This was our second dinner at Pasta Shop Ristorante and it was better than the first! Fresh pasta, great service, funky artsy vibe and wonderful Chef Owner David. We highly recommend the Chicken Marsala, Mediterranean Salad with Salmon, and the eggplant parmigiana, but everything we have ordered was delicious!"}
{"text":"I just love this place.  Always scrumptious food and service is perfectly timed and has a comfortable personal touch.  We had the treana and it was so good I am still craving it and we ate there 3 days ago.  You just cannot go wrong in this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"My husband and I were yelping for something good to eat once we arrived into Las Vegas.... Pictures and reviews for Pasta Shop looked amazing, so I thought we would give it a try!  We were greeted by one of the owners and he was pleasant in every way! Went over their special and my husband decided to try the filet mignon with the mushroom sauce. I knew what I wanted to try prior to arriving and ordered the black squid ink pasta cooked in a saffron sauce and served with tiger shrimps!!!! My husbands dish was aahhhhhmazing! I think I ended up on his side of the table eating off his plate! The black squid ink pasta was also pretty darn good!!!   The owner even sent us home with some fresh uncooked pasta to take home and cook ourselves!!! What a wonderful experience! I definitely would love to come back for that filet mignon dish!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about this place yet. Nice little hole in the wall vibe. Definitely unique in style. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp to go. The noodles tasted over cooked.  There was only four shrimp in the entire sea of pasta. The sauce didn't taste homemade it tasted bland. I enjoyed the salad and bread on the side, although, I could have made both of those easily at home. Unique in vibe but not unique in flavor. Also, I didn't get utensils or napkins but that's just me being petty. I plan to try a different dish, because this may have just been a bland option."}
{"text":"How this place has 4 stars instead of 6, blows my mind!  I come to the Pasta shop regularly, not only because of the INCREDIBLE food...but more so because of the atmosphere .  I've never felt so welcomed by any restaurant before.  David and his unbelievable staff of impeccably hand picked servers, make me feel like family.  I will always recommend this gem to anyone looking for a perfect night out.  The food is priced right, the wine list is excellent, the decor and music stay fresh, and they will always find a seat for you...no matter how busy!  Cheers to the PSR crew!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!!  I've heard wonderful things about this place and they did not disappoint.  Great service, great food, and lovely artwork!"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem thanks to Yelp.  I was in the area and decided to try this place out because of the solid reviews on Yelp. Glad I did. I tried the chicken parm, which is my usual order at a new Italian restaurant. Every Italian restaurant has chicken parm on the menu, so it works as a good barometer.  All dinner entrees come with a small basket of cheese bread and Caesar salad. Nice touch. The chicken parm was very good. The chicken portion was ample. They were also very generous with the mozzarella cheese on top. The marinara sauce on the side of pasta pomodoro had good flavor and was spiced well. The pasta was cooked perfectly and was fresh.  At $18, the chicken parm was a bit pricey. Not necessarily expensive, but not a deal either. You are paying a bit for the atmosphere, decor, and service, which I don't mind doing on occasion. This would definitely be a good date spot."}
{"text":"Great little place with awesome food and interesting article.  Totally enjoyable with personalized service.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots in Henderson. They give you free cheesy bread while you wait. I usually order the spaghetti and meatballs.  The pasta is made fresh and is some of the best in town. The meatballs are soft, tender and juicy. I order fresh shaved Parmesan to put on top and I'm good to go. They also top the plate with fresh basil. Yum, now I'm craving it again writing this. Go try it."}
{"text":"Nice busy, small place, very friendly staff.  Food was good, prices were fair.  Limited menu."}
{"text":"What a great little spot out in Henderson! I've passed by this place a million times, and finally gave it a try.... so glad I did!!! We went on a rainy Saturday night... pasta with veggies... DELICIOUS!!!! Salad was great... and cannoli was to die for. There was also an amazing singer and pianist playing some Frank Sinatra and Michael Buble. Very nice touch. The artwork on the wall was beautiful. (I think you can even buy some of the artwork displayed on the walls, which is something I will definitely consider). There's not a whole lot of Italian places that have this much to offer... so if you want something different in the Henderson area, then I HIGHLY recommend this place! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely family owned place with fresh pasta and amazing flavor in the sauce . I haven't  had such a good plate of pasta in ages and the  best part is the great, friendly service. I love all the art work here too!   If you're a vegan they also have a vegan menu! Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for as long as I can remember. It all started back on their Eastern and Tropicana location and we would always go there before the Rebel game!!! Way classic. A solid choice is the cheesy bread to start and the shrimp fradiavlo- rivaled by no one. Chef David and his sweet wife Annie (who makes the art decorating the place) are great people, and this local establishment is a real gem in the Henderson culture. Go here!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned place.  Everyone's dish was excellent.  Highly recommend the meatballs, any linguini dish, and the ravioli Bianca."}
{"text":"Amazing pasta in Las Vegas! I've been numerous times and always leave extremely satisfied with a full tummy! Every time I visit I have ordered the Saffron Shrimp Sauté with Black squid pasta and tiger shrimp in a saffron cream sauce. It is so delicious, I look forward to it every time. All the pasta is handmade and to die for! The atmosphere is cozy and eclectic with artwork (which is available for sale) throughout the restaurant. Very warm and friendly service. This restaurant apparently supplies their handmade pasta to some of the famous restaurants on the strip!"}
{"text":"The food and the service was top notch! Gaby was our server and she was very attentive. I ordered the chicken Marsala plate and it was probably one of the best Marsala's I have ever had. Thank you pasta shop! I will be returning!! :)"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place ever since it was on E. Tropicana. Always wanted to try but never did since the E. Tropicana location was not where I usually hang out.   When it opened a location on Horizon Ridge, I knew I must try it since I am running out of excuse to not!   I came here with my brother on a Thursday night. From the outside, you wouldn't know this place was packed. Once we were inside, you get this artsy, I-know-the-food-must-be-good-here kind of feeling. We were seated right away even though there were only three people running the place.   The guy who sat us was very nice and seemed happy to be doing what he was doing. We placed our drink orders not long after. The menu was not crazy extensive (like Cheesecake Factory), which I personally prefer.   I ordered the clams and linguine in a rose sauce, and the brother ordered the chicken alfredo. I really like my linguine more than another local Italian restaurant that is just around the corner on Eastern, but the sauce was a little bit too salty. The chef must have forgotten that the clams have salt from the ocean. Anyways, pasta-wise, it was good.   I had a bite of the chicken alfredo, and I loved it! The sauce was lighter than any alfredos I have ever tasted. The pasta was absolutely fresh fresh fresh! I was kind of disappointed that I didn't order the chicken alfredo. My brother finished the whole plate.   They also served us a caesar salad and warm cheesy bread. The salad - I can do without, but the bread was absolutely delicious! I would have gotten more if I hadn't ordered a pasta.   Definitely give this place a try if you are looking for a plate of fresh homemade pasta. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The place is adorable - it has an eclectic feel - owners wife's art on the walls and is for sale - the service is fabulous and the fresh food comes out fast and steaming hot! The fresh pasta noodles are just divine! The red sauce is fabulous taste like my Italian friend makes in Italy! Overall super tasty and great portions - not too much and not too little! I loved the linguine and meatballs!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious daily specials! The grilled salmon on lobster ravioli is our favorite. They have a cute eclectic seating area with unique art on the walls. Great place for a romantic or family meal."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because a close friend of mine does, but I'm just not that big a fan. I like that everything is homemade and the food is very delicious and atmosphere nice.  However, I've eaten here 3-4 times and I think the service is borderline rude at times and other times indifferent.  Not what I would expect from a family owned business and I absolutely love going away from chains and supporting local.  Especially for Italian.  So I'm disappointed to write this review.  I've taken two different groups here and was slightly embarrassed at my choice at the end of both meals."}
{"text":"I usually eat at the Pasta Shoppe monthly.  Just made reservations for Friday Night for the 5th time in the last 6 weeks. Everyone I take there falls in love w the food and atmosphere. David and his great staff make for a wonderful dining experience.   paul"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now before writing this review.  It is very odd, because I had always driven by this place and thought that it was quite an \"odd\" location for a restaurant.  However, finally having the time to try it, we enjoyed it and came back again.  The restaurant here serves exactly what their name states. Pasta, fresh made pasta that is simple, tasty and also creative. you can find your basics as well as more of the creative items.  1. Portofino - Well, of course I found and decided on the pasta that had the most resemblance to my favorite Cioppino.  The Portofino is fresh shellfish served over linguine.  Plenty of shellfish and a very al dente linguini accompanied this dish. Rather expensive, but hey we live in the desert, so i understand that getting fresh shellfish can be tough.  2. Teatro - The next time I came here, I tried the Teatro.  Pappardelle pasta in a cream sauce with sun-dried tomatoes and portobello mushrooms. Again, the highlight of this dish is the pasta and the pappardelle was again just perfect. Loved the nice, wide noodle. I also added a side of meatballs with this dish. I could have added chicken, but hey, meatballs sound great in an Italian restaurant.  3.  Franks Favorite Meat Sauce- Meatballs in a tomato sauce over rigatoni, this is a version of bolognese I would say and my wife ordered this. she normally goes for Lasagna, and she did have this on her first visit. Well presented, good amount of pasta, and a new favorite for us.  4. Vegetarian Pizza - We ordered this for take out on the second visit.  We made this vegan for the daughter. I am so happy that they have vegan options. The first time she had the linguine below.  5.  Spinach Linguine EVOO & Garlic- For our first visit, this is what our daughter ordered as a vegan option.  This is a unique and very excellent aglio 3 olio style pasta and the Spinach linguine was a hit.  6.  Chicken Marsala - Our son ordered this and he loved it. Good amount of chicken and for all of you that like Chicken Marsala, you will be happy ordering this dish.  The mushrooms, the little onions, all poured over the home made linguini.  a bit of sauce and cream and there you have it, a classic dish that is elegant and flavorful.  7.  Lasagna - We ordered this on our first visit and what a classic dish. This is the standby dish that the wife orders at nearly every Italian restaurant to gauge and compare food quality. She gave this a thumbs up.  The service here is top notch.  The ambiance is eclectic.  The art work is on display and for sale. We were able to see the artist / owner sitting at a table talking and eating with friends.    We enjoyed a few glasses or wine, some great food and basked in great service.  Can't ask for more.  GK says, check it out."}
{"text":"I loved the squid ink pasta with the saffron cream sauce! The pasta was so fresh. It is a cute little place and it's awesome when you check in there they give you a pound of fresh pasta. It seemed like a lot of customers were regulars there because the waitresses knew them by name."}
{"text":"First of all, if you decide to go here because of the other good reviews (which is why I came here) DO NOT buy a $10 for $20 deal because they automatically charge you 18% gratuity without informing you. The bill that we received tonight only had our entrees written down, the bottle of wine that we ordered was not written on the bill.... My boyfriend noticed a $16 charge and I'm so thankful he pointed it out because I overlooked it thinking it was just the tax.... The 18% was written very small, and looked like 8%... I would have ended up tipping these people TWICE....  I asked the waitress what the 18% was and she played dumb and said \"oh I think that's gratuity\" ... so when she returned a few minutes later after she ran my credit card I asked again if that was normal since we were only a party of 2.... She finally told me that 18% gratuity is included if you use any deals/coupons which I doubt she should have told me BEFORE she ran my credit card when I asked her..... !!!!!!!!IT DOES NOT SAY THAT ON THE DISCLAIMER FOR THE $10 FOR $20 DEAL!!!!!!!! It states 'gratuity not included, please tip on full amount' ---- shady shady shady shady!!!! You would have received a 20% tip if you didn't automatically and fraudulently charge me a tip already....I HATE SHADY-NESS..... SHAME ON YOU PASTA SHOP!!   I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE BACK! At first I really liked this place because I thought it was a mom and pop shop, I thought it was fun and different, but I can't believe the lack of disclaimer and the \"playing dumb\" that I just experienced. And you can only use either the $10 for $20 deal that you purchased or get the 1 lb. homemade pasta (which WAS part of the disclaimer but I still think that's stupid...)"}
{"text":"For the past several years I have eaten here every time I've visited the area. They have no peer. This is the place for authentic Italian food with creative enhancement. I consider pasta a home dish and only rarely order it \"out\".  However, Dave's pasta selections are must haves. I still dream about the squid ink pasta with grilled shrimp in a saffron laced sauce. No matter what else I have, I have to have an order either to eat there or take home. My family (immediate and extended) cannot leave me alone about \"when are we going back for the pistachio pizza\".  The pistachio is an essential part of any meal you may partake there. We live in New York City a mecca for Italian food and I have yet to find a better place.  As an aside you must look closely at Annie's creative art work adorning every corner of the restaurant all of which is for sale. Don't leave without one of her works all of which are reasonably priced and most are one of a kind."}
{"text":"We visited based on positive yelp reviews. Warm atmosphere, pleasant service, reasonable prices and the food was excellent. I assumed I would eat half of the Mediterranean Sausage and bring the rest home for lunch. Nope. Just continued 'enjoying' as they say till it was gone. Will definitely be back with friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous chicken Parmesan. Fried to perfection-- crispy & not the slightest bit soggy even with the sauce."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this week. Great service, order was taken by one of the owners who was very pleasant. I ordered the Scallops Fra Diablo. Was totally yummy, large scallops cooked perfectly, homemade sauce was delicious.  Cute place with cool art on the walls, will definitely come back here for authentic Italian food. Being from New York I'm super picky....and this place definitely delivered!"}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems that locals know about, but hardly tell anyone! I guess they want to keep the secret to themselves! I've had just about everything on their menu and to say it's good food would be an understatement. My favorite is the Clams Linguine, mostly because they use fresh clams and not the canned stuff like a lot of other Italian restaurants. All of the portions are just the right amount and the food is well balanced. No overpowering flavors what so ever. And one of the best Caesar salads I've had in Vegas yet!  To me, the decor is refreshing. Little art trinkets and pieces throughout the shop that are for sale and give it a unique feel. There isn't much of a view of the strip from the restaurant due to homes in the area, but go to the parking lot just above the restaurant and you have an incredible view of the city."}
{"text":"Several previous enjoyable visits to the The Pasta Shop prompted three of us to make New Year's Eve reservations for an early dinner. The weather was quite cold and at 5 o'clock when the restaurant opened, we were seated directly in the path of the opening and closing door. We requested a change of table twice, but were refused because \"we have a lot of reservations tonight.\" A couple walked in, stated that they had no reservations, yet were promptly seated at one of the many vacant tables in the interior of the restaurant. Dinner was a choice between two fixed price menus. Of the limited choices from the unfestive menu, we opted for a Caprese appetizer, which was served without basil, because \"we are out of basil\" (although are three grocery stores within shouting distance of the Pasta Shop).  Rigatoni with sausage was drowning in tomato sauce, the brownish Caesar salad seemed to be dressed with balsamic vinegar, and the cannoli, the only choice of dessert on the $38 menu, was hard as a brick. The host for the evening, after seating us, never returned to the table and while the server was competent we felt quite unwelcome in general. No excuse for a small capacity restaurant with limited choices of a fixed price menu to produce such unsatisfying fare. This experience was in complete contrast to previous visits when the pasta was tender and tasty and the salads were ice cold and crisp. We left disappointed and most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian gem in Henderson! The pasta is always fresh and the service is always friendly. I am so excited to have a vegan friendly restaurant close to home! Their new vegan menu is delicious, and I can't wait to come back for more! ORDER THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Have been going for years and the food is consistently great.  The menu is varied and the nightly specials have been outstanding.  They have always effortlessly taken the time to discuss food choices to accommodate  my needs as a vegetarian.  It's a welcome place where they know your name and remember you when you come back.  The move to Horizon Ridge is a plus and as ever, the artwork creates a fun setting."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the baked rigatoni with pink sauce and a glass of chardonay for lunch. Hubby loved the lasagne. Polite and quick, I have no complaints about the service.  Enjoyed looking at the quirky artwork as we ate. We'll  be back for more casual yet delicious meals."}
{"text":"Took our friends from out of town and did a family style. Our favorites were chicken Marsala and ravioli Bianca and must have chocolate mousse pie!!"}
{"text":"Went for Dinner on a Thursday with 7 people. I heard that you needed reservations so I did ahead of time. It was not too busy while we were there so I presume we picked a good day.   We had polenta for the appetizer, it was tasty.  Caesar Salad comes with dinner, and garlic bread with cheese. Starters were great.  I had the pasta anne & my husband had the spinach noodles with evoo and chicken. Other plates at our table were lobster ravioli with salmon, eggplant parm, spaghetti & meatballs, chicken parm. Everyones food was wonderful. Fresh, hot and delicious! Flavors were there, fresh pasta always makes the difference. Dessert we had a flourless choc cake and a tiramisu. Service was very good as well our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We never had to ask for a refill of anything. Yelp check in and got a bag of fresh pasta! Definitely would go again, good for a date night also!"}
{"text":"A little hidden gem. Fresh homemade pasta, full of flavor and simply delicious. Welcoming staff, quiet, relaxing environment. Food was amazing. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Prefacing this review by saying I live in NYC... food here was fine. Certainly nothing to write home about. However, the standout quality of the Pasta Shop is their completely absurd prices....not only for their mediocre pastas (one was over $30) but asking $1800 for the awful artwork displayed. Again, I am from arguably the most expensive city in the world and am accustomed to paying high prices. The Pasta Shop takes the cake with their pricing structure. Def will not return."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch! I am a huge pasta fan, and I didnt know this place was just down the street from my work place. I really liked the food that I ordered but I was so hungry that I finished all the ceasar salad and some bread before my food finally came. I ordered from the dinner menu.. Maybe next time i'll try the lunch menu. It was kinda pricey for a lunch meal :) But for sure i'll be back!! Next time i'll redeem my free pasta bag upon checkin! ;)"}
{"text":"First time here and pleasantly surprised by the quality of food.   Ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce which flavors lit up my pallette.   The pasta was delivered at just the right temperature."}
{"text":"Gianna has made my experience here a lovely one! They have a nice ambiance in the restaurant and their wine selection is great! The food was delicious and like I said gianna has made my experience here!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go since I wasn't feeling well to eat out.  I found the food to be just ok.  I ordered Eggplant Parmigiana and Linguini with Meatballs.  Both  lacked in flavor and presentation.  The taste was bland and I wouldn't order to go with them any more.  Good things:   - Phone service was great.  He was attentive and seemed very interested in my phone call. - Food server who helped me with my order was also very friendly and kind. - The only reason why I would go back is because service was awesome.  Maybe the cook just wasn't happy that night."}
{"text":"Oh my!  We spent New Years Eve at The Pasta Shop and were welcomed by David and his gracious staff. The food was out of this world!  The filet mignon was cooked to perfection, the noodles --oh! to die for! My boyfriend's salmon tasted like nothing I've ever tasted before! It was cooked to perfection and his pasta sauce was delicious!! Definitely will be going back much more often his New year.   Love the Pasta Shop and all the gorgeous creative art is such an added bonus as is the warmth David gifts to his customers!    Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"First time. Very good. The Caesar Salad appetizer with the entree was good. A large one with chicken would have been great.   The Garlic Ciabatta bread was excellent. Good texture and just enough cheese.   The Chicken Marsala is like we make it but the thinner sauce tasted good. We would have liked more mushrooms.   The lasagna was very classic. Nice thick layer of cheese and meat sauce. Pasta was tender.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The bread is amazing.  I also highly recommend the baked rigatoni. All of the pasta is fresh.  The service was above and beyond.  Fairly priced.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a nice Italian meal out."}
{"text":"i love the fact that the owner/manager is the host/server. The prices are reasonable and the ambience is perfect for a date. The art on the wall varies from the hipster chic to the mundane and the eclectic.  I highly recommend you eat here. I had the portofino and it was tasty and completely devoured. I know the restaurant just moved. But if the food is as good, and the ambiance as eclectic you'll do fine eating here."}
{"text":"Stopped by based on the Yelp reviews and boy am I glad! My boyfriend and I have been on the hunt for some authentic Italian pasta for far too long and this hit the SPOT! Simply Devine.  We came in around 6 (so they began to get busy within a few moments of us being seated) and the service was still great. I believe the owner himself came out and bused our table and he was very sweet.  I can't remember the name of my dish other than it started with a \"T\" and had rose cream sauce....those left overs will be amazing tonight because my dish was too good to be true rich and creamy yum! My boyfriend got the ravioli and it was bland (not very much sauce or flavors I saw added, some tomato cut up on top) but he enjoyed it and said the inside and quality of fresh pasta was well worth ordering.  We WILL be back often."}
{"text":"This is a really cute place. We came here on a Sunday evening and tried the artichoke and shrimp scampi appetizer and the salmon lobster ravioli. The food was good along with a great service."}
{"text":"This place is small but packed with BIG flavor! I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole vegan menu available! The waitresses were very accommodating (even during a very busy time - Saturday night Dinner) and courteous. I ordered the Diablo Trent which was very fresh and delicious! My boyfriend loved his order of lasagna. This place is super cute! I hope they are able to expand soon. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've been through most of the menu and have yet to be disappointed. My kids' favorite restaurant (yeah, they're spoiled)."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding!  Wine selection  was really good, the mood was nice and dinning room looked great!   Ordered one of the nightly special server did tell us the price, the dish was good just not the $32.00 they charged for the dish! In a whole the server was average at best, slammed plates down and would ask a question and walk away while we were talk back to her!      We would go back because the food was really good!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boss, was told that they sell pasta to the Strip. The decor is lovely, and the owner nice, and the service prompt. The food was only mediocre, though. My husband had the ravioli, and I had black ink shrimp pasta. My dish had a lot of butter, and the pasta not as fragrant as what I had at other restaurants. My dish was $26 just for the entree with a small salad."}
{"text":"When my roomie told me he was taking me to the Pasta Shop, I was hungry for PASTA.  The linguine he had was nothing like any I've ever seen, and I'm Siclian.  You call yourself a pasta shop, and don't have Angel Hair, Mostaccioli, Bow-Tie, and many other kinds of pastas?  The service was good until it was time to get the check.  For 2 people, they gave us one piece of bread, split into 6 of the smallest sections I have ever seen.  $16.95 for a little plate of Fettucine, whose watery sauce had a muenster cheese smell to it!  The caesars salad was good, but how can anyone mess up a salad?  It would have been a nice neighborhood find, but no thank you.  I'll go to Giada's down the street toward Anthem, and get some decent Italian food.  When you want or think of pasta, going to the Pasta Shop will be a disappointment as it is NOT their speciality.  If it is, I shudder to think what other menu selections taste like."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge pasta fan but I've been curious about this place for some time now. It was definitely good and you can tell their pastas are made from scratch. Ingredients were fresh and the dishes comes with a Caesar salad to start. They also give out really tasty cheesy bread. The place is a bit small. The service was great. The waitress was very kind and attentive. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I wasn't a big fan of my dish. It was prepared just fine but I didn't love it. I ordered the ravioli Bianca. But I loved my sisters dish, linguine with clams. It was savory with lots of garlic, which I love! I'd probably go back and explore the menu some more."}
{"text":"The catch with Pasta Shop is the food is created by a chef with Strip experience inside a restaurant that doubles as an art gallery which provides a unique and intimate environment. If you're not a fan of fresh, house made pasta then something is wrong. But that's what you'll find here along with a welcoming and attentive staff.  The restaurants is literally under Lindo Michoacan sitting on the lower level of the same hill on the southwest corner of Horizon Ridge and Carnegie. Our party of 5 arrived around 6 PM without reservation and we were able to sit immediately in a round in the middle of the restaurant. The interesting artwork and decor will definitely catch your eye when you have a second to look around. We were greeted immediately and given the dinner specials for the night. Service was more than adequate for the entire meal.  The dinner menu is centered around  \"creative specialties\" and \"classics\" all made with pastas that are made in house. Even with all of the entrees coming with a complimentary Caesar salad and garlic cheesy bread, the prices are a touch inflated. We skipped appetizers and ordered entrees that came out in a timely manner. Everyone was pleased with their pasta dishes which included linguine & clams, two pappardelle alfredo with chicken, and ravioli bianca. I was least satisfied with my salmon and lobster special for the night. The salmon was cooked over and salty and the lobster was pretty much non existent with only one bite sized piece. I definitely did not get value with the $30+ price tag for my entree.  We also skipped on dessert with our bill, without appetizer and dessert, coming to $155 before tip. We also received a bag of fresh pasta with check in which turned out to be a great meal later in the week. I think this would be a great place to take a date for a unique experience. Next time, we would leave the younger ones at home and I would make their chicken alfredo myself instead of paying $20 for each entree. I would also make sure we order from the \"creative specialties\" section to have something unique."}
{"text":"If you're looking for home-cooked Italian in the Henderson area, this is the place.  I have been I came here because of a recommendation from a friend, and have not been disappointed since!   We love their garlic bread and another fave is the spinach pasta!   If you check in on Yelp you get a free bag of pasta to take home!   The filet special was so tender and fabulous and their sauces in the dishes we've tried are Devine! There's morning quite like homemade pasta versus that out of a box!  The owners are very friendly and personable!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  We go about once a month for date night.  The owner usually serves us - he always remembers us and the service is top notch!  I wish the menu were a bit more extensive but understandable for such a tiny place.  The specials can be a bit pricey but the regular menu items are pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food with great ambience. Been there only during lunch, quite a few times with my office mates. The decor is like an art museum. The fettuccine alfredo chicken is my favorite. Go there before 1:30pm as that's when they close."}
{"text":"The first impression was quite good: Although I didn't find this place cozy I liked the idea of homemade pasta in various shapes and flavors. The food was OK but not outstanding - and it was clearly overpriced.   A few weeks later we decided to give it another try. We arrived there around 8pm and the restaurant was already closed!?! While we were peeking inside to find out what's going on, somebody opened the door and told us that they closed early because the evening was slow. Hence, this didn't leave a good second impression on our second visit!  The third time we went there, we double checked first whether they were really open that evening. I ordered the black pasta and it tasted like cardboard. The bill was over $100 for 2 pasta dishes and one appetizer (no wine). Needless to say we won't come back: For that price tag the restaurant design should be nicer, the opening hours more reliable, the service more professional and the food a one of a kind pasta experience!  Post Scriptum: It's almost impossible to find a vegan option on the menu. Make sure you check their menu before you consider going there!"}
{"text":"My parents and I just moved up the street last weekend and have ordered this through Postmates 3 times already! I have to eat gluten free and they make the absolute BEST gluten free pasta I have ever had. My parents say they have never had better regular pasta before either! Our new favorite restaurant, delivered through Postmates, and we live less than a mile, it's all dangerous for us pasta lovers! :)"}
{"text":"Had a restaurant.com certificate and wanted to hit the town with my husband for dinner so we decided to give this a try.  What a surprise this restaurant was because it was delicious.  The homemade pasta is the best we've had in Vegas so far.  This is a very very small little place in a strip mall, and there was hardly anyone there.  All the art on the walls is made by a local artist and for sale.  They had some homemade night lights that I thought were so cool that I almost bought one, and I might get one next time we go.  All the tables are also unique and painted by the same artist.    Eating here made us feel like we were eating at someone's home for dinner, as we were warmly welcomed and talked to as if they wanted to get to know us.  I ordered the Portofino which was a delicious spicy tomato sauce over linguine with nice juicy clams, good size tiger shrimp and scallops.  All the seafood was cooked perfectly, and I couldn't have been happier with the dish.  Husband got the Ravioli Pomodoro, which he was extremely pleased with and said it was the best homemade ravioli and sauce he had ever had.  The best part about the food was the chef himself served us after he had cooked the meal and talked to us for awhile.  The meals were served with hot crusty bread and a small light caesar that was very good.  I have not eaten at Nora's like some here on yelp have compared this place to, but the prices were very reasonable and the service was outstanding.  I can only compare this place to Gaetano's, and Pasta Shop is much better than Gaetano's easily in every way.  This was one of the few times we have tipped over the 18% that restaurant.com requires the restaurant to tack on the bill, it was that good.  Call first before you go because their hours are limited.  We got there at 7pm during 100+ degree weather and they were getting ready to close when we left.  We will be making this a frequent dinner destination for sure."}
{"text":"My daughter loves Pasta and we both love Art. So I thought this would be a great place as it touts itself as a pasta shop and art gallery.  Mostly we were not disappointed!  The gallery is just what they call the restaurant as there is art everywhere.  Most of the art is very unique and vibrant.    The pasta is all homemade and the yelp special (1 lb of fresh pasta to take home for free on your first visit) is awesome.  The baked ziti was great and you could tell the chef made it with love!  The garlic cheesy bread is actually bland and soggy and the only negative for the meal.  We didn't get to try the deserts we were so full.  Portion size is just right!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much just hate that I live downtown! My husband and I took my mom and aunt here and let me tell you they are the biggest critics and they absolutely fell in love! They had the special with salmon and ravioli and some type of green creamy sauce and it was fantastic! Will be coming again and again and again! Oh and please have Nina Rose preform again we absolutely enjoyed her music and her voice is absolutely beautiful! We really enjoyed eating our meal and listening to her preform! You guys rock open a location downtown!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My boss recommended this restaurant so we gave it a try last night. We live a few minutes away so we can drive or walk to the location. I would recommend reservations or a fair amount of patience as this is a small place. There is artwork to look at while waiting but there is really no where to stand without feeling like you are in the way.  The kitchen must put a fair amount of heat into the dining area as it seemed hot. We had the live forever salad, chicken marsala and eggplant parmesan...cannoli and spumoni pie for dessert. We probably didn't need the salad appetizer since the dinners come with Caesar salad. I found the Chicken Marsala to be an interesting interpretation of a classic dish and the Eggplant Parmesan was okay. I imagine we will eat here again based upon food but ambiance is what it is."}
{"text":"The BEST pasta shop in Southern Nevada!! Always such a treat to dine there.. You've got to try it.."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed for the quality of the food. The fettuccine alfredo lacked flavor, and  the strips of marsala chicken over pasta was  bland and watery. The entrees average around 18.00 which is not bad but I would have rather paid a bit more at the casino restaurants for a good italian dinner. Service was good, did give a good tip but the food  was the worst I've ever had ."}
{"text":"We had another great meal at Pasta Ristorante last night. Checked in on yelp and brought home a pound of fresh pasta for checking in! Tonight we had roasted mushroom clam sauce with basil pappardelle. Yum. Dinner here is always a pleasure."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here on a date tonight. I had heard about this place on NPR ads and had been meaning to check it out. I got the baked rigatoni and I was absolutely blown away. My belly is full, and it was super tasty."}
{"text":"Food was very good, but a little over priced. Find it crazy this day in age that you have to pay for refills for a soda. $6 for a soda & 1 refill :("}
{"text":"Awesome food! Little pricy and few seats but get here early or make a reservation and you'll be golden!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the area. The food is very fresh and you can tell it is made with love. My husband and I are vegetarians and we can always find different things to order. The entire back page of the menu is a vegan menu, so there really is something here for everyone. My favorites are the Ravioli Bianca and the Teatro, which are creative and flavorful dishes. They also have classic Italian meals. They serve a delicious Caesar salad and cheesy ciabatta bread with every meal. They always have good wine, I had the Iconic Chardonnay last night and loved it. The restaurant itself is so interesting. The owner creates her own artwork and it is displayed throughout, which is always fun to look at. We have been here on nights where there is a live performer and the ambiance is awesome. We also love to come here for special occasions, especially because if you sign up with them, they send you a coupon for a discount and a free bag of pasta/cannoli on your birthday and anniversary. If you usually go to Olive Garden or anything similar, you will only spend a bit more here, but the difference is AMAZING. Pasta Shop Ristorante is the best!"}
{"text":"On the recommendation of friends and several fellow reviewing Yelpers, Diane and I recently embarked on a 45-minute ride to Henderson from North Las Vegas to see if the pasta here lived up to its billing.  It did!  After sampling a very good bowl of White Bean Soup with carrots as the soup of the day, followed by a very good Caesar Salad with croutons, Mozzarella Cheese, and a light dressing, I eagerly dove into a large portion of the Mediterranean Sausage dish as my entree.  This steaming hot concoction featured sweet Italian Sausage, Red Bell Pepper, sweet onions, oregano, and Kalamata Olives in a robust Tomato Sauce ladled over really fresh rigatoni.  Although the sausage was indeed sweet, my main was nicely spicy as a whole.  It was an excellent hot pasta offering.  Diane enjoyed her specially requested Rigatoni Alfredo with Tiger Shrimp.  And decadent Ganache-covered Cookies & Cream Gelati capped off a fine introduction to a ristorante with stellar food.  Seating was comfortable in a rather intimate, informal setting.  And we were afforded fine and pleasant service.  Because of a Yelp check in offer, we received a bag of fresh fettuccine on our way out of the restaurant.  That pasta tasted great too, and turned out to be a portion big enough to support four large helpings of Spaghetti, Meatballs, & Mushrooms served up at home over the course of one dinner and one lunch.  Bravo to the Pasta Shop's pasta maker!"}
{"text":"After a great experience on mothers day ,we decided to stop by for date night. They had a restaurant week special going on with a three course meal. There were several dishes to choose from, Fa Diablo Shrimp, Tiger, Shrimp Primavera, one I can't remember lol and last but not least Salmon with lobster ravioli, in a lobster sauce. I chose the Salmon and it was Fantastic!!!  The Caesar salad there is nice and light. Not too fishy. The Salmon it's self was cooked to perfection, that paired with the lobster sauce had a wonderful flavor. The lobster raviolis were perfect. My boyfriend got the fettuccine Alfredo and added shrimp. The shrimp was huge, and really tender, and of course the pasta was yummy. For desert we got the cookies and cream tartufo, which I'm not going to lie I had no idea what that was when I ordered it but I'm so glad I did. It was so good. Cookies and cream gelato rolled in more cookies with chocolate.  Amazing!!!! Once again a spectacular meal. Thank you so much for making date night special."}
{"text":"Its a very small quiet and quaint romantic date spot. I've been here plenty of times and I can't believe I have not written a 5 star review about this place yet! I'm a bad customer. I will forever be a regular. The owner or manager and staff is always so friendly and welcoming. I always feel like they are rolling out the red carpet for my gf and I! The pasta is always so fresh! Their food most defiantly compliments their customer service! Perfect date spot with great wine great food and superb customer service!"}
{"text":"This has a more casual dining feel with a mix of contemporary art and Van Gogh likes is the best I could describe this place.  The main attraction is the home made pasta that is not flown in, not store bought, just simply made in-house.    The Caesar salad and ciabatta bread was complimentary with our meal and a nice way to start off the meal.  We ordered bruschetta as an appetizer that came with a healthy serving of tomato mixture and the olive tapenade.  Definitely on the pricier side of things, so I probably would only stop by on special occasions. We finally found some time to celebrate a birthday and it was a nice treat.  The spinach linguine with olive oil and garlic was my dish of choice.  The chicken was ever so lightly fluffed in flour and cooked to perfection.  The sun dried tomatoes with the hidden mozzarella cheese was a great balance to a non-red sauce dish.  No dry chicken in my dish, but I couldn't speak for my husband who thought his pappardelle and chicken was on the dry side.  The pasta are great, and I appreciate that the mere fact that it was just freshly made.  Our waiter was sweet and gave us two bags of pasta to-go when we mentioned our check-ins.  The fresh pasta came in handy for a quick pasta night at home."}
{"text":"Love this small very cozy restaurant. The food is amazing. Everything is made to order. The baked eggplant parm is the best I ever had. I have eaten several items and have not been let down. The garlic bread rocks. The owners are very warm and inviting with their guests. The art work that decorates the restaurant is amazing and it is all for sale."}
{"text":"My family lives in Summerlin which is quite far from the Pasta Shop, however we continue to go to the restaurant as if we lived around the corner. Not only is the food delicious but the service has always been efficient and kind. My favorite part is the ambiance, when I enter the restaurant I feel an overwhelming sense of family and warmth. I wouldn't trade the beautiful family dinners I've had there for anything and I hope everyone gets the opportunity to visit the Pasta Shop, even just if it's for the amazing food."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Pasta Shop for dinner. We arrived right when they opened at 5:00 for dinner. We were greeted as we walked in and asked if we had reservations, which we did not. Only one table was occupied. We were told we could sit outside or at a hightop but all other tables were reserved. We decided on the hightop.   We were sad to hear that Chef/owner David Alenik had just passed away on Sept. 15th. There is a very nice photo and memorial of him on the wall.   Water and \"garlic cheese bread\" were delivered to the table. We placed our drink orders as well as our entrees. We chose the baked rigatoni with a side of meatballs and the calamari steak and shrimp which was a special of the evening. Both came with caesar salad which was quickly brought out. Simple, with romaine, croutons and shaved parmesan it was a nice start.   My other half's baked rigatoni arrived with his side of meatballs. I tried one of the meatballs and it was just okay, a little dry for my taste. A good 5-6 minutes went by before my entree came out, a pet peeve of mine. I thought the calamari steak entree was excellent. The calamari and the shrimp were charred perfectly and served over bow tie pasta with a garlic scampi sauce. As good as it was, the $38 price was not justified.   Like the meatballs, the baked rigatoni was very average. We both said we have had better. We ordered tiramisu for dessert and again it was just average, we have definitely had better. The service throughout our dinner was excellent with waters refilled quickly and plates removed when needed.   As we were leaving we noticed that many tables were still empty, not used the entire time we were there. Others came in without reservations and were offered tables. We may come back and give it another try, but it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not sure what took me so long to try this place. I love fresh pasta. Everything we had was fantastic and the service was great as well.  We will definitely add the Pasta Shop to our regular rotation. It's not cheap, but it is some of the best pasta I've had in town!"}
{"text":"After having seen good things about this place around the internet & local magazines, I finally visited for the first time last week and was sadly disappointed; I was expecting and hoping to like it! I really wish their food was better, because this place is fairly close to my house and I'd otherwise be there all the time.  The space they have is small but welcoming, and I love the art they have hanging around (all of it is actually for sale). The owner and others working there were all very pleasant and service was pretty good. The menu, while not super extensive and a bit heavy on seafood offerings, had several intriguing offerings. Out of four of us, we ended up with 3 different dishes: rigatoni primavera, chicken davida (sauteed chicken topped with eggplant parm with a side of vegetables and a polenta cake), and my pick, the scallops fra-diablo (that's what they say instead of fra diavolo). Now, they're known for their home-made pasta, and in that respect I can say they didn't disappoint. The linguini (and accompanying sauce) in my scallops dish was pretty tasty, and held up well as next-day lunch leftovers. The scallops sort of brought the vibe down, though, as they turned out more rubbery than they should have been. The rigatoni primavera looked good, but I didn't end up trying that dish. I did taste a couple bites of both the chicken and the eggplant parm,and they were both nearly flavorless (how the heck do you get a fried food to lose its flavor?!). I was told, however, that the accompanying veggies were delicious. With your meal, you're given cheesy garlic bread (tasty enough, but could use more garlic) and starter Caesar salads (just ok, for a Caesar, which I normally enjoy; would have liked the option for a green/garden salad instead). The croutons on the salad are even better than the garlic bread, so don't skip eating those!  I'm hoping it was just an \"off\" night for the chef, because like I said, the place is super cute and I really wanted to like it. I'll re-visit at some point and test out a different dish or two, but I can't say my mouth will be watering in anticipation."}
{"text":"Someone highly recommended this place to me so i checked it out. We were greeted at the door by the owner who gave us a little history of the place and showed us his wifes art work for sale. The waitress was very friendly and went over the specials with us. We started with a delicious artichoke, drizzled with parmesean and balsamic appetizer. I ordered the spinach linguini and my bf ordered chicken marsala; both were very delicious!  They gave me a complimentary birthday dessert and bag of fresh pasta. Everything about this place was great, the service,  the ambiance and most importantly,  the food!!"}
{"text":"The pappardelle alfredo - says \"light cream sauce\" on the menu - more like watery pasta soup! great flavor, just so much watery sauce.  Forgot to mention - entrees & pasta come with complimentary yummy garlic cheese bread and a good-sized caesar.  For dress / ambiance - some people come in shirt and tie (usually older couples), others come in jeans and t-shirt. Feels very \"come as you are\"  Gratuity included for parties of 5+"}
{"text":"This restaurant has nice atmosphere, nice service and trendy interior. Food is average, lacking aroma, and spices.  My tiramisu didn't impress me also. Although, my husband enjoyed a lot pineapple turnover cake. It was sweet, warm, soft and juicy piece of heaven... I will come back to get this desert only."}
