{"text":"I've heard about this deli a couple different places and it's close enough to my work that I can walk, so I decided to check it out.  I'm so glad I did!  I ordered the Ruben sandwich and it was delicious!  Everything was good - from the perfect amount of sauerkraut on the sandwich to the potato salad and even the little garnish of cole slaw.  The bread was fresh, they used a good quality cheese, the Montreal smoked meat was tender and flavourful.  I was in and out in under a half hour, which is perfect for a work day lunch.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I felt like I was in Montreal, except for the Flames jersey on the wall. The food was good, service was fast considering how busy they were. It's a go to spot."}
{"text":"Great customer service by Gillian at the Take-Out desk, very friendly and she glowingly raved that the Reuben was the best in the city.... And she was right!"}
{"text":"My first visit was today for brunch. We were promptly greeted and seated, amazed to find so few people there. That only became more amazing as the meal progressed. I ordered the smoked and poached breakfast poutine, one friend had the omlette and the other had a rueben. All three meals were excellent and arrived in good time. The only complaint was from me that there was too much food. The waitress asked about desserts and was told just that. 

I left wishing that people wouldn't find about this place, but knowing they will, because I plan on telling everyone I know about it. You should go!"}
{"text":"It's my second time here, it had such good reviews I thought I'd give it another chance. Nothing has changed. 

Super slow service, 

mediocre portions, hash browns weren't cooked through, just all around bland and boring. 

I really wanted it to be good since I live within walking distance; disappointed.
2 stars is being generous but the staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Love this joint. It's very easy to miss but once you do wander in you will be hooked. Smoked meat poutine, breakfast poutine, lox Benedict, Reuben and grilled vegetable sandwhich are all knockouts. Good coffee and definitely get some latkes!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place.

My office gets catered breakfast from Grumans and I always look forward to it. They do an wonderful job of catering.

I've also been into the restaurant many times for breakfast and lunch. Staff are very friendly and great at their jobs. Always attentive, quick and so nice to talk to. In my onion, some of the friendlier staff I've had in Calgary. 

They always poach the perfect egg, amazing lox, salad dressing on the mixed greens is amazing, just a hint of rosemary. The sandwiches are unbelievably delicious.  If you are lucky enough to try their house made potato chips you will never want store bought potato chips again!

Can't wait until my next visit here."}
{"text":"Cool little place with good service. We have only had breakfast here and all I can say is yum!  Can't wait to come back for some lunch."}
{"text":"Gruman's is a Jewish style deli, located in a small strip mall downtown. Blink and you may miss it. From the location ( close to the Mustard Seed) and the bland front of the strip mall, I wasn't expecting to walk into the clean and busy it turned out to be. The man who greeted us at the front door seemed like he didn't usually do that job, so he his half acknowledgment to my friend and I was followed by us being seated by a friendlier lady who was also a server there.
The menu isn't huge but has a variety of staples seen in Jewish delis: pickles, latkes, challah etc. 
I chose the latkes to start and them the Chicken Club. The latkes were served with thick sour cream and were thin, crispy and delicious. They offered a sample of their chicken liver with bagels chips. It looked like cat food and tasted organ-y ( that even a word?) but I ate it all. Would I ever eat it if it wasn't given toe for free? No, but it was nice of them to offer the patrons there something different to try. My gigantic sandwich came on an amazing onion bun, which was soft and buttery. The chicken was tender, and the vegetables fresh. It was served with pancetta, which I couldn't taste, but that didn't bother me. On the side was potato salad and slaw. Both awesome, the slaw not being too tart or bitter. My friend had the bagel with lox and capers, served with a generous portion of fruit salad. He lets have a bite. The salmon was nice and thin, the capers not too salty and the bagel was also thinner and had a slightly sweet taste to it. 
Gruman's also has a few breakfast/brunch options ( challah bread French toast) so  definately going back to give it a try."}
{"text":"Just like being in Montreal. Peter and his crew are awesome. Do yourself a favour eat here!"}
{"text":"So first off, there is no parking in the parking lot.  So you have to pay on the street.  But that's fine...if it is worth it.  I went in around 1045am on a week day, not busy at all. I wanted a smoked meat sandwich and was rudely told they don't make that until 11am, I had to order breakfast.  So, reluctantly, I ordered a bagel, cream cheese and lox.  I explained it was for a child so to make it plain.  After paying over 8 dollars, and the cashier who couldn't seem to find change for a 10, ok...just call it a tip...so between parking and the bagel, I'm now up to 11 dollars...for a bagel.  Get home, open it, and it is covered in capers and red onions.  Not sure how this is child-friendly.  
I am a BIG deli fan (from Montreal and Ottawa originally), so I KNOW good deli.  This isn't it."}
{"text":"Nice change of pace and great food. Very simple no bells and whistles but great food.  Had the breakfast and pastrami on rye. Simple is still beter"}
{"text":"Judy and Jessica helped us out and put together a fantastic buffet menu for 50 on two weeks notice. The food was a hit! Folks were raving about the beef brisket, crab cakes and herbed butter. Everything was hot and fresh despite the long drive down to South Calgary. Grumans knows food. The staff was so friendly, helpful and professional. We are grateful!"}
{"text":"We live across from Gruman's deli otherwise we may never known it existed.  Tucked away in an industrial type strip mall, I was surprised to see a lovely deli upon entering - clean, bright with a casual atmosphere.

We were seated promptly by a friendly individual and immediately received menus.  Hmmm....what to chose?  Gruman's has sandwiches, salads, burgers and they all sounded delicious.  I opted for the tuna melt on challah with tomato.  I had two choices of sides in the form of potato salad or fries, but the server said that \"today I can offer you latkes or knishes instead.\"  After asking for a description of both, I chose the latkes which were crispy and delicious and served with sour cream.  The tuna melt was also tasty, but too salty for my liking.  My boyfriend tried the poutine which was not on the menu but was a dish that was in the running for being added to the regular menu.  It was flavorful and quite good, but also very salty.  

We also used them for catering for a potluck we attended and ordered the macaroni and cheese and an order of pickles.  The order was ready when requested as promised and the food was delicious.  Crunchy, refreshing pickles and creamy, cheesy mac and cheese.

I would definitely go back to Gruman's for another try.  I just think they do need to cut back on the salt.  I'm sure the food can stand on its own.  Also, I was surprised to see that I was up charged $2.00 for the latkes.  Not a big deal, but the server didn't mention that.  In fact, she definitely made it sound like I could get them instead of the other side dishes.  That was sneaky which I didn't like.  Otherwise, I would have given them 4 stars."}
{"text":"I expected this place to be good based on the Yelp reviews. But when we arrived I started to get worried -- aside from two other tables, we were the only ones in there. On a Saturday morning. In a city where you have to wait to get into a Humpty's on a Saturday morning. 

But, whatever is keeping people from mobbing this place on weekends is still a mystery to me. The food and service were fantastic, well above our expectations. Our very friendly server said she thinks it's still one of the city's best kept secrets, but not for long... John Catucci has been there to film a segment for \"You Gotta Eat Here,\" which will be airing in a couple months. So, get there fast while you can still get in the door!

Now on to the food. I had the breakfast poutine, which is fried potatoes piled with Montreal smoked meat, cheese curds, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. It wasn't too salty or overwhelmingly rich, like you'd think it would be based on the ingredients. It was really nicely balanced and flavourful. The hollandaise is rich, thick, creamy and lemony, the way it should be -- none of that packaged stuff that looks and tastes like wound seepage.

My fiance had the challah French toast and said it was the best French toast he's ever had. It's three thick pieces of challah bread covered in banana slices, whole walnuts and a caramelized sugar sauce. I tried just the sauce by itself first, and it was almost too sweet, but when I tried a bite with the bread, walnut, banana and sauce it was perfect. Again, a really nicely balanced dish.

One thing to note: the parking situation is a little whacky... we got away with it on a weekend, but you're not supposed to park in the surrounding parking lot as it doesn't belong to the restaurant. So, street parking, especially on a weekday. But whatever. I would hike to get to this place.

We're now super excited to go back and try their lunch and deli stuff, like the potato knishes, matzo ball soup and brisket!"}
{"text":"The food and service were fantastic, well above our expectations.  I had the breakfast poutine, which is fried potatoes piled with Montreal smoked meat, cheese curds, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.IT was amazing. And just the right amount of food. The waitstaff was so friendly and attentive and it really was not very busy. I think it is busier in the summer when the weather is nice - people must enjoy the patio. We were there Saturday morning and there were only 5 tables in the restaurant with peopl at them which is strange as the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here for a catered dinner - was absolutely WONDERFUL!!  Had to go back the next morning and try their breakfast.  CANT wait to go back to Calgary so I can go back to Grumans.  The owner is AWESOME, staff are FAntabulLOUs!!!"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice now. The first time I ordered a non-traditional steak salad and was really impressed with how tasty it was, and how good the service was. The second time I went back for a more authentic deli expereince with a coworker (he was quite put out that on my previous visit someone had told me to have a steak salad. \"Even if it was good\" he said, \"You had no business ordering that in a traditional deli\".

We were going to go all out on this visit and have the Matzo ball soup and the old fashioned smoke meat sammy. When we got there we learned the soup only happens on the weekends now. My coworker almost wept. In fact I think he did. Being as I've never had it, I was detached emotionally from the situation. We did go ahead and have the sandwich. It was melt in your mouth delish!  We had to ask a few times for my gravy for my fries, but otherwise the service was fairly decent - nothing spectacular but efficient and polite.

I'm looking forward to going back, perhaps on a weekend to try out the soup and some other items!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times and the food is really good. It is fashioned after a Montreal deli and it is very close to the ones I used to go to in Montreal. 
The smoke meat is fresh and tasty with the correct rye bread on the sandwiches. A side of pickles, coleslaw, potato pancakes with sour cream and a cherry Coke and I'm in heaven. 
Have also been here for breakfast and adding smoked meat to eggs is decadent. 
The waitresses are a throw back to the old lady's I was served by as a kid in the Montreal deli's. They are warm hearted and always have a smile and are easy to talk to. There is also a takeout service for almost everything they make. This small deli can get packed at lunch and breakfast times so go early or late if you can. Weekends you have to line up. Parking is street only weekdays as the parking lot is for other businesses in the building. 
Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Grumans is awesome! The owner is always walking around and is super friendly. Love how you can get takeout, catering or sit down and enjoy!

Loved the burger creation for YYC Burger Week! 

Great place to eat, easy to find and park as well."}
{"text":"Grumans catering is truly a hidden gem.  We came here for breakfast on Saturday around 11am.  At this time, most decent breakfast places (and even the not-so-decent ones) have line ups and a long wait for a table.  Not Grumans...  I guess the rest of Calgary doesn't yet know about the AMAZING breakfast served here for prices cheaper than the Humpty's down the street.  To top it off, the service is quick AND friendly.  Shhh.... Don't tell anyone, or I may have to wait for a table!

I had the Breakfast Special with my eggs poached and my bacon crispy.  It was served with tasty chunky hash browns, and rye toast.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  $8.  I'll be back for this often!

Mike got the Smoked & Poached Breakfast Poutine.  Chunky potato hash browns were topped with a generous serving of Montreal smoked meat (yum), cheese curds and soft poached eggs.  Oh - and of course, a lemony hollandaise!  AND a side of toast.  For $13.  You really can't beat that.  He even turned down my leftovers, which doesn't happen often!  He absolutely loved this meal.

There's also free parking on the weekends!

....shhh - don't tell too many people...Or we'll all be waiting for a table!"}
{"text":"Been to Grumans twice now and thought it was only okay. Nothing special to write home about. First time had the lox bagel and second time the normal breakfast. Had higher expectations for the latkes although much better when dipped in the sour cream. Sausages were small. Service was great and nice atmosphere however. Not sure if we would return to this place. We did have them cater a retirement party at my company and the food in that event was pretty good so having mixed feelings."}
{"text":"Grumans is the real deal.

I lived for a few years in Montreal and used to go to Ben's.  Grumans is much smaller, but the food is terrific.  They claim the best Reuben in town, which is true.   May be the best in the West.  

The burger also looked quite good.  Grumans is now in the regular rotation.  Next up is some Montreal smoked meat.

If you want a great deli experience in Calgary this is your place."}
{"text":"Wow. I love this place!

The moment we walked in we were warmly greeted. 

We ordered smoked meat sandwiches. They came with the best coleslaw and fries. Of course we had gravy as well. 

The smoked meat was delicious. 

My daughter had smoked meat poutine. She loved it!!!!! Fries smothered in gravy, meat and cheese curds. 

The fried pickles came with a spicy sauce. We all thought the fried pickles were about the Best we have had. 

We are so happy to have found Grumans and plan to be back!"}
{"text":"PICK UP ONLY REVIEW

We've tried the Rueben and the Chicken Breast Club with potato salad and fries. ALL are freaking amazing!!! Best potato salad I've had outside my Grammy's kitchen. The Chicken Breast Club is so amazing the messiness of eating it is obsolete to me. Crappy deli's are messy too but don't taste as epic as these sandwiches are!!  

Only complaints about here is they aren't open after my work and their website sounds like they didn't opt for customer parking. When in the most unfair parking city in Canada this is so stupid I'll probably never go back if not on my walking route at lunch. I would go here a lot more of I could feel safe for once parking in this city."}
{"text":"I love Grumans! Like to the point where it's a little bit extra so my review is low key bias. My favourite things are the chicken pot pie and the Reuben with the house made chips.  The knishes are sometimes really good especially when it's hot out the oven, but sometimes when they're cold it lacks a bit, the lox platter is a great appetizer and the French toast is delicious. The staff is always friendly and gives great service regardless if the restaurant is empty or full, or even if you stop by 30min to close (I'm so sorry and thankful about this). They have fun Seinfeld Trivia for their loyalty cards so make sure to grab one."}
{"text":"Let me sum this review up with one word: REUBEN.

Quite possible THE BEST reuben I have ever had.   The meat was tasty,  tender and an unusual thick cut that brought the sandwich to a new level.   Perfect ratios of meat : kraut : sauce  : bread : cheese.   Accompanied by Potatoe salad (try with a kosher pickle for a perfect balance of creamy to acid), and a Cole slaw that brings back childhood memories. 

Service is fantastic.

No complaints about my first Grumans experience.

Food.   5 by 5.
Service.  5 by 5.
Overall.  5 by 5.  TRY THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"So after our Yelp party, I decided to try them out for catering. When one day at work we talked about catering for a small group lunch, I jumped on it and suggested Grumans.

I placed the order online. They have a really nice website which is not only aesthetically pleasing but also makes it super easy for customers to order. I ordered a variety of items to my hearts desire.

Everyone enjoyed the sandwiches, and I got to take some home :)

The billing process was very easy as well. We had a holdup due to technical difficulties but the lady at Grumans did not have a problem at all and seemed very amicable.

I would use them again!



Review #27 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"This place is right across from my work and is always packed and for good reasons too! I have tried various of items off the menu and it's always delicious. The chicken liver on bagettes is great to start, my go to meal is the chicken club sandwich with potato salad and side of coleslaw. Fridays the have their feature brisket, which is super moist and tender. Totally recommend this. There is no parking out front on weekdays so be aware if you are driving there, you will have to park on the street. If you are going for lunch go early cuz they don't take reservations and after 12 there will be a little bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Sarah and the owner (Peter, I think?) saved me! I mistakenly placed a catering order for a morning breakfast meeting and showed up at 9am when they weren't even open yet. Not only did they let me in early but they whipped up a catering order for me on the spot even though it was 100% my mistake for placing the order for the wrong date.  Cannot recommend more highly to anyone looking to feed a group at work!"}
{"text":"Delicious close to home made food with a Jewish flavor to it. Good place for lunch or breakfast as long as you are not looking for a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"I was dropping off my hubbie at the BMO Centre last weekend for his annual car show visit and I noticed a familiar name was back on the Calgary restaurant scene.  We used to frequent Grumans when it was located just south of the Louise Bridge some years ago.  Sadly the Grumans deli disappeared about 6 years ago but they continued to do amazing things with the catering business.   I still remember the first meal I had there years ago... amazing food.  We have since gone to Grumans for the past two Saturdays to experience the brunch offerings and the new location.  I am thrilled to say that it's as wonderful as I remember.  Grumans offers 9 items on their brunch menu from an omelette with your choice of two fillings, challah french toast, to a smoked meat latka and eggs dish.  All are delish and I can't wait to sample the rest of the menu.  They also have take out and we ended up having a roasted eggplant dip with bagel chips and a super yummy matza ball soup with a tasty chicken broth and tender sticks of carrots and celery.  It made for a great dinner.  The deli has a nice industrial feel to it but still has that 'home' feeling with vases of fresh flowers and great old photos of the owner Peter's family... fun to look at photos of Bubbe and Zayde circa 1950s.  It speaks volumes when on our first visit, we were welcomed by Karen who remembered us from the original deli 6 years ago!  It's like our old friend is back and we can't be happier!  Free parking, only on Saturdays, is available in the parking lot in front of the building."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today, it was great! Good service, good food (I had the chicken club which was delicious and the fries which were cooked to perfection). Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"From all the choices downtown for food, I keep finding myself coming back to Grumans for their Rueben. Best in town for sure, and rivals Montreal restaurants for sure!! (their meat comes from there I'm pretty sure). What a good lunch."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointing.  OJ - Fz concentrate..Bagels..Not fresh- must be toasted - French Toast - horrible cloying syrup - a mess - Montreal Smoked Meat?  No way..They use a pre=packaged product.

Don't waste you dining dollars at this place."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go to it is very good and the food is good and it's a good yah man I liked the fact the do sfood is yAy"}
{"text":"Montreal smoked meat. Drool thinking about how good it was!
Best Montréal smoked meat I had in Calgary and the ladkas were amazing as well!!"}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE AND FRIENDLY ATTITUDE.
Food was awesome and I plan to come back before I leave Calgary for Breakfast this time!"}
{"text":"Read great reviews, figured I needed to try it. Arrived close to 3pm and the place was pretty empty, which was great. Shared a rueben sandwich with my husband and ordered a side of pickles. Best rueben sandwich ever!!!  The meat just melted in your mouth.  Also ordered some meats from the deli counter to go. 

The people at Grumans are the friendliest!!  Being the only ones in the restaurant some of the staff chatted with us for awhile. We had the best visit, so glad we came. Highly recommend Grumans Deli!!"}
{"text":"Service at Grumans is both fast and friendly.  The portions are a bit smaller and the prices a bit higher than those to which I've grown accustomed for this kind of fare.  All in all, Grumans is alright."}
{"text":"What a glorious Reuben, the pastrami was on point in juicyness and meaty wonder

The sauerkraut and coleslaw deserved their spot on the plate, and in my stomach.

Sunday Brunch hack: Skip the lines at your usual brunch spots in downtown and come here, they quickly sat us down as soon as we walked in!"}
{"text":"What the heck does Gruman's do to get their staff so stoked about smoked meat? Want to find out? Take a bite of one of a Gruman's sandwich - you will know immediately! *Caution* You may need to dislocated your jaw first.

A regular Reuben comes stuffed with 7 oz. of thick sliced smoked meat greatness. If you're feeling zaney, 'Zadie' size if for $2 and get 2 more ounces shoved in there. 9 oz. Reuben, friends. Prepare yourself!

Want to be a star of you office? Gruman's does catering. Order from them. I'm sure they have some sort of options for the outspoken veggies in your office, but I don't know what they are. Ma 

Their Smoked Meat Poutine is unreal. The smoked meat is a bonus, but this poutine really holds its own. I want to go on a \"gravy only\" cleanse diet and carry a water bottle of it around with me wherever I go. I tried to wait until noone was watching before I tongue-bathed that plate clean. To be completely honest, I don't even care who saw. We're in love!!

Things to know: There's a parking lot in front of Gruman's but you don't get to park in it. It's sort of unfortunate as there's only a few street parking spaces out front along the one-way street. I wish who ever owned the lot would be willing to let Gruman's have parking spaces in exchange for sandwiches. Everyone would win!

They're only open until 3:30 so you can get Smoked Meat Breakfast Poutine in the morning, a Reuben for lunch, but you'll have to skip picking up your 3rd straight smoked meat meal on the way home.

Maybe it's a mad rush over the lunch hour, but during the non-peak times I've been to Gruman's I've pretty much had the place to myself."}
{"text":"It's been almost 3 years since I moved away from Calgary and I STILL think about the delicious meals I've had at Gruman's. Nothing compares. They make everything from scratch, from the latkes, to the dough for their verenikes and knishes, to the in house cured lox. The lox is absolutely mouth wateringly delicious. They perfected the brine that they cure it in - it has the right amount of salt without being \"salty\" and you can taste the freshness in the salmon. One of my favourite lunches was the bagel and lox combo. Mmmm.. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches Ive ever eaten!  The Rueben is a must with a side of Poutine.  Died and went to heaven.  Staff was so friendly and the environment is wonderful."}
{"text":"Nearly a year after first hearing about this little restaurant, I finally made my way to Gruman's to try their deli offerings. Now that I've been, I can't wait to visit again.

On this first visit, I tried a few of their standard items including the Montreal smoked meat sandwich, pickles, coleslaw, and potato salad. The smoked meat was flavourful without being overly salty (a common complaint with smoked meat), the pickles were crunchy and fresh, the potato salad was creamy without being heavy, and the vinegar-based coleslaw was fresh and thin sliced. All together, this made for an awesome meal.

A little before noon on a Wednesday, myself and four other co-workers were able to get a table with no wait but the restaurant did fill up over the noon hour. If you are dining on a Friday at lunch or arriving just after the noon-hour, maybe be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that this review will be far from complete, which is why I left it without the fifth star. There is a lot about Gruman's I haven't experienced as I wasn't the one to call them to organize the event, nor the one footing the bill, so those aspects of the business are things I can't speak to. However, everything I did see lived up to the companys somewhat boastful name.

The event I witnessed was a retirement party for a woman who worked in the same building I do. I wasn't even an official guest, rather I wound up experiencing the workings of the companies representatives and some of the products offered because the office I'm based out of is across the hall from where they set up, and due to the nature of my position I aided them in bringing everything in, setting up, and the inverse. This shows the limited nature of my experience with them.

However, I did see some things that impressed me A LOT. First of all, the young ladies who handled this event were on site well in advance of the event, were very professional, and handled everything without incident. One in particular, a young lady named Jessica (who I suspect may have some sort of management role) was an absolute delight; greeting everyone with a smile and pleasent conversation, eagerly handing out business cards and brochures to anyone who showed interest (though, without being pushy) and all around being the exact kind of representative I can imagine their company would want.

On top of that, the food was AMAZING. Granted, this wasn't a full meal affair - mostly limited to small sample-sized appetizers and mini deserts, along with punches, coffees, etc. but everything I had the chance to try was impecible - from fresh, juicy fruit skewers, to several different variations of desert squares (of which it was nearly impossible to pick a favorite) and mini strawberry cheesecakes that almost made my knees buckle. 

I can't say I've ever organized anything that would require catering, but if I ever do - I know who will be my first call."}
{"text":"Waiting in a 2 hour line up at Stampede in the blazing sun, I worked up quite the appetite and insane thirst! Like, I may have slurped up a puddle if the pavement wasn't 50 degrees, thirst.

Faced with thousands of screaming kids and lineups for crappy hotdogs and buckets of grease, I was about to just give in and join the closest cue for my slop. 
But, in a stroke of pure genius I checked Yelp and \"Nearby\" on my phone... and voila... A real jewish deli only a 5 minute walk away. I'm on my way. Get outta my way kid.

Ahhhhhhh. Air conditioned heaven as I sat down in my comfy seat. Pints of filtered COLD water ensued as I literally inhaled my Reuben. It was perfect. Stacked just high enough that I could wrap my face around it. Sooooooo yummy. I was treated to a little bag of homemade chips, that were really good too.

Thank you for making proper sandwiches. You guys rock!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat in the city. I love everything about this restaurant, the staff are extremely nice the restaurant is always immaculate and the food is killer. My favourite things on the menu are, the Ruben sandwich and the chicken breast sandwich. Other things worth trying: smoked salmon and capers, matzah ball soup, smoked and poached breakfast poutine. A couple menu items that I think aren't so great are the all day breakfast burger because it's a bit too much of everything and the tuna melt, I found it a bit dry. Having said that I highly recommend this restaurant to all my friends - I love it every time I go, as they say at Gruman's \"eat well and get the f&$@ out.\""}
{"text":"Smoked meat to die for. Delicious. Staff is super friendly, clean and orderly space.  Where else can you get matzo soup?"}
{"text":"The service was 5/5, the ingredients were 5/5.  The only problem was the meat was cold.  The food wasnt cooked.  At least at SUBWAY they toast your sub so the cheese and meat gets hot.  I sent it back and it came back luke-warm again.  Manager was a bit tough saying that he doesnt advertise a hot smoked meat sandwitch, and to be fair I didnt ask for it hot.  Ive never encountered anyone thinking they can just cut up some cold meat and put it on a bun and charge 15$ for it.  why not just buy a loaf of bread and buy a pound of meat from them instead?  Kind of ridiculous that they make food there at all, let alone charge you to sit there and eat something that takes no actually 'cooking'..  It should be a clear deli counter with no places to sit , not a restaurant.  

I've been all over the country and in many smoked meat smoked meat shops and never have encountered this kind of atmosphere, the kind where they barley prepare food and expect people to come eat there.  McDonalds prepares food better im sorry to say.  The knish's were barley baked at all, mostly doey and just luke-warm inside.  I feel sick after eating them.

The hours of the place are ridiculous, but I think the same about all morning restaurants.  I have never been to a single deli, not here in calgary from alberta king of subs, to myres, to the one in marda-loop, to swartzes in montrael, where there is a wall between you and the kitchen.  Its always open and always inviting.  The fact that they are hiding the chef's is  allowing sub-par food to come out of the kitchen, and then with the owners reinforcement.  I havnt seen this diners/dives/drive-in's video on grumans, but thats only T.V.  The reality is guy ferrari doesnt get an unknown to come in an order a sandwich and then he eats it on camera talking about how wonderful it is.  He sits in the kitchen watching and making sure everything is great, and when its open and I do that, it is also for me.

I came in with such high expectations after seeing the reviews i was expecting the best smoked meat sandwitch in calgary, to dethrone Alberta King of Subs in my books.  Alas the best hot smoked meat sandwitch (can be done no other way) is with alberta king of subs and their meat from swartz, always steaming, fat rendering nicely, not too dry not too moist.  

If you are in the area, and Alberta King of subs is too far, just buy the meat and microwave it and put it in some bread.  You'll be so much more happier than buying a sandwich made by Grumans.  I dont think I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"We had the reuben sandwich and the lox eggs benny. The sandwich was soo good. I don't have a lot of experience (???) eating reuben sandwiches at many places but mmm this one is definitely superb. I would totally recommend!

The lox benny was another story. While I was intrigued by the fact that it was served on a potato latkes (like a potato pancake! Just reminds me of a hashbrown haha), the lox itself tasted kind of.. Old. And extremely fishy. The artichoke and pepper sauce on the dish also sounded so good but none of it felt like it went together. 

LONG STORY SHORT, try the reuben sandwich and avoid the lox eggs benny. I think next time I visit (which I definitely will again!), I will try the montreal smoked meat sandwich because I was so impressed with the reuben sandwich. 

Also, just a side note but apparently the parking lot in front of this place is reserved/private? Seemed kinda stupid because it was a huge empty lot with like one car in it and everyone eating at this place had to park on the street."}
{"text":"Our friends took us here for a late breakfast today. It was delicious! I had the eggs Benny served over potato latke with pancetta. Yum!!!! It comes with a little side salad that had a nice light dressing. My friend had the French toast, which she dreams about regularly. Highly recommend this place. Plus no wait on a Saturday in Calgary. That's worth a lot too!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and family friendly! Recommend the reuben and fries with gravy...plus a side of potato salad. The sausages with the breakfast platter were delicious. I'm eating here every time I visit Calgary."}
{"text":"Best breakfast potatoes in town. The closest you'll get to the real deal when it comes to a Montréal style Jewish delicatessen. Memories of Snowden Deli, The Main, Schwartz.... Love this place!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the fuss is about. I was having a smoked meat craving and google pointed me to Grumans. I ordered the smoked meat sandwich and it when it arrived, it was soggy. Very soggy, disgustingly so.  The bread was soggy and the texture of the meat was \"off\".  I couldn't even get through two bites of the sandwich.  Nothing like Schwartz's Deli in Montreal.

I will never return and would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"5 of us were patiently waiting, next to come in, when 4 women walked in behind us. The owner looked through us and said, \"I can take you 4 now.\" One of my party joked, \"If it's based on looks, we'll never get in,\" and the owner quickly replied, \"No, it's a money thing.\" An arrogant prick like that doesn't deserve anyone's business.

I wish I could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"There is no reason you can give me that will forgive you for missing this place if you are anywhere in the Calgary area. It is a serious loss on your part if you don't make the effort to get here. This place is the real deal and will raise the bar. 

Not only is the staff phenomenal, like family almost, but the food is top notch. I had the breakfast Lox Benedict and it blew my mind. It was the perfect balance of savory and creamy and tart goodness. Those latkes are the stuff dreams are made of. 

The decor and ambiance are just the cherry on top. This is an authentic New York diner experience. The attention to detail is on point. From the quality soft TP to the babies with pickle wall o'fame to the Jew\"ish\" shirt uniforms...this place is a class act. Go eat it up Yum. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I started with a pecan spinach salad, followed by lox eggs Benedict, finished with the carrot cake. My wife had eggplant with baked bagel crisps and the Montreal smoked meat breakfast poutine. Our son had matzah ball soup and a feta burger. Everything was delicious. On a Saturday, we were pampered with A-list service instead of enduring the mad weekday rush. It's a delightful alternative to our usual brunch places, and we'll be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The service is really good. The smoke meat is piled high and very flavourful I had an excellent sandwich"}
{"text":"According to my friend O, Grumans Catering and Delicatessen used to be pretty sketchy looking from the outside until recently (they did some renos due to a fire). Heck, I hadn't even heard of it's existence until she suggested we check it out for a late Saturday lunch. Living in Montreal taught me a few things. If you want smoked meat, you go to Schwartz's Deli. How would Grumans compared in relation to the holy Jewish institution? Read on friend, read on.

Having just ate an early brunch at Cerezo, I wasn't exactly starving. But I'll never say no to trying a new place out so I went to meet up with a different group of friends that were also in town for Stampede. At least I was smart and shared two dishes with my friend. Then again, we always share. It's the thought bro! Parking is free on the weekends in their parking lot but you have to street park on weekdays so be aware of that!

The place is very bright with crisp white and blue lines surrounding the walls. They have a lot of food/funny quotes up on the walls which I thought was pretty clever along with a smorgasbord of Bubby's family pictures. The menu has everything you'd expect of a Jewish deli (smoked meat, reuben and matzho soup) but also has a few intriguing twists (smoked meat poutine, eggs benny and challah French toast). A little something for everyone.

- Grumans reuben ($14.00) - smoked meat, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, Russian dressing on grilled rye bread. I haven't had a ruben for ages but this one was off the charts. The sandwich was huuuuge! Super tender, juicy smoked meat with the right amount of fat on each slice. ON POINT brah. If you're craving a sandwich, go with this one. O wanted it all to herself, so greedy. 
- Challah French toast ($12.00) - vanilla, cinnamon, sautéed bananas, nuts and a fruit salad. To combat all the smoked meat we were indulging in, we also shared the challah French toast. Best decision ever. Challah bread is the best. Brings me back to my youth where my one buddy's mom would make it fresh out of the oven whenever I went to their place for dinner Friday nights. This one is for all the brunchies out there. The French toast was delicious - airy, fluffy and delicate. Another solid dish.
- Grumans grilled special ($13.00) - All beef salami, smoked meat, mustard on grilled rye bread. Two buddies ordered the same thing (losers). One tidbit was that when our reuben came out, one bud said he wished he'd ordered ours instead. #winning.

Two other friends came late and ordered the matzho soup and smoked meat poutine. The poutine looked potent (in a good way). Forgot to mention our other buddy ordered the sundried tomato turkey breast but he ate it so fast, I couldn't even get a picture. I don't think you can really go wrong with ordering anything off Grumans menu. Look out for their daily specials (Tuesday - meat loaf, Wednesday - croquet, Thursday - reuben pizza, Friday - beef brisket).

They definitely give Schwartz's a run for their money."}
{"text":"Not as if they needed another 4 star, but boy, the egg salad has got to be one of the top 2, behind my recipe ;) 

Fluffy, not salty, and just the right touch of green onions.  Hats off to how they were able to dice the egg to such consistent pieces.

And that's some high-quality container too, so rigid, it can hold hot soup easily, I'm thinking.  

So if John Catucci came here, it's got to be great, eh?"}
{"text":"On Saturday, Sept 24, my boyfriend and I ordered the smoked & poached poutine to share. I'm health conscious, so I immediately refused to eat anything more than a few soggy potatoes. It was literally a pile of greasy goop. After he ate the majority of it, my 29 year old partner, who generally likes greasy food (therefore his stomach is used to this type of meal) got the worst food poisoning I've ever witnessed. I'm glad I followed my gut and opted out of eating the undercooked medium poached eggs. He vomited for 9 hours. It had to have been Gruman's, because we hadn't eaten anything else that day. 
We had already attempted to give this place a try once, but since the parking situation is so horrendous we had to come back on the weekend... Why they have empty reserved parking stalls surrounding the restaurant is beyond me, I guess they don't care if their customers get ticketed. 
Whatever you do, don't order this meal. Make sure you specify that you want your eggs fully cooked. The service was friendly and the decor was nice, I was expecting the food to be better."}
{"text":"Lucked into this authentic New York deli experience smack dab in the middle of Calgary.  First the interaction with all the staff and owner was just great, followed up with some of the best food I've had in months. Seriously, go here!"}
{"text":"\"Grumans... What is this place that people keep posting about?\" I scratched my head last spring after seeing a couple of reviews and checkins and wondered why I hadn't seen it sooner. When I went in search of it, I understood why. It's a bit out of the way in the same building as tourism Calgary and if you don't know to be on the lookout for it, it's likely you'll miss it. But it's there! Open for breakfast, second breakfast, elevensies, lunch, and afternoon tea. Don't get any ideas about filling up for your 6pm dinner or 9pm supper though... These doors close at 330pm weekdays.

Now that the weather is turning a bit more nipply, (no, not a typo ;) )' may I suggest you start with a bowl of Matzoe ball soup - light broth, with a dumpling made from bread turned into crackers then rolled all up together. Hope you're bringing your appetite because if you follow up with a sandwich, you might be carrying half your meal out the door to save for your next hobbit meal. If that's the case, you should get the Grumans Grilled Special. It's my favourite, though the Reuben is sure to please and these folks might know a thing or two about making a Montreal smoked meat sammy.

If you want a new breakfast place to try, Grumans does that too! And don't worry about waking up early... It goes all day on Saturdays and Sundays. On my list to try is the Challah French Toast and Lox Benedict.

Oh, did I mention Grumans also does catering? Yep... You can spread the love for The drool-worthy goodness coming from this delicatessen at your next meeting or event.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ever since I discovered that Grumans serves some traditional Jewish cuisine, I really wanted to make a visit with my Jewish gf because she would know what was best!  Gruman's is located on 11th Avenue SE and it looks like they have a large parking lot but it is ALL RESERVED.  My gf and I parked in the lot on a Saturday during lunch but after seeing many many signs that say \"DO NOT PARK IN LOT\" \"WILL GET TOWED\" we got scared then went out to move our cars onto the street.

The entrance door is pretty heavy so be careful (haha) you then walk up the stairs and have to wait to be seated.  At the front there is a display of Jewish clothing articles along with other things.  I think the first thing I said to my gf was \"Omg is this what it's like because I feel Jewish!\" (haha, it's a joke).  Shortly after, we were greeted and sat at a booth.  It didn't seem busy for a Saturday afternoon!  

I let my gf order because she had been here before and knew what was good.  We ordered the chicken matzo ball soup, potato latkes as well as a Reuben sandwich to which we shared.  \"WTF is a matzo ball soup and latkes??\" I asked.  She just said \"trust me, they're good\" and she was right! The matzo soup is pretty simple but super tasty!  The matzo ball is a dumpling made from matzoh meal, eggs, water and fat and it was a really nice light broth with a nice touch of dill.  The potato latkes were essentially shredded potatoes with sour cream on the side.  And the Reuben was huge! It came with a little side of coleslaw which was nice (we only ordered the sandwich alone).  We asked for mustard because well...you need mustard on any smoked meat sandwich and it was delicious.  I took some pieces of meat out so the sandwich would fit in my mouth for a bite.  The smoked meat was thick and juicy while the melted swiss cheese, sauerkraut and dressing complimented the meat very well and there was a nice crunch from the rye bread.  Sharing all the dishes was perfect because it didn't absolutely stuff us but we were comfortable.

Overall, our service was OK - we had to ask for refills but the food was deeeeelish!!! I reeeeeally enjoyed the matzo ball soup and reuben sandwich and would get those two again for sure.  As for the potato latkes, they were good but I can probably make them at home. They are famous for their smoked meat and you can definitely tell.  I heard that they have a slow oven roasted beef brisket only served on Fridays so I would like to check that out as well as their breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Really love the smoked meat! the best in town! thick and juice!!! 

The slow oven roasted beef brisket (only served on Friday) was okay, I personally prefer chinese beef brisket coz fat and juice haha....

I would love to try Lox Benedict but that's only available on Saturday & Sunday.

The portion is good! I was full but not extremely full plus the food was not greasy! 

Not busy before 11:45am, my hubby and I got ours 5 min after we ordered, awesome!
But very packed once it hit 12noon. 

PARKING: need to pay for meter, the parking lot is not for customers."}
{"text":"I first heard about this deli while watching Diners and Dives on the food channel. My ears perked up when I heard them reviewing in Calgary. It sounded interesting, so I made a mental note to check it out whenever I got to Calgary.

Our first impression was one of frustration because the diner is located in a building with a parking lot out front. But all the parking lot stalls are reserved and there are none set aside for patrons. This turned us off a little because we felt the least they could do was have 2 stalls with a \"reserved for Gruman's customers\" sign up. It seemed like the first message you received was that the customer wasn't very important.

I was pleased to discover that our first impression was not the most accurate one. 

The waitress was very pleasant and helpful and seemed to really take pride in working at Gruman's. 

I had the smoked beef shepherd's pie and my husband had the brisket (a special on Fridays). We were both very pleased with our selections.

The potatoes on the shepherds pie were light and fluffy and very flavourful. The smoked meat was incredible and just surprising enough that it transformed the dish from an old favourite to something a bit special. Even the side salad that was served with it was very fresh and tasty.

My husband's brisket was fantastically tender and full of juicy flavour. As someone who is gluten intolerant, he found he was able to choose from a wide selection of items as the food is prepared fresh.

Overall, we had a lovely lunch with great service and a wonderful jewish diner feel that is hard to find in Alberta."}
{"text":"Totally unimpressive... The potatoes salad was good... But the sandwiches were just ok.... In addition the service was super slow... I would say I'll go back only if I have no choice... But it is definitely not one of my favorite places in the area, perhaps I was expecting something better based on the reviews and I was disappointed... My biggest recommendation is if you have to go there, don't expect too much... Just normal sandwiches..."}
{"text":"Clearly, Gruman's Bubby knew her stuff. From crispy potato latkes to tasty matzo ball soup to fat sandwiches (the turkey bacon is my current favorite) and a damn good chicken pot pie, Gruman's has become one of my regular lunch spots. The desserts that I have tried (the carrot cake and the chocolate cake) have also been delicious. The service is friendly and prompt, and Peter Gruman himself  can usually be found standing by the deli, helping customers order take out or checking in on a table's meals. I haven't tried their brunch yet, or their early morning breakfast specials, but it's definitely on my list. 
If you're looking for comfort food made right, and a casual place to go for lunch or dinner, and hey, if you enjoy spinning hypothetical yarns about Bubby, then be sure to check out Grumans."}
{"text":"My update today is to add my review for breakfast at Grumans.  We ordered:
- Breakfast special - 2 eggs over easy, Spolumbo's maple sausages, confit hasbbrowns and multigrain toast - quite tasty.
- Challah French Toast - delicious French toast covered with maple syrup, pecans and bananas.  
- Salami and Eggs Omellette - comes with multigrain toast and confit hash browns  - quite well done.
- Lox Eggs Benedict - Delicious poached eggs sitting on lox and potato latkas with a spread of roasted peppers, then smothered with Hollandaise sauce with paprika seasoning.  Came with a house salad and a slice of grilled English muffin.  The waitress asked me how I wanted my eggs poached and soft they came!  A most delicious eggs Benny!  Not at all fishy.

I'd eat at Grumans any day!"}
{"text":"Jew\"ish\" Deli! Amotzaballs!!!! The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable too! The fries are hand cut, house cured lox, but they are most known for their smoked meat. They serve breakfast all day on Saturday and Sunday. There's free parking available out front on the weekends."}
