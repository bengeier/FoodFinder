{"text":"The decor is the best thing about this restaurant, which serves up acceptable but thoroughly uninspiring food. Service is fairly rapid and attentive but lacks elegance - food is offered on the left, cutlery has to be requested, one wine cooler is brought when three bottles are on the table. We were a large group but things could have been done better. Bottom line -- nothing objectionable, but there are better restaurants on the same block that don't cost anything more and are also BYOW."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very pretty. Our waiter was great and I almost felt bad complaining about my food because the server was so nice. The food was mediocre, at best. I would love to go back but I can cook up a better tasting meal at home."}
{"text":"Eeeeyyyy tout un resto les amis je vous le dit! Belle ambiance, beau decors et bonne bouffe! J'ai opté pour la table d'hôte de brochette de poulet.. mmmh un délice pour les papilles, ca m'a remplis au bouttee!!Vous allez en avoir pour votre argent je vous le garantie!! Parole de Mathieu creme caramel!"}
{"text":"Food tasted good. Service was excellent. Decor was nice. Price was perfect Everyone in our group of 7 seemed very pleased. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Le décor est très beau,bon service,la nourriture bonne, pas plus et trop cher.A choisir en dernier si les autres alentour sont plein."}
{"text":"This place was incredible the service was excellent the food was outstanding I will definitely become a regular here.  George our waiter was the best I have ever seen. He was bringing me stuff before I can even ask for it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends last month.. Food and service was impeccable... Great value for your money!"}
{"text":"The place was average and I would not visit again considering it's no bargain!   A. the salmon was bland and needs some more seasoning  B. the service was quick and friendly  C. we did not have to wait on line Saturday evening at 8pm even tho the place was full"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call the food impeccable, but the service was definitely good.   Most of the meat dishes that had been ordered at my table (filet mignon brochette and medaillon filet mignon) were decent, at best. My mom wasn't too pleased with the fact that her filet mignon was wrapped in bacon, which she had only realized after eating 1/2 of her plate. My mom doesn't eat pork. It was hard to tell what it was at first due to the sauce covering most of it, and the menu doesn't mention that anywhere (I believe it should). Others felt as though the filet mignon was rather tasteless and drenched in sauce to compensate for that. I had ordered the chicken brochette with butterfly shrimp. I thought it was pretty good, the chicken was great actually, but the butterfly shrimp was a tad greasy and mushy. The rice needed salt in order to have any taste at all, and the potatoes... same problem.  It was a nice sit-down dinner, however not very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ordered Mussels in mustard sauce and spaghetti bolognese. Both were excellent so I'm not sure about the food complaints in here. Also, you can bring your own bottle which is to me the best thing ever, as I like good wine and find that restaurants don't always have the best options or it's just super expensive. SAQ is 5 mins walk."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding, the service was great, the soup and salad (yes both are included) were both fantastic, and the tortellini rosé was simply outstanding. I don't write reviews but I had to for this place, I'm definitely coming back and the brochettes being cooked on our way out looked amazing."}
{"text":"Maintenant Alexandre new design,belle ambiance excellent service et très bonne nourriture a un prix très abordable et c 'est un apporter votre vin. A découvrir !"}
{"text":"Alexanders my favorite spot while in town!!! Family run business offers EXCELLENT SERVICE!! Had veal parmiganna with fettuccini alfredo and was absolutely amazing!! Cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Je ne sais pas par où commencer en faite...c'était un samedi soir, repas table d'hôte. La soupe et la salade son inclus. Soupe étant supposément présenté comme une crème de carottes qui est en faite une canne de crème au poulet (avec encore des mottons dedans, ça lève le cur)avec des morceaux de carottes dedans. Ensuite...la salade. Laitue iceberg coupée grossièrement avec quelques carottes et un peu de vinaigrette...tu peux faire un updrade pour vraiment trop cher et transformer ça en salade cesar avec 6-7 croûtons et du parmesan. Ensuite j'ai pris le surf and turf. La cuisson de la viande était parfaite et les crevettes étaient bonnes, fort heureusement. Le riz étant beaucoup trop cuit et sans aucune saveurs et les légumes en accompagnement pas assez cuit...genre vrrrraaaiiiiimmmeeeennnnt pas cuit. Les patates grecs étaient bonnes. Les desserts semblent être sortis tout droit d'une boîte chez Costco, vraiiiiiment pas bon et ça ne vaut pas la peine. Point positif : C'est un apporté votre vin. Tu peux noyer ta peine d'un aussi mauvais repas. Le service est bon. C'est pas leur faute si la bouffe est mauvaise."}
{"text":"In my 24 years of existence I have never been so disappointed about food. The décor is pretty nice but the food was mediocre. So mediocre no words can explain it. We were around 50, had a fixed price for 5 courses ( either 27 or 32$) which is extremely cheap but that doesn't mean you serve food that is not edible. Although people that were served steak said it was alright, everything else was awful. Soup was tasteless, made with canned tomato juice, salad was iceberg lettuce that's been sitting on the counter for ages. As an entree we had shrimps au gratin (the tiny frozen ones), that was so watery. Fried zucchini was soo oily. Followed by pasta that was way overcooked and tasteless rosé sauce. The worst part is when our dessert came, creme caramel-  Omgsh, as soon as I approched the spoon to my mouth I could smell eggs, it was so intense, I felt like I was served raw eggs. I couldn't even take a bite we had to ask them to take it away. The waiters did an amazing job handling everything and that one star goes to them but please do yourself a favor and don't book your corporate event or any event here"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The restaurant decor is lovely but the food not so much.  Yes it was reasonably priced but not at all authentic.  Supposed to be Mediterranean, I think not. Maybe the owners but not the cooks. I say cooks not chefs. What a shame but I will not return. On menu 2 sauces for mussels. Apparently they use one sauce for base of all dishes & just add a few other ingredients.  A red sauce which is supposed to be white wine sauce. Lasagna was clearly no better than a frozen dinner, definetely not home made as the manager said.  Believe me I know homemade pasta since I make it myself. Pathetic really pathetic."}
{"text":"Food is yummy, I like their pasta primavera. I usually get extra mushrooms and add chicken. The butterfly shrimps are tasty."}
{"text":"I am on the fence. The service was great and for the cost, I got quite a bit of food and it's a BYOW. My plate cost me $19. I ordered the grilled chicken breast. First we were served warm bread and we ordered a side of tzatziki. The tzatziki I personally found a bit too garlicy but bland at the same time. Not my favorite but it was ok. Then we got soup and a salad (all included in the $19 price). My plate came with potatoes, rice and veggies. I found the plate itself a bit too oily for my liking. There was a pool of oil at the bottom of my plate.  I would go back if I wanted a big meal for a small price. But if you want good Greek food, I would suggest you go to Panos."}
{"text":"Came with a large group and were accommodated well. The waiter was a little disgruntled by the large group of Uni students but they managed it well. Perhaps a smile would have helped but they were quick and efficient.   They had a few veggie options (bless) which was a great start! I had a penne primevera and was happy with the abundance of fresh veggies and simple sauce. However, the pasta was so overcooked I wasn't excited to gobble up my very generous serving size. Most of the party feasted on steaks and were happy with what they got. Strangely, a few of us agreed that the best thing was the lentil soup they served us as a starter. I heard good things about the cheesecake but I would skip the creme caramel - it was flavourless.   Overall, I'd say this is a great place for a large group. They can accomodate you well and there is a variety on the menu so everyone is happy. The service might be better if you aren't a bunch of loud university students (I hope so anyways!)"}
{"text":"We tried to go to a nearby fancy place without a reservation on a sunday evening and was shooed away by the hostess... so we settled for this place instead. This place was spectacular, very pretty, almost empty, with attentive service and good 3 course meal specials. and BYOB. The server directed us to a nearby liquor store still open and viola dinner was saved. Food was decent. I was surprised at the generosity of the helpings (I got a ton of mussels) and the lack of a byob fee. They even helped call us a cab afterwards. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"An upscale dining experience at a fraction of the cost. I came here with a large group on a weeknight. Our reservation was handled smoothly and we were given a quaint little section to ourselves. The decor is really stunning, with an all-white theme and gold accents, giving the place a luxurious feel.  The restaurant is BYOB and is conveniently close to an SAQ, so we brought a few bottles of wine. The waiter was very courteous in helping pour the glasses and bringing us an ice bucket for our white wines.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food, which was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. I ordered the salmon which came with potatoes and steamed vegetables; everything was delicious.  Overall, everyone in our group absolutely loved this restaurant. The price to quality ratio is great, the service is impeccable and the classy decor is just icing on top of the cake."}
{"text":"Giving it 3 stars why well the service wasn't that bad I was there for someones birthday we were served cold bread, they charge you the service fee I ordered a lasagna price 17$ at the end it cost me about 22$ with the service fee and taxes I don't like places that function like that but the food was good, O didn't try the deserts maybe next time :)"}
{"text":"Loooovely place! Nice service! I only ordered starters: a very well served Pikilia and a fried Zucchini. The tzatziki they serve is delicious... So fresh! Don't forget to bring your own. There is a SAQ close by... At St. Denis."}
{"text":"La nourriture est bonne, mais beaucoup trop chère. L'ambiance et le décor sont très biens aussi."}
{"text":"Really good. The calamari was the best I've had in a while. Bring your own wine though."}
