{"text":"Went to eat at this restaurant last night based upon earlier review.  The reviews were spot on!  The food was great, atmosphere was very chill, pleasant service and dinner for 2 with tea, capps and desert was $35.00.  Pretty reasonable.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Consistently good and reasonably priced food and we've always received great service here.  There are a lot of Ethiopian choices in Toronto with this being one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Great little Ethiopian place right by Donlands station. The decor is warm and inviting and it smells amazing inside. Don't make the same mistake I made and show up extremely hungry, because those 20 minutes until your food arrives will go by very slowly when you can smell all the delicious food people around you are eating.   Our server was very friendly and great about helping us decide what to order. We got the beef tibs with vegetables platter and I was a much bigger fan of the vegetables than I was of the beef. Although the tibs' sauce was probably my favorite part of the meal, the meat itself was a little tough and chewy. The vegetables on the other hand were all very good. I would recommend the lentils in berbere sauce, and the collard greens were delicious as well.   We also did the coffee ceremony at the end, which is worth trying if you have never done it before. The coffee was really interesting, it was strong and had this cinnamon-y flavor that I haven't experienced elsewhere. Also the popcorn they served with it was addicting.  The entire meal came to about $35 for two, including tip, which felt pretty inexpensive for the amount of food we got."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place through close family, so we were super excited to have our first experience with Ethiopian food!  When we arrive, on a chilly Saturday evening, Dukem was full. That's ok, that means it  must be good! So, we came in expecting to wait for some seats. As we  arrive, a curtain  greets us with a homely restaurant, filled with smells delicious exotic spices. We were immediately greeted by a the host, telling us there were no tables available, and that it would be a 30 minute wait. We were told we could not wait inside, and it was cold outside, so we decided to grab a business card and wait in our car.   We waited, and gave Dukem a call, and was told to wait another 10 minutes for a table of 4. 10 minutes passed, and we called again from the car, expecting  them to have a table of 4 ready. The person on the line told us they simply gave away our tables, and it would be another 30 minute wait. Really?? We showed up, and was turned away, called to confirm, and our table was given away.   We were cold and hungry, and was told to wait almost 1 hour to eat there, because they gave our tables away.   Poor customer service, broken reservation systems, and simply disgusting attitude towards prospective customers. We haven't eaten here, but based on their treatment towards us, we won't even bother."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one star because the food was decent. That's it, DECENT. The service was unbelievably bad. I think I would've enjoyed it more if I was eating it at home. The owner suggested we take the platter and I told him I wanted my own food and didn't want to share. He said that's not the tradition and gave me the look! They had single meals on their menu but he chose to ignore my request and brought us a platter anyway. I wish it went that smooth! We got there at 7:00 pm and we were starving. We got water at 7:15. They took our drink order at 7:30. They took our food order at 7:45 and we finally got food at 8:10! And it was a damn platter! It's not like they cooked to order and we had to wait for our meal to get cooked. I was starving so while waiting, I asked if I could try their salad. The owner said there's salad in the middle of our platter! He didn't sound or act like the owner. He acted like someone who's really mad at the owner and wants to drive him out of business. My girlfriend asked for orange juice and he went to the bar, opened a bottle of half-full minutemaid, poured it into glass and brought it over. All right in front of us! lol The food was ok. Nothing amazing. Honestly after waiting for so long, I would've eat ANYTHING.  If you're taller than 5'10\" forget going to bathroom, the ceiling is so low, there's no way you don't come back with head injury. I'm a huge coffee drinker and was excited to try their genuine Ethiopian coffee. Huge disappointment. Tasted like dirt and over roasted. Almost burnt and sour.  This place it very small, very dark and has the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. They act as if they're doing you a huge favour by serving you food. I'll order if they start delivering as long as I don't have to deal with their arrogant owner and their incompetent staff because as I said I didn't mind the food."}
{"text":"Now that I am on an Ethiopian Reviewing kick, I figure it is only fair that I review Dukem. A long Time favorite of alot of east enders, I can certainly appreciate Dukem. I do not eat meat, and that is (I think) where Duken loses some points from me. My meat eating dining companion was more thrilled than I was with our meal. I also found it a little bland and a little expensive.  But note, Im comparing this to \"mixed veggie platter\" everywhere.   As for my opinion of the Messir Wat.. It was decent. Not particularly special and definitely not spicy enough.   This place really excels in service and atmosphere. The (owner?) actually visits tables saying hello and asking how your meal is. Its comfy, cozy and feels welcoming when you enter. Everyone is friendly and smiling and the server was suer attentive. This would be a good choice for an introduction to Ethiopian.   There is a teeny patio out front with two tables for summer dining.   Dukem is the kind of place I would visit again in a heartbeat if anyone invited me, and I may even give it another shot on my own. The food didn't blow my mind, but it really didn't offend me either."}
{"text":"Ordered the awabe kip beef and the lamb with the vegetarian combo and salad to start. Way too much food for three people! Thankfully the waitress stopped us before we could also order a chicken dish. Food comes on one large platter with injera bread so be prepared to get your right hand dirty and get sociable!"}
{"text":"Beef Kitfo- great. Tibs also good. I like how for $6 you can add a huge assortment of marinated vegetables/injera  The flavour/spice compares favourably to most Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto, and the food seems fresh. Service is friendly and the place was relatively full (mostly Ethiopians) and inviting despite it being 11pm. Portions are very fair. Nothing I can fault this place on, and I will go back for sure! Surely one of the top two Ethiopian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I definitely agree with Eugenio, in that this resto would be great if it were just a little bit spicier, otherwise it has everything else going for it.  A solid 3.5 stars (but I'll be nice and round up to 4).  Other than the lack of spiciness, I found the food to be very good at Dukem.  We had the vegetarian combo and an order of tibs, and I was surprised by how many different veg dishes we were served.  The tibs were excellent, nice and spicy and flavourful, if only a few of the veg dishes were spiced to a similar level it would have been perfect.  Perhaps it was the humid weather, but we couldn't finish our meal, we were so full.  We asked for the leftovers to go, and were rewarded with a whole new injera tucked into our takeout box.  The leftovers were fantastic at room temp the next day.  No meal at an Ethiopian restaurant is complete without the coffee ceremony.  My partner found the coffee to be a little burnt tasting, but I found it perfect.    The service was adequate.  I didn't quite understand who was supposed to be doing what, as we were often approached by the woman working there only to have the man come up and jump in on whatever was going on.  But nonetheless the meal flowed well, we didn't have to wait long to order, and then the food came out after a reasonable delay.  When it came time to pay, we had no problem getting someone's attention to do so.  And the bill came out to a reasonable cost, which is always welcome.  Would I eat here again?  Probably.  I might try another one of the many nearby restaurants on the Danforth first, to see if their veg combo was spicier, but I wouldn't say no if a friend was decided on coming back."}
{"text":"After I stepped in here the other night, thanks to my short term memory, I realized I had already been here before. The decor isn't dazzling - dark, 80's tavern-sort of feel to it.  It sounds like the other reviewers didn't find the service up to par but I found our server quite friendly and attentive.  We ordered the vegetable combo platter for two ($12 each). The injera isn't as sour as some other places I've been to. The different mounds of vegetables were good but not entirely memorable. A slight bit on the bland side. I'm not sure which was the shuro wat or yemiser wot but one was spicy and a favourite out of the six vegetables. I'm not a wuss when it comes to spices so I would've welcomed a bit more of a kick. Ring of fire? Bring it! Filling but missing a bit of a punch. Next time I've got a hankering for some Ethiopian food, I'll try to remember that I've checked off Dukem on my list of places to explore."}
{"text":"I took my parents to Dukem last night (though they are both over seventy years of age, they like interesting, tasty food).  And we feasted.  Absolutely not to be missed is the Dukem Special Tibs (lamb on sizzling platter).  And please try to think outside the box here.  The kitfo was the highlight of the evening (yes, it's marinated raw beef... like the best steak tartare you've ever had).  The food is not greasy or overly salted.  I would even like it maybe a bit more spicy.    The service is delightful.  I especially appreciated how friendly they were to my parents and made them feel very welcome.  There's also a nice vibe at the restaurant.  Pleasant decor featuring work by local artists.    Two minor drawbacks: 1)  It would be nice to have African beer and tej (Ethiopian honey wine).  2)  The long wait for the bill.  Although I was delighted not to be rushed out or have to spend my time in a chain restaurant-style environment, I am sure that many diners would appreciate not having to ask several times for the bill."}
{"text":"Toronto is blessed with a large number of Ethiopian restaurants, many of which I have patronized. Dukem with it's cozy atmosphere, friendly service, reasonable prices and delicious flavours ranks as the best to me.     Every time me and Dallas H. go together the server always gives a little chuckle when she comes to refill our water glasses and realizes that the entire platter is empty save for a small clump of injera in the middle.    In the near future, I'm planning to make a list of top meals in Toronto for two under $30. Dukem will be on it."}
{"text":"I had never had Ethiopian food before...was a nice introduction. Wait staff was friendly and created a nice melange for me and my friends, one of which was vegetarian.  I'm not a great big fan of the injera..but maybe it will grow on me.  Really inexpensive, and a fabulous atmosphere. Our bill came to $50 for three including a glass of wine and a soda."}
{"text":"The place could earn another star if the food wouldn't be on the mild side of what I expect from Ethiopian food. I had Yetimatim fitfit as appetizer that was delicious, then the Dukem veg combo. I was expecting a mound of different items with a decisive and spicy taste. It was good but not memorable. Micheal the owner is friendly but it is not easy to engage him in a conversation. Time to try some other Ethiopian on Dunforth..."}
{"text":"Dukem is a staple in my rotation of favorite restaurants to eat at within the GTA.  I was skeptical at first of what Ethiopian cuisine was like but after my first visit to Dukem I was hooked.  My regular order is Awaze Tibs with the Vegetable Combo Platter along with a mango juice.  The service is excellent and the owner really knows how to make you feel welcome in his establishment.  I suggest trying Ethiopian at least once to all of my friends and family, but it has to be at Dukem!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Aside from that.... It's no longer open and has closed until further notice."}
{"text":"Solid, tasty Ethiopian. I love that you can get a huge vegetarian plate for $12, cheaper if you are 2. Lots of vegetables, plenty of protein, and wonderful tasty variety."}
{"text":"Yummy. Make sure you wash you hands, the main dishes are eaten with your hands and injera bread -think - sour spongy pancake that is used similar to naan to pick up the morsels from a common platter. Not for the squeamish who are germ-a-phobics.   Share the Tibs combo (4-5 small veg portions along with beef tidbits in yum spicy sauce) and don't miss the Dukem salad. Delish.   Wine is cheap, not sure about the beer.    If you're up for it, partake in the elaborate coffee ceremony  personally I haven't tried but it is a treat to watch and smell!  Popcorn was a surprise twist."}
{"text":"I'm not really familiar with the food scene in Toronto, but my brief experiences with this city have taught me that, even with such bounty present, Torontonians do not know the value of good food. Some of the reviews below suffice as evidence.   Dukem is small, and humble. The front is darkened by curtains, and can be quite easy to miss. Yet, every single time that I have eaten here, the place has been more-or-less full. It should be bustling.  The service is timid, but attentive. There is very little grandeur in the way they set up plate at Dukem. You will be given a table, some menus, and then trusted to get on with business. That said, the staff will not fail to give you direction, if you so request. This particular instance, the manager was told that one of our party was vegetarian, and immediately offered to separate all meat from veg. Very considerate.  The food lives up to the hype of Ethiopian food. Spicy, rich, and extremely filling. Our party of four had the veg platter, the kitfo, and a plate of sizzling lamb tibs. The kitfo and tibs were outrageously good. Note: if you want the kitfo raw, you must specify or they will cook it up for you.  Take a slightly longer subway ride, and go to Dukem."}
{"text":"Dukem is definitely not the cheapest Ethiopian fare to be found in Toronto (go to Nazareth for that) but nor is it super pricey.   What really stood out for me about the food at Dukem was that it was not overly greasy whatsoever...it fact it wasn't greasy at all. Even the injera bread underneath both our veg and meat options did not become too saturated with oils (as is the norm for Ethiopian food I've had at 4-5 other places in Toronto).  My Yelp buddy and I shared 1 vegetarian plate ($12) and added a lamb dish ($14). Note that the prices on the menu INCLUDE tax (bonus!) So $26 for two people is not too bad. Food portion was large and they brought plenty of injera bread so we didn't have to ask for more.  Another thing I liked about Dukem is the service was good and the food came out within a reasonable time - another surprise for an Ethiopian place. I'm usually left agonizing over why the food is taking so long.  Decor was OK. The place has only 7-8 tables. Waitress was very friendly."}
