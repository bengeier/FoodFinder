{"text":"Food was really good! I don't have a single complaint about the food. I had the salmon teriyaki bento box, Canada roll and scallops. The mixed veggies that came with the box were so good and a really hardy portion of tempura!
The service was really great as well! Everyone was soooo nice. I would recommend it for anyone looking for good sushi and a nice place to eat :)"}
{"text":"To my surprise, this vegan sushi was very filling. They have a wide selection of creative rolls and appetizers. Would've liked an english menu as many of the rolls had several unorthodox ingredients. Our waiter was a bit slow and was checking his phone often. 
Overall, the food was great and I will definitely enjoy more vegan sushi at Momo again."}
{"text":"Food was ok.... The service was slow and we have been sitting for one hour no on served us water.  Don't feel like going back..."}
{"text":"Great lunch special, friendly and fast service, delicious makis and good miso. Very cute decor and great location. I will be coming back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Looked for a new sushi place on Yelp as all those I've tried in the area were disappointing. This place definitely did not disappoint! I ordered the tofu teriyaki dinner bento. It came with salad and soup. The salad had some fancy lettuces that I've never seen in your regular Japanese salad. Miso soup was ok. My jaw dropped however when the waitress brought my bento box to the table, as there were so many tofu pieces that they threatened to escape the box. I've never been won over by large amounts of food, but this food was excellent as well. The tempura was light and crispy, with asparagus tempura, which I've never seen before. There were six pieces of fresh and crisp tasting cucumber and avocado roll, and six pieces of spicy tempura roll, the latter with a generous topping of tempura pieces. (At some places the sushi rolls that come with bento boxes are really small, but these were regular sized.) The teriyaki tofu itself was a little bland but very smooth. It sat atop a bed of peppery stir fried veggies. A generous bowl of rice was served on the side. There was so much food that the leftovers I brought home will be enough for two additional meals.

My mom had the chicken yaki soba, and my dad had the bulgogi bento. He also got a very generous helping of beef, and both my mom and dad agreed that it was very tasty. They both enjoyed their dishes as well.

We sat in a booth which provided visual privacy but there were some loud patrons at tables beside us. There were several curtained-off rooms that would probably be quieter. The restaurant overall was pretty quiet though.

The waitresses were polite and came by to top off our drinks once. 

I really wanted to try the mochi for dessert but unfortunately (or fortunately?) I was already slightly uncomfortably full.

The prices are a bit more than nearby sushi places, but I find that I got my money's worth in the ingredients and care in preparing the dishes. I will definitely return! (And eat a bit less so I have room for mochi.)"}
{"text":"After seeing Sushi Momo countless times driving up and down Leslie (and getting some really bad service at Sushi Kiku around the corner), I decided to give Sushi Momo a try on a late Monday night. It was really good.

An experience starts with a first impression. Although the establishment is located in an understated building, upon stepping inside, one is immediately greeted by a cheery, authentically Japanese waiter/waitress (I was greeted by both) and a surplus of cozy, closed-in booths on the north wall and private dining rooms on the south wall (instead of doors to these rooms, there are curtains). My friend and I sat in one of the booths. The waiter offered us green tea, we accepted and I proceeded to order miso soup and the Sushi Momo house salad as starters, as well as 6 pieces of California maki, a spicy crab handroll and a piece of Sake sushi.

The miso soup that came to the table was a white miso soup, was piping hot, and was interspersed with chunks of tofu and seaweed leaves. It tasted full-bodied - no complaints here.

The Sushi Momo house salad was just what I wanted: salad leaves plus that delicious Japanese salad dressing you find everywhere. It was simple and I was happy.

The California maki was great. The crab tasted fresh, the avocado was perfectly ripe (but not too ripe), and the rice was good. My one gripe is that the rice could have been a bit fresher and fluffier, which is not a big deal, given that I arrived at around 9 PM and the restaurant was closing down within the hour. Had I come a few hours earlier, it would have probably been a bit fresher.

The spicy crab handroll contained copious amounts of crab and spicy sauce and was just lovely. Nothing like the meagre, rice-stuffed handrolls you will find at other places.

Last but not least, the Sake sushi (single slice of salmon on a ball of rice). Good sushi (not maki, not handrolls), for me, is the litmus test of a sushi restaurant and Sushi Momo did not disappoint. Unlike other places, where the slice of salmon is as small as possible and perhaps even slightly dry, Sushi Momo served an extremely succulent and large piece of salmon - almost twice the length of the rice! I must come back to try the other types of sushi.

With respect to service, my waiter was extremely polite and attentive. He made sure my tea cup was filled at all times. Although some may complain that his accent is too strong, he was understandable and seeing an authentic Japanese waiter at a sushi restaurant always makes me happy! This waiter really added to the experience.

In conclusion, my rating is a 4/5. The service was great and the food was simple but really good. This place does it right and for me, the prices are right as well."}
{"text":"This is truly world class vegetarian cuisine. Some of the tastiest food combinations I've ever experienced. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi place. Has both fish and vegan options. The fish options are what I tried. My favorite is the spicy tuna tartar maki with smoked salmon wrapped around it!"}
{"text":"They have the best sushi I've ever tasted and really friendly service. The sushi is creative and SO tasty. The prices are also pretty affordable. I'm a loyal customer"}
{"text":"Solid sushi for Montreal! Nothing tasted fishy which can be a problem this far from the ocean. Not for purists, this place is  more fusion than traditional.  Overall, a very pleasant meal with very kind and attentive service. Small, not for groups."}
{"text":"Food is very good, but the last two times we've been here the food took too long to come, we were a smal party (3 to 4) and the restaurant wasn't crowded."}
{"text":"Sérieusement ma meilleure expérience de sushi à Montréal!! Toujours frais et délicieux! Il manque un peu de place, mais c'est tellement bon qu'on peut oublier ça rapidement!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm hard to review. Cute place but seating is tight (yet I enjoy intimate spots) but you will end up sitting next to teenagers eager to impress their dates, teenagers who simper non stop as you are struggling to swallow your sushi. As to the sushi... I was impressed with apple and mango variations on the menu but not in the execution. Felt that the place didn't focus on the quality of the fish coming through and thus lacks lots of simple rolls such as yellowtail jalapeño or salmon/tuna with avocado and crunch. As a result, lots of overpriced rolls that are overpowering and taking away from the fish and the sushi experience. If you are just starting to eat sushi then please give this place a try, it really will not disappoint and you will start to acquire a taste for the dish!"}
{"text":"Mind blown! 
The service could use a bit more work and it feels a bit small inside. 
But the food was INCREDIBLE!!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavour combinations- totally worth the hype"}
{"text":"I am updating the review because of the service we received the last time we were there: we waited 30 minutes for our waitress to pick our order from the counter to our table. Yes, the thing sat there for 30 minutes. Momo is one of those places where you will not get a service if there is a large group because the waiters will be more worried about the tip they will get from them. I wish this was a joke. 
We asked another waiter whether the plate belonged to us and instead of (I have to chip in an opinion) employing his neurons to put an effort to understand what we were saying he looked beyond our plate to the behind of the counter, said \"oh thank you\", passed the counter, went to the back and fixed the adjustment of one of the plates on the rack. This was the one waiter whose attention we managed to get in the 30 minutes. Never again with this place and this service. The service was not stellar before but waiting for someone to take the 5 steps between your table and the counter to simply take your ready order and bring it back is extreme. The food is good but to compensate for THAT service you need you food to be heavenly."}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant was out of this world, just incredible. We're from Burlington, VT, and some random stranger at a Mardi Gras parade recommended the place to us.  We didn't even know that it was vegan, and we were blow away. Amazing food, so many different flavors at once, it's almost indescribable how amazing the food was. The service was wonderful and the restaurant itself was very cute. I wish they had one of these near us."}
{"text":"Wife and I vacationed in Montreal this past weekend, after I hadn't been there in over 7 years. Was really happy to see that their veg food scene has really expanded.  Sushi Momo was my favorite place we visited by far though.  Food was absolutely amazing.  Im sure many non vegans would eat here and feel the same.  Incredible eats.  Also, our waiter was really awesome... made us feel welcome and explained everything to us first timers.  I highly recommend, and glad we made a reservation"}
{"text":"I really love this place. First of all, their fishes are \"super\" fresh and all of dishes are delicious. 
Secondly, the atmosphere of this restaurant is cozy, clean and lovely. I feel like I'm in the home of  my Japanese friend when I visit there.
Lastly, all the staffs are friendly, helpful and extremely kind. 
I strongly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Affordable, creative vegetarian sushi option. They have moved to a new location on St-Denis street, which gives an underground, sake bar feel about it. Bigger location it still feels cramped. They don't honour the Yelp deal at the new location. Cost is about $20 per person for a regular sized meal, without booze."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best vegan sushi you will ever have!!! If you are in Montreal and you want to experience a unique style of sushi....this is the place!!! So much flavor on each sushi that is just amazing!! Ill travel to Montreal any time just to go to this place!! Hands down!!!.....ohh...and is all VEGAN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Such good sushi! The best place I've tried in Montreal. If you're dubious about it being vegan, don't worry- it's not just avocado rolls. If anything, the lack of fish forces them to be more creative, and their rolls have amazing unique flavor profiles. My advice is to get the chef's choice if you don't mind the price, as it will provide a range of different types of sushi. Otherwise do your best to order a variety- you'll be surprised at which ones end up being your favorites! 

Do be careful about the timing though- at a normal dinner time there is usually a wait, and their opening hours are a bit weird, so making a reservation might be a good call."}
{"text":"The best sushi I've had outside of Vancouver. I took my girlfriend here on a date, and every dish we had was simply delicious. Highly recommend the Arc de Triomphe if you're a fan of salmon and red tuna."}
{"text":"There are so many corner sushi place in Montreal. I'm talking about the ones where you order quickly mostly for take away and the roles mostly are the same among them. But Momo Sushi is one different place. The roles are refreshing choices and actually taste different than any sushi place I tried in Montreal. I tried the tastinh menu for 2 people and it was worth it and all roles are sooo delicious. Definitely one of my favorite sushi and will make a come back again."}
{"text":"This new sushi place is quite good particularly if you enjoy fusion rolls - which I'm not a fan of myself. However instead of completely not enjoying myself, I was happy and pleased with my order. My usual reaction to creative/fusion rolls is disappointment, so a pleasant surprise.

Really cozy and warm restaurant too, with very nice folks staffing the place."}
{"text":"The food was really good and cool homey ambience. Would have gave another star but like  other people are saying, the server wasn't very personable. The service wasn't bad, she just had a attitude like she didn't want people bugging her. I will go again but hope for a different server. The mint ice cream was really nice."}
{"text":"As soon as I entered the restaurant, the waitress was very unwelcoming and arrogant. I had heard from my friends that the food was amazing, but that some staff members seemed to hate their job. I decided to still go, since my sister is vegan and she really wanted to try it out. The waitress was complaining about us in Spanish; I guess she did not realize that the people I went with understood the language. I thought it was extremely unprofessional. Although their food is good, I would recommend ordering food to go if you do want to try it out."}
{"text":"Very fun, unique experience having all vegan \"sushi\"! Ordered a smorgasbord of dishes: seaweed salad, steamed pot stickers, spicy beet roll, jalapeño roll, \"shrimp\" roll made with tofu, dynamite roll, tour Eiffel roll, and I'm sure there was more I can't remember the name of! Some of these rolls packed a punch of heat and all were flavorful and tasty. There was fruit (jackfruit and mango) in some rolls, which I found original and delicious. Very impressed by the creativity in creating these rolls. Only setbacks: small, somewhat cramped space and at first our service was slow, but once we ordered, food came quickly. Good, adventurous spot for vegans and foodies."}
{"text":"Moi qui ne suit pas Vegan, j'ai été tentée d'essayer ce resto tout-de-même, ayant lu de bonnes critiques à son sujet! Et je n'ai pas été déçue. J'affirme sans regret que ce sont les meilleurs sushis que j'ai mangés de ma vie! Pas besoin de poisson pour avoir du goût! L'endroit est sympathique, la serveuse géniale (elle prend le temps de nous décrire chacune des sortes de sushis que nous avons dans notre spécial du chef et de nous apporter de l'eau aussitôt que notre bouteille est vide. Excellent service. Amateurs de viande, détrompez-vous, il se peut que vous soyez tout aussi charmés que moi! **Le sushi spécial Momo est absolument divin!"}
{"text":"What's a pregnant lady to do, craving sushi but knowing there are certain risks in indulging in raw seafood and not really wanting to take those risks?  She heads to a place she knows will be able to whip up more than just a few a california and plain avocado rolls for her!

Sushi MoMo was pretty darn good.  Not my most favorite of all time sushi restaurant, but definitely of high quality and delicious, and I won't hesitate to pop in while in the area.  They have both a vegan and a standard menu, and the standard menu has a sub section of vegetarian rolls, so you know you can bring just about anyone here who is craving sushi and have them find multiple choices of rolls to order.

Something I was particularly impressed by was that they have a bunch of rolls that involve fruits . . . and fish (including tempura goodies!).  So not dessert sushi, but not your standard rolls either.   We were really happy we ordered the table d'hote menu, because we probably wouldn't have otherwise chosen one of these rolls.  Speaking of the table d'hote, it's a lot of food!  Unless you have a HUGE appetite, you will leave satisfied and full.

The space itself is tiny and welcoming.  It's more of a \"pop in a with a friend\" kind of place than a \"bring the gang\" kind of place."}
{"text":"We had an incredible meal here. We got there late, and they definitely had a moment of indecision about if the kitchen could still serve us, but once they sat us, they are so polite and kind. The waitress explained many things and took her time telling us the history of the restaurant and answering our questions. She was very curious about our reactions to various rolls and attentive. We got the special menu for 2. I can't choose a favorite roll, because they were each amazing and fantastic. As a vegan, I'm used to the same rotation of available sushi rolls. This was such a pleasure. The mixture of Mexican and Japanese flavors was really unique. The only thing that didn't wow me were the gyoza. The dipping sauce, yes, but they were just average. Everything else was beyond excellent! We cannot wait to come back again and again. YUM."}
{"text":"C'est le combo pour deux. Avec la miso soupe et les rouleaux impériaux. Mais on a mangé trop vite, oublié à prendre les photos! C'était bon!"}
{"text":"I think that this is my new favorite sushi place in Montreal....

I've been to Momo three times now over the course of about 9 months and every single time I've been, the sushi has been phenomenal.

The restaurant itself is not ideal because it is extremely tight and so you don't get the most comfortable seating out of it (there are only 3-4 tables). However, because the sushi is so good, I'm willing to ignore that.

Let me start by saying that this is not an AYCE place which of course turns some people off sometimes. However, after managing to bring a few sushi lovers to this little gem yesterday, I'm happy to report that they are now on the same page and clearly see that (a) you don't need an AYCE to get full and (b) just because it's not AYCE doesn't mean that you'll break the bank.

Every single roll here is made with love - you can see it..you can feel it..and you can absolutely taste it. Top ingredients and generosity are key words I think of. You'll definitely not find rolls jam packed with rice and and lacking much substance in the middle. If anything, it's quite the opposite here.

The avocado rolls are amazing..kamikaze out of this world..mango salmon phenomenal..and I could go on and on.

Do yourself a favor and head on over here. We've always had the table d'hote which ends up being more than enough food. I can't wait to go back..if I can find a table! :)"}
{"text":"Yummy !

Un excellent restaurant de sushis végétaliens qui ravira aussi bien les végétaliens accomplis que les non végétaliens. J'y suis allée avec une amie, nous avons partagé et testé le menu à partager à 2. Un très bon choix pour découvrir se restaurant et ses spécialités.
Je vous recommande fortement de vous laisser tenter par ce restaurant atypique. 

Amazing vegan sushis, you will enjoy it even if you are not vegan. I tried the sharing menu with a friend. It was amazing. It is a great choice to try the specialities.
I highly recommend you to try this place, you will enjoy it !"}
{"text":"Pour les personnes qui décident de devenir végétaliennes, les restaurants à sushi proposent habituellement des choix classiques avec avocat, concombres, .. bref ça peut être très bon mais ça ne fait pas rêver. 
Chez Sushi momo, on nous sort le grand jeu. Les saveurs sont associées originalement et chaque bouchée est une nouvelle découverte de plaisir. 
Même un mangeur de poisson pourra être convaincu! Je vous l'assure. 
Le service est de plus exemplaire."}
{"text":"I expected it to be good, but it still surprised me. My friend and I ordered the omakase for 2. Everything was delicate and perfect. I can't believe everything was vegan. I will definitely come next time to try some a la carte sushi. They seemed pretty good as well. The selection was huge. There were a lot to choose from. The sushi had layers in their flavor. Some are textured, some are spicy and some are just simply amazing. Would recommend to every person around me."}
{"text":"When we're talking favourite vegan restaurants of all time this is definitely in the running. Everything about this establishment is 5 stars. The very friendly and helpful staff, the environment, the drink selections all add to some of the best foods your mouth will have the pleasure of tasting. If you are in Montréal and are looking for either a great vegan or sushi experience that is as unique as it is delicious then Sushi Momo is a must."}
{"text":"I love this sushi, the ice cream and the salad with mango and papaya. It's all so perfect and yummy! Their sushi is very special because it's so light and flavorful. I just had the whole  table d'hote by myself ( I was really hungry, because you can easily share it with another person) and I highly recommend it. I also recommend the green tea moshi ice cream--it's amazing. The service is very good too, everybody is very warm."}
{"text":"Sushi Momo is an excellent vegan sushi restaurant. Don't be fooled however; the sushi is incredible and any food-loving person will enjoy their selections, vegan or not. 

My girlfriend and I arrived around 6:30 pm, and there were some tables left. We made a reservation, but the waiter said that it wasn't on his list. Regardless, he found us a table for two near the back of the restaurant.

The restaurant has a nice ambiance; the lighting is soft and it wasn't too loud. Most of the tables are small, which lends itself to a more intimate atmosphere. 

The service was great. The waiter explained the menu to us, and was pretty attentive. This was my first vegan sushi experience, and I loved it. We ordered 4 rolls from their recommended selections, and they were all exceptional. The menu was pretty creative, so this is a great restaurant if you're feeling a little adventurous. 

I highly recommend Sushi Momo! Vegan or not, it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Two vegan travelers, having visited MANY times to Montreal (at least once per year for the past 17 years) agree: YOU CANNOT MISS SUSHI MOMO!!!!

Went here on a Sunday at about 4:00. We did not have reservations, but were able to get a table. The space is nothing too special, nice to see the stone walls of the basement exposed, but they seem to make the best use of a small space.

We ordered six \"rolls\" and two of the special entrees - one was also a roll, and one was the poutine.

I am not going to describe each roll or even recommend one over the other. It would be impossible! All of the flavors are unique and just beyond words. I don't remember having anything similar, even when I wasn't vegan. Even the poutine was nothing like what we expected. Whether you like sushi or not, I would argue it is worth trying as it is truly a unique culinary experience. 

So, why a four star instead of five? Although the rolls came out really fast, within about 10 mins, they forgot to put in the order for the specials and had to be reminded. Also the server came off a bit unfriendly, and they would not make change for the parking meter. Lastly, and perhaps the most odd - you cannot buy red wine by the glass! Yep, read it again, even though they have plenty of red wine, a full bar, and you can get white wine by the glass- not red wine. I can understand that perhaps red wine is not the best pairing for sushi (and I am not sure this is even the reason or if they just want to push selling bottles), however some people do prefer to drink red wine. To not even have one red wine by the glass just doesn't make sense to me."}
{"text":"When I walked in, they asked me if I had a reservation and because I didn't have one, I was seated in the small area by the window. Other customers who came in were in the same situation. I believe they keep the main room for customers with reservation. 

This is a place for vegan who loves sushi. From 3pm to 5pm, they have \"Early Bird\" specials which are worthy for those who prefers to dine early. The Jackfruit gunkan was spicy delicious, the toppings looked like salmon even though everything is vegan. I also liked the Momo wrapped in Japanese oba leaf. The herb gives a beautiful aroma to the roll."}
{"text":"It was a sunny afternoon when we sat down at a lazy Starbucks and looked for a new sushi location around the area, then we figured to give the new Sushi Momo a try. The food was prepared at a reasonable time and despite the above average price, is a huge step above what you might expect from such a tiny storefront. Beef enoki mushroom is expertly prepared and the creative rolls hits the right balance between flavour and portion. We went back a few more times after and the quality is amazingly consistent with attentive staff and friendly atmosphere, and of course, the excellent food with fresh sashimi and \"just right\" preparation of other cooked dishes such as the aforementioned enoki rolls, noodles, rolls, and hot plates. Don't let the unassuming appearance fool you, this is definitely one of the best in the area!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service.  Even before ordering the waitress provided us with miso soup.
The food is quite good, with large portions, very tasty.

The only reason this restaurant doesn't get 5 stars is the price for dinner.  Anywhere from about 15 dollars - 23 dollars for entrees
It's a few dollars more than other Korean-run Japanese restaurants, and apart from the free miso soup and salad (which most people would have received anyway with their meals), there were no freebees, which sometimes Korean restos give.

But for a more upscale experience, I'd recommend visiting this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend who's not vegan and we both loved the explosive flavours and the originality of each dish. Bravo!!! (finally vegan sushi that taste better than fish sushi, thought this day will never come!)"}
{"text":"The thing about momo is their sushi is stellar. As a vegan, I crave it ALL the time. I love the plain avocado sushi because unlike other sushi places, they put spicy mayo in it. I also love the edamame and the spring rolls.

Everyone I've brought to sushi momo has had the same opinion - it's delicious. 

Last time we visited, however, there was an awkward situation with the staff. We were a party of 6, and some people were new and had never tasted anything on the menu before. 

We were advised that as a party of 6 we had no choice but to order from their version of a \"table d'hote\", essentially choosing a starter, enjoying a choix-de-chef mix of different kinds of sushi, and then I think there was also a dessert. 

I understand that this policy is put in place to make it easier for the chefs to put out the food in a shorter amount of time... but considering the fact that I am a picky eater and that some of my friends hadn't had the chance to try anything yet, we kind of just wanted to order our own individual sushi. 

I asked the waitress if we could do that even though we were a large party and she said no. Again, I understand why the policy is in place but I figured given our reasoning + the fact that I've become a semi-regular customer, that they might just let us order what we wanted. I even communicated that we didn't mind if it took a while to get everything out... We didn't care about the wait, we just wanted to sit down, hang out, and eat the sushi of our choice. 

We ended up having to split up at 2 different tables just for the sake of not being a group of 6. I think it's safe to say that the foot of empty space between us did not make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things. 

I was very grateful that we found a way for us to order our own things, but I still felt uncomfortable the entire time because I could tell the staff was annoyed at us. 

I understand what it's like to have fussy customers as I've been a waitress for 6 years so I didn't say anything and I was trying very hard to be upbeat and peppy. I know some of my party was a little less friendly. 

If the owners / staff at sushi momo happen to check the reviews and see this one, I hope that they consider changing their policy to accommodate the customers. My party was so annoyed that they wanted to leave but I convinced them to stay. That could have easily been a loss of 6 customers in under two minutes. 

In terms of just the food though - 5 stars."}
{"text":"The sushi here is super delicious. It's pricey, but I'd go there again because of how good it was. The server was really nice too. I'm giving this place three stars because of the owner - there's not much inside seating, so we decided to eat at their table outside rather than at the bar. The waitress told us that would have to be a to go order, which was okay with us, especially since she was happy to give us water (again, really nice). But when we asked for a couple of extras soy sauces, the owner made her charge us 50 cents a piece, which felt pretty stingy, given that we'd spent $35 on sushi. Also, each table inside had an entire bottle of it, so it kind of felt like we were being punished for sitting outside. Anyway, overall a nice place, but that left kind of a bad taste in our mouths, despite the super tasty sushi."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place blew away the expectations of all three of us (a vegan, vegetarian and sushi-loving meat eater). The food was incredibly, amazingly delicious, and the atmosphere, presentation and service matched. Highly, highly recommend the combo with all the things: miso soup, edamame, spring rolls and a million pieces of surpassingly fabulous sushi. I freaked out a little that one type was topped by slivers of something that looked just like raw fish-- but the (perfect) waiter explained that it was a red bell pepper. The meal ended with a small scoop of coconut ice cream from our good ol' Pacific Northwest."}
{"text":"This review is for the service alone, as I did not get the opportunity to dine there (as I will describe further). I was traveling for a number of days in Montreal, one of those being my birthday. The friend who was traveling with me left earlier in the day but I still wanted to treat myself to a nice meal. I had heard amazing things about this place and am always excited to try new, interesting vegan cuisine, as I do not eat meat. I walk in and the place is packed, as expected. The waiter overlooks me and addresses the two men behind me. When I'm finally addressed, I ask for a table/seat for one and that I am willing to wait. He says that a seat for me at the sushi bar will be \"at least an hour and a half\". He goes to seat those two guys that came in after me at the next open table. He speaks to a co-worker after that and comes back to me with \"sorry, we don't have tables for one\". No wait time estimate....nothing. They simply were just not going to seat me at all and I had no choice in the matter. I've never experienced that level of rudeness before when dining out. So I left and went next door to a lovely tapas restaurant that welcomed me with open arms."}
{"text":"I'm so annoyed this place closed down. The food was excellent. I hope the owners open somewhere else."}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi. Can stand toe to toe with any sushi, vegan or not. Brought family members that have not had sushi nor are vegan and they raved about the flavours, variety and freshness. We had the four person set menu and enjoyed a variety of the rolls. It was impossible to pick a favourite but the Geisha came out on top. Will be back again."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine recommended Sushi Momo, and I remember being very skeptical about the \"vegan sushi\" concept. Honestly, I was expecting cucumber and avocado rolls. Maybe some pickled radish. For me, sushi wasn't sushi without fish. It was nonsensical, like grilled cheese without cheese.  

Well, Sushi Momo exceeded all my expectations. The staff was wonderful: our waitress took the time to go through the menu with us, and answered all our questions. For our first visit, we went with her recommendation: the omakase for 2, which includes miso soup, dumplings, 25 pieces of vegan sushi and a dessert. 

The miso soup was one of the best I've had in my life. Full of flavor, not too salty, with just the right amount of tofu pieces and enoki mushroom. Dumplings were good: they had a nice crunchy exterior and a hearty filling.
Now the sushi:
My first bite of the Geisha roll was an explosion of flavors. The texture of the rice and avocado, coupled with the crunch of the pickled veggies, the sweetness of the sweet potato, and the sauce, which really tied everything together. 
The other pieces would all have their distinguishable features: the tartness of the mango, the spiciness of jalapeno peppers balanced out by sweet potato, the unique unami flavors of pickled japanese vegetables and seaweed, the hearty feel of portobello mushrooms... And everything tasted so fresh!
The dessert was a rich coconut ice cream (wished the portion was bigger... it was so good!) 

All in all, I was blown away. Fish or no fish, I think this is one of the best sushi restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"My sister lived in the Plateau area and wanted to go for lunch today. We've heard some good things about the restaurant, so why not try it out? 

Good : The food is decent quality and the portions are worth the money. It's a small but charming space on Duluth. We came by around 12pm on a Wednesday so we didn't have to wait to be seated. The food came pretty quick, but the service can use some improvement.

Bad : The service left a sour taste for me at the very beginning, to be honest. I've asked if my plate of rice can be replaced with a salad instead, and I was immediately greeted with a cold attitude and snarky remark \"uh, it's a sushi restaurant.\" They were not flexible with accommodating their patrons? I wasn't asking for truffle oil and milet mignon to substitute, it's a friggin salad. The seats against the wall are extremely uncomfortable. If you're a bigger person, avoid the benches at all costs. It's very close to the other tables, which I've only noticed when another table was seated next to us. 

Bottom Line : the food was enjoyable, but service was not."}
{"text":"This place is alright - they have managed to prove that you can have a perfectly nice sushi meal without fish. The place is cool (meaning they have a/c) and the staff is really friendly too.  I mean they sure do mean well, but also kinda annoying - when a waitress came to see if we needed help and I commented that the menu (typed in a tiny font) was hard to read, and she offered an English menu. Now this sounds perfectly reasonable, but I had no problem with the French (most of it is Japanese names of ingredients anyhow)... I needed a magnifying glass and a flashlight!  What were they thinking printing out menus in font size 4 and dimming out the lights? (is it possible I am the first to complain? unlikely). She then made an assumption that this is the first time we are having vegetarian sushi (wrong!) and tried to pedal a tasting menu for two \"so we can try different things and get a feel for what vegetarian sushi is\"...
My vegetarian partner (and the main reason I wanted to try this place) was overwhelmed by the vegetarian variety, but didn't really like any of the four rolls we tried. I actually found them fine, but far from mind blowing. It took half an hour to make the first two out of the four rolls, and the other two came about 15 minutes later. Again they assumed that we were sharing (which we were, but they couldn't have know that!). On the upside, they brought out some Edamame while we waited for the first batch, and didn't charge for it. The waitress, however, took forever bringing the check. 
Also, waiters kept bumping into my partner's chair (we were siting at a low table opposite from the bar - don't seat there!)
Bottom line - three stars is really the maximum I can do here. It's expensive for what it is. Don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best vegan sushi places! I've had a pretty mediocre experience with the staff back at the Duluth location, but I decided to give the new spot a chance since I honestly did enjoy the food. I brought my boyfriend here to try the vegan sushi (much to his dismay).

Good: The service has since improved, or maybe they've finally took note on people's feedback at the older location. Our waitress was friendly and seated us right away and explained the menu to us. Don't come here thinking you're eating vegan food that's light and diet friendly. A lot of the rolls are drenched in rich sauces/mayo-esque  (but it's so tasty!) that you almost forgot it's vegan sushi. The rolls are well made and the presentation is on par with mid range sushi restaurants. Even my boyfriend was impressed, as he said it was probably his favourite vegan place in Montreal.

Bad: Nadda

Bottom Line: Yes, definitely check it out even if you're not a vegan. The food has really amazing sauces that pack really good flavours. One of my favourite sushi spots now!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is the BOMB (dot) com. I've been here a bunch of times both before and after they went totally vegan. Now as a vegan establishment, they've become one of my number one places to recommend people to ask for great veg options. The flavour profiles are full bodied -- salty, sweet, umami, acidic, fatty -- they really illustrate how great vegan cuisine can be. If you are interested in seeing more of my veg recommendations check out my blog mtlveg.com"}
{"text":"I had an excellent meal here. My dinner companion is Vegan and had a complete menu, as large as the regular menu to choose from! 

Every bite I ate was nicely seasoned, balanced and prepared with care. 

The speed of service was excellent, there are few seats but have a booming take-away business. 

This is an excellent place to have a delicious meal that will please both the vegetarians and the un-vegetarians in your party."}
{"text":"I am under the strong impression that the waiter last friday must have been a hired saboteur by some rival sushi joint. By all measures the worst n00b at waiting I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends and had a great time! I recommend making reservations seeing as the place is tiny. I only ate from the vegan menu but my friends had fish as well and we were all impressed! The presentation is beautiful and the flavours are unique. The volcan was especially delicious - the tofu, avocado, asparagus tempura, cucumber, and panko zuccini formed a rich, creamy and sweet blend that was unlike any vegan sushi I've ever had. The kamikaze was also delicious, although it's described as having a spicy sauce which I didn't notice. The reason this is a 4 rather than 5 star rating is because of the service. The waitress was unable to answer any questions we had about the menu, couldn't identify the rolls she was bringing to the table (we wanted to be able to discern the vegan from the fish), and forgot to bring us the soy sauce, wasabi and ginger. We waited a while thinking she would eventually bring it but finally had to ask. Also, a waiter tried to take our unfinished dishes away without asking if we were done. (We weren't, and went on to order dessert.) All in all I would definitely recommend this place for the delicious food and dessert. I just hope they improve their service because it made the experienced more confusing and awkward than it needed to be."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Food is so nicely prepared, full of flavor, it doesn't feel like we're missing out on meat or fish at all. On top of it, great service and cute cozy place. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"WOOHOO !!!
qui veut des sushis fondants ? qui veut des sushis originaux ? qui veut de cuit ? qui veut du cru ? qui veut de la mayo épicée ? qui veut un super plateau ?

Si tu as dit oui à tout ça, cherche plus, c'est LA ! Je peux pas tant décrire que ça, le mieux c'est de les gouter. Mais franchement, le sushi como double 33mcx \"traditionnels\" (= pas végan mais rien de très classique pour autant !)... une tuerie ! 
Et nous n'avons pas eu les mêmes morceaux cette fois ci que la semaine dernière. Oui, une bonne découverte, on y revient !!"}
{"text":"Yes, the sushi IS creative and delicious but the flavour intensity becomes a bit much after awhile.  They rely heavily on amazing house-made sauces to pull this off (kudos!) but the chef has no sense of restraint.  It's like the flavour volume is up on full-blast and there's no escaping it. One exception is the cool and mild avocado roll; it's a breath of fresh air in what is otherwise an assault by a salty-sweet-umami tsunami."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to the restaurant for their lunch menu, which included a nice variety of choices (with vegan options!) at a reasonable price (10-15$/dish). We went around noon so we were the first customer for lunch. My girlfriend requested for a rice-free option for one of the dishes as she is gluten intolerant but the server was quick to reply that no other replacements of the rice was possible and she was quite rude about it as well. I had the traditional bento box which included a small portion of tempura, chicken saute, a 5 piece roll of maki, a seaweed salad and a miso soup, which were all very satisfying. Other than the server, service was quick and food arrived fast since we were the only customers."}
{"text":"Wow, les meilleurs sushis de ma vie!

Je le recommande fortement même pour les non végétaliens. J'y suis allée avec mon copain et nous avons pris le menu dégustation. C'était parfait! Très bon choix du Chef, quantité parfaite et le décor très bien. Même la playlist \"oldies\" nous rendait heureux. 
Nous ne savons pas pourquoi nous irions dans un autre sushi shop maintenant que nous avons goûté à ces merveilles. J'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner et j'aimerais que tout le monde que j'aime y ailler pour vivre ce moment fabuleux."}
{"text":"Came here as a large group (of 12 people) and they have a pretty nice group menu. Each person had a choice of one appetizer, a starter shared amongst two people, a sushi platter with your choice of number of pieces for each person, and a dessert. They also gave a discount on drinks as a group so we got a sake.
First of all, the miso soup was incredibly salty. The sushi itself were various rolls of vegan fillings, there were a curry one and barbeque one that really threw you off. The flavours were super fun and inventive. Also, the vegan ice cream was AMAZING. 
The atmosphere is pretty small and service was slow, but it's good to chill out anyways.
My concern was how pricy the meal turned out to be. Regular sushi itself is pricy due to the expensive fresh sushi grade raw fish. But for something like this, I don't think the value was there. 
Nonetheless, this is a good restaurant if you want to try something cool."}
{"text":"Died and went to sushi heaven. Best sushi in Montreal hands down. The prices are extremely reasonable. The place is adorable and the staff is friendly. It was a bit of a wait to get our food but SO worth it. I can't believe I have been eating sushi elsewhere. The 911 is a must if you are a fan of spice! Make sure you make a reservation before. And try to dress warm. When the door opens it chills the whole place"}
{"text":"I tried the traditional lunch box with sushi, salad and miso soup. The sushi with salmon and shrimp was freshly made and the rice was so soft and well compressed that it melt in my mouth. The ingredients were fresh and mixed in the right way to create a balanced flavour. The salad with mango pieces, blueberry, strawberry and many other ingredients was a lovely healthy side dish. I highly recommend their lunch box and will try other items for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Hands down, the sushi here is amazing. My friend and I love the Mumbai because of its fun curry flavor but other menus are unique and creative. I'm not a vegan but I would enjoy their food any time.

However, this is not the place for you if you want authentic sushi. The atmosphere, set up and crowd are all for trendy&vegan vibes and far from the traditional idea of sushi. It is fun in its own way and I love it but it's something to beware of.

Also, our food came 1h after ordering, which is why I'm giving them a 4 star. They could really use more kitchen staff or more efficient way of serving their food."}
{"text":"Une. Claque. De. Bonheur.

Arrivé dans le restaurant assez sceptique sur des sushis végétaliens j'en suis ressortis conquis !

On s'est laissé guidé par le menu à partager à 2 qui comprend 
- soit soupe miso soit salade (magnifique vinaigrette au gingembre)
- soit rouleaux impériaux soit dumpling
- assortiment de 26 morceaux de maki
- une glace ;a la noix de coco
Parfaite portion pour 2 et surtout quel gout. Dammit j'y repense encore avec nostalgie :)
Les entrées sont vraiment bonnes mais surtout les makis ...
Tous les makis sont plus bons les uns que les autres, c'est très bien pensé et travaillé les arrangements de goûts. J'aime bien les sushis mais là j'ai adoré tout simplement.
Pour l'instant ils sont au top de ma liste de sushis sur Montréal et en plus c'est végane. 
Afin de conclure cela on te ramène une glace à base de noix de coco, ça a du gout, c'Est frais, ca finis parfaitement ton repas.
Mission accomplis Momo et haut la main !

En conclusion Ici tu auras du respect pour les animaux, pour ta santé, pour tes papilles.
La maison du bonheur ? Tu peux aussi appeler ça Sushi Momo mis c'est toi qui vois;)"}
{"text":"Excellent quality and very innovative. I have been to Sushi Momo at least half a dozen times now and always love it. I am not vegan but only order off the vegan menu as it's a more exciting menu. Super tasty and run by really friendly people!"}
{"text":"Végétarienne stricte depuis 1 an et demi, à forte tendance végétalienne/végane et en grande amatrice de sushis, il était absolument inconcevable pour moi de ne pas tester Sushi Momo. Même si je n'ai jamais réussi à avoir une place, nous avons, mon cher et tendre et moi, déjà commandé à emporter à 2 reprises. Les prix, par rapport à la qualité des produits me semblent tout à fait raisonnables, on a à chaque fois choisi les formules \"basic\". Leur soupe miso est vraiment excellente, pareil pour la plupart des sushis proposés (au choix du chef). Les 2 fois on a eu des saveurs totalement différentes et c'est ca qui est fun. Si vous êtes véganes et que les sushis vous manquent, il s'agit d'une excellente alternative. On est parfois bluffés par la ressemblance de texture avec des sushis traditionnels."}
{"text":"Add me to the chorus, I loved my first visit to Sushi Momo! This is vegan sushi that any food-loving, adventurous friend will enjoy. (We were a group of non-vegans, everyone dug it.) Just try a bunch of stuff. Go on a trip. You'll like some things better than others but honestly, it's all good. 

If you're in a group like we were I think the chef's choice sharing menu is perfect. We had almost a dozen different rolls so I felt like we got a great introduction to what vegan sushi can be. We shared a lovely bottle of wine which the host discounted for us on the spot for some reason, and our service came with vegan jasmine ice cream as well. A simple lovely closer. 

In summer I would sit where we were again, up in the small raised area by the door. In colder seasons I'd love to tuck down into the warmer, cozy area by the bar to watch the magic happen. Look forward to coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! At their old location they used to offer fish sushi too but have now switched to totally vegan. The delicious vegan sushi creations are genius- each bite is a taste explosion in your mouth! The dumplings and miso soup are also fantastic. This is world-class food at exceptionally reasonable prices. Each dish looks like a little work of art. Currently my favourite restaurant in Montreal. Good location, cute place, friendly staff.

I went here with my husband for our anniversary and the chef prepared a feast of special dishes that weren't even on the menu. Check out my photos- they taste as good as they look! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"The vegetarian selection is impressive (30+), and very delicious. Every plate that we ordered was a 5/5. This is not your typical avocado cucumber sushi type of place, the chef has mastered how to blend different flavours with veggies, tofu, and soy. For the fish lovers, don't worry there is menu with classic sushi. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I went to Sushi MoMo last night with my boyfriend and our vegan friends. It was the perfect place to go with plenty of options for them, and a wide selection of our favourite traditional sushi. We arrived around 6pm and immediately got a table, despite the place being quite small. The staff was incredibly friendly and we ordered quite a lot of sushi from both the vegan and regular menu. The sushi they offered was quite unique- some choices had green apple, sweet potato, and basil- ingredients I haven't seen in sushi before. I would have enjoyed a miso soup too- but maybe they'll add that to the menu later. 

I can't remember exactly what I ordered but it was delicious. My favourite dish was a red tuna and mango based creation. My boyfriend ordered the majority of the salmon based dishes and was very satisfied with the quality of the fish as well.

My only complaint was that service was rather slow- we received the first round of sushi relatively quickly (about 20 minutes after ordering), but after that there was a long wait between each order and it took almost 2 hours to be served our complete order. The restaurant only opened a week ago, so I think the staff is still figuring out the logistics. That being said, it seems quite understaffed and the couple behind us waited almost 45 minutes to get their first rolls. I hope they improve the speed of service soon, because I'd like to come back.

Also, I heard they will have delivery starting next week- so looking forward to that!"}
{"text":"This sushi was great quality, with many options and creative rolls for anyone! All the sushi is meat free but even my non vegan friend was satisfied. You can get mock meats or stick with vegetable rolls. I recommend the chefs choice, as you get a 5 course tasting for a great deal! This was a truly amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Took my vegetarian partner here for a birthday dinner. I have celiac and ordered off the gluten-free menu (tip: the miso soup isn't listed on the GF menu, but the server told me it was gluten-free), and my date ordered off the regular (vegetarian/vegan) menu.

Meal was good - much more flavorful than I expected. Sleeper hit was the (gluten-free) asparagus roll -- asparagus and \"crispy,\" topped with spicy mayo. Pleasantly simple, good textural contrasts. The (gluten-free) 911 roll was nice: spicy/lemony tofu. The gf kamakaze roll would have been great if the avocado was ripe -- but it was hard!!  Date had the deep-fried dumplings, said they were bland. Miso soup was good, nothing special.

Decent sake/beer list. Service was a little clumsy, but well-intentioned.

2 appetizers + 4 futomaki rolls + 1 hosomaki roll was enough that we were both stuffed at the end of the meal.  With a bottle of sake, the bill came out to about $65.

Definitely a place to try at least once. I'd go back with vegetarian friends; not sure that I'd go back with other meat/fish eaters."}
{"text":"RESTAURANT IS CURRENTLY CLOSED!!!! Have been trying to call to place take-out orders the past 2 weekends with no answer. Just figured they were busy. Actually drove by today and the restaurant is closed with a letter posted on their door saying they defaulted on their rent payment..."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! The fact that they have a separate vegan menu is a huge selling factor to me. The only thing I didn't realize was how small the avocado rolls would be.  But the extremely low price should have tipped me off.  Super yum!"}
{"text":"WOW!! Not what I was expecting, and such a great surprise and tasty adventure. Some of the best sushi I've had anywhere (Mtl, NY, LA, Osaka).  Yum! Give it a go!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi!! 

You would not know this was vegan, it just tastes spectacular, the only complaint, as trivial as it sounds is the lack of wasabi.....see, not really a massive issue, just my personal taste.....delicious, delicious, delicious I cannot recommend it more highly, even though I'd rather no more people know about it, were leaving Montreal - so it'll be fine ;) 

Hoping for one last visit!"}
{"text":"Délicieux, tout petit et chaleureux. Une façon de redécouvrir le sushi. Chaque bouchée est une explosion de saveurs et de couleurs. Service très sympathique. Mais réservez avant d'y aller, Ca se rempli très vite!!! Le meilleur 25$ investi en sushi!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite vegan place in Montreal! Amazing sushi!! Very accommodating specially a girl named ALEJANDRA (I don't eat spicy food and she always makes some changes for me) she's always ready to help! 

I don't like that when you are more than 6 they force you to order \"a boat\" shared by everybody. Very disappointing...specially when you don't want the chef to order for you..."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place from many people and it was always super positive, so decided to give it a try 

The place itself is small-ish, cute and cozy. We reserved in advance and was not informed that at a certain time we would have to leave. At the end of our meal, we paid and were still chitchatting and was told politely that we had to leave because other ppl were waiting for the table. Oh well! As long as they were polite I guess?

The service was pretty good. Our waiter was attentive and very nice.

The menu was very creative. As I'm not someone who eats a lot of rolls because I get full too fast and neither is my friend so we didn't order a ton of things but everything was very good. Pan fried jackfuit, crispy asparagus, mushrooms, yuzu sauce, you name it, the combos of flavors are pretty cool :)

That said, since everything was rolled with rice, I'm not sure I'd come back but I'd definitely recommend it ^^"}
{"text":"The best vegan sushi restaurant i've ever tried.
The choice is wide.
I suggest the deal for 4 people.
Very tasty, you don't even need to add soy sauce.
When the platters arrive it is so nice to see and everything is so so so good !!!"}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant so many times. I know a lot of people cannot picture eating vegetarian sushi. You know what! You are right! You shouldn't unless you come here. This place serve you piece of art that you can enjoy so much. If you have never been, I say give it a try, I don't think you will regret it"}
{"text":"Needed reservation!!! Had several open tables but was not willing to sit us no matter what we said... host had an attitude..."}
{"text":"Je ne vais pas y aller par quatre chemins: Sushi Momo offre les meilleurs sushis ever.
Sans poisson ni produit d'originale animale quelconque, le menu propose une multitude de sushis créatifs et insolites. On est très loin des sushis végétariens basiques à l'avocat ou au concombre. La majorité des confections, comme La Vie en Rose (à la betterave poêlée), sortent de l'ordinaire. D'ailleurs, dans ce cas-ci, les sushis arrivent même dans un verre à martini décoré d'une fleur!
Quels que soient vos goûts, vous trouverez de quoi vous plaire: du frais et rafraîchissant, de l'épicé, du citronné, etc. Les ingrédients sont variés (jacquier, jalapeño, échalote, tempura, imitation de crevette, patate douce et bien d'autres!) et, lorsqu'ils sont habilement combinés, résultent en une richesse de saveurs qu'il m'est rarement arrivé de goûter dans des sushis. Le menu comprend aussi d'autres plats, du plus classique (comme la soupe miso) au plus inusité pour un établissement du genre (tartare de betteraves, tartare de champignons et même des pizzas de riz frit). Des desserts sont aussi disponibles et, bien sûr, aucun produit d'origine animale n'est utilisé non plus. Le cheesecake fait maison et la crème glacée végane sont des incontournables. Si vous avez envie d'un verre avec votre repas, la sélection de vins est également impressionnante. Au passage, même s'il est possible de commander à emporter, il faut toutefois noter que certains plats spéciaux (comme une poutine aux champignons) sont uniquement offerts sur place. Des tables d'hôte, que ce soit pour une personne ou à partager à plusieurs, sont aussi offertes. Les prix reflètent la qualité des plats et ne sont pas excessifs mais préparez-vous quand même à une addition salée: c'est très probable que vous dépensiez plus en voulant goûter aux plus de sushis possibles! Au final, cependant, le rapport qualité-prix est raisonnable.
Au-delà de la nourriture, Sushi Momo peut être fier du décor (murs en pierre grise, tables en bois, statues de Bouddha, néons, etc.). L'ambiance est à la fois cozy, intime et branchée. L'endroit est plutôt étroit et bâti en long mais la circulation est fluide et on ne se sent pas serré. La musique, plutôt moderne, est bien choisie et est ni trop basse, ni trop forte. Le restaurant offre donc une expérience complète, qui se tient et satisfait de la nourriture jusqu'à l'espace physique.
Surtout, Sushi Momo me surprend toujours par la qualité de son service. Le personnel est souriant, à l'écoute et connaît les plats de A à Z. Si vous venez pour la première fois, votre serveur saura vous guider dans le menu (un peu complexe et sur lequel vous devez inscrire vos choix au crayon) et s'assurera de trouver de quoi correspondre à vos préférences.
Pensez juste à planifier votre arrivée en avance: le restaurant est très populaire et les soirées du jeudi, du vendredi et du samedi sont toujours bookées au complet (même pas de place au bar). Même un soir de semaine, il est préférable d'appeler avant.
Bref, que vous soyez végane ou pas encore, que vous aimiez le poisson ou non, que vous ne juriez que par les sushis ou non, Sushi Momo est un restaurant incontournable. Hooray pour des sushis réinventés qui ne détruisent pas nos océans!"}
{"text":"I've got to tell you that as a foodie and a vegan this place is the top-of-the-line

You have got to come here. I'm telling you come here now. If you're thinking about coming to this restaurant you must come nowl

Phil was our waiter. He is an amazing person. Cute too!  

We ordered the dinner for four.   Just let the chef make you what he likes. I promise you will be happily surprised

We enjoyed.  
Miso soup.  Dumplings.  Spring rolls. Dino Dino.  The Fuji. Jack fruit wasabi.  Sweet potato jalapeño   The mumbai.    3 champions.  Popeye and mix of Geisha ebi inari."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré ma première expérience chez Sushi Momo.

Au-delà du personnel, qui était très sympathique, la nourriture était tout simplement exceptionnelle (et végane !), en plus d'être offerte à des prix très raisonnables.

À recommander sans hésitation !"}
{"text":"Sushi Momo is my favourite restaurant in Montreal! It used to be located by Duluth and Saint-Laurent, but the location has moved quite a bit farther (just north of rue de Bienville on Saint-Denis), which makes for a nice walk. They used to do delivery as well, but I do not think that's an option anymore. 

With that said, the walk is always worth it because the food is amazing. I honestly can no longer eat sushi anywhere else.  Everything is super fresh and made right in front of you. The menu is now completely vegan, which is awesome. There is also a menu solely containing gluten-free options, which is extremely accommodating for those with allergies. The restaurant itself is a lot bigger at this location, but still nice and clean. I've heard complaints regarding the service, but I've always been treated super well. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone, vegan or not. You won't regret dining here!"}
{"text":"I finally found a decent and affordable sushi spot in montreal!! This place's decor is cute and cozy. The service is amazing. 

You can order their vegan or traditional menu (non-veg option). Their sushi are creative and you can tell they pay attention to every single piece. Highly recommended !! :)"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful treat. Nearly everything we had was exceptionally prepared - gyoza, rolls, mushroom tartare. The only \"miss\" was the poutine - it just didn't meld for me. Lovely service and free wifi as well. Most other sushi will forever pale in comparison."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. We were in Montreal for 4 days and while I found the food to generally be very good, this was by far my favorite restaurant of the entire trip. The waiter was wonderful - somehow managing a ton of tables, and always being there to refill our drinks. The atmosphere was great as well. The absolute best thing about the place, however, was the food itself. This was, without hyperbole, one of the best meals I have ever had. each roll had a particular, complex, and amazing taste to it. I'm usually so disappointed by veggie sushi (usually tastes like a bland salad with rice) that we almost didn't try this place. So glad that I did! 
Side note - my girlfriend is a big meat eater and huge fan of non-vegetarian sushi and even she said this was one of the best sushi meals she's ever had!"}
{"text":"Pretty fresh sashimi. Food came out quick. Waitress is competent. Ordered a 30 piece sashimi combo, plate came out with almost 40."}
{"text":"Belle découverte grâce à \"Yelp suggestions\".

Si vous voulez sortir de votre zone de confort, cette place est sûrement un endroit à expérimenter. Avec un menu vegan très varié, vous allez découvrir de nouvelles saveurs avec des aliments pourtant simples.

Une explosion de saveurs sans viande ni de produit dérivé.

Prix très raisonnable pour cette location et le saké est environ le double du prix à la SAQ."}
{"text":"i walked in, not knowing it's vegan, i am celiac so asked for the gluten free menu and waiter gave me a vegan gluten free menu i said well im celiac not vegetarian! and his like your at the wrong place, i had a real sushi craving that day so was desapointed then i opened my mind and tried recommended rolls they were AMAZING the spicy tofu wow for the other rolls its very dense and consistend since its all carbs(lots of sweet patatoes) and their sauces it show they are very creative and have experiance."}
{"text":"My diet consists of meat and carbs almost exclusively and this place blew my mind. My boyfriend and I accidentally picked a vegan sushi place and we're so glad we stayed. I got the California and the Quebec roll and oh my god. I am speechless. I'll definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Wow les sushis sont suculents j'ai jamais mangé des sushis aussi gouteux et en plus vegan!! C'est génial. Meilleur sushi  Je le conseille fortement par contre réservé d'avance je suis allée un lundi et j'ai eu la chance qu'une réservation cancel, sinon je n'aurais pas pu avoir une table."}
{"text":"Really amazing sushi! My favourite ones were Roru Age, Kara age and California. I'll definetly be going back soon"}
{"text":"Oh man, did I over eat here! I had such a hard te choosing since they had so many delicious looking options and since going vegan it's rare to have so many options at a sushi place. 

To starts the presentation was beautiful. They had beautiful plating that made everything more appetizing. The staff was very friendly and efficient, and knowledgeable about their food.

I ordered this sweet potato tempura with jackfruit on it that was gorgeous as well as delicious. The edemame they provided had a great spice to them that made them unique. The miso soup was amazing and better than most I have eaten, vegan or not. There wasn't one roll I didn't enjoy. The inari was beautiful, the sauces complimented the flavors amazingly, everything was great. Don't go in thinking that this will be a healthy meal, it is not at all in the most glorious way. Go here, it's amazing."}
{"text":"When we (my vegan friend and I) arrived around 6pm, the restaurant was almost empty, but the waiter told us that most tables were reserved, but he was able to find us a table. 

The menu was a little overwhelming, but he told us that if it's our first time we should get the table d'hôte. However, we have both been to a lot of sushi places and we decided to tackle the seemingly complex menu. 

We got the kamasutra (the asparagus was cooked to perfection), the arc-en-ciel (that had a lot of harmony), the Mumbai (tasted a lot of curry, but it was my personal favourite) and the 4 saisons (my least favourite, but still very good. The vegan cream cheese was superb)

We also got the Monsieur croquant (i think it's what it's called. It's a specialty roll). It was nice, but I don't think it was worth the excitement. I didn't like it as much as the 4 aforementioned rolls. The crunchiness on the outside started to become a bit annoying. 

Our waiter was SO NICE! He was really funny and attentive. He gave us recommendations and he checked in. Top notch service. 

I am so happy with this restaurant. Being a big fan of fish and meat, I didn't expect to like vegan food all that much, but I think this restaurant really stepped it up and I didn't miss the fish at all! If anything, I think the lack of meat forced them to compensate by creating amazing flavours. 

I am going back next weekend!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and loved it! I took the lunch special, got 10 maki rolls, 2 nigiri salmon and a nice salad with miso. Everything was fresh and tasty, fast service and a cool vibe. Come try this place you will not be disappointed! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So first off, the table d'hôte here is a great deal and everything is vegan. These are the main reasons I'll inevitably be back for more momo adventures. The service is also great/friendly and their new space does the trick (compared to the zero space they had at their old location).

My main qualm is with the food itself. While the menu is beautiful and clearly well thought-out, my partner and I found that the sushi tasted like a rolled-up health food store (vegans, you know what I'm talking about!). And the entrées were just blah.
If anything, if I could have four courses of their icecream I'd do that over the actual sushi, but that's just me."}
{"text":"This is a vegan sushi restaurant. 
I came here when pregnant to get my sushi fix. 
They put water on the table as soon as you sit down. 
We got the mushroom tartar to start. 
It was incredible! 
We got the mix platter for 2 people which is 25 pieces. You can choose between miso soup or salad to start. I liked the salad better but both are good. You can also choose between dumplings or imperial rolls. Both are fried. We got dumplings so I don't know which is better. 
The sushi rolls were surprisingly really delicious like an explosion of flavor in your mouth! I guess they have to be creative to replace traditional fish. My only complaint is that is was pretty spicy as they put jalapeño peppers in some of the rolls. Next time I will ask without and they can remove it. 
Then we got 2 extra rolls: Kappa portobello and kamikaze inari. 
We finished off with green tea ice cream which is included. 
Awesome restaurant! My hubby enjoyed it too."}
