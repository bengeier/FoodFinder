{"text":"Everything was 5/5 from the service to the food.  Had a four course meal and me and my fiancé can understand why foodies exist.  The tiramasu is to break any diet for. The lamb tenderloin was probably the best that I have had.  Finally Sophia was an amazing server.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"First time review and I'm excited that it's about a fantastic little Italian restaurant that I wouldn't have stumbled upon without a groupon that I purchased.
4 course meal special is an ongoing lunch or dinner special for only $30 regular price. Got it for $28 for 2 with groupon.

Very friendly older gentlemen waiters. Set the ambience for dinner with a small candle. Very fast service.

Started with a warm garlic brushetta with melted cheese and tomatoes. Ordered the escargot in a rich, creamy mushroom sauce that was incredible.

The veal chop was cooked to perfection and the roasted vegetables were delicious. Not sure how they made those roasted red peppers taste that good! Also tried the lamb, which was served in two kebab style pieces, and was just as delicious. I'd go for the veal over the lamb if you want a bigger portion, but both were great choices. Couldn't go wrong with either.

Tiramisu was was a delicious way to top off an incredible meal.

Overall, fantastic food and service. Dinner took us less than 40 mins. I would highly recommend this hidden gem and visit again even without the groupon.

Well done, Volare!"}
{"text":"All meals begin with perfectly toasted bruschetta. Great service and excellent value. Especially like the mushroom salad and veal garga. The tiramisu
Is one the best I ever tasted. The lasagna is very good with an unparalleled depth of sauce. The bolognese sauce is also very good with deep rich flavor.  For Italian in the west end this place is my pick don't waste your time in bloor west or Allegro."}
{"text":"Was mediocre food at best!  All of their business is strictly based on Groupon purchases.  The menu has a good selection of dishes.  However upon receiving your courses you begin to notice that each plate is completely stingy!  

The brushetta:  2 thin slices of baguette  bread toasted  with olive oil and a few cubes of tomato with a sliver of cheese (2 slices) with 2 plain pieces of bread (supposed to be garlic bread) 

The seafood crepe: I read reviews that said no seafood was in the crepe.  I asked the server if it indeed had seafood,  he said yes.  I ordered the crepe.... No Seafood! I mentioned it to the server and he said I'll tell the chef. It came piping hot.  There is no way a crepe can come that hot.  It was microwaved then sauce poured on top.  Strike 2

The lamb tenderloin with Madeira wine sauce : it came with vegetables.  Server offered a substitution,  I opted for the penne pasta with rose sauce.  Server says we give you linguine because it's easier for the chef?  Really!  The lamb was drenched (supposed to be Madeira wine sauce)  tasted and looked like French fry gravy from a food truck!  Or maybe from a club house packet mixed with water.  

My wife had the shrimp and lobster linguine in a rose sauce.  Guess what?  No LOBSTER and 2 tiny shrimp!  Yes 2 wholes pieces of shrimp. Really wow,  stingy again!

Dessert: we opted for the ice cream scoop of tiramisu. It was partially frozen!  If I wanted frozen I'd ask for ice cream. 

I make many italian dishes (from scratch)  at home.  This is yet another poor example of Italian cuisine in the city of Toronto. 

So if you want seafood crepes with no seafood or shrimp and lobster pasta with no lobster and 2 pieces of shrimp and frozen tiramisu, this is as good as it gets! 

Grazie,  chow!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem on the queensway and Royal York. A place that you have to try - 3 thumbs up. The price is affordable, the service is amazing and the flavour is fantastic. Def recommend this place to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and we were quite surprised. The food was excellent and the prices were extremely reasonable. Perfect evening for a date night."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant that seats about 50 people.  There is only one server and it takes some time for him to come up to greet and seat you.  Because there is only one server, there were a lot of empty tables that were not cleared up.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dinner however.  Had the $30.00 fixed price menu, which started off with the bruschetta, which was scrumptious!!!, then the seafood crepe and the veal.  The dishes came out extremely hot and on point.  There was actually no seafood in the crepe, but it was a seafood sauce.  The veal was soft and had a charred taste.  The tiramisu was out of this world!!! My friend had the garden salad with balsamic vinaigrette and it was delicious, followed by the pasta with shrimp and lobster.  The size of the shrimp was great!  However, the pasta seemed to be store bought and ready made.  This is a great place, offering great food.  For the price, it is totally worth it.  I would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Main courses are fantastic, Appetizers are so so. Good service, never too busy. Limited wine list."}
{"text":"Found the restaurant from Groupon, which boasted a 4-course meal for 2. Sorry can't find price paid (maybe max. $60)

Initial impression: small Italian restaurant, just one, much older gentleman server. Asked us to have a seat at a small table for 2, when it was a mostly empty restaurant. So we sat at a slightly larger table by the window. He sat us with the wine menu, but took about 5 minutes to receive the food menu, after he was finished tending to the other 2 tables. 

Atmosphere: Typical Italian music in the background, which later changed to Ricky Martin, then back to the classic Italian hits... UFC fight on TV. 

Service: food came out very quickly. Waiter service was quite unassertive. I don't think he cracked a smile the entire night. He was setting an entire other table, in a basically empty restaurant, while we were finished and waiting to pay and leave 

Food: bruschetta to start (very measly, see photo) - I joked, \"where's the other half? Haha\" and he said \"it is $2.50 another piece if you want\". We also ordered grilled calamari and warm mushroom salad as appetizers. Both were \"okay\" maybe 2.5/5. Main course, we both ordered shrimp and lobster rosé linguine. 2 pieces of shrimp, not sure if there was any lobster involved TBH, must have been the very finely shredded type (yum..). 2.5/5 as well for me. Lemon sorbet dessert was light and refreshing. 

Finale: the bill had a comment, written \"please tip on $85-\" whatever, to ensure we left a proper tip in the end. Very classy... the restaurant had no personal touch and was not enjoyable"}
{"text":"My husband and mother-in-law just got back from dining here and absolutely loved it. The service is absolutely exemplary. I do not remember the last time a waitress was so attentive in addition to a very friendly chef. We each had one of The lunch specials that are very reasonably priced. I do not remember paying only $8.95 for a lunch and having such excellent quality of food and generous portions. I sincerely hope that this restaurant will do very well in this area. I would highly recommend this to anyone. The ambience of the restaurant is also very classy and relaxing. It was such a wonderful lunch here due to the excellent food and excellent service. I would definitely go back at least once a week if I lived closer to the area. It is definitely a true hidden gem in a Toronto."}
{"text":"If I owned a restaurant and wanted to attract new clients I would definitely create a groupon.  I would provide over the top service as well as top notch food in order to impress and to retain them as future clients. 
Sounds simple........ We purchased a groupon for this restaurant and I must say that they did very well in regards to providing excellent service however the food wasn't the greatest. There are so many wonderful Italian restaurants in the GTA therefore you have to stand out and be over the top if you hope to have repeat business. 
I am Italian and love to try Italian restaurants and unfortunately I won't be rushing back to this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"I came here with a Groupon for the four course meal for four people for $125 instead of paying $200 something.  I had the bruschetta, the Crespelle Frutti di Mare (Crepe with shrimp, crab and scallop in a cream pernod sauce), linguine with shrimp and lobster meat in a rose sauce and the tiramisu ice cream / cake. The crepe was really good, all the savoury flavours blended well and it came out fresh and hot. The linguine was decent, I found it barely had any lobster meat, and it was hard to taste in the over rose sauce. I thought the linguine was slightly overcooked and too soft.

I came with my family and they had the mushroom salad, escargot and calamari. I was able to try their appetizers and we agreed that they were all below are expectations. They were pretty bland and untasteful, also the textures didn't feel that great with those appetizers. Also the mains they had (lamb tenderloin and veal) were A-OK, nothing special. The plating was a bit off though, I found there was sauces on my plate from another dish at our table.

All in all, with the Groupon I still think this place is overpriced because we're still paying around $30 for food, so you aren't really getting a great deal or anything from this place. So for that price I don't think it's worth it. The only thing that was good was the Crepe appetizer. Everything else was average."}
{"text":"I went with a groupon.... WARNING :  They have a \"special\" menu for $30 a person.  That we could NOT HAVE with our groupon, even though I paid $59!!  Don't buy the groupon! 

The bruschetta was the SMALLEST I've ever seen.  Two TINY pieces, with 3 pieces of tomato.  The warm mushroom salad was quite good. 

The chicken marsala (they wouldn't even spring for VEAL)it was ok.  Sauce salty, as were the Chopped zucchini and peppers.  Didn't taste any marsala..... 

Dessert: lemon sorbet is very good, nice and tart!   Tiramisu was spectacular, except for the strawberry sauce drizzle, which has NO place NEAR tiramisu! 

The waiter was efficient and considerate.

Don't buy the groupon!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time at Volare, the 4 of us had a Groupon. All I can say is.. fabulous!!! The staff was friendly and courteous and the food was outstanding, we weren't rushed, the aroma when we walked in the was amazing. Restaurant is very comfortable and unpretentiousness. We will be back often."}
