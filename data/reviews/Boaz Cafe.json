{"text":"Don't hesitate- this place is amazing! So fresh, so flavorful even our super picky 5 year old ate until she was stuffed."}
{"text":"good food but the excessive amount of brainwashing positive wooden signs on the wall gave my husband  headache and had to take the food to go."}
{"text":"I am always looking for great vegetarian options in Cleveland, and Boaz Cafe definitely makes the list! We decided to eat dinner here on a Wednesday night and parked directly across the street in a metered spot on Lorain Ave. As soon as we walked in, the employees at the front greeted us warmly and offered us menus. In terms of layout, Boaz Cafe is much more laid back than its big brother Aladdin - you order and pay at the front and then seat yourself. I ordered a build-your-own bowl and a mean & green juice at the suggestion of one of the staff members. 

When building your bowl/pita, you select the ingredients from a large spread as an employee serves you behind the bar. The staff member who made my order was exceptionally kind - when I said I would prefer neither chicken nor beef for protein, he gave me extra lentils, which I really appreciated. You can choose as many different ingredients as you like - I ended up with greens, lentils, baba, salata, quinoa, cabbage salad, pickled turnips, pickled cucumbers, and tahini yogurt dressing. It was fantastic! My fellow diners also built their own bowls, and they agreed that their meals were delicious.

About a minute after we sat down, our juices arrived. Even though I had read through the ingredients of the mean & green, I still was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not just a sweet green juice - the ginger really gave it a little kick. Whenever I am back next, I am definitely going to try another juice or a smoothie - at $2, who could resist!?

I definitely will be returning to Boaz Cafe in the future. With it being situated just a block away from the West Side Market, I imagine others will quickly discover this gem too. Everything on the menu was extremely affordable (less than $9 total for a bowl and juice), and both the staff and the ambience were inviting and warm."}
{"text":"Yummy and healthy! Like a Mediterranean Chipotle with more choices on menu. Build your own bowl options were: rice and lentils or greens, chicken or beef, hummus or baba, lots of little salad topping extras (green pepper tomato cucumber, cabbage, carrots, pickled things) and toom, which is basically garlic with a little oil whipped up into paste. Fast and cheap too!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Ohio city. Unlike most places in this area, Boaz is not overpriced!! The falafel and wraps are amazing. They even have build your own bowl for just 7$ !! just opened and I've already been there 4 times."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. From their amazing food, to their tasty juices, this a place you must try. I always get the \"build your own bowl\" with chicken and all my fav fix-ins. Their hot sauce is the best! Ask for pita on the side with your bowl too. I've tried all their fresh squeezed juices and smoothies, the tropical storm my ultimate favorite if you want something sweet after your meal. 
I'm telling you, this is the best place in Ohio city. boaz is the best!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and very affordable - especially in Ohio City! I cannot resist the build-your-own option. I like to get the rice, lentils, chicken, garlic sauce (yum!), eggplant, hummus, tomato salata, pickled radish, etc. It's a healthy, fresh, and quick meal. For the vegetarians out there, you have a large amount of options."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and very flavorful. It must be from the freshness of the ingredients. Tried the cold pressed juice as well.  I went for the nutrients sake of the juice more than the taste. Yes, they did not add sugar to make it a dessert!  Indulged in the Baklava. It was rich and good. Recommend this place."}
{"text":"OMG - amazing food ... delicious - very reasonably priced - healthy... the trifecta!!!  Can see many Boaz dinners in my future!!"}
{"text":"This place has it all. Great tasting, healthy food. Fast. Never have to wait and it's cheap! Smoothies are delicious and very inexpensive. Addicted to this place"}
{"text":"Probably the most perfect restaurant in the whole world. Healthy and delicious. Anyone who gives this place less than 5 stars is delusional."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Delicious food, smoothies and juices.  The best fattoush in town and prices are great.  You can't find a place in town (or anywhere) where you can buy a fresh 3.00 smoothie. Very comfortable and clean atmosphere.  Staff is always friendly.  We need more places like this in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's like chipotle for Lebanese food. Also, lemon water on tap."}
{"text":"When we went there were two girls at the register when we came in. Neither could be accused of being overly friendly. They weren't mean, they were just indifferent. It was our first time there and I wanted to check out the menu and my husband wanted to do the make your own. They told him to go ahead. He didn't know what he should go ahead and do. So, when he starts saying what he wants, he gets a glare like he's stupid and they call a very nice lady from the back to help him. Meanwhile, they seemed impatient with me for not knowing what I wanted. Once I placed my order, she immediately blurted out my total, there was no 'did you want anything else' or anything like that. It was just, I'll have this. $17.85. I even had to ask her what she said and then I realized that it was my total. It was all sort of weird. They made us feel somewhat stupid, like they were bothered that we were there. Not at all welcoming.

The food was good. My chicken was dry. My husband really enjoyed his create your own bowl.

I'm sure we'll end up going back, but it won't be anytime soon though."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! Today I drove in from Philadelphia PA and the first place I wanted to go was here for my Mediterranean dinner!!! Yes directly from a 6 1/2 hour drive straight to BOAZ!!! By the way I passed my home in the Parma area  to continue my journey downtown Cleveland to BOAZ!!! 
Always great services and excellent food!!! The spicy cauliflower is amazing and addictive!!! No better meal for the value!!!"}
{"text":"I died and went to heaven. Our meal was divine. Both my husband and I ordered \"build your own bowls.\" I had the Tropical Storm smoothie and my husband ordered the Strawberry Blast; both were incredible. The bowls were so fresh, the flavors were so amazing, and I left stuffed but not sick. The staff were are really friendly and the decor is really nice too. I can't wait to come back. Also the price is more than right... Only $19.44 (for the above mentored meal, plus dine in tax.) There's nothing wrong with this place and we need them everywhere."}
{"text":"My roommates and I are new to the Ohio City neighborhood. We noticed Boaz cafe had replaced bonbon and decided to test it out. We stopped in this evening and we're very impressed. The build your own bowl was delicious and very affordable. And the fresh juices are only $2!! Unheard of. Very excited to be so close to Boaz and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a fast and fun environment! We had the vegetarian entree, which had falafel, grape leave, baba, and hummus. The beet juice was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Very happy a fast causal healthy place has opened in Ohio City! Dined in and had a wonderful experience overall. I made my own bowl and we also ordered a spicy falafel, hummus & veggies, as well as the green smoothie. All delicious! There was a little confusion with the order but nothing big and they gave us an extra bowl for the small inconvenience. I will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh.  Place is clean and nicely decorated. Very friendly and polite service too! Not expensive."}
{"text":"If you like good healthy Mediterranean food than this is a must. Clean, friendly staff and awesome food"}
{"text":"We came here on my fiance's request, and were definitely extremely pleased and will be returning. This was described to me as \"Mediterranean Chipotle\" and I feel this is pretty accurate. Definitely gave every feel of a Chipotle, but with a Mediterranean vibe.
The staff was very friendly, and made ordering comfortable. Both of us chose to go with the build your own option, a pita for me and a bowl for her. There were lots of tasty options to include on your order including hummus, baba (still not sure what it is), radishes, and carrots are just a few. The chicken was very tasty and I'm looking forward to trying the beef shawarma next time. If you are not a fan of make your own or don't do well with many options, there are also several preset orders of freshly made pitas. We also had a side of tabouli, my fiance's choice, which was a new experience for me, and I'd be open to having again.
The prices for pitas here are very reasonable, and the serving sizes are generous. I would be interested to try a smoothie next time I come here. Definitely a place we will be returning again to get some good food at a good price."}
{"text":"Really good! They're affiliated with Aladdins but they're a lot better in my opinion! You can choose to build your own pita or bowl and have the pita on the side.  Their toppings are great! The girls at the counter were very friendly. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot! Go in and grab yourself a pita bowl, and prepare to be amazed: great selection of fillings. My favorite is the lentils, chicken, baba, and cilantro mango dressing. Get it with some pita and it'll only put you back $7. I feel like this is a healthy lunch option, but I could totally be wrong... either way, it's a healthier lunch option than Chipotle, so it wins in my book."}
{"text":"Will be frequenting this place probably weekly! Had my first meal last night which was the chicken shawarma  rolled and a juice. So wonderful on all accounts. Great prices, friendly service, beautiful atmosphere, delicious food."}
{"text":"YUMMY YUM YUM. This place is so freaking good. Do you like Aladdin's? Do you like fresh food? Do you like to feel a little healthy but also like you're not being forced to eat healthy? Mmkay then come here. This is a gem in Ohio City that I hope never goes away. It's a \"Chipotle-style\" place, only meaning that you can build your own bowl or salad. The choices are plenty and you will not be unsatisfied. Lettuce or brown rice/lentils, chicken or steak, salata, hummus, baba ganoush, a ton of veggie options, and all of the dressings you could ask for. Oh, and DONT FORGET THE HOT SAUCE. Please. That's all I ask of you. 

Oh, and I know they have a lot of options you can choose from that aren't build your own, but I honestly can't drag myself away to try them. They also have fresh made juices and some wine if you want a little sippy sip."}
{"text":"Excellant food and service. Clean. Very reasonable. Babaganoush excellant. Make sure to try the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Ok place. A light clean meal. Had the make your own bowl with chicken (which was made quickly) and cauliflower appetizer. Cauliflower was my fave...a unique flavor! I've had better baba and hummus in the bowl. Also had a tropical smoothie, was ok. As I researched this place the day before going I see the prices has gone up and up! Bowls $6 to now $7. Smoothies started at $2 to $2.50 to $3 to now $3.75. Wow wish my income increased like that! Maybe will go back."}
{"text":"A legit bright spot in Clevelands over saturated  food scene. Friendly down to earth owner,  more then fair prices and down right delicious fucking food.  Love it."}
{"text":"Love love love Boaz Cafe!  I would eat here everyday if I could!  Boaz is located in my favorite part of Cleveland, Ohio City.  Walking in you kinda get a chipotle vibe, except it's Mediterranean food instead of Mexican.  My go to meal is the BYOB build your own bowl.   The BYOB is so great because you get so much healthy, flavorful and fresh food for only $7.00  You start off by choosing your base, greens or lentils and rice.  Then you choose your protein, beef or chicken.  Next, you top it off with hummus or baba, and then add some color by adding all the topping you like.  You also get to choose a dressing, and my favorite is the hot sauce.  Their hot sauce dressing is bomb!  One of the best dressings I've ever had!
Besides the amazing food I love the feel of this place.  It's very casual and the space is big, bright and clean.  The staff is always super friendly and I just really enjoy coming here.  If you haven't been, drop what you're doing right now and go!  You'll thank me later :)"}
{"text":"I love Middle Eastern food. This place is good. 
I like that they offer freshly made veggie juices!

Yet ... 4 stars cuz, 'I know what you did.'

I usually get the build your own - on pita bread.
I had noticed when I frequented Boaz in the past, that the build your own in the biodegradable (?)  bowls appeared to have large amounts of food; enough to take home perhaps. People remarked on that fact on Yelp. 
Well, Boaz has remedied that.

I went in a few days ago to order my first (like a virgin - but not) bowl. The bowls are now different and appear smaller. 
Of course, I made mention of that fact to the cashier and she gave the 'corporate' response of no, it is the same. 
Listen, per corporate response, people [who] were complaining about the biodegradable bowls leaking, shoulda just put their overabundance of food in a water-proof container at home. Because of them, now I have no healthy snack for later, should I continue to give Boaz my bizness.?

As one reviewer stated here, the portions are small(er) now. The builder of my \"smaller\" bowl - was let's say, quite economical (for them) with my building food choices. 
Unless, you speak up nicely stating \"a little more please\" - but geez. 
Who wants to coerce 'a builder of bowls' for an additional pat/spoonful - in front of a line of customers - puh-leeze? 
(See how it pays to know your history? Newcomers/Foodies to Boaz eager & starred-eyed have no idea of the former 'bowl abundance'). (Note how I extrapolated the (holistic) importance of history to a biodegradable serving bowl? 
Yes! I have a lot of free time).?

All in all, the food is fresh & delicious. The surrounds are trendy. Boaz cleans up your table mess, so you do not. 
I also like their fries with the Zaatar seasoning, which is equally good. 

Yet, I am back to visiting my other ME food places; as I would anyway. Boaz is still on my radar for their fresh veggie juices on the days that my dude at the Juice stand@WSM is not there due to closure. 
Okayyyy... 
maybe an occasional \"coerced\" build your own pita. I have to be in the mood tho.?"}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of vegan and vegetarian dishes. The smoothies were great especially the rejuvenate with bananas, mangos and pineapple. The berry came in a close second. Fast service and friendly wait staff. Will definitely stop again on my way through Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love this place. Many standbys from Aladdin's in a quick, fun concept. I got take out from there, two delicious customized bowls with hearty servings, and a bowl of lentil soup for $15. Not to mention they serve coffee, juices, and Aladdin's famous desserts. This is a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is like the Chipotle of Falafel! Super good, going to be coming here a bunch!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh myyy gooodness. At first I was sad to see BonBon close, but now I'm so happy that this place opened up in place of it.  
First off, the service was amazing. The man running the pita/bowl counter was so sweet and so helpful.
The place was also very clean and organized, both storefront and especially in the back/ kitchen area as I couldn't help but peek over. 
Lastly, the food was so so good. We ordered the \"chipotle\" style pita bowl and it just yum. 
We can't wait to come back and try everything else!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my new favorite places to eat! Today was my first time here and all the workers were extremely nice. I also got a smoothie and you could tell that it was made with real fruit. The food is really filling but doesn't make you feel gross afterwards like how some places do. Already planning the next trip to come back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean food I've had. Definitely will have to make this a regular lunch stop after a visit to the West Side Market."}
{"text":"I live in Washington and read about Boaz about 6 months ago and knew I wanted to try it. Finally got a chance when visiting relatives. Friendly people behind the counter, excellent fresh selection, and fast delicious food. I'd go here everyday if I could. I'd tell you what I got but I'd totally misspell it but it involved hummus and a big ol soft pita. Drooling just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Boaz Cafe is fantastic! I absolutely love Middle Eastern food, so I couldn't wait to try this place. Everything is so fresh, and delicious, and inexpensive!

Their falafels are so good... they might even be my favorites now! Eating them on hummus, and covered with hot sauce, was just heavenly. The spicy cauliflower was also very good! My friend ordered the build-your-own bowl, which also looked seriously great. I actually had a brief moment of jealously... until I remembered my own spicy hummus covered falafels of joy. The smoothies also looked wonderful, and are definitely on my list to order next time.

If you find find yourself bopping around Ohio City, I highly recommend you stop by Boaz Cafe!"}
{"text":"Great spot to enjoy a clean, well run business with a staff that appreciates the customer. Also excellent food. A must go for me each time I come to the Cleveland."}
{"text":"Like Greek chipotle. Definitely try chicken curry wrap the mango curry sauce is delicious!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and courteous. They went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of. I had a to-go order that I ordered in house. It took about 10 mins, which is not bad at all. The food was fabulous. We had the chicken shawarma wrap, hummus, lentils and beans, and the beef falafel wrap. We also had sides of the hot sauce, mango cilantro, and yogurt. All of which were amazing. As far as the juices, they were great as well. The all green smoothie was sweet and mellow, the detox has a strong bite of ginger...which I love. I live in the neighborhood, and will be back many times over."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for a healthy meal in Cleveland. As someone who grew up with incredible middle eastern food in Dearborn, Michigan, the offerings have been slim to say the least (aladdins? No.) so to find a place like boaz that has all the flavors, freshness, and variety I'm used to back home? Amazing. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"After the Woman's march, this great little secret in Ohio City was the perfect healthy meal to re-energize for the day."}
{"text":"For my first trip to Boaz Cafe, I went on a Sunday around lunch. Steady stream of people but not crowded and no wait. This place has amazing value and offers something quick and affordable among a lot of pricier sit down restaurants.

I ordered the falafel plate with hummus which was plentiful. It came with a side of pita. They also have fresh squeezed juice for $2 a glass- super value!

The restaurant is in the same vein as Aladdin's, except for a younger urban crowd and a \"build a bowl\" option. I love that this Lebanese-owned family business took a risk to do this."}
{"text":"I tried the build-your-on-bowl. It was outstanding. I especially love the Shawarma.  And, the pickled radishes we're also surprisingly good. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is great for a fast healthy lunch. Or dinner because they are open a little later. They take a sort of Chipotle model but with tasty Mediterranean instead of faux Mex. Brown rice and lentils or lettuce, beef or chicken if you want, baba or hummus and a variety of veggie toppers. All loaded into a compostable bowl! Sit down and eat or take it back to work with a very reasonably priced juice mix or smoothie made to order. For under $10, you will be full and feeling self righteous."}
{"text":"Wow! Only $6.50 for a huge bowl filled with lettuce, beans, all sorts of veggies, choice of baba or hummus, rice and lentils and lots more! Plus some delicious sauces as well (homemade hot sauce!) I didn't get a juice but they are only $2.50! Next time for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the neighborhood. It's a nice cheap healthy lunch spot. Everyone that works there is very friendly. The juices are so good and everything is reasonably priced. They have already increased the prices though. I hope they don't keep doing that . . . ."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. I regularly tell my wife it is a good thing I don't live or work by Boaz cafe because I absolutely love their food.  I could get the lunch bowl every day of the week and not get sick of it. Plus the space there is very beautiful."}
{"text":"Its like a chipotle for Medeterranean food. I wasnt overly impressed by the food however Ive noticed i dont really like that style of food in general. FOR ME, it was bland and rushed. The staff were very \"hurry up and buy\".

You go in, choose pita or bowl and fill it accordingly. Not really WOW in my eyes. Also i heard they have since raised prices from when they first opened which to me screams price gauge but hey im not the feds."}
{"text":"Such a good place to eat! Tonight was our first time trying it we ordered 20 mins before they closed and they were still nice enough to make it! The food was so good and such a good price."}
{"text":"Prices are perfectly on point. Ridiculously fresh and the atmosphere is clean. I hope to see this place flourish in years to come. You can tell it's very young but I bet you it will be an Ohio City staple, give it a little time. The chicken is f'n perfectly grilled. 9/10 just needs to ditch the radio and use Spotify playlists or something haha"}
{"text":"I'm happy to see so many good reviews of this place. It is one of those rare gems in Cleveland where the food is healthy and you can have a (pretty generous) meal for under $10. I chose the make your own salad option, which has a good spread of ingredients for a Mediterranean salad and I got a fresh squeezed juice. Total cost was under $10! 

A word on the location of this place: it is, in fact, where Bonbon café used to be. I didn't realize that Bonbon had closed. Turns out that the owner of Bonbon cafe (who wanted to pursue something new) sold the place to the owner of Aladdin's, who opened up Boaz. If you want to know more, see: http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2016/12/26/ohio-citys-bonbon-pastry-to-become-aladdins-eatery-spinoff-boaz-café."}
{"text":"Super delicious!! Such an easy stop for healthy, filling, and flavorful food. I was surprised they didn't have feta cheese though!"}
{"text":"It's basically Chipotle, but healthy. I built a bowl, which is basically a salad but with more interesting toppings than I've ever found at a salad bar. I was not a fan of the lentil soup, and they added way too much hummus and dressing on my bowl, but I would eat here again and just have them go lighter on those next time."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint. The food is fresh, delicious and packed with flavor. The fresh juices and smoothies are insanely cheap and perfect. P.s. they make their own hot sauce that is super thin, but bright and zippy. The staff is beyond friendly, helpful and super accomodating. What a welcome addition to Ohio City. Can't wait to come back again and again. And again."}
{"text":"I usually go to Sittoo's for my feel of Middle Eastern food but saw Boaz on Yelp and decided to try it because they have build your own pitas and bowls. The place is beautiful, trendy and very clean. The prices are very reasonable, however, portions too small. This is why I did not give it 5 stars. Let me paint the picture for you...I got the bowl and it was like a third full and I got almost all they offered for the bowl. Other than that the food was fresh and tasty....just not enough of it . I will return and try an entree next time just to see if that is the way to go when it comes to getting more food . Update: after response from owner Hubby and I decided to come in for post work out and portion is bigger! Husband added double meat for $2.50 but I am happy and tastes so good!"}
{"text":"Great new spot in Ohio City. We ordered take out last night with a couple of friends and the food was all great, as was the service when my husband picked up the food. We had the falafel on hummus, chicken on hummus, shawarma on hummus (sensing a theme?), the baba, spicy cauliflower, kibbie and grape leaves, plus the fattoush and salata...all of it was a hit and we will most definitely be back! So glad to have a new delicious, reasonably healthy and very reasonably priced place to add to our rotation. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"An absolute winner in my book! Just had lunch here and loved every minute! Went with the bowl concept ($7.00) Lots of fresh ingredients to choose from,  plus from the kitchen choices. I chatted  with a lovely woman (the owner I think ) who was so friendly. . She let me try the roasted  cauliflower  it was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Imagine Chipotle and Aladdin blended together....you get Boaz.  I stopped in on a busy Friday afternoon, for a to-go order.  It was just a tiny bit chaotic, but it's also only been open 2 weeks.  I ordered a \"do it yourself\" bowl and added a side of tabouli.  The price was right and the ingredients were fresh.  I will absolutely return."}
{"text":"I can here because of the healthy menu and good reviews, didn't disappoint one bit, in fact way exceeded expectations. Super healthy, great vibe, and delicious food. Full of really bold flavor! I got the bowl and coming from a chipotle fanatic, this was better. Come here"}
{"text":"This place is fire!!! $6 bowls and $2 smoothies. Get real. Food was delicious, service was friendly, makes for an awesome lunch spot."}
{"text":"Affordable food

Quick and friendly service 

Chipotle style option

Great location

Healthy choices 

Above average smoothies"}
{"text":"Oh! My! God! I have no idea how humanity deserved such good for such low price. 

They have an amazing build your own pita/bowl bar which in the end tasted delicious. Then, they make juices and smoothies by order. So they are not pre-made which makes them fresh and healthier. You can also take out some stuff that you may not like which gives you flexibility. In addition, you can add chia and flax seeds to your smoothies for 40 cents each. It's crazy!

If I lived in Cleveland, I'd probably come here every day. Great spot! This is my last day here, and I know I'll be there for some smoothies!"}
{"text":"This place now will be one of my favorite.....looks very healthy and great made. Not expensive."}
{"text":"Just updating that prices have now gone up to from $6.50 to $7 a bowl and also from $2.50 to $3.25 for juices (quite a large % change for juices/smoothies).  The value is still good, but if this continues, I can't say that it will remain the case.  I also wish service were a bit friendlier (they don't even smile back and barely acknowledge your presence)."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time trying Boaz with a friend and this place is lovely! I live right down the street and will be visiting frequently. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious including the green juice! The only reason I gave it a four was because I felt like my bowl could have been filled with more food, otherwise I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and simple restaurant. I got the falafel bowl and a smoothie. Very healthy and tasty. Will definitely be returning to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Oh yum! Came in for lunch with the fam today and we all really enjoyed our food. We all did the build your own bowl with beef Shawarma. The meat was tender and so flavorful!  I really enjoyed the baba and all the other toppings. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. You can't beat the prices of everything too, I will definitely come back. 

We found parking on the street right outside but there also seemed to be a small parking lot in back. The place doesn't have a ton of tables, but it seemed plenty for the lunch crowd around 1:00 on a weekday."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food! So fresh, flavorful, and inexpensive! I have been talking non-stop about this wonderful food discovery since I visited last weekend! I would HIGHLY recommend Boaz Cafe if you're in the Ohio City area. It's just right across the street from the iconic West Side Market, definitely walking distance!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing...it's Mediterranean chipotle. Much healthier though and affordable. I will be back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Bon bon cafe was a mediocre cafe here before it sold to Boaz Cafe.   Unfortunately, Boaz hasn't been able to reach above that low bar.  It's about as exciting as Aladdin' (same owner, not coincidentally).  Better quality is easier to find elsewhere, but if you're desperate for food, it'll do."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab dinner and ordered the kibbie and hummus chicken - great flavor and quality of ingredients.  Could believe how inexpensive it was too.  Will definitely be back often - great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time here. Stopped here after looking for a quick bite.  Always looking for something healthy & also vegan/vegetarian friendly. Husband & I each had the build-your-own Mediterranean bowl. Great options & left feeling very satisfied. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you like Aladdin's then you are going to like Boaz because it's the same company. The difference with Boaz is that it is fast causal, more like a Mediterranean Chipotle. You walk in order your food and pay, then if you got a create your own bowl you move to the side and pick what you want included. You can get your food to-go or they have tables for dining in. Staff is friendly and I parked in the school lot down the street so no issue with parking. 

*Vegan Combo $7.50 - You get hummus, baba, tabouli, grape leaves, and falafel. Great sampling of offered items! 
*Spicy Cauliflower $4.25 - Very tasty and saucy! 
*Kibbie $4.75 - Two kibbie with a tomato cucumber salad.
*Bowl $6.50 - Rice, lettuce, veggies, meat, sauce, whatever you want. 
*Baklava $1 - Standard

I'd say the prices are very affordable for some healthier eating on the go. Portion sizes are filling and taste is pretty good. If you are getting kibbie or falafel to-go, I would ask to have them wrapped up separately as they get mushy from the other items (I actually drained the juice out of my salad when I got home because there was just so much of it). 

I would definitely try them again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic smoothies, great food, and very nice service. The menu is is quite flexible, and the food tastes delicious. It also opens on Sundays which is not the case in may other restaurants. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Whelp, I've been to Boaz 3 times since discovering it last week...so to say that I'm a fan, might be understating my fandom. 

I'm not sure why the juices and smoothies are priced at $2-2.50, but I hope these prices stick!

The make-your-own bowl has been my go-to, but I aspire to branch out at some point. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked excellent. 

Highly, highly recommend if you're looking for a healthy, affordable option in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I can still taste the garlic.  Very quick.  Just as advertised: Chipotle for Mediterranean food.  The ingredients seemed much fresher, though.  Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've had in cleveland so far. Crispy and sturdy on the outside, almost creamy and fluffy on the inside. Flavors on point! Everything is fresh and delicious. The juices are so cheap and delicious, I grab two at a time. I love it! The cashier is super friendly too."}
{"text":"Wow this place is truly spectacular. So many good things on the menu. I had some minor work done on my car and was in the area. I was hungry and wanted something clean to eat. This place has been on my radar. 

I had to go with the build your own bowl. Everything looked amazingly fresh. I went with the beef schwarma  bowl. I was completely amazed by how many choices are offered. Greens, lentils, baba, turnips, veggies, dressings, pickles, peppers, hot sauce.  By the time they built my bowl it was bigger than my head. It was spectacular. 

Oh lets talk about the service. So welcoming, the owner and employees really care about there product and their guests' experiences.  Oh and it's  an amazing value. I felt like I should have paid more

If you have not tried this place you have been missing out. Run, don't walk here."}
{"text":"Ohio City needed this place. Price point is perfect. The owner from Aladdin's Eatery aced it.
Smoothie + lentil soup + shawarma = just over $10. Also functions as a build your own bowl/pits place with delicious ingredients. 

Place is a no brainer and has a nice clean layout. As an Ohio City resident - I'll be passing along the word. Like I said, OHC needed somewhere with this price point + vibe. Boaz hit a home run. 

Only negative was that Creed - Arms Wide Open came on during my meal. Yes, I sang along."}
{"text":"Very good! Quick to get our order and friendly folks! The cauliflower is a must!

Uber eats please!"}
{"text":"Quality Mediterranean food and juices that are all fresh, cheap, and quickly prepared."}
{"text":"Of all the dining options in Ohio city, this has to be my least fave. I could tell from the clustermuck ordering process and seat yourself idea that I was not going to like it. I was right. Food is meh-ness."}
{"text":"I am absolutely delighted to have quick, healthy food so close to home. Boaz Cafe is delicious, healthy, and affordable. I particularly like the fresh squeezed juices and the fried cauliflower. The staff is incredibly friendly and I've never waited more than a few minutes. The bowls are big enough that I can usually make two meals out of one, and the sauce options are on point. I highly, highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Loved the build your own bowl I got everything ! Very flavorful. Also loved the spicy cauliflower which I was skeptical about because I'm not the biggest cauliflower fan but they were great! Very affordable especially the juice."}
{"text":"This is a bit of a hidden gem in Cleveland. It is in the quaint area of Ohio City, right near West Side Market. I am a falafel lover and found that they have delicious falafel for a very reasonable price. The service is always good and staff is friendly and polite. My girlfriend is a big fan of their juices, which are also a very fair price when considering places like Helio Terra or Townhall."}
{"text":"A nice and healthy alternative, good quality, friendly service and a nice atmosphere. I really enjoyed my lunch here."}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh and the tastes are vibrant! This fast casual place in Ohio City makes Mediterranean food approachable and inviting. 

I ordered the make-your-own chicken bowl. Just like Chipotle, the ingredients are set-up in assembly line fashion and you pick what flavors to build into your bowl. What makes boaz different than chipotle, and in my opinion comparatively better, are the gangsta topping choices. Tabouli and pickled turnips with a cilantro vinaigrette..Straight Gangsta! The bowl ends up being a healthy rainbow of bright colors and vibrant flavors.

I also ordered some fresh squeezed juice which was a combination of beets, carrots and other healthy vegetables. Took a sip and BAM those antoxidants hit you in the face. 

This place could become my go-to lunch spot. Healthy, well priced and delicious."}
{"text":"My son and I were visiting from out of town, and heard that Boaz Cafe offered healthy, tasty, affordable food. We're glad we tried it. It's build your own pita wrap (or bowl), chipotle -style. I got a beef shawarma pita with hummus, tabouleh,  tomatoes,  turnips,  and a whole lot more. Very fresh and tasty and filling,  for seven bucks. We were both very pleased."}
{"text":"This really is what food should be.  I came here on a Sunday afternoon and was greeted pleasantly before I reviewed the menu.  I opted for the Mean Green Juice and the build your own bowl.  I had greens, lentils and brown rice as a base.  I chose a variety of vegetables and hummus to top it off.  

This was soooo good!  And the juice was freshly made and delicious as well.  I can't believe it was only 2.50!  Other places charge two or three times as much for fresh juice.

I hope this place continues to serve great food at these super affordable prices."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon, and loved it! Although we were sad to see Bon Bon go, we were excited for a healthy, quick new (extremely affordable)spot to pop up. The one hung we both couldn't get over were that fresh juices and smoothies are only $2! It's insane, most other places around town will charge $10 for similar items! We ordered the grapes leaves & salata for light appetizers and the chicken shawarma rolled and beef shawarma rolled, while both were good, the beef was AMAZING! The staff was great too, very attentive even though you don't have a specific waitress since you order up front, but all of our needs were met while we were there (extra napkins, ice for my drink, etc). We will probably become regulars at this place!"}
{"text":"Boaz is hands down one of the cheapest, healthiest restaurants in OC. Another family owned business with a great vibe. The bowls are a steal for $7. I eat here about twice a week and I can say that every single bite has been delicious and fresh. The workers are happy and playful. I hope they stick around for a long time :-)"}
{"text":"If only Boaz Café were closer...but I do drive all the way from the east suburbs to eat here, and would do it much more if it weren't so far! I've only ever gotten the make your own bowl and fresh juice but the rest of the menu looks just as tempting. Prices have increased just a tad since opening but they are still so affordable. I usually go with the beef and top it with ALL the fixins. Such a fast, healthy option and always fresh. I've been told they are owned by Aladdin's but haven't confirmed this tidbit- doesn't make a difference to me, tastes yummy either way!"}
{"text":"Boaz caters! Incredible food, amazing service. The food is so fresh!  Never had a bad meal here. And the French fries are tops!"}
{"text":"Would highly recommend Boaz Cafe for Mediterranean food! Similar service concept to Chipotle. Amazing customer service, the staff are happy to help you and continue to check on you even though it's not table service. The food is delicious and the smoothies are great too. The build your own option has a great variety to create a bowl or pita, and the menu has a lot vegetarian/vegan options. Everything is really reasonably priced and the portions are fairly large. It was a delicious meal and it's quick if you are in a rush. Would visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"Love Boaz. The falafels! Yummy! Same for the fries with the special seasoning. Inexpensive. Try a single pressed juice!"}
{"text":"Cheap. Fresh. Tasty. Friendly. The make your own bowl option was fantastic and $2.50 for fresh juice is insane."}
{"text":"Delicious fast and healthy Mediterranean food! I'm not from the area so I yelped a delicious lunch spot. This was on point!! I did a make your own bowl with beef shawarma and all the fixings. I did a combination hummus and garlic dressing, which I recommend!! I also had a detox juice. The prices were very reasonable and the food was seasoned nicely. I wish I had one closer!!"}
{"text":"I love that this place opened up right down the street from me! Their create your own bowls are the perfect meal to pick up for lunch and they have so many options of additions - it's like the Chipotle of healthy Mediterranean food! They are also so big and can be split for 2 meals. Best off, they have $2 freshly squeezed juices. This is not a joke or a scam - literally $2 amazing juices! 

This is my new go-to for lunch and juice!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch today and fell in love. I'll be back over and over. The prices were super reasonable, the ambience is great and the staff was super helpful. The tables and chairs were very comfortable and the vibe is overall homey. One of my biggest pet peeves is when you're in a horrible, rickety chair while eating lunch, but Boaz is pretty solid. Boaz is a great place for a meeting or just to hang out. I wish they had wi-fi, but then again, its a restaurant, not a coffee shop. They bring your food out to you and also bus your table for you when you're done.

They had a great looking menu with standard Mediterranean fare, smoothies and fresh juices. Here's what I ordered:

Chicken shawarma: very tender, great sauce, onions had a punchy flavor. Super filling, and best ordered with a side of something green or with veggies (it was very carby).

Grape leaves: I honestly think these were some of the best grape leaves i've ever had. They had the perfect seasoned/lemon flavor, melted in your mouth and were served warmly at the perfect temperature above a mini-salad.

Juice: I can't believe the juices were only $2.50/a piece. I had the Empower with lemon, orange, kale, spinach, ginger, apple, and cucumber. While the final color wasn't super attractive, it tasted like the healthy goodness I was hoping for.

My total was under $12. UNDER 12 DOLLARS! What an awesome place. Especially when you've been eating like a garbage can all week and just want some healthy, non-guilty food. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is THE PERFECT LUNCH SPOT, especially for folks like me who work from home but aren't exactly gourmet chefs. They have about half of the regular Aladdin's menu, plus a build-a-bowl option (lentils or greens, chicken or beef, hummus or baba, lots of veggies). So healthy, plus the space itself is bright & clean, with friendly employees. Easily a new favorite - I already can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I went today with my friend for lunch. We both did build your own bowl. I don't eat meat so I loved all the veggie options, lentils, and dressings! Would highly recommend for anyone. Everything was fresh and tasty. Also the atmosphere is very pleasant. Paul, one of the workers was also very nice and brought us our drinks and coffee to our table. I'll def be coming to Boaz again!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It's one of those places that tricks you into eating healthily even if you don't feel like it. The atmosphere is bright, airy, and warm which is just like the staff that works there. Oh, and $2 for all the juices and smoothies?!? STEAL. 

The woman at the register greeted us and asked if we had been there before walking us through everything and how it worked-super appreciated. She also ran out from behind the counter to hand menus to another couple that seemed a little confused. 

The older man working as the build your own chef literally radiates positivity. He was so genuinely nice friendly and happy it honestly made my day. The walls are also covered with messages that cheered me up. Okay. Enough about that and onto the food. 

Everything here is super fresh and revitalizing. Both my picky mother and I loved what we got. I tried to try each ingredient individually so I could distinguish if everything was good or if the delicious garlicky baba made everything seem amazing. I'd say everything was perfect on its own. In particular the chicken is super tender and the peppery seasoning they put on it was fantastic. 

I'll definitely be back to try something off the \"ordered\" menu, because, although it seems like most people do the build your own, I spotted falafel on the menu so I've got to check that and some of the desserts out. 

Delicious yet healthy food with a super sweet staff and great prices? Honestly it's hard to dislike anything about Boaz."}
{"text":"The perfect quick and delicious stop. The smoothies are really fresh and a great addition to a pita roll or bowl."}
{"text":"We walked in and the restaurant had open seating and the place felt clean.  We were greeted by someone who worked there and he explained how the restaurant worked.  

You ordered at the counter and you had a choice to build your own pita bowl (kind of like chipotle) or order off the menu and it would be brought to your table.   We ordered hummus beef shawarma, Boaz combo and lamb rolled in pita.  We ordered 2 freshly squeezed juices. (Grapefruit and immune booster) and a water.  We also got an falafel appetizer and French fries. Total was around $30 for three people. The juices are only $2!  

The juices came first and they brought us samples of the strawberry smoothie. All the juices were fantastic!!  My husband loved his lamb and I had a bite of the Kibbie in the Boaz combo and it's the best I've ever had. The falafel was very tasty but a little on the dry side. Still delicious. My beef was absolutely delicious. What a deal!

Our food came in all together and it was love at first bite. The hot sauce was to die for. Not over powering but just a slight heat with flavor. 
There was a lot of hummus to be eating and the portions were generous. 

If we lived in Cleveland we would definitely frequent this place and try everything on their menu.  

After we ate we went back to the counter and bought some desserts for the 2 hour ride home.  Just had the coconut macaroons. OMG it was delicious. I'm now jealous of the Cleveland residents. 

When we are back in the area we are definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, cute decor, friendly staff, what more can you ask for! My sister and I stopped by here lunch. It was our first time here but all the reviews were really positive so we knew it would be delicious. We were not disappointed! 

I'm the type of person that loves ketchup with my fries. Not these fries! The seasoning is delicious. Not too heavy or overpowering, just perfect! 

My rejuvenating smoothie was so refreshing. There was so much delicious looking menu items that I definitely need to go back."}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday to grab lunch for my boyfriend, but didn't get anything for myself. I came back for dinner for myself tonight and am glad I did! I got the build your own bowl option. No matter how much of what you want, it's still the same cheap price. Anything I wasn't sure of, they explained to me in detail. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. The food was so fresh and delicious. What a great spot!"}
{"text":"This place was great! As a resident of Brooklyn, and lover of Mediterranean food, I'm surprised I haven't gone here sooner! What was I doing with my life... Things ordered: baba, grape leaves, french fries, spicy cauliflower, kale quinoa tabouli. Overall, 10 out of 10!! I would order all those items again, and probably will.

I must go back and do the build-your-own-pita-or-bowl. And for the soup. And for the fresh squeezed juice. And maybe a smoothie too. OK I yes I'm going back for everything."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Affordable, fast, and delicious. Need I say more? It is like a Chipotle for Mediterranean food. Both the bowls and the pitas are delicious, and its a good place to eat in or take out!

The decorations at Boaz are so cute and trendy, and make for a fun experience eating out! This is a great place to stop for lunch on your lunch break during the week, or meet up with friends on the weekend to chat. I've done both :)

The last time I went, my friend and I met up there for lunch, and then walked right across the street to the West Side Market for a latte. It's in a great location to add to part of your fun afternoon!"}
{"text":"Great prices for tasty good! For example, they have $2 fresh juices and $7 build your own salad bowl or pita. You can get as much as you want with no extra charge on the build your own! If you've been to Alladin's eatery then this is like their cool hip younger sibling. Will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"The price for what you get is phenomenal and the food feels fresh and healthy. Even better that the staff is the nicest!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I discovered this wonderful cafe! The value for what you get here is amazing, and the food is incredibly fresh, healthy, and satisfying. The cafe is a really cute space - bright, spacious, and clean. The employees are also friendly and were happy to give me recommendations as it was my first time here.

I built my own bowl here with both greens and lentils/rice, grilled chicken, hummus, and a variety of vegetables. The bowl was fresh and full of flavor even without dressing, and it definitely filled me up. Also, their fresh-pressed juices and smoothies are only $2!!! Fresh-pressed juices are notoriously expensive (like $8-10 expensive...) in many other places, so this is honestly such an amazing value! You should try one of their juices or smoothies!! I ended up getting the detox juice, which was refreshing and delicious. 

Overall, Boaz Cafe is a great spot for a delicious and healthy meal at an incredibly reasonable price! I highly recommend trying it out if you're in the area - I definitely plan to come back in the future!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a boaz cafe at every corner! The juices are so fresh and affordable! I don't know how they make beet juice so tasty. The food is filling and fresh, I just wish they had halal food to serve all the middle eastern customers who prefer it"}
{"text":"I realize I'm one of the few non-Clevelanders to review this place but I'll give it a shot. 

I came in as an Ohio City noob - I'd never been to the area or tried any of its food. We had heard about Boaz and decided to come in. The place was really clean and nice. The food was all really tasty and fresh. The people I was with tried the build your own, but I got the tawook pita, which was excellent. It was definitely a comfortable setting, with very tall ceilings, and huge windows facing the street, excellent for some solid people-watching. And lunch for 3 including a side dish was $25. Would totally come back here next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing for such a great price. The food, the service, the atmosphere-all fantastic and noteworthy!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and filling... I always feel great about eating here.

You can expect the same menu selection of Aladdin's locations, but with an empasis on build-your-own bowl/pita custom options."}
{"text":"I ended up grabbing a late lunch here with a friend after the original spot we planned on was closed. I'd never been before, but I was pleasantly surprised. My friend is a vegetarian, and she was satisfied with the options she had. 

I had a lamb wrap and a tropical fruit smoothie, both delicious. Ordering was simple and straightforward and they brought us our food after we had found a table. The portions were a great size, and the food was yummy. It was pretty quiet when I was there, so it's perfect for catching up.  

I'm definitely planning on making a return visit and getting something else off the menu. You can never have too mich Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Boaz, located in the heart of Ohio City on the corner of the street. The cashier who helped me was very delightful and patient in explaining the menu and options for smoothies, which is what I came for. I feel like I can be a smoothie snob at times, but this place fulfilled every expectation I had. I was able to get in, order quickly and have a delectable berry smoothie that left me wanting more. Also as a plus, it was their one year anniversary and they were serving Baklava ice cream, which was to DIE FOR. Hurry into this local place people, it is well worth your time!"}
{"text":"I tried Boaz and it was good. The concept is appreciated. I tried a chicken tawook rolled and while good it wasn't as good Aladdin's Eatery and some of the other middle eastern restaurants in town. It was a light on the fillings and soggy."}
{"text":"SO i stopped in for the second time. The owner seems really nice and made me feel welcome. However some of the staff need better customer service training. I asked the girl how much was the chicken shwarma and she said \"$7.00\" However I knew that was not right. I checked the website menu before coming in it reads:
CHICKEN SHAWARMA ROLLED - grilled marinated chicken, tomatoes, onions, sumac, tahini lemon dressing, parsley 5.75
 
This place has not been consistent with prices now a bowl is 7 when it was 6.50 last time i was there.  She rang me up but I checked the menu at the register and it read 6.00 not 5.75 as online. What the hell!!!! Anyways I told her you over charged me and showed her the receipt. She refunded me but said \"It must have been the computer not me\" But she told me to my face it was 7.00 so uhhhh yeah I guess it was you since you used your fingers to punch it in the register boo boo...At least Alladin's Eatery has better customer service. Consumers are smarter than you think hun."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a Mediterranean Chipotle. You go through a line pick your meat toppings etc. I was nervous as I was just picking as I went with no real plan of what would taste good together. The staff was helpful and described each item and how it worked. The flavors were good and tasted fresh. Only thing I would like a little more meat and felt I had way more other toppings then the meat. I'm sure you could ask for double meat and it would be even better. I would recommend this place for a quick bite, lunch or on the go."}
{"text":"I had make your own with pita and beef. It's a fancy chipotle concept for mediterranean food. Good eat. The smoothie for $2.50 is a steal!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Friendly staff, fresh delicious food, clean, affordable .. can't say enough. If I lived here, I'd come all the time."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this place. Every time I've been here there food has been great. So fresh and healthy and the juices are great too! Everyone here is so friendly and makes sure you have everything you could possibly need. The prices are great and you will leave feeling full."}
{"text":"Easily the cheapest, best lunch place in Ohio City. It's hard to resist the temptation to eat out for lunch all the time when it's just a couple minutes walk from my work! It's cheap, fresh, and tasty. Build your own bowl can be fun, but I prefer the rolled pitas and the falafels are amazing. Ask for the homemade hot sauce too. I also love the lemon garlic tahini sauce. 

It's clean and the interior looks great with giant welcoming windows. Try it out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Like a lot of the other reviews have said, this place is a really great value. Cheap bowls and cheap smoothies. 

I love Chipotle and so I thought I would love this Mediterranean twist on the concept. But something just fell flat. My bowl was okay and so was my smoothie. Maybe I just suck a putting my own bowl together. I'll give this place another chance, although I am not super excited to."}
{"text":"Kinda of like middle eastern version of chipotle. Juices were cheap. The cauliflower appetizer was amazing - perfectly fried topped with a tangy yogurt sauce. I like the baba as well. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Truly the best food and such a cool concept! This place is like the Mediterranean version of Chipotle, and a million times healthier for you. I probably ate a week's worth of veggies in one \"build your own bowl\" - the portions are unreal! AND all for $6. If you're in the mood for some good coffee, a refreshing homemade all-natural smoothie, or lemon diffused water, look no further. This place is healthy, clean, and beyond delicious with amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and still love the food each visit! This is a fast casual Mediterranean restaurant. I have always ordered the bowl. Select from rice and lentils or salad, top with grilled chicken or beef shawarma, select from
Hummus or baba ganoush and then pick your toppings! Shredded carrots, shredded radish, cole slaw, , tabouli, bean salad, quinoa, pickles, etc... basically anything you can imagine from a Mediterranean restaurant as an
Option you can put on your bowl! Lots of sauces as well."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today to get a make your own bowl. I don't know how I've missed this place after spending so much time in Ohio city, especially right around the corner from West Side Market.

I do have to say that they make the experience pretty efficient and stress free with all the bowl toppings it can get overwhelming but they walk you through section by section. Greens or lentils? Chicken or beef? Baba or hummus? Then for the 10 other unlimited toppings they break them up and tell you what each one is so you're not panicking and guessing. Haha. But actually that could cause anxiety (see any place that has 10+ unlimited ingredients and just say 'what do you want on it?')

Price is good, food is tasty! Decent amount of tables. I'll for sure be back for another bowl and probably to try a smoothie or juice."}
{"text":"Incredible!!! Everything is SO fresh!!! Veggies taste like they were just picked!!! And the prices are so reasonable! Could not be more happy with my experience here! AWESOME place :) one of my new favorite spots!!! All of the food was fantastic but you've got to try the spicy cauliflower!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Ohio City. The layout is simple. Mediterranean food in a fast pace environment. You can get a bowl full of lentils, meat and toppings."}
{"text":"Love Boaz!!! So happy about this new addition to downtown Cleveland! It's like chipotle but Mediterranean food. There prices are SO reasonable and their food is incredible. I love the falafel and spicy cauliflower the most, but seriously everything is great. Also, awesome environment and super friendly workers!"}
{"text":"The food is fine, the surly tattooed girl cashier with the crappy attitude however is not. As soon as I walk in, I was trying to figure out how this place works like do you get seated first, do you order first... I don't see a sign but I see lots of bad quotes hung up on the walls as if hobby lobby was having a fire sale. The girl stands behind the cash register with no greeting and no help. So I ask how it works and she hands me the menu, no explanation. I'm looking around to see if I can figure it out because there's a ingredients bar so I'm assuming it's like Chipotle. With all the quotes around the place, you would think there would be a sign telling customers how to order or what to do... if it exists, I missed it because my eyes diverted to something out of a chicken soup for the soul book. I order and pay the girl with the attitude, she walks away before I have my card back in my wallet with no instruction that they'll bring out the food or what to do. I ask another person working what to do and she said I could have a seat so I do.  Being that this is a fairly new spot that took over for Bon Bon (which was amazing), I would assume that new customer experiences would be important. This girl clearly seems miserable and is letting customers know she's miserable. There are plenty of jobs out there so if you don't like it, then move on and stop being a completely rude pos. Might I suggest something that doesn't require you to be around customers. Not sure I'll go back as I can trek out to Lakewood Aladdins to get great service from their kind staff."}
{"text":"This was some of the best Mediterranean food I have eaten. The beef bowl with lentils was absolutely delicious and all of the fixings were fresh and really tasty. My food was ready right away and I could choose what items (hummus, beets, tomatoes etc.) to add to the bowl. It was absolutely amazing! My green smoothie was also very good! Perfect healthy option!"}
{"text":"I order to go lunches for staff meetings and decided to try Boaz.  It went perfectly! Every order was correct and the food was a hit. The prices are great as well.  I had a custom bowl with chicken and a variety of fresh vegetables and hummus.  It was wonderful.

Everyone enjoyed their lunches which makes me look good :)  I am hooked and I am ordering Boaz for our office again next week!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed. I get a bowl with lentil and a meat and then fill up on all the great Fixin's. Then I take it home and put it over leafy greens or kale and end up with two big salads for the week. They have so many very good items. The baba is amazing.

Try the spicy cauliflower. 

My only complaint is that their tongs are very small. So I have to ask for two or three x extra Of the things I really like & want to actually taste...Such as tabouli or pickles. JUST GIVE IT TO ME."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Boaz twice now, and I absolutely love it! The restaurant is usually fairly busy, but not overly crowded, and they are very quick with the orders. I love the sturdy tables and chairs, and the cute decor.

The first time we went with friends, I was secretly panicking on the drive over because I was the only vegan in our group, and I wasn't sure if there would be many options for me. But as soon as I got a look at the menu I was relieved! Not only do they have tons of options, but all the different dietary options are marked on the menu! It shows which items are vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, and contain nuts. It made ordering so easy, and I was impressed there were so many options! 

I love the power salad, which has greens, hummus, dressing, lentils, rice, cucumber, onions, and probably a few other veggies I'm forgetting. It's delicious! We've also had the hummus and falafel appetizer with the pita bread (it's so good that I crave this every day now), and the stuffed grape leaves. Everything is fresh and perfectly cooked, and a wonderland for your tastebuds. The staff is really friendly, and if you dine in they bring your food to your table, bus it for you, and stop by frequently to ask if you need anything. 

Aside from the friendly staff and the food being delicious, the prices were also awesome. For my salad, the hummus with falafel, stuffed grape leaves, and a mean green juice, the total was just over $20! I thought that was fantastic- especially for the fresh, quality ingredients, and generous portions.

Also, if you are a big fresh pressed juice drinker, then this is your holy land. The juices are SO CHEAP! $2 for a green juice!! I'm used to paying about $10 at another place (you know which one I mean.) So this place is like a dream. Boaz is delicious, healthy, affordable, friendly staff, fast service.... I really can't say enough good things. If you haven't still tried it, just go!! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally tried Boaz!  Super friendly owners and staff went out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed. Delicious fresh food similar to Aladdin's but with all kinds of new options and consolidated for quicker service. The prices are beyond reasonable for the quality and tastiness of the food. The space itself is great for eating in but takeout is offered as well. Can't wait to try more. They also have a ton of gluten free and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mediterranean style chipotle. Love that you can make your own \"bowl\" and pick your own ingredients. Fresh and delicious. Service could use a little improvement though. Location is good but there is only street parking. Prices aren't bad- a bowl is about $7 and a puta wrap is about $5-$6. I've been here twice and plan to come back again."}
{"text":"I gotta start this review just to highlight the $2 juices. Yes, you heard me right people, fresh pressed juice for the low, low price of $2. And that's not all folks: you can add chia seeds, wheat germ or flax seeds to your juice for just $.35. How do they do it? I have no idea and I don't care. If this alone doesn't bring you in the door, I don't know what will. Here I've been running all over town paying $9 for juice, when I could have just gotten it at Boaz for much, much cheaper! 

Boaz Cafe occupies the former Bonbon Cafe location. I'll spare you my lamentations on the loss of Bonbon, I don't think I'll ever truly recover, but what I can tell you is that the space is mostly set up the same. The main difference is that Boaz Cafe now offers fast casual service rather than table service. I had truly excellent service when I stopped in; the staff greeted me warmly, and I had multiple people explain the menu in case there was any confusion. Basically you can order off the menu a la carte, or you can order one of their $6 bowls and add all the toppings you want off their \"salad\" bar. I really was stunned at how affordable their prices are. This place feels quite trendy, the inside is really warm and comfortable, yet their prices are incredibly cheap. The menu choices remind me a lot of my longtime favorite Sittoo's, which offers delicious and affordable Lebanese food, but I can't always get out to their location. This is a perfect stand-in. They offer a lot of the same menu items such as schwarma/pitas, falafel, all of the obligatory middle eastern appetizers such as hummus, tabouli and kibbie, as well as one of my favorites: french fries seasoned with za'atar seasoning. You can easily order a really filling and tasty meal here for under $10, which is saying something in this part of town. My food was ready in just minutes, and I found the flavor to be really comparable to what I expected in terms of comparison to similar eateries. My only complaint is that I found the pickles and turnips in my pita to be a bit too thick which threw off the flavor balance of the pita as a whole, but that's if I'm being really nitpicky. Otherwise for a healthy, affordable meal, you really can't beat Boaz!"}
