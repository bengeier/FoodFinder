{"text":"I just ordered on the website, and selected the delivery option. No delivery an hour later so I called to confirm they had my order. They had the order, but then told me they don't offer delivery. They may have great food, but accepting a delivery order when they don't deliver is bad."}
{"text":"On Friday night my wife and I arrived at 9PM. The front doors were locked, though, it says open until 10PM. We went around the side, and walked in behind a man who was paying for his food. Staff member said they were closed. Staff member then told us we needed to look at the takeout menu hours as if we were wrong. Friday night open until 9:30PM. We of course were taken aback, because it was still 9PM. Either way, we were there 30 minutes before close, or 1 hour before close. Obviously looking dissatisfied, staff member explained had we come earlier we could have ordered, and followed us (literally to our car) outside to further explain they closed early because of Boss's orders and a slow night. Unfortunately, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Looks like they're out of business. Came by during lunch hour, which should be they're busiest time...doors are locked."}
{"text":"Finally!! We have lived in Ballantyne for 2 1/2 years without an easy express Japanese place. Now we finally have one!

Not only is this place cheap (and it is!!) but it is soooo good too. Another review mentioned how there weren't peas and carrots in the rice but they give you actual egg in the rice and a ton of veggies with the dish to make up for it. 

Another great thing about this place? Sushi! The boyfriend and I love sushi but it's too expensive to eat a lot. Not anymore! 

This is my second time and the boyfriend's first eating there. We got: teriyaki chicken, shrimp and chicken, crispy bagel roll, and avocado eel roll which were all fresh and delicious!

Just to recap: inexpensive  good standard dishes  legitimate sushi selection 

So excited to have them right down the road!! Please give them a try and spread the word so we can keep them around!!"}
{"text":"I will never eat there again. Went today for the first time just myself and my 8 week old when the gentleman at the register thought it was appropriate to ask me \"when are you due\" -after I sat down to eat, the cashier and he continued to talk about what was said and stare at me. I've never been so offended in my life. I will be spreading the word in the ballantyne area"}
{"text":"Yay!! A New Japanese quick service restaurant in the Ballantyne area! Been waiting for this place to open for a while. It's located in the conlan circle shopping center where five guys used to be. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is very clean! 

I ordered the hibachi chicken with noodles and the rest of the group ordered hibachi chicken, a side of noodles, and a hibachi chicken with rice. The food was fresh, hot, and tasty! It hit the spot and didn't break the wallet! Chicken was cooked perfect, veggies were tender and well seasoned, the noodles were divine! Gosh, I love noodles!!!  

 There were so many other things listed on the menu I wanted to try! The ramen was tempting (can't wait for a rainy day or fall!), they have bento boxes (so cute), and they even offer some standard Chinese dishes (general tso chicken). This is very convenient to our home and I can see us frequenting this fine establishment regularly in the future. The closest Asian/Chinese/Japanese restaurant was a 10 minute drive. This is a short walk and we can't wait to visit again!!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a hibachi pro. Over 50 different Japanese hibachi restaurants. 

I order teriyaki steak with fried rice. My wife ordered teriyaki veggies with fried rice (not listed on menu).

Taste: Very good. The shrimp sauce was perfect.

Quantity: I expected additional veggies. Typically sweet carrots come with similar meals at quick hibachi restaurants. The fried rice did not have any peas or carrots either.

Service: Quick, although we were only guest at the time. 

Price: Reasonable for the area but I expected carrots or more veggies in general."}
{"text":"Not the best quality in hibachi food. Vegetables are not fresh and appears to be pre-made/cooked. The set up is like a food court at the mall. Hopefully they're still working out the \"kinks\" as they are fairly still new."}
{"text":"Great location! Much needed Japanese express for the Ballantyne area. Great service! Food was great. Couldn't ask for more. Definitely a great new place!"}
{"text":"Quick easy take out at 7pm on a Thursday night. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great portion size, high quality chicken, clean establishment"}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki chicken and shrimp.  It was bland and didn't have even a hint of teriyaki flavor.  The fried rice and mixed vegetables were equally bland and tasteless. Definitely the worst meal I've had in years."}
{"text":"This place has great food. The people who serve there are friendly and the food is great. The shrimp sauce is one of a kind. Taste homemade."}
{"text":"Really passionate cashier bubbling with enthusiasm about this clean, new place. 

Sadly the Teriyaki chicken with fried rice and veggies was rather ordinary and tasteless. 

It's one and done for me . . ."}
{"text":"Mmm yummy! There aren't a lot of places like this in ballantyne. Quick hibachi food. We came on a Saturday around 730pm. The owner/manager there that day was really nice and helpful. He answered all of our questions. 

I got the chicken and shrimp hibachi with noodles. It wasn't a bad price. I think it was about $8-9. I got a good bit of noodles and they were delicious. Chicken and shrimp was good and cooked well. They also put in onions and mushrooms per my request. My husband got the all you can eat sushi. They had a decent amount of choices and there was someone in the back making more rolls. His favorite was the shrimp tempura roll with the crab salad on top. We went with two other people and they also got the sushi buffet. They both really liked the avocado roll. 

Overall, I would come here again. The restaurant itself is really updated and nice. Good amount of seating as well as easy parking!"}
{"text":"So I've lived in the Ballantyne area for quite some time and noticed a new Asian/hibachi restaurant where five guys used to be near duck worth ...I decided to stop in and check the place out. Upon entering I was amazed at the remodeling they did it's a very cozy and relaxed environment. With red and blue booths and chairs. I looked up above the register to see 4 tv screens displaying their full menu. I decided to order hibachi chicken and steak with fried rice. The price was decent not bad compared to other Restaurant for lunch. The lady told me to hold onto my receipt as she would call my number. I quickly found a seat and they bought my food out. The presentation was very pretty ...decent amount of chicken and steak with some veggies. The steak was tender served with a side of shrimp sauce. Drinks were self served. Over all I was very happy with my experience here and will be back again to dine in with my family."}
