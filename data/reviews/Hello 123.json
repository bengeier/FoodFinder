{"text":"Won't be back. Arrived at 3:15 and they are closed till dinner however the website says 9:30 to midnight or later?! Not only are they closed but the lovely lady behind the bar had attitude. Hope the food is good cause the service did not impress."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend on a weekday and it was great. The service was prompt and courteous and the food was very good. I'm not a vegan but I found that everything was flavorful and delicious. The dishes had generous portions. We shared three dishes between the two of us and took half of it home. We got the pineapple slider, chili cumin noodles, and cauliflower tahini. I was a big fan of the pineapple and chili cumin noodles. The cauliflower tahini was good, but nothing overly special. I would come back here again and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Me and Shakespare we are quite similar mens. We ask real,deep, Questions. To be or not to be? He ask...

And tonight im asking myself, Can someone make a Good Vegan Burger. Please 

But lets take it back to the beggining.


We arrived at this brand new Vegan restaurant and i was so pleased by the way it looks, the sun setting, the windows open and a fresh breeze coming in. What an amazing location and vibe.

The Staff is simply amazing, lots of care for your experience, great service, and quick to help you out! Service was a 5stars.

But well. The food.

We order 3 plates to get a good sample.

-Hummus, Crackers and Seed-Oat Toast
-Lettuce wrap paleo party
-Smashed avocado Burger

1.The hummus was quite okay. The seed oat bread was really good, the crackers were really blend and sunflowers forward. Just kinda boring

The hummus is served with mint and pomegranate. And it think that the wrong way to go. The fruit is too sweet for the hummus and the mint doesnt add anything.

2.The Lettuce Wrap Paleo Party was actually really good. Great mix of sauces, salad, vegetable, K & K hemp and sunflower balls were really good and the wrap quite pleasant.

But the burger... 

With an overload of avocado, an overload of everything and anything to hide the taste of that hideous pattie which was salty, tart, with a weird texture. just taste it by itself and try. You need the avocado to hide the taste. The burger and the side of damp wet fries are just disgusting. run run RUN

I would suggest to go and get the paleo to share with a drink. Now! thats a pleasant evening!"}
{"text":"A really cute spot! Welcome to the neighbourhood; I used to live across the street from here and still remember coming into the convince store to purchase random items. Good times. 

More delicious times are thanks to Hello 123 moving on in. Came here on the weekend and they wouldn't seat us until the full party was there, no matter, but baby it's cold outside. The space itself is very cute, full of plants and exactly as one would expect for the relatively new sit down spot of Kupfert & Kim. 

Everyone really loved their bowls, but this omnivore perhaps should have ordered something warmer, heartier. I had the Cauliflower Hummus Bowl ($13) with quinoa, cauliflower hummus, seasoned chickpeas, greens, za'atar salsa, carrots, cabbage, beets, mint, pomegranate, radish, sesame seeds, pickled onions, seed flatbread with lemon tahini. Favourites seemed to be the breakfast bowl with spiced tofu scramble! 

All in all, a good spot? Super healthy, super fresh, pretty busy but unfortunately in my experience, service that gets much better as you get closer to paying the bill."}
{"text":"I think when people hear that they're eating at a vegetarian they become pretty apprehensive about it. I came here with two guys who would typically not eat here, but you know it's good when they both said that they would come back and they were actually really surprised at how good it was!

What we got was the: Cauliflower Tahini (I really like this and normally get it at their sister restaurant Kupert and Kim), Almond Butter French Toast and the Bene Bene. 

I really like almond butter usually - which is why it wasn't much of a surprise that I liked this plate. The combination of blueberries and banana slices is a really nice combination. However, I'd recommend splitting this with someone - two slices of this can sit really heavy. 

As it is a vegetarian/vegan restaurant the Bene didn't actually have eggs. I honestly wasn't really sure what I was eating. It was really light and refreshing and actually tasted pretty good. I had half of one (it comes with two). I liked the portion that I had, but don't think I liked it enough to have both. The potato's were really good! 

It's definitely not cheap and not a fast casual lunch; however, the price point is fairly on point for a Toronto brunch spot. Hi"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! 
Would recommend the pulled pineapple and coleslaw burger, corn and sweet potato with avocado!
Lots of delicious ingredients!
Unfortunately the service wasn't great at all. No explaining of any of the dishes, no recommendations even when we asked for help and we waited too long before anyone came over, as did other customers too. It's a shame the service is so bad as the food is super tasty!"}
{"text":"While I was excited to try a new vegetarian brunch spot the service just killed this one for me. When we sat down I asked the server if it was possible to turn the music down just a little, as our table of 3 and the server couldn't hear what was being said without leaning over right into your lap. The server just flat out said no and that lowering the volume would mean no one could hear the music. The server then brought the food and disappeared until they decided to try and chat us up when it came time to tip. All being said the food, we had breakfast bowls and pineapple sliders were good, they just didn't redeem the attitude that the servers had toward the customers. With so much choice in Toronto no reason to go back here."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I decided to try this restaurant Thursday night. I was excited to try it after going to Kupfert and Kim on Spadina earlier in the summer. The restaurant is small inside. We arrived around 7:30pm and were lucky to get a table. We were seated at a very small table with stools for seating which I found really uncomfortable. Unfortunately there is no where to hang your coat or bag so I had to put my stuff on the floor under the table. Service was very slow. I ordered the Green XXXX bowl. The tempeh was the best part of the whole dish. My friend added tempeh to her noodle dish and they forgot to bring it. We reminded the waitress when she served our meals but still forgot. We asked again for it and she said that it would be on the house. When my friend received her bill the tempeh was still on it. It is unlikely I will return to this restaurant with so many options in the area."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were absolutely delicious. Even my omnivore friends liked it, there was something on the menu for everyone. It's a very small place but they were able to seat 9 of us, very accommodating."}
{"text":"basically repackaged version of kupfert and kim.
i got the cauliflower tahini bowl and it was alright"}
{"text":"Andrew was amazing!!! He's the bartender, and took care of a party of 6 perfectly! The food was great but the service better and Andrew is the best :)

The cashew cheesecake was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Arrived here at 7:30 on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant was packed, both inside and patio.  We were lucky to get the last 2 remains seats. 

We were seated promptly and asked if we wanted water and or another drink. We ordered collective arts, prophets and nomads sour draught and Norte Sur  2016 rose. Wine and beer both good. 

The patrons were mostly young ( we are in our 70s). The place is lively and happy. The patrons were about 90 percent female. 


We had half head of cauliflower. Very good. My kimchi burger was ok. Not bad but not great. My partner had the green bowl which he enjoyed but as with all bowls, you usually can't finish  


The service was great"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night for dinner around 8pm and got seated right away. But the tables by the window in the front we so tight it was hard to get in and out without worrying about knocking things off the table. The place itself is super cute, dimly lit for dinner and the service was good. But the music and audio level was SO LOUD in there. My friend and I could barely hear each other and yelling to have a conversation. We asked to move to the back because we couldn't even talk and it was slightly better. 

I got the Chana Chaat and it was delicious and the portion was large and I had some left to take home for lunch the next day for $13.50. Very filling with the chickpeas and brown rice and I love roasted cauliflower. Would come again to try the other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"I visited Toronto for a wedding last weekend. Our Airbnb was located on the same block as Hello 123 and half of our group was vegan, so we tried this place first thing when we arrived. I had the Chana chaat bowl and it was very good, super fresh and filling. My fiancé has the avocado smash burger and even though he is a big meat eater, he really enjoyed his meal. We drank the kombucha with ginger and lime (I think?) and it was refreshing and delicious. I enjoyed my meal so much that I insisted we come back 2 days later for breakfast. I had the breakfast bowl which was what breakfast bowls everywhere should aspire to be... SO delicious and filling. My fiancé has the French toast... also tasty as hell. I wish there was a good neighborhood vegan spot like it where I live!"}
{"text":"I got the benny benny. So good!!! This is my first time having a vegetarian meal and I was not disappointed. It was like a kale, tofu and feta scramble with avocado on top of a whole wheat English muffin. Comes with a side of potato fries and salad. Meal was about $17 with tax which is a good price for a vegan meal. The flavour was very good, it was very filling and the quality is definitely there. I would go back again to try something else."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend and we really enjoyed it. Neither of us are vegetarian or vegan but we like to try different types of food. We got the Lettuce Wrap Paleo Party and sliders to share which was just enough for the 2 of us. The star of the show was definitely the Lettuce Wrap Paleo Party. We loved everything about this dish except we could have done without the hemp and sunflower balls. They were quite hard and difficult to eat in a wrap form. I had to crush it apart first. The sliders were also just ok. We got them because we saw another table get them but I would suggest skipping this one if you had to choose. They tasted good but they weren't great. I think there are better things on the menu to try. Overall, I would definitely come here again. It's nice eating a meal and leaving feeling full but light!"}
{"text":"I live right across the street from this place. I've been so looking forward to trying it out! The decor is elegant and minimalist - lots of natural light, white walls, modern light fixtures, potted plants and exposed brick. I've walked past in the evening and seen candles in the windows too - a cozy touch. Not to mention the place is always packed! 

My friends and I stopped by today to grab a bite to eat. We seated ourselves toward the back of the restaurant. The little stools at the tables are super cute but they leave you without a place to hang your purse or jacket. We ended up leaving our things on the floor.

Unfortunately, our server seemed a bit indifferent or absent-minded. We did have to flag her down multiple times for drink menus and to order and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. We also ordered 2 beers and were, much to our dismay, brought half pints. 

The menus looked unreal! It's great to see such diversity in a vegan menu :) I had trouble choosing what to order. Everything sounded so good! I ordered the Spicy Bap. My friends had the Just Like Oaxaca and the Cauliflower Tahini. The food was wonderful. The presentation was almost too good to eat! (Almost). The Spicy Bap was delicious. Lots of different flavours and textures in the bowl and the veggies and tofu were cooked perfectly. It was, as promised, spicy! The portions were a little bit on the small side or maybe I was just super hungry or maybe it was just that good. I probably could've eaten another one. 

I would have to say my overall experience was okay, but not great. The service needs a bit of improvement but I'll definitely be back to try the cocktails and more of the menu items!"}
{"text":"Service: Needs work. In particular those waiting for a seat. Our existence was not acknowledged for quite some time. The people in front of us simply left and throughout the night I witnessed others leaving after not being acknowledged at the front door. You dont need to seat people immediately, but you need to acknowledge their presence and let them know the approximate timing. Otherwise service was decent, but not amazing.

Food: We stared with the pulled  pineapple slider and the tempeh tomatillo thing (3 tempeh on skewers). Both good. For mains my friend had the Lettuce Wrap Paleo Party, which is described as \"fun\" on the menu. If messy means fun then I guess it was fun. The taste was good, but I think they should consider using bib lettuce. I had the chick peak cauliflower bowl and it was quite good as well. No complaints on the food. The wine and cocktail list is good as well. 

Vibe: Hipstery Cool

Price: Standard hipster pricing

I would definitely go again to try other dishes on the menu.

Also be sure to scroll down and look at the 21 5 star reviews that yelp is currently 'not recommending'. Very strange!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars! 

Totally delicious, affordable, and their staff are amazing! 

I came here for brunch on a Sunday with a girlfriend. We ordered the pancakes (10/10), and the green bowl (9/10). My only issue with the green bowl was the abundance of quinoa - I will definitely ask for more veggies, and half the quinoa next time. 

The staff were super friendly, the drinks were all so delicious (and healthy), and you leave feeling fresh and light! 

I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The lettuce wrap was amazing. 

Service wasn't great, I asked for a takeout container for leftovers and she gave me a bowl. My dish had several items on the plate that ended up being mixed up in the bowl and I was unable to eat. I didn't even ask her to pack it for me, but seemed apprehensive to give me this bowl, it was pretty off putting. 

Also when I try to order on Ritual they cancel and close the option to order. And on Foodora you can't order. 

Because of the poor service and takeout issue I sadly have to give this place a 3 star. How can they except to compete with Fresh? Upsetting!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across Hello 123 while looking for a place to have a quick bite for lunch today. The restaurant is quite new, so I was excited to find a new vegan restaurant in the area. 

The aesthetic of the restaurant is super cute, and bright with lots of big windows and lots of plants around the doorway, which is a lovely little touch.

The menu looked super promising and I had a hard time deciding what I was going to have. The service was really quite disappointing. Our waitress was lovely, but seemed a bit spacey and kept forgetting that we were sitting there to the point where we had to flag her down for almost every interaction we had. I ordered the \"Just like Oaxaca\" bowl and a beer because they were not serving any cocktails for some reason. When our drinks finally came, I was given the wrong drink and had to ask for the proper one. 

The food was the saving grace of our experience today. I really enjoyed my food and would definitely order it again. As the place is still new, I chalk it up to the staff still trying to find their legs and I hope that after some time the service improves."}
{"text":"Toronto is blessed with having a pretty decent amount of vegan and vegetarian restaurants these days. What I like about Hello 123 is that it is neither \"super healthy, everything is made from spelt and organic lentils, etc\" and \"we invented a crazy fake meat and covered it in this crazy fake cheese and deep fried it.\" Don't get me wrong, both of those options are awesome, and serve a purpose. But Hello 123 is just nice nourishing, filling, tasty food that also happens to be animal product free. Its like the stuff you would make for yourself or your friends at home, if you were a slightly better cook and had a bit more time to make something special. Plus cocktails :)

Recently I went with a friend for a late dinner and we shared a few apps as a meal. We got the elotes (Mexican street corn), the Cauliflower with vegan hollandaise and pomegranate, and the sweet potato sin carne (so with beans, and a healthy topping of lightly dressed arugula). Everything was super tasty. The vegan hollandaise was great, and I loved he little juicy pops of pom every now and again. The Sweet potato was probably my favourite. It felt like camping food in the best way - nourishing, hearty, fresh. The corn was good, but it was just one cob split in two, which felt a little small tbh. 

We also both had the same cocktail because it sounded the most refreshing on that muggy night. And it was. I think it was called \"Pinkish Summer\" and it was gin, watermelon juice, lime, basil, black pepper and ginger beer. SO GOOD. 

All in all, I'll definitely be saying \"Hello\" to Hello 123 again and again."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Kupfert and Kim so I was excited to come and try Hello 123. Hello 123 is located near Queen and Dovercourt in the bustle and hustle of Queen Street West. The place has a relaxed chill vibe which is great to go with friends or by yourself if you want a quick bite to eat. I came by twice, once for brunch on a Sunday and another time on a weekday for lunch. Both times, service was friendly and attentive. 

Brunch on Sunday was quite busy but my friend and I were able to get a table around 12:30pm (no wait!). We both shared the breakfast bowl and the cauliflower tahini bowl. Both were delicious! We didn't sit there and chat for hours but during our time there we never felt rushed or hurried to leave. The second time I went for lunch at around 11:30pm on a Wednesday. The restaurant was pretty quiet and I heard the staff telling other customers that the lunch rush usually happens after 12:30pm. Service during that visit was quick and I ordered the just like oaxaca bowl. Delicious and filling. 

I definitely will be back for more in the future."}
