{"text":"I've gone there twice, once when it first opened then again tonight.  Both times extreemly disappointed.   I only went back to give it another shot since I was hopping for my first night going was just an off night.  I was wrong.  The pizza honestly was gross.  It was cold, dough is heavy and flavorless,  sauce was watered down, pepperoni was bad quality and the cheese was actually the only good part.
We unfortunately left half of it and fed it to the birds outside lol.
I wouldn't recommend this place truthfully at all.
Worst part was the owner gave my pizza to another costumer by accident and made me wait another 15 minutes to make and other one."}
{"text":"From order time to pizza delivery...over 1hr and pizza arrived cold! Mind you, this was a Thursday night at around 5:30. Nevertheless, it shouldn't take that long.  Also, they are located a mere 5 minutes from the house. Pizza was sent back with driver and a phone call was made.
 
On the positive side, spoke with manager and she was very accommodating and apologetic and rectified the mess up. A new pizza was delivered very fast and efficiently, hot, with a generous amount of toppings and perfect amount of cheese. The flavor was great, your average pizza. Crust nicely done, good tasting sauce."}
{"text":"We normally visit Pizza Nova or Ginos when the craving for pizza is upon us but we decided to give this place a try.  I love to support small local business so I was very excited to try this place. It is a small location in a plaza surrounded by a neighbourhood enclave.  Mostly take-out but they do have a few tables to eat in if you'd prefer. Our order consisted of a large pizza and an order of lasagna. Our order was ready fairly quick and we returned home hungrily and ready to dig in: First,  the pizza: We ordered a large meat lovers pizza which consisted of pepperoni, sausage, ground beef and ham.  The pizza was cooked well however,  wasn't as flavourful as we hoped.  The crust is more of a 'bread\" style crust,  not really crispy as we prefer.  Overall,  I would say it wasn't horrible, but nothing to write home about either. Perhaps a step up from a frozen grocery store pizza.  On to the lasagna:  In short,  it was horrible.  Soggy, gummy noodles, sauce that tasted like a cross between tomato paste and ketchup, rubbery cheese and a burnt bottom.  My toddler who lives on pasta of any kind woulden't even eat it after the first bite. Overall this place satisfied my curiosoty however,  we will not be returning.  Still on the hunt for a new mom-and-pop pizza shop."}
{"text":"We picked up our pizza and the service in store was decent. The pizza was delicious, would absolutely buy from them again. The prices are reasonable and taste way better than higher priced competitors."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious.  The crust definitely makes it stand out from other pizza places and the toppings are delicious too.  We've only walked in to place an order and have gotten it within the time they said."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  We ordered weekly! But just found out their pizza and Wing deal went up by $7 over night!  It is now over $30! Back to pizza Pizza :( lost customer"}
{"text":"New to Ajax, and typically ordered pizza from pizza pizza. Started exploring and found this gem tucked away. The pizza is delicious, crust is delicious, and the service is great. We haven't ordered during any rush periods, but service has been quick. The prices are decent, (3 topping medium pizza is $12), but its the quality of the dough and ingredients they use. They also offer free delivery within a certain distance, good for those days where you don't have time to drop by.

Been ordering from here ever since! (closes at 10pm!)"}
{"text":"Oh so good. My husband loves the panzerotti and I love a simple pepperoni pizza. Such good taste and a nice change from the typical chains. Great little hidden gem in Ajax!"}
{"text":"Aj is awesome chef and amazing at taking orders, by far clean and great prices. Will be going back, however, the wings were very oily! So no to wings."}
{"text":"The best halal Pizza I've had in the GTA...Love their crust and toppings, especially the jerk chicken pizza!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Love the wings and HALAL options. And delivery!!!

Have tried this place several time and always consistent. 
Very nice to have a local pizzeria in the neighbourhood instead of big box chains."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this pizza joint.  The pizza is great (especially compared to the generics like Pizza Pizza).  We always get the family fun deal and upsize it to large pizzas.  For $41 overall you get dinner plus alot of leftovers to cover a lunch or two.  The folks working here are always friendly and the food is made quickly.  For pizza in Pickering/Ajax, ever since Pie closed down this is the only place for us."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst place to order a pizza. I decided to order local to support local businesses and this place threw that right back in my face. Ordered my pizza at 5:57 and it arrived at 6:10 ice cold and inedible. When I called to complain about timing they challenged me on the time with a dismissive tone and even laughed at it (I ordered from my cell and I had the time stamps). No apology whatsoever, no nothing. He went on to claim the guy in went from the store straight to my house. That's an outright lie since it is literally 9 mins away. Guy on the phone was an absolute weasel and I think it's the environment of this place. I have no idea how this place is in business. The pizza itself is garbage. I reheated it in my oven and it literally taste like a frozen pizza. Save yourself some time and a potential disaster and order from another place or go to a grocery store and buy a Dr. Oetker pizza for the same experience sans the loser at the counter and snail mail delivery speed."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of this pizza.  It was quite bland and the crust is more like bread than crust.  The sauce has an okay flavor but the rest is blah.  Good price though if you pick up.  I got a medium double cheese for $5.65. If you're not too picky on pizza it's worth a try for the price."}
{"text":"First time here. The service was great!  Next time I'm going to try the jerk chicken pizza"}
