{"text":"Walking by and looked inside and it made me walk inside. The atmosphere is incredible and you can actually site on the bikes here Amazing. The coffee was one of the best in the neighbourhood. The guy making my coffee actually puts all he's got. 10 stars guys!!!!!!  Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"What a cool place! My friend and I stumbled upon this gem while on our way to another coffee shop up the street from there. We decided to give it a try and I'm so glad we did. Coffee is uh-mazing! Seriously, one of the best almond milk lattes I've ever had. They use quality coffee beans and the baristas really know what they're doing! Lastly, the concept and the atmosphere really make it the coolest and most unique coffee shop around."}
{"text":"Harley Davidson is really trying to make an impression on Ossington, from their hipster style décor to the exclusive blends named after Harley models (883 is the exclusive btw), 1903 manages to be a real café, while also promoting their vintage and current model bikes.

At the front are their new models on display, while at the back you see more rare vintage models, and can also take a test ride if you so prefer.  

During the Ossington Crit, you can see all the motor-less bikes whizz by on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"I was in the area today therefore I decided to stop by especially since I love Harleys but coffee not so much lol. I had a very good iced tea that they made right there As well as a very delicious cookie which I forget what it was called but it was good! The staff there were very friendly! If you've never been on a motorcycle before they also have a motorcycle in the back where you get the feel of it. You get to sit on a harley, start it, shift gears, throttle it. It doesn't move but you still get a feel for it. Cool place, nice bikes, nice drinks & food and of course great staff!"}
{"text":"they seem like have moved to another location. Visit the cafe today but inside was all empty...."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere. Pleasant barista. The espresso blend was delicious. I really enjoyed it and I would come back."}
{"text":"Opened today! Had to see it! Will be better once crowded and full of bikes. Coffee's great and operated by very friendly folks."}
