{"text":"Three words : absolutely disgusting restaurant.  How can I review this restaurant ... First of all , the food was disgusting and expensive.   In fact , I had a take out order of a souvlaki combo. Well , my plate that usually comes with a salad in any Greek establishment was not there . Instead , I had a souvlaki which meat was not even cooked properly as it was still reddish . Then , this came with a pack of fries that came from McCain frozen food -- absolutely garbage as it was full of salt . It was not even worth taking a picture for future customers to see.  Add another aspect of something I really disliked . My order took 20-25 mins to be made and given to me . Seriously ? It's a day week and the restaurant was not busy . I saw a man who knew the manager or boss walked in after me for a take out order and was served before me ? Moreover, I've asked the person who took my order whether it was possible to have water instead of a soft drink , she told me it was possible , and instead she charged me for the water without warning me , thanks a lot I felt conpletly deceived . How is this acceptable . I worked in the restaurant industry for years and such service can be describe as complete crap and unprofessional .  Honestly If I could I would give this restaurant zero stars as it's take out standards are garbage . Various coworkers of my office have also told me to avoid this restaurant and thereby , following my experience, I do not recommend it to anyone .   Avoid at all costs , you'll be served a lot faster, with more food and a cheaper price at fairview'a food court upstairs."}
{"text":"I had a simple egg breakfast here, it was cooked per my request and the service was fast and friendly. The meal was appropriately priced. I would come back here again. It is an expansive menu."}
{"text":"Nice and clean deli with great service.   The smoked meat may not have been Schwartz's, but it came pretty close - probably the best on the West Island.   Club sandwich was huge with a large portion of chicken breast.  My only complaint about the food were the fries. More like McDonalds than Montreal fries.   Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have only ever had the smoked meat sandwich, so I can't comment on any of the other food options there. Based on that, I would highly recommend this place: excellent sized portions for the money and much better smoked meat than I've had at other places in the area."}
