{"text":"What a great place.  Reasonably priced and always friendly, plus, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years and have never had a bad experience. Everything I've ordered from the menu has been excellent and is always a more than fair portion. My favorite thing about the place is the fantastic service though. All the servers there are very friendly and do a great job. After months of not going there upon walking in I've been greeted by long time no see and big smiles."}
{"text":"great place, Awesome food, friendly service, bathrooms are clean and the atmosphere is calm (Sun City, hehe). The only bummer is that the kitchen closes from 230 - 5pm.  My favorite flavors are the southern Asian cuisines; Thai, Vietnamese, Muong, & a touch of Indian. This is very good Thai. This is a BIG favorite lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"I was told this place is amazing for THAI food, I happened to be in town for the weekend and decided to check it out.  First thing I noticed when I walked in was how clean the place was. It was clean, organized, and the color of the place blended really well.  We were greeted right away and seated. The wait staff is very friendly and attentive (came back and filled our water glasses frequently).  We ordered the shrimp pad thai, silver noodle with shrimp and a soup (can't think of the name). I highly recomend these. We ordered them with mild spice, but you can get them anyway you like.  It def was one of the best Thai places I've been too.I will def return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the facility has a smell about it that turns my stomach. Upon looking around the carpet is grossly dirty."}
{"text":"The spring rolls are good! We didn't think the pork fried rice was anything but greasy and flavorless! No one greeted us when we came in and we waited for a table in front of their sign for five minutes before we saw an employee, who did not greet us or seat us! Hmm...not sure the service was as good as the spring rolls. A star for each and -3 for the extra grease!"}
{"text":"We are repeat customers here. Their service is always great and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Omg! My friend and I came here yesterday and I had the yellow curry which was filled with grease and the rice sucked. I could cook better! My friends looked like dog food and was pad Thai. We both have been sick since yesterday, no joke I literally feel the grease sitting in my gal bladder or somewhere in there. I have my mother over taking care of my kids because of how bad I feel. My friend just said she's pooping her brains out right now lol, that had me rollin. At least we're still alive and my yellow curry had 1 potato in it and like 3 cut up carrots. Wow first timers and got ill!   Be aware !! Seriously they need an inspection and under cover to see what is going on!  Thanks for reading, I just wanted to share."}
{"text":"Visited on 07/07. As a West Valley resident, I'm still searching for a great Thai restaurant closer to home. Hubby and I usually go to Scottsdale for really good Thai food. It was our wedding anniversary, so we wanted to go out, to a place we hadn't been before. We were going to dine at another Thai place around 83rd & Bell, but it had received such horrible reviews of their food and service, we decided to give Line Thai a try. Line Thai had actually been recommended by an associate who is Thai herself. We started out with the chicken satay appetizer. While the flavor was pretty good, the bright orange color and slightly rubbery texture of the chicken was a little off-putting. Loved the little sliced cucumbers/onion/jalapeno it came with, though. I ordered Thai BBQ chicken, which arrived on a sizzling flat skillet. White meat was a bit dry, but the dark meat was very tasty. Hubby judges all Thai restaurants by their Pad Thai, so ordered their version, medium spice. He gave it a thumbs up. I thought it was okay, with a little more tang to it than I'm used to. Prices are very reasonable and portions were enough for leftovers. As an aside, I used the leftover chicken in a fried rice dish I made the next day (really good flavor), and the Pad Thai actually tasted better the next day. The owners/servers are extremely kind, albeit a bit on the shy side, but efficient. Our dishes were served promptly, and our water glasses were filled without us having to ask. I'm still in search of a WOW factor, and I didn't get it from this visit. However, we would visit again and maybe order a couple of other dishes to really make a firm decision on this place."}
{"text":"I got the vegetable soup for an appetizer,  and stir fried vegetables in spicy garlic sauce for dinner . My wife got the Phad Thai with shrimp and chicken. Very authentic and tasty. Service is good and friendly. The place can use some remodeling though. Will definitely be back again.."}
{"text":"Was visiting my Mom in the area and had a hankering for some Thai food (I am spoiled living in LA area with plethora of choices). We started with tum yum gai soup which was delicious.  Well balanced with spicy and flavor of lemongrass and chicken.  Also ordered fish cakes appetizer also wonderful!  Ordered Pad Thai and Gapow with beef as main dishes and all very authentic and delicious.  Service was quick and friendly while the inside environment is clean and nicely decorated.  I highly recommend this for some good, tasty authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"The food was great! Clean and fresh and delicious. We had the satay appetizer, the larb (called \"Lap\" on the menu) and the duck with bok choy. Everyone cleaned their plates. Recommend mild to medium for the average American palate. Our service was genuinely friendly and engaged-- all questions were answered with attention toward our preference. The smiles from the staff were heartfelt.  Perhaps not much to look at from the outside, but don't let that throw you. Found this place neat and clean and well considered from the moment we went inside. The bathrooms were clean. The decor is simple and understated but the wall carvings and statues are definitely hand crafted."}
{"text":"Location and style leave a lot to be desired, but ambiance is only one of many reasons to go out to eat.  For over $10 a dinner entrée (for takeout or 80s style dining) I had high expectations which were met in the food: if only just.  I had the pad Thai (extra spicy) and my companion had the spicy chicken fried rice.  The pad Thai was medium at best and of a smaller portion than you would get at Pei Wei (for $2 more) but was of good quality.  Hard to completely fault them there being in Sun City territory.  My single sample of my companions fried rice is what really hosts the review.  Flavor, texture and portion (nearly double that of my more expensive entrée) was great.  Hope to come here again in the future to update the review."}
{"text":"Best Thai food!!!  Order the dry garlic chicken."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Their Pad Thai is the best in the valley (since Satara closed.)  And, I love their salad with peanut dressing.  My favs!!!"}
{"text":"Sun City decor, but good food & service."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years!  The food is fabulous (I have never had anything that I have not liked).  The service is so considerate and attentive!  I could not ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Not remotely authentic,  not remotely Thai,  not remotely good.  Tried a few items off the menu.  Fresh roll, noodle dish,  and a rice dish.  All were less than appealing and didn't taste good.  Food lacked flavor but had more than enough grease and oil."}
{"text":"I've eaten Thai food up and down the Western US and Hawaii. This is the best I've tasted. True, I've never been to Thailand, so I don't know what authentic Thai food tastes like. However, the food here is tasty. They have many options for Vegans. The place is clean with a peaceful atmosphere. The staff is friendly, prices reasonable, and service unexcelled."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant yesterday for lunch.  As we walked in, two other couples walked in, which I thought was a good sign.  I really wanted to love this restaurant because it is near our home.  Hubby and I both ordered from the lunch menu.    I had the vegetarian noodle lunch.  The noodles and sauce were very flavorful; however, the vegetables were lukewarm, almost cold.  It seemed like they cooked the noodles and simply tossed in pre-cooked vegetables at the very end.    Hubby had the chicken lunch.  He took a couple of bites and pushed his plate away.  He gave me some of the chicken to try, and the chicken had almost no flavor at all.  My husbnd is a meat and veggie guy, and since he was hungry, he filled up on the rice, something he rarely does.    On the positive side, we both enjoyed the soup very much.  I am willing to give Line Thai another try (everyone deserves a second chance), but I doubt my husband will go back."}
{"text":"They changed the menu since I was here last. The Phad Thai was not as good as I remember. My mom ordered the eggplant with chicken, it was okay, she said she would not order it again. My husband ordered the Beef Green Curry extra \"Thai hot\". It was very hot, however they skimped on the amount of Beef in the dish. It should be called a Vegetable green curry with a Beef garnish.  There were only two servers for the whole dining area, they were overwhelmed due to a large group of 15 people, the service was slower than usual.  The place is cheap and clean. I'd recommend the satay chicken for an appetizer.  Overall it's an okay place...it's the Thai food restaurant in Sun City. I'd miss the old Line Thai, maybe they got a new cook?"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for dinner on a Friday night ... after driving past all the chain restaurants at Arrowhead with the long lines, we decided to try Line Thai instead.  No lines!  We had the Green Curry and Phad Egg Plant.  Both were excellent.   Everyone was friendly and the service was great!  However, the coconut ice cream was the best!  We'll definitely go back the next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"I ordered two green curries to-go: one chicken and one tofu. The curry in general was extremely watery and had no flavor, although the tofu curry had SLIGHTLY more substance than the chicken one. The tofu curry came with a few vegetables in it; the carrots were browned/dirty looking on the edges. The chicken in the chicken curry was dry. There was nothing else in the chicken curry besides a ton of bamboo shoots - it took up so much space in the container that there was barely any room for the curry itself.   The rice was a mix between mushy and chewy.   If curry is what you're looking for, you can get better tasting curry elsewhere for a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a few years now. I was born in Bangkok and am half Thai. My mother also owned a top valley Thai restaurant back in the 80's. Before she passed on.   I love the Prik King nya here. It is green beans with red chili paste and beef. Very tasty!  Also a great soup to try is Tom kha gai. It is a cocconut milk,lime broth with chili, chicken, mushroom and galangal( like a thai ginger root). All their soups are great, but I like this and the wonton the best. And the shrimp fried rice rocks! I love it. When you go, get a side of prik kee noo, or just say chili's with fish sauce. They bring out a little bowl of it and is the best sauce I tried at any thai place. Even better then my moms sauce. One of the best salads to get is the Som Tam. WOW! I loved this. An exquisite mix of flavors just burst in your mouth. My husband who has never had this expected it to be fruity because it is made with papaya. But this is unripe papaya and its nice light and crunchy. I am not real crazy about the noodle dishes. It can be hit or miss. I have ordered pat thai here before a few times, and it is always different. So now I stick to my other favorites and hopefully I can find awesome pat thai somewhere..I am so picky when it comes to that particular dish. I would never go into a Thai restaurant and order something bland or something like sweet and sour chicken. The staff here is always friendly!Give it a shot and see how ya like it! lunch specials here are great with much variety. There is also a vegetarian section for those non meat lovers."}
{"text":"From the outside it looks lonely in a bare parking lot, but the inside is is much different. Nicely decorated and spacious. I was craving Thai Iced Tea and elided to give it a shot based on reviews here. The food was yummy and priced really conservative compared to other Thai places I've been. The Thai Tea was good, not the best I've had but it definitely satisfied my craving. But what I love most about this place is the service; the waiters (undoubtedly part owners) were so nice and accommodating. There was a male and female and the guy had a perpetual smile on his face. I was really pleased I went here because both were so welcoming and helped make suggestions on the menu. I would not hesitate to go back when my pad thai craving rolls around."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. This is the first time I visited the Line Thai Restaurant. The atmosphere was pleasant, the service was good, and the food tasted great.  I will definitely be here again. If the service and food remains this good,  I'll up the rating to 5 stars.  Definitely a decent value for the money."}
{"text":"Super disappointing visit. No idea what's going on here. Flavor was totally lacking in all of our dishes. The green curry...was there even curry in it?  The heat was there, but from what? Not any ingredient I could figure out. And canned mushrooms! Yuck. I know they had fresh ones in the kitchen because they were in our soup.  Speaking of the soup, it was missing lemongrass and cilantro. The pad Thai was presented with one, sad string of cilantro and no lime or lemon. Even the rice was overcooked and flavorless, like the cheapest rice available. We all had enough left for another meal, but no one wanted to take it home. From now on, we will stick with Tom Yum and skip this one."}
{"text":"Great thai resturant. The food is always great and the staff is very professional. I highly recommend Line Thai. My favorite is the #39 medium spiced."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever eaten here has been FABULOUS.  I have tried every curry they serve and it's hot spicy wonderfulness tailored to your own personal heat level.  If you like Thai food, you have to try this place."}
{"text":"Curry was marginal at best and portion size for lunch was rather small. Plus, when I made a request from the server after I got my \"lunch\" sized portion to upgrade to the dinner size, he just laughed and said he couldn't do that. Told him I wouldn't be back in and he said, \"That's ok sir, have a good day\"."}
{"text":"Great thai food at a great price. Love the curry and the noodle dishes. We've only gotten take out but I look forward to dining in soon. The woman at the counter was friendly and the place looked very clean. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I contacted the lady owner of this restaurant letting her know of my complaint stated in my previous review. She took responsibility for their policy of no substituting on the rice, explained they cook everything as it is ordered and cost wise can not do substitutes which really did not make sense to me but ok, and refunded me the cost of the dinner stating if I was not happy with their restaurant she did not want to take my money. I appreciated this but am at a loss why they don't tack on a dollar or two and let people substitute on the rice served with entrees. Because of this, I still can not recommend this eatery but really do appreciate my refund."}
{"text":"Looked at Yelp reviews and had high expectations . Presentation was good but taste was below average ... The vegetarian curry was smelling like it may have had some fish sauce ... I reconfirmed with the waiter and he denied ..   I would never go there again nor recommend to anyone ...  Pl. avoid and don't try !!!"}
{"text":"I've never had Thai food before but my husband is obsessed. I had no idea what to try, but I went with #38. the phrik khing curry with chicken. wow. that was the best choice I could have ever made!! it was so freaking good!"}
{"text":"The 4-star rating must be geographically influenced because there isn't anything special about Line Thai. When you first walk in, it feels, looks and smells old - like a cafeteria for elderly people with Thai decorations. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly but the food was mediocre. The crab puff appetizer was your basic attempt and the curry (yellow & red) were bland and watery, unlike any Thai restaurant I've ever been too. There are much better Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"OMG. I just experienced the WORST service ever!!! When ordering the lunch special and asked the waitress for  the soup choices I had for my included soup her response \"its chicken broth with noodles!\" And let me point out with an attitude.  Only asked because it did not specify which soup was included with the lunch special and their menu did have a list of soups.   Then After watching everyone arriving after us getting  their food before we did, I get my dish which was soooo bland I had to ask for soy sauce (by the time I was able to get her attention for service, my lunch date was already done with their lunch).  After dousing the chicken in soy sauce to make it eatable, i couldn't eat it. As she came to pick up our plates I mentioned I was not happy with my meal, before I could finish her response\"its sautéed in oyster sauce and what you want !?! A fancy dish?!?\"  AH! Really?!?!   And please note 1) im NOT  a picky eater and 2) I am very well versed in Thai food. I come from Thailand raised in -laws."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Love the chairs on wheels. Recommend"}
{"text":"Horrible food quality. The two dishes we ordered were greasy, watery, and lack of flavor. The thai fresh roll was probably the worse I had from a restaurant. The worse part was I got stomach ache the next morning."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and were amazed at the speed, efficiency, and cleanliness of the staff and the dining room. And the food was delicious! Lunch special s are inexpensive and very filling."}
{"text":"Decent Thai but I have had better..more than likely will not go back. The service was good though so I gave it a 3 based on that aspect alone. The pad thai was made with a weird powder instead of the usual spice and my red curry was kind of bland. The owner however is really nice so if you want exceptional service but mediocre food, give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is a little overpriced for their food AND it does not look or taste authentic but more Americanized. (In pad se ew they use regular broccoli Instead of Chinese broccoli) my food was a bit over cooked and I'm not sure if they cook big batches and reheat them or what because I had a piece of cold chicken mixed in with my warm food. Overall the taste was still good."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and there are not many good options in this part of town... soo thankful for Line Thai! Every dish I've tried has been delicious and the service has been good whether I dine in or order take out.  P.s. If planning for a large group or for reservations, keep in mind that the \"crowd\" here tends to come from Sun City, so is a bit older."}
{"text":"The best Thai Food in the Phoenix Metro Area.The portions are amazing.The food is great,and the prices are very low for the amount of food they give you.Great Place."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food ! This is a favorite take out for my family. 4 stars because the restaurant definitely needs updating. The currys are wonderful and you are always greeted with a smile."}
{"text":"I was fairly surprised to visit Line Thai and find some decently authentic, good-tasting Thai food. I'd always assumed that this area of Phoenix was (excuse me for the pun) totally dry on ethnic food, considering I had a hard time finding pho within a ten-mile radius of my parents' place in Surprise.  Anyways, I chose the pad si yew (spelling varies all over the place, I think they spell it \"phat si iew\") and my father ordered some kind of chicken cashew dish. Both were excellent, though a little more in the line of American tastes -- not as spicy, and the pad si yew wasn't cooked slightly burnt like I recall it traditionally is made -- it was pretty tasty.  The hot tea was a great companion to my meal as well.  The service was great without being too pushy, invasive, or sloppy. They always refilled my water in a timely manner and didn't interrupt my conversation with my dad. That's important to me -- that servers don't bust into your conversation with little to no consideration of personal space.  My parents had been there several times and enjoyed it, so now I see why they liked it. Oh, and their spring rolls and the accompanying peanut and hot sauces were also delicious -- not the best I've ever had but super-tasty.  The atmosphere is a little dry (what is it with this word? Sorry) but I can live with it. The booths were comfy and it's not like the place was musty or gross. Not every good restaurant needs to be chic and trendy, really.  All in all, it was a nice experience at a reasonable price and I'll definitely make a visit next time I hang out with the 'rents."}
{"text":"Now being Thai myself, I'm very particular of my Thai food. The owner of Line Thai is a friend of my family but most Thai people all know eachother.   The owner is so kind. Recognizes myself and family every time we stop in. I'm sure he does the same for all his regular customers.   The food is very good. I'm still very particular about some dishes but I still recommend Line Thai versus a lot of other Thai food places in the valley.   I hope people give them a chance.  To me, great service can definitely make your food experience a whole lot better and tastier. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see the decor upon entering the restaurant. I was imagining a tiny hole in the whole restaurant but was pleasantly surprised. The staff were friendly and we were seated promptly. We ordered seafood thom kah (we asked for seafood to be added), pad seew, and #41 eggplant dish. The seafood thom kah was served a few minutes after ordering and was very good. I wished it was a little bit more spicier but we did asked for \"medium\" spiciness. The other two dishes arrived maybe 25 minutes after we ordered. (reason for 3 stars). And that was the only bad thing.. Both dishes were delectable. My picky 2 yr old liked the noodles so much that he did a happy dance while eating."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots for Thai! The Tom Yum Gai is crazy delicious. If you get a chance try the #38. We do ours medium with chicken and add carrots and bell peppers."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times since discovering this gem last Fall.  Superior customer service -  cheerful staff.  From appetizers,  fried rice, noodle dishes, fish entrees, each order has been delicious and substantial.  Prices are fair and portions large so with leftovers, we get two meals for the price of one.  Clean restaurant - it's obvious this family run business strives to be the best."}
{"text":"Real Thai food. I spent two months traveling and eating my way through Thailand from the beaches of Koh Samui to Chaing Mai and the mountains. This place has the best khao soi I have had in the states."}
{"text":"Called to do an order for pick up and then was asked if I could pick it up before 2:30. I said no and was going to ask if they were closing. Before I could even ask I was told \"Goodbye Ma'am\" and was hung up on. I understand somethings but not being told an explanation and hung up on is not the way to conduct business. Period."}
{"text":"Is this place hip, trendy or pretty in any way? No. Do they make amazing food? YES. Ive eaten here many times and tried several things...many of the curries, soups, the phad eggplant (which I get cravings for all the time) as well as many of their shrimp, chickn and noodle dishes. I have never had a bad meal here. Ever. The food is fresh, authentic and tasty. They will respect your need (or lack of) for spicyness. The staff is very sweet. I will keep on coming here and would recommend this unassuming place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food here.  I always get the bananas with honey for dessert!  Try it!  As for the food they use just a little too much oil.  The service staff are so kind.  I will come here from time to time when I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Ordering Chicken Curry is the standard way to compare Thai restaurants.  Their curry is so good, I rarely order anything else!  Great Thai in Sun City area, and just a step away from Arrowhead Mall."}
{"text":"My husband and I just love this place. When we first moved here, we tried a couple chinese places and were consistently disappointed because they never seemed to know what \"spicy\" meant - at least to us. Spicy chinese food is NOT really that spicy at all. Plus, I'm a picky eater when it comes to meat, and when I order chicken, I like pure chicken breast, not something that looks molded together to be chicken. Line Thai offers us both. The spicy is seriously spicy, and the chicken is of such good quality and cooked so well, that we just keep coming back here for both reasons. Plus, it's almost nearly a $1 cheaper per dish than chinese food, is healthier, and we like that the place is never crowded when we visit. Best thai food we've ever found so far. Totally recommend it."}
{"text":"We go to Line Thai often and love the food.  They have the best soups and curries.  This is one of our favorite thai food spots in Phoenix.  It's cheap and high quality.  Judging from the outside, wouldn't really necessarily grab my attention but is worth checking out for some good spicy comfort food.  I have been referred here by a few people separately and decided to try - definitely worth it.  And the wait staff is always friendly and helpful.  Feels a little like family when you're there.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love it here!  We have tried almost everything - and everything is great!  I enjoy the panang myself and the hubby likes the yellow curry and the garlic vegetables.  We go at least once a week.  We've been to other Thai places and we consider ourselves Thai snobs - this is really authentic Thai.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Do not get seafood soup unless you like chewing squid, pongant fish and a sever that doesn't explain that the wood chip in the soup is not to be eaten.."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. We have been looking for a new a Thai place and this place did not disappoint. The garlic chicken was our favorite but the chicken with green beans and chili paste didn't disappoint either."}
{"text":"Went here with my homegirl.... restaurant was full which was a good sign. they served us quickly and the food didn't take long to come out. I had yellow curry with chicken medium hot and my friend had pat thai medium hot. Both were delicious! We're glad we tried it. Very reasonable pricing also."}
{"text":"The worst Thai food I've ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed!  Everything was completely blase and tasteless, the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiance's entree(probably to make up for the lack of other spices)...  don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"I have a colleague who picks up lunch from this place. I ordered some Pad Thai the last two times he went to get lunch and he brought it back for me. Has great flavor and spice. Have not tried anything else but the Pad Thai is spot on."}
{"text":"I love this place! For the past 3 years, I have been frequenting the Line Thai Restaurant even though it's quite a drive for me. The food is outstanding and the service is friendly and accommodating. I've brought guests in the past who are on special medical diets. The chefs are more than happy to cook to order. To add to it all, the atmosphere is quiet and the seating is spacious. If you like Thai food, check out the Line Thai, for sure!!"}
{"text":"After work one night, I had a rediculous craving for some Thai Curry, so I remembered driving past this place and always seeing cars parked out front.  So, I thought, let's go there!  Glad I did!  I was a little freaked out when I pulled up @ 7PM, and there were no cars in the parking lot.  Then again, it is in Sun City, so their dinner rush ends @ 6, so it made sense.  I ordered the Yellow Curry with Rice and the Fish Patty with Cucumber Chili sauce as an appetizer.  Everything was so flavorful!  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Thai experience.  I did not give this a 5, only because I am still learning about Thai food."}
{"text":"There's a wonderful little Thai place nestled away in a strip mall in Sun City. Ask me where I want to go for lunch and I'll most likely say Line Thai! I have been there 65 times so far and it never gets old.   The service is super fast and the wait staff is friendly and attentive. No matter how busy they are, they always make sure you have what you need. Once your glass is half empty they are at your table with a refill.  The lunch specials are awesome. Always fresh and hot. They come with steamed rice, two wontons, an egg roll, and a cup of soup for $6.95. Here are a few suggestions. My personal favorite is #4.   #2- Kaeng Ka-Ri Kai: Yellow curry with coconut milk, chicken, potatoes, onions, and carrots.  #4- Neue Phad Phrik Khing: Beef stir-fried in Phrik Khing curry sauce with green beans.  #6- Kai Phad Kraphrao: Chicken stir-fried with fresh chili peppers, onions, bamboo shoots, and basil leaves.   Other yummy dishes to try for dinner:  #16- Salad Khaeg:  Fresh green salad with hard-boiled eggs, pork, shrimp, topped with famous peanut sauce. $8.50  #24- Tom Kha Kai:  Hot and sour soup with lemon grass, mushrooms, chicken with galanga in coconut milk and home made chili paste.  #38- Phad Phrik Khing: (#4 on the lunch menu, comes with beef)  Your choice of meat stir-fried in a phrik khing curry sauce with green beans. $8.95  #39- Kai Phad Mamuang Himaphan:  Chicken stir-fried with bell peppers, onions, carrots, water chestnuts, cashews, and peanuts. $9.50  #40- Phad Khing Sod:  Chicken or pork stir-fried with fresh ginger, chili, onion, and mushrooms. $9.50  Plan on going at least three or four times because there are so many excellent dishes to try. It's definitely my favorite lunch spot. I would cry if this place ever went out of business."}
{"text":"Line Thai Restaurant from the outside doesn't look like anything special due to the fact it is in a strip mall and it also doesn't look like a large restaurant. When you walk in to the left side it appears small but when you are seated the room is quite big. Plenty of room for large parties. Food wise, my wife and I had Kwedian Jae. Wide rice noodles stir fried with egg and vegetables in a soy sauce. The dish was not hot but my wife was pretty hungry so she didn't send it back. My dish was Rah Nah. Wide rice noodles with pork and broccoli in a brown gravy sauce. My dish was hot and tasty. My only gripe was the portion was not enough. We also had 2 little egg rolls as an appetizer.  We might try Line Thai again."}
{"text":"Saw Line Thai on Check Please Arizona and thought we would give it a try. The experience was bad all around. Once seated, we waited a VERY long time to be greeted. Not being super savvy about Thai food, I was looking for some guidance that I did NOT receive from the staff. I did my best at picking a dish, as did my husband and mom. We also had our 5 year old daughter with us and they do not have much for kids. We arrived shortly after 5:00, assuming that we have plenty of time because my daughter did not have swim class until 7:00. It took so long to get our food that we had to get boxes after a few bites of food that left a lot to be desired. We will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"It is a Chinese Restaurant posing as Thai!  Stopped for lunch and ordered a Squid salad- not edible because of the sauce poured over the chopped iceberg lettuce. My wife had a lunch special which was like Chicken chowmein w/ no chicken and canned mushrooms.  This is NOT a Thai restaurant and they are lazy and cheap w/ how they prepare their food.   Save your $ and or give another Thai place a chance in the area before trying this place!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the spiciest food I've ever eaten. Ask for \"Thai hot.\" Amazing red curry. Friendly and courteous wait-staff. Recommended."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  #23 Tom Yam Kai is wonderful soup, such exotic flavor.  I also love #38 Phad Phrik Khing, Chicken, Medium, No Beans.  The food is fantastic, the service is awesome, and I cannot get enough of this place.  I live and work in Waddell, AZ and I try to get to Line Thai at lease once a month.  Wish I could eat there everyday!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. I usually judge a Thai food place for it's authenticity by its Pad Thai. Theirs is very good and didn't give me any health issues associated with cheap food or chemicals (headache, belly ache, etc). The food cake out hot, delicious and quick! The Thai iced tea was sweet but delicious and we enjoyed the fresh spring rolls (although a bit surprised by the imitation crab meat in them bc we thought they were veggie only). We will go here again definitely and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, and had really good meals, excellent lunch specials. The staff is super helpful and very friendly."}
{"text":"I have never written a review on a restaurant before. Based on the reviews, we decided to go to Line Thai tonight. We walked in and were seated. We were given a death trap high chair for our 6 month old and my 5 year old was given nothing. I asked if they had a kids menu and he said no but our only option would be to order a full adult dinner plate for our son. We sat there for at least 10 minutes and nobody had come to the table. The place was NOT busy. It was then that we decided to leave. I have never in my entire life walked out of a restaurant. If I walk in, I order. If I don't like it, I just don't come back. I couldn't even do that here! We were getting up to leave and a waitress finally came to our table. We told her why we were leaving and instead of offering something to get us to stay, she just said \"okay!\" Glad I didn't spend my money here! NOT kid friendly!"}
{"text":"The food was great, and a great selection, for reasonable prices.  Thai waitresses and several Asian customers (which is always a good sign).  We were very happy that the friend we were visiting wanted to go here, as we enjoyed every dish."}
{"text":"I can't believe we've never eaten here and have lived in Surprise for almost 2 years! Started with the spring rolls which were delicious. There were 2 of us and we split the coconut curry soup and a curry, potato and chicken dish. All of it was delicious! Great service and even better food. and the bill only came to $24 bucks."}
{"text":"Very good food, nice waitress. Friendly atmosphere. The seafood soup I got today was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place really is authentic. Their green curry with chicken is delicious, and if you decide to get it hot (as in spicy), then be sure to order some coconut ice cream to help cool you down and help that sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant!!  Every time we visit Surprise, we eat here!  The owners/employees are the nicest people.  The food is always amazing and I love the atmosphere.  I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to eat here for some time after reading some promising reviews. Went for lunch and I'll start with initial ambiance and feel of the place itself. It does smell of the bathrooms when you walk in as some of the previous reviews mentioned. The carpet really needs to be replaced and the booth we sat in was like sitting on wood, no cusioning. The staff was very friendly and courteous. I really like curry so I tried the red curry with veggies and tofu and wasn't that excited as it was very milky , not enough curry. My wife had the veggie fried rice and said it was good. I'd have to try another dish to give this place another chance but the smell and everything being very run down is a turnoff."}
{"text":"I had an eye doctor appointment near by so my wife & I stopped here after after the  eye appointment. We soon learned this place was The restaurant is family owned. I love supporting mom & pop businesses.   The restaurant was not crowded so I was a little worried but my wife reminded me it was past a normal lunch time. We started our meal with a pot of soup. It was the most amazing tasting soup I've had in ages and I love soup especially on a cold winter's day like we've been having in Phoenix lately. Having a pot of soup allowed us to have several delectable helpings after another. I almost wanted to order some soup to take with us it was so good..     Our waitress suggested a few if their specialty dishes too us but being from Thailand, was a little hard to understand. However that being said she was extremely nice. lovely.    Whatever we had ( some sort of noodle dish) we both thought it was delicious and our dishes came out quickly & hot.  FOOD: Was excellent. The aroma from the food made my mouth water. SERVICE: Professional & attentive. PRICE: The prices on the lunch menu were compatible to other Asian type restaurants in the valley. They were very reasonable. CONCLUSION: Nice atmosphere that offers a relaxed atmosphere, where diners are not rushed. The portions were just right for lunch. RETURN FACTOR 100%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ******************** 5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH"}
{"text":"I went to this place 2 25pm sadly they were close but i spoke to the gentleman work there and got thai tea to go.thai tea is little bit over sweet but over all is very good. come back at night around 7 30 ordered pad thai it was delicious.the gentleman who severed me was very nice.would come back definitely!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I have had from their eggplant dish to their noodle dishes to the soups and the many other dishes I have tried there. I always keep coming back not only for the food but the great service.   The pricing is pretty standard, $8-9 for a dish but they are large portions so definitely worth it.  The only negative is the lack of choice for dessert. They only have coconut ice cream (which is really good) and coconut custard.   The place is usually not crowded so you're immediately seated with no wait time (I've been there for both lunch and dinner).   The bathrooms are okay, they need a bit of updating but are clean.   I gave it a 5 star mainly for the food and service, things like the dessert menu and the bathrooms can be easily \"remodeled\"."}
{"text":"This place has been here as long as I can remember....drove past it for over 15 years in my travels around the valley.  Walking in feels like a hotel lobby with the awkward bathroom cleaner scented candle burning. The place is huge and can handle a group of any size.  Timing from greeting/beverages to appetizers to entrees was good.  Plates show signs of wear which make them appear dirty and the furniture is dated and a bit worn. The dishes were definitely scratch made and it was nice to sit down and have a nice meal. Tried the seafood mix plate with vegetables, papaya salad, and chicken satay...... Next time the soup. Definitely a nice local place to get some authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had dinner at Line Thai with a party of 16. The service and food were great. None of us had ever been there before, but we decided to go based on the rating and high number of reviews on Yelp. (Thanks everyone!)   I made a reservation by phone the day before. When we arrived everything was set up and worked like clockwork. At the end they helped us divide the tab into equal parts and pay one-by-one or as couples.   I've never been to Thailand, but the food seemed very authentic. For instance, the Pad Thai came on a plate with different ingredients by themselves, and you mixed them together in the way you like. Also, the dining area was full of Thai sculptures and paintings.   Lastly, the restrooms were very clean and pleasantly lit."}
{"text":"Was really excited about Thai but the only thing I enjoyed was my Thai tea. I ordered something I didn't see any reviews for but it's such a typical Thai dish I figured it was going to be good. I ordered pad Thai and was hugely disappointed. Not the typical peanut recipe so I just couldn't enjoy it. So I did leave unsatisfied. It seemed like everyone else around me enjoyed their food and it was quick and clean."}
{"text":"The food was great. We ordered the Pad Thai and it was great! The service was excellent, and the waitress was very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! It took me a while to find a Thai restaurant that I really liked in AZ. I've gotten several suggestions and some of them were ok. Many were not worth going back to ever. Line Thai has won me over though. I've been going here for the last 2 years and they never disappoint me. Everything is great! The employees are all courteous and helpful. They have a new young guy who's been my waiter the last 2 times and he his awesome."}
{"text":"Good food, not the best, but the good lunch special prices make up for it.  Big lunch selection.  Been a few times, no regrets."}
{"text":"Really good AUTHENTIC Thai food! Great place to bring people who may not have tried Thai before. Delicious food and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Very good and flavorful! Be warned if you ask for Thai hot is EXTREMELY hot! Some places don't make Thai hot very hot but this was incredibly spicy, very delicious and flavorful!  The wide noodles were really good as well as the sweet and sour chicken and eggplant. Not the best I've ever had but definitely very good and worth going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. Very accomodating to our requests   There were 6 of us in our party.  The peanut sauce was the best ever!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!! The egg and spring rolls r delish!  Red curry is a family favorite along with the pad tai."}
{"text":"Who knew?! This place reminded my friend and I of an old hotel lobby on the inside. It had an interesting entrance with a few main seating areas to the left and right of the lobby. They have lots of tables, which they keep really clean.   If you like Thai food, eat here. The food was delicious! Great portions too! We ordered Phat Thai with veggies. It had the right amount of everything! We also ordered a veggie curry. If you are not a big eater, each dish has plenty to share.   The service was friendly and attentive...even when we were the last ones there at the end of the night.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"What to do for lunch on a Saturday whilst browsing realtors' open houses? Try Line Thai on Bell Road, of course.  Good selection, reasonable prices. Spring rolls were just $2 for two. I had the green curry with pork, and my girlfriend had special #29 - phad woon sen (silver noodles). Both were served with an enormous quantity of rice. We were both surprised at how juicy/wet each dish was; my green curry was served in a bowl and was more soup than curry. I didn't mind, as it was a different style than what I consider more traditional  Thai - like Siam Thai on 51st Ave & Northern who serve their entrees less saucy. But overall very satisfying with an appropriate spice, considering this is Sun City.  The one complaint would be one of the waitresses who spoke in more of a whisper than voice. I couldn't hear her, let alone understand her, and I'm far from being eligible to live in Sun City. I can't imagine what the blue hairs have to go through getting her to break with traditional demure vocalizations.  Definitely tasty enough to warrant a return visit to try the mee krob."}
{"text":"Just when I'm about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale, I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough. Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design. A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel. Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door.   The food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre. It will pay off handsomely."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Pretty much the only Thai restaurant in the area (I think the next closest is Bell and 43rd but maybe there's something south). I've had plenty of Thai before and this place is fairly average by comparison, which basically means that it's worth return visits. I've been here a few times and it's pretty consistent - a large seating room, never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table (usually we're seated immediately on arrival), the food's ready pretty quickly and if you order spicy you get spicy. One of the highlights of the restaurant is the male waiter. He bows, scrapes and simpers in a way that almost makes me chuckle whenever I go, almost like a Saturday Night Live parody of a waiter. The Sun City q-tips apparently love this place too; I've seen several greeting cards from people to the restaurant owners placed out front. Restrooms are kept very clean as well. Best tasting Thai I've had in Phoenix so far is Thai Lahna (http://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-lahna-restaurant-phoenix) but that's a little too much of a drive for me. This place does nicely for us when we're after something other than the boring old Grand and Bell chains. And GOD I wish there was an Indian restaurant near us.."}
{"text":"Killer service, great food (especially the spicy chicken soup) and family owned atmosphere. Been here many times in the last few years, never had a bad meal. I reccomend it to anyone who enjoys Thai food."}
{"text":"Since trying Line Thai for the first time and my first review of the restaurant, we have returned for lunch numerous times and dinner several times.  With each visit we find the food excellent.  We love the fresh Spring Rolls they create here and often will order them to take out at lunch time so that we can have them for fun Asian lunches we prepare at home.  The rolls really make our at home meals extra special.   Had the sweet and sour pork dish today along with the sizzling half chicken, so very good!  We'd come here more often if my husband wasn't on such a low sodium diet as the food here is terrific."}
{"text":"Best Thai food everrrr never fails to l disappoint. I ordered the number 69 with tofu and it was he most delicious Thai food I had in a while. Props to the chef. If you're reading these reviews trying to figure if you should come down. YOU SHOULD"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Phat Thai (Pad Thai)  I ordered it super spicy and my wishes were fulfilled.  Whenever it's cold I like to warm the inside of my body, and WOW, my lips were flaming the whole drive home.  I also ordered an appetizer, the fried tofu with spicy sauce, that was very good as well.  So stoked on this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why there were great reviews of this place in Chowhound.   I decided to go because of them, and was disappointed.  It was decent if you are craving Thai food but have nowhere else to go to in the area, but not amazing.  Also, halfway during our meal, there was the distinct smell of sewage that wafted thru--not sure what it was from.  Both my significant other & I smelled it.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Number 24 soup is sooooo good! Amongst other things. This place is the best and staff is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place! Alway drove by but never stopped till today!  Very reasonable prices for a fancy place! Restroom is spotless which tells kitchen is clean too.  Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"A gentleman at the gas station, recommended this place.  After overhearing my 3 year old say she wanted \"Chinese food\"  Only one full table, upon arrival...yet it took 10 minutes for them to acknowledge and seat us. No biggie though, the lady was very sweet to my 3 year old and I appreciate that more.  The fried rice was a bit to buttery for my taste and not enough vegetables in it for my veggie loving child. The shrimp dish, she recommended was very good tho.  Kinda a bummer no kid menu/options. I am sure grandparents bring them.  Yes, the decor is dated (as stated in other review) but the 2 people who we saw working there and interacted with...were so nice and kind. I would stop in again when visiting my mum. I will just opt for a less buttery dish for my daughter."}
{"text":"We looked up on yelp for Thai food and this location is the closest to us. My sister called and ordered to go the pad Thai and yellow curry. Both taste average not as good as the one we normally go to, Thai Spice in Mesa. The shrimp in yellow curry wasn't fresh at all. I don't mind paying extra for the seafood but it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Our group of three arrived shortly after noon, and considering this is in a strip mall on busy Bell Road, I was a bit surprised that not only we didn't have a wait, but the lobby and dining areas seemed relatively empty. I hoped this wasn't a harbinger of things to come.  We were seated promptly after being asked our table/booth preference, and given menus and waters right away. After a few minutes of poring over the extensive menu, our waitress came by to take our order. There were too many items to choose from, so we needed help with our decision, which the waitress was helpful with. The guys ordered lunch specials ($6.95 each, served with soup, rice, and egg roll); one was a chicken/pineapple sweet dish, which the waitress said they couldn't do spicy, but she could bring out hot red pepper to sprinkle on, as well as what may have been homemade chili hot sauce in a dish. The other  was some sort of chicken dish ordered extra spicy, and he was a bit surprised (but not disappointed) it had *very* hot sliced hot peppers in it. I ordered off the regular menu, Phat Thai (pad thai) for $8.95 ordered extra \"Thai\" spicy, which was served with soup and it was delicious. There were several pieces of tender chicken but only two large shrimp in the noodle dish, which was probably enough to split in half and take home, but I didn't because it was too tasty.   All in all the food and service were very good, the only reason for only four stars was it just didn't go that extra mile in ambiance, price, etc. that makes someone rave about a new favorite to recommend driving across the state for. Maybe just across the West Valley."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an \"off\" night for them tonight as the food was overwhelming with ginger.  I appreciate that they let me exchange one dish for another as this was the first time at ANY restaurant EVER I have asked to return a dish as I was literally unable to eat it (my normal favorite phad phrik khing looked like chicken with thanksgiving gravy sprinkled in ginger strips).  Waitresses were kind but I was extremely disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"Line Thai proudly displays their large pile of grade \"A\" health inspection reports in the lobby.  The owner was very thoughtful and picked chairs for elderly or handicapped people because of the wheels on the chair legs for ease of movement. Booths are also available.  They started us off with a cup of complimentary egg noodle soup. The soup seemed house made and good but did have some frozen vegetables in it  I ordered the Phad Eggplant with Chicken. I thought the sauce was very good and I liked the fresh vegetables in it. The white meat chicken was sort of dry and didn't seem developed with flavor but OK and passable. They use jalapeno peppers here and I know it's a substitute for Thai banana peppers but I would have preferred Thai Birdseye chills. The medium hot was a perfect heat level I thought.  My companion had one of the shrimp dishes. He ordered it hot and said it was just slightly hotter than mine and thought the heat was mostly from the jalapeno peppers. He said the shrimp were cooked perfect and he thought the sauce was also very good.  Service was extremely courteous and timely.  I will be back sometime for lunch because Satara no longer is open for lunch on the weekends and I think Line Thai is the next closest Thai.  Better than other Thai places I gave three stars to but not quite as good as Thai Places I gave four stars to.  A very solid three stars.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Shrimp fried rice and pad Thai were very good.  The place wasn't much to look at but most of the restaurants off the beaten path aren't, its the food that brings you in.  This place had the food and the staff was attentive."}
{"text":"So, Mom and Dad live in Sun City and this restaurant is something like 6 blocks from their house, making it a very convenient place to get some Thai food. I've always had a great meal here in the past, but on this visit, I don't know, something was off.  I ordered the Kung Phad Noh Mai: Shrimp stir-fried with bamboo shoots, baby corns, carrots and mushrooms in oyster sauce. When it came, there were onions and green peppers mixed in, so I asked the waitress if this was, in fact, what I ordered, because I specifically chose something that didn't have onions in it. I don't have an allergy to onions, I just really detest them. If I can get something without them, so I'm not paying for something that I won't eat, I will. I think that makes perfect sense! Her response was that they just didn't put those ingredients on the menu! Ok, ok, I can pick them out (which is exactly what I did), but if they weren't on the menu, then they shouldn't be in the dish, IMO. What if I had a food allergy?   I will go back, but guaranteed, I will be stating NO ONIONS IN MY DISH. For anyone else, I guess you had better ask and maybe ask again if a specific ingredient is in a dish. For me it was just a food preference, but for someone else, it could be life or death!   4/2017"}
{"text":"One of my two favorite Thai restaurants. Good food. It's a pretty big restaurant. Always few people, which I don't think is bad. It's pretty quiet. It's a friendly setting. Good food and nice people. I still like my Thai tea from my other favorite Thai restaurant better but they still have good Thai tea regardless. If I remember, their dessert was better though. :)"}
{"text":"We ordered to go food and the food was pretty mediocre. We ordered the pad Thai and panang curry and let's just say we didn't save the food after we took some bites. But the inside is clean and well kept"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Thai food and have eaten at a lot of Thai places. This place is great! I have been there many, many times. The food is great and so is the service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food but have yet to find an establishment here in Arizona that meets my high standards. The hubs and I had tried Line Thai a couple years ago and it was NOT the kind of Thai food I was used to. (think fresh vegetables with chicken in a light garlic sauce, chicken over spinach with peanut sauce, yellow curry with vegetables and shrimp) I vowed to never return. But I did...a couple weeks ago.   My friend and I were craving Thai and figured we would give this place another try. We ordered spring rolls to start that were the BEST we've ever had. We loved them so much we placed FOUR orders of these delicious little creations! From here...the rest of our food was OK at best. From garlic chicken ( which I don't believe had garlic in it) to sweet and sour chicken (with that horrible RED jelly sauce you get in old Chinese restaurants) and some noodle dish that tasted MUCH better than it looked. (the noodles were GRAY)   Overall it wasn't a horrible experience but the Thai food here isn't what I am used to enjoying when I lived in WA. That is some of the best Thai food, I've ever enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Went to Line Thai tonight with visiting relatives. It was not busy but we stood over 10 minutes just to be seated. Then we waited 15 minutes without seeing a waitress. No water, no order taking, no nothing. Finally just left.  I have no idea if the food is any good but the service is terrible. Many people were complaining. This restaurant is understaffed and needs a professional manager.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food we have ever had.  Good Phad Thai and Phad See Iiw.  Can't wait to get back!  The people here are the kindest we have ever met.  We came here for our wedding rehearsal dinner and they took good care of us."}
{"text":"We go there two or more times a month and have not had a single bad experience. Not to mention they are the only Thai place I've found west of the 101. My girlfriend only gets the Phad Thai, but I try everything and would recommend going back multiple times because there is a lot to choose from. If your in the area for weekday lunch you can't beat their deal.  The services is always smiling and greeting everyone that walks in the door within a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"We love the chicken satay appetizer and always get spicy noodles with a Thai tea! Service is always fast and the staff is great. Love this place and happy to see a decent Thai place on the west side!"}
{"text":"Poor excuse for Thai food that made both my wife and I sick. The noodles were mashed and unrecognizable. The soup was poorly prepared. Recommend staying away from this dive."}
{"text":"The curry and traditional decor is cute. Lunch prices at $7 are descent. The fried wonton was boring and seemed to be an excuse to make you think you were getting more for your money.  The eggroll was mediocre. The mustard sauce, not for me. The yellow curry was nice and flavorful. The barbecued chicken was dry and the least successful dish for me."}
{"text":"Overall: The food is good, not great. For the price the food is better than most at the same cost so I will continue to go here when I'm in the area.  Food Quality: 8/10  - I did find some frozen peas & carrots in a curry tonight... really!? The other dishes had fresh and they were good. Why skimp on the curry?  Food Flavor: 7/10  - the Tom soups are very good, some of the best I've had anywhere. The Garlic Shrimp was very good also. The curry dishes and other standard entrees are average.  Service: 8/10 -  Not overly attentive but I've been happy and never had a problem. The people are very nice.  Decor: 6/10 - nothing special but you don't go here for the decor anyway."}
{"text":"This place is great. We eat here, probably once a week. The Phad Thai is fabulous--my favorite--but everything else is great too.   The staff is from Thailand, and they are extremely nice. The decor is lovely.   Also, they'll do many of their dishes with tofu if you're vegetarian."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place, I love the Thai pork fried rice and beef satay as my default choices."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai place so far on the west side. Cute little place inside, people are always friendly, and the food is delicious!  Please don't go here looking for Chinese food... There have been a couple times I've overheard people asking them for items you'd see at a Chinese food place - I'm sure they get it all the time and surprisingly they were nice about recommending dishes.   The food is super authentic and so far I've liked everything I ordered. The pork fried rice never disappoints and the larb gai was really good too. Even better is that the bill never hurts my wallet and I usually walk out with my extras I couldn't finish."}
{"text":"This place appears to be out of business, we arrived at 2:45 PM and their closed sign was out. It was a Thursday and not a holiday."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food at a very reasonable price.  The Phat Thai is amazing, and whenever you order something spicy they ask what level of spice you want in your dish.  I've never tried anything hotter than medium because the medium is VERY spicy.  Really love their red curry as well as coconut ice cream made right at the restaurant.  The atmosphere is very quiet - mostly older couples or small groups dining together."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a find in Sun City. My family has been frequenting Line Thai for over 6 years and if has never disappointed. I've taken friends, family, and business contacts here, and everyone has always enjoyed it.  Angel wings are one of a kind and delicious.  All noodle dishes are amazing- I recommend the Pad See Ew and Pad Woo Sen.  Watch out for how spicy you order curry, when they say hot they mean HOT"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this establishment. Having enjoyed Thai cuisine at scores of restaurants from coast to coast, I consider myself a low-level connoisseur at this point in my life, and found very little to complain about at Line Thai. The servers are attentive and prompt with seeing to your requests, and the portions and quality of the food is well above average for the price. The Tom Kha Gai (chicken coconut soup for the uninitiated) was very good, and mild enough for my laughably spice-sensitive father to handle. Many Thai restaurants have a problem with toning the heat level down, but that is certainly not the case with Line Thai. My Pad Khee Mao (also known as drunken noodles in some locales) left a little bit to be desired, as the noodles were slightly over cooked, but was tasty nonetheless. This place won't win any best-in-class awards in my opinion, but for solid food at very reasonable prices, it's hard to beat for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Went here with my father and brother while running errands in the area. We hadn't been to Line Thai in a long long time. After our meal, we questioned why we hadn't come back sooner!!! Busy I guess... We all ordered curry dishes, and thai hot. Lets just say all 3 of us who are big spicy food guys all had to get extra napkins to wipe away our tears and runny noses while chowing down on some delicious food. I couldn't eat the complimentary soup since I am vegan but they do have vegan/vegetarian options which is nice. All of our meals were very tasty and very hot!!! I'll definitely come back again. The decor is slightly old and in an old shopping area near/in sun city but I don't go to a restaurant because the decor is \"cute\" or \"hip,\" I go for the food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Unlike our resident Vegan Umpire \"Wayne\" (Who can't seem to understand you cannot ask for anything past a 10 on a 1-10 scale, LOL) I thought this restaurant hit a home run!"}
{"text":"Wow...best customer service I've had in a while....and great food too?! Definitely hit the jack pot. Will be seeing more of me for sure ."}
{"text":"Unassuming exterior with a pleasant interior decor. The hostess promptly offer us open seating for any booth or table. Our waitress brought us menu's and water.  I got a Thai ice tea with cream (good). We ordered the Green curry and Pad Thai both with medium heat. Food was good but slightly bland. Both dishes seemed to lack that traditional complex meld of Thai flavors. Neither dish had any real bite and I had to add chili to spice mine up a bit. Service was good and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Immediately upon entering, you're greeted by super friendly people.  We came here for lunch and there was a pretty good lunch crowd.  The place it decorated really cute.  They have lunch specials for $5.95 which include egg rolls and soup.  It's a steal!  The Pad Thai was pretty good and my husbands' Red Chicken Curry was delicious.  The presentations were nice and the portions were huge.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was placing Line Thai as my second choice for a while, but they are starting to tie for my first.  We went on a whim the other night and had their phad Thai for the first time, it is the best I have had.  We also ordered our usual Thai fried rice, and it was as AMAZING as ever!!  I have also had the yellow curry many times and it is great, as well as the pork dumpling soup and it is great also.  Their Thai tea is wonderful! Also the service is always wonderful!"}
{"text":"The soup they serve with lunch tastes like cheap ramen with undercooked noodles. The Pad Thai advertises that it comes with shrimp - 2 of them to be exact and the one I tried tasted bad and hadn't been peeled properly.   Also,  they have no spice level control.  I asked for medium,  although in a fan of spicy food,  and it was hot by any standard.  Add to that the fact that it was badly seasoned, and the 2 stars are justified."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place when I'm in the Northwest valley. Check the hours because often they're closed early afternoon. Try the Thai rice. It's the best in the state. Extra onions and insanely flavorful."}
{"text":"Got pad Thai and Panang curry   The pad Thai was weird tasting. Tasted more like a sweet and sour dish than a pad Thai.   The Panang curry was okay, certainly not what I would call Panang curry but not bad.   Overall overpriced. and not great. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the yellow chicken curry, sweet & sour chicken, and pad thai. Food was pretty good. Their medium spicy is not spicy at all... recommend getting hot or extra spice on the side."}
{"text":"Good food.  Usually only two servers there that keep busy for sure.   Tom kar would is my favorite and they will make it mild if you like.   Fried rice is good."}
{"text":"It's all about the food! Located in Sun City, the decor is a bit dated and what you might expect. The servers are very pleasant and attentive. But if I was rating it strictly on the food I would give it a full 5 stars. The food is delicious."}
{"text":"I have driven by this restaurant for many years on a very busy section of Bell Rd. in Sun City and never stopped due to it's heavy traffic, but after seeing a review on \"Check Please, Arizona\", we made the trip.  Great food! Lots included in their lunch specials! For about 8 bucks, you can choose from about ten items that also include a delicious chicken broth cup, two wonton, a tasty egg roll, a decorative cup of rice and a large portion of the entree. I had a chicken dish with onions, basil, and tons of flavor! They will make it as spicy as you like. Try this place. It is a real value!"}
{"text":"An explosion of flavors!  We tried several dishes and loved them all. Authentic seasoning and mixtures of fresh vegetables and pasta along with an awesome peanut sauce."}
{"text":"I pick up Thai food from this restaurant all the time. I always order my curry \"hot\", because usually the hottest available is not even spicy to me. BOY, WAS THIS CURRY HOTTTT! And delicious! Give Line Thai a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend from work for lunch and was not disappointed. We started with chicken sate as an appetizer with some egg rolls and both were very good. The peanut sauce for the sate was amazing. I ordered a fried rice dish for lunch and asked them to make it with brown rice. Ahhhh yes, make me some brown rice and I'll make you my friend for life. Why you ask? Because it helps me believe eating fried rice is actually healthy!  More than anything I appreciate the willingness to please customers. I also asked for no shrimp and normally my friends are embarrassed that I'm being so picky (I promise I'm usually not) but our waitress helped me keep my dignity. Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Ordered food medium spicy and couldn't even down a few bites. Ended up puking profusely in their bathroom for 10 minutes straight. They refused to take off any of the inedible items off the bill to maintain a loyal customer. I will never eat here again because they were rude and cheap for not remaking or taking it off the bill. Most places would offer to do something, at least remake the food to our liking. We ordered 4 appetizers, loved them all, 4 drinks, and 3 entrees that were too spicy. All we complained about was that the entrees literally made us puke and we couldn't finish but a few bites. It ended ugly but my boyfriend being the gentleman he is, paid the bill in full like they demanded. But f this place. Save your money cuz the service SUCKS!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I love trying new Thai food restaurants. We started off our meal there with 2 thai teas. They were made just right with the right amount of sweetness.  Appetizer- we shared the beef skewers with side of cucambers and peanut sauce. I really enjoyed the meat and the marinate. The peanut sauce was really good.  Entrée- I ordered the red curry chicken dish. The peanut flavor was excellent in that dish and the spicyness just right for me. I always like to add chilli paste to every bite as I go to if I like it more spicy. However, the dish is on the salty side. I would definitely prefer a little less salt, then it would be perfect.  Hubby ordered a noodle dish, something with beef and basil. Very tasty. No complaints there.  In my experience, service at most asian themed restaurants is a hit or miss. Lucily, we did experience good service at this location. Our server there was very friendly and attentive and we were pretty happy and full when we left."}
{"text":"I ordered their Green Curry on a rainy day and it was okay.  Not the greatest Thai restaurant but nothing inedible.  The curry tasted too much like coconut milk and in turn, made it quite watery, and I was hoping for more meat and vegetables inside the curry and perhaps making it a bit thicker.  I just have a problem with my curry turning into porridge.  The prices were reasonable and the service was very prompt and quick.  It's a very nice place to try out when you're sick of cooking at home and eating week old leftovers you have in the fridge."}
{"text":"Good Spring Rolls and excellent Tom Ka Kai Soup (Coconut).  The actual building could use some work, but solid food."}
{"text":"Got stir fry shrimp with basil (#53). I like spicy and ordered it \"hot\" with a side of fish sauce. This was fantastic! The spice wasn't at all over the top. It came with a half dozen good-sized shrimp, and also bamboo shoots and onions. Recommended!   Also, service was first-rate. The place wasn't full, but was moderately busy. Even so, my food was served within minutes of ordering.   Last, the atmosphere was very nice, not cramped, nice decor, and (presumably) Thai music playing softly in the background. I wish I lived closer, because I'd like to visit more often!"}
{"text":"The food is just okay. I have had better. Service is slow."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and YES. If you are looking for amazing Thai food, this is the place. The atmosphere is quiet  and the restaurant feels dated but don't let that discount the food. I have been going here for years and it just gets better. My absolute favorite is spicy garlic chicken and the Panang Curry with chicken. Also, try the soup. The Tom Yum shrimp comes out in one of the coolest serving dishes ever! The staff is more than pleasant and patient. You instantly feel like family when you eat there."}
{"text":"The food was okay, however the decor is quite outdated. I would have enjoyed it much more if the restaurant didn't smell dingy."}
{"text":"What can I say about Line Thai?! I always get friendly service and I can't get enough of their Tom Yum Kai soup! Try #38, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"Som Tom (papaya salad)...what can I say other than a HUGE disappointment.  Okay, so I have been in Thailand and do know what this papaya salad is really supposed to taste like, and I see absolutely no similarity between Line Thai's and the real thing.   I was so psyched to go here that I am bummed they haven't perfected this fantastic papaya salad.  It's almost like they got a papaya, sliced it thin in sticks (so far so good), threw some roasted peanuts on it and some vinegarette type sauce with some slices of red pepper....uh, not Kosher.  They need to work on this one. However, my friend loved his and has been here many times.  Nothing but compliments on his dish (whatever it was it had beef). Seeing as I have heard only good things about this place, I will give it a 2 star for how clean, how professional the service is and how quickly they bring out the food.  But my dish itself rates a big zero--sadly. I will come back here soon, try something else and see if that isn't alot better.  Maybe my other fav Thai thing:  Pad Thai.  If they screw that up...I'm done with Line Thai."}
{"text":"We love Thai food. As soon as we moved to town asked our Thai neighbor for a recommendation - unfortunately they liked Line Thai.  Tried the chicken Pad Thai, Panang curry, and Pad ka prao.  My wife and daughter who love pad thai picked at their noodles  and left the rest as the taste was not even close to right.  The panang curry tasted only of peanut satay sauce and had no spice. The pad ka prao was the best dish we had and it was definitely not worth going back to try again.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here had a great experience! I had the PadThai with chicken shrimp and tofu SPICY! It was really good! Started with the Thai Tea my Favorite and finished with a glass of Cabernet"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this place. I have gone twice. Once to dine in and the other was take out. Had curry both times. Their Panang curry was ok and the red curry was totally bland and boring. The used some fresh ingredients and some canned. I would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  We had Yellow curry, Red Curry,  pad Thai and Sweet & Sour. Nothing disappointed us.   There is not a lot of heat so order a little hotter than normal.  Server recommended getting chili on the side next time.  Save room for ice cream."}
{"text":"Serene, tranquil restaurant! It was quiet until a mother and two unruly toddlers were seated behind us. Downhill from there. Why do restaurants seat all the tables in just one area--for their own convenience, not the diners. Ordered the chicken curry in coconut broth. There was not enough delicious broth for the bowl of dry-tasting slices of chicken. The plate was a very attractive presentation, but the food  was not appealing to me, including the soup. Liked the spring roll though. Would not be interested in giving Thai food another try."}
{"text":"As someone who used to live in Thailand, this is hands down one of the most authentic Thai restuarants that I've eaten at in Arizona. The prices are inexpensive and meals are shared family style, as they should be. The tom yum goong (hot and spicy shrimp soup) is heavenly here. If you ask for it, they will make their dishes \"Thai hot,\" something many chain-type Thai restuarants will not do. Line Thai is not the Americanized \"fusion-style\" food you will find from other Asian restaurants, this is the real deal. The atmosphere is always a little weird (read, quiet) to me, but I go here for the food, not to be entertained. Just a note, the waiters/waitresses all speak Thai and are traditionally dressed; they are also friendly, helpful and always looking to impress their guests. I have brought my family here on multiple occasions and have never been disappointed.  Stop by this place and find out what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and shrimp pad Thai to go. You can only order the dinner. There was only two shrimps medium size. We were so disappointed. The taste was good overall. I also ordered beef panang there was so much sweet flavor we couldn't enjoy it. I will try two other dishes next time and rate them again. The host was nice."}
{"text":"We love this place, and come about once a week.  The curry and pad thai is always good.  The boyfriend loves hot food, and no matter how hot we ask for it, they always try to make it spicier than the first time.  The staff is always friendly and recognizes you when you come in, and usually knows what we are going to order."}
{"text":"Good food. Service for pick up was a tad slow but it was due to me order being messed up not that I knew.... good food though I really like them here only thai food in the area worth trying. Lots of seating for sit down.  I will say medium spicy food was very spicey!! So be aware lol."}
{"text":"I've always lived over 15 min away from Line Thai and I will always drive to this place if I am wanting Thai food.   We have gotten many dishes from them but our favorite is between their Pad Thai or Pad See Yew! Oh they are both so good! The other dish is their Pannang (peanut curry) which has always been my favorite Thai dish. They have the perfect spice and amazing flavor in all of their foods and the owners are very professional and kind.  If you are dining in, you will get a nice feel of their culture and good service.   Yummy food and worth it!"}
{"text":"My teenage daughters who are very picky eaters absolutely love this place. The portions are large and we usually share 3 plates then finish up with fried bananas for desert."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Amazing service. We ordered the pad Thai and an appetizer that had a peanut sauce both were great. We ordered with medium spice and it was very spicy! So if you can't do spicy then order their less spicy option. If your up to trying something different then visit this spot. The menu is difficult to read but our waitress was very helpful."}
{"text":"I don't care if the restaurant did smell like a hospice and the decor is like a cheesy buffet in Reno, Nevada, but I do care about the food. First off, I went in this place saying it's a Thai spot in Surprise but the white rice was undercooked...HOW DO YOU MESS UP ON JASMINE RICE. I'm done..."}
{"text":"I guess I have high standards when judging a restaurant.  I like the place to look nice on the outside, nice decor on the inside, greeted promptly upon entering, service to be attentive, and the food to be delicious.  Some restaurants get high marks and others don't.  Located on a busy Bell Rd in Sun City the restaurant is a good choice for the area.  The outside is very inviting and I can see why this place attracts many people to the establishment.  The foyer upon walking in is beautiful, decor on the wall is nice, music is soothing, but the table and chairs stand out to be very boring.  Kind of family style I would say.  The service I experienced was just ok and the food was a little above average.  Prices are very reasonable for what you get and this could be another reaon why it's a busy place.  All in all this restaurant serves a purpose for the area.  Worth it to check out if nearby.  Otherwise it's not a die to go place."}
{"text":"A little too bright inside, but I understand why--it's close to Sun City and the bulk majority of clientele is over 60.  Maybe the above-table/booth lighting could be kept bright, but the room lighting can be more dim?  Alas, perhaps someone tripped and fell a long time ago, again because of clientele over 60, so adequate lighting is essential.  Honestly, I think that's my biggest gripe with the place.  The food and presentation is very good.  Oh wait...now that I mention it, here's another: if spice level is requested to be medium, then that would mean somewhat spicy, right?  Maybe not.  In my case, it was zero spice level.  It could have been a fluke.  It was still good though.  Servers and water-filler-dude were all friendly and very attentive.  The wife and I have been here a couple times, and we will continue to frequent the establishment for years to come."}
{"text":"We went to Line Thai  for lunch today  because my friend said this place is really good.  When we arrived I was a little bid shocked how this place looked from outside and inside.  Glass doors are so dirty that you can barely see through it,  all over glass you see  finger prints and some kind of glue and something what look like dry saliva ( ? )  I know it sound gross but this is exactly how it looked.   Then you walk inside and see this huge space - cold, empty and uninviting...  Horrible decoration, a lot of empty tables, there was also huge, empty  room which was blocked off from entering with some kind of chain.  This place need renovation badly. In the dining area where people are sitting , next to the wall,  they have  something what look like registration desk at the hotel (!!)  Employees are staying there all the time and they watching and gossiping about their customers.    I requested to sit at the table but my friend wanted to have booth seating - after we changed our seating request we got a huge attitude from the waiter ( place was almost empty, just few  guests ).   She brought us to the booth - it is important to mention that she never welcomed us nor introduced herself  -  being polite and to smile when approaching customers seem not important to her.  RUDE as rude can be. We ordered salad with eggs as appetizer and we asked for a different salad dressing because salad came with some kind of nuts dressing.  It was impossible for our waiter to get a different dressing for us.  She claimed it cannot be done! Salad looked old and brownish, it was suppose to be dinner salad but it was in size of  side salad,  served in very unattractive way. Then we ordered yellow curry - number 2 on the menu -  and Phad thai Noodles.  Yellow curry was not yellow.  It  was in  brown/green color,  it was not cooked fresh , I could tell that chicken was pre cooked probably day or two before , because it was totally dry and without taste.  There was no onions in the curry, but there was  one huge potato half raw and three small pieces of carrot. It was the worse thai curry I have ever had in my life. I did not eat my curry and I informed waiter how I feel about the food.  She did not apologize for food quality at all.  She just took my plate away!  Phad Thai looked like spaghetti bolognese - it had some kind of brown,nasty looking sauce on it.  It definitely did not  look or taste like Phad Thai.   It was horrible dining experience starting from ambience continuing with their service and ending with food. I did pay for my food which I did not eat,  leaving waiter with tip in zero amount. Her tip was well deserved. I  recommend staying away from this dive."}
{"text":"Aww, we discovered an oasis in the desert. An unassuming exterior. Once you step inside you feel the that this is the real deal. Just what we were looking for. In the lobby there are the most beautiful paintings of Thai traditions. The entrance has lush plants arranged just so. The restaurant has plenty of space. You won't ever feel crowed. The servers are so very nice. Respectful even. Reasonable prices. The food is the main thing right? We were so impressed. It has become our favorite Thai restaurant in the Surprise area. They deserve a great review!!"}
{"text":"Red Curry is Thai-mazing!  Back for more ....ordered Khao Soi (Norther Thai curry noodle) spicy which was delicious but not enough curry, didn't care for the wontons on top, I prefer it when's done w the extras to add, owner said they will customize. The red curry shrimp was delectable w the bamboo shoots done perfectly...Savory!"}
{"text":"We love going to Line Thai!  The friendly service with their huge smiles are always a wonderful welcome.   The pricing is great, especially during lunch.  We love their Thai Ice Tea -- what a sweet treat! We've tried a variety of their dishes and have never been disappointed.  The atmosphere is nothing fancy, just a simple, family-owned joint, doing a great job!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were regulars at Thai Rama (Camelback) about 14 years ago.  Part of the reason we loved it so much was because of Ms. Chaiyasut.  She was always so sweet and remembered our favorite dishes.  After recently moving to the west valley, I started searching for legit Thai food places.  Stumbled upon a New Times review of Line Thai and was stoked to learn that Ms. C had taken it over!  I had been to Thai Rama twice after she left and the flavor (food and service) was not the same.  Went in to Line Thai last Sunday and it was like re-living some of the best times and food I can remember!  I went prepared to pig out in stretchy pants and had my favorites: fish patties for appetizer, phat prig King w/ beef, and sticky rice w/ mango for dessert.  Service was great, food was PERFECT and I can't wait to take my friends on the next trip!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places where I can ask for it Thai Hot and it comes out hot enough to bring sweat to my forehead.  Pure hell for some, but heaven on earth for me!"}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant 5 stars but I had to compare it to Tom Yum. Tom Yum had more flavor, and they are able to accommodate your spice level. The curry here was spicy even though we asked for no spice. Other than that. The flavor was good and good quantity and quality for the money. The only other complaint I would have is the water is sink water, and nobody likes that."}
{"text":"5 stars for the staff, the service, cleanliness and food. Been eating here since 2009 and the food only gets better. My fave is the chicken and prawns pad Thai, though I've tried different items on the menu and seems that everything I've tried was delicious.   Ate here two weeks ago and was slightly disappointed with the portion sizes. It seems to have become smaller. But, I stand by my 5  rating."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant. Every time I've been there the food has been excellent and the service great. The staff keeps the restaurant clean which is very important to me. The only negative is that it closes from 2 PM to 4 PM each day, so I can't have an early dinner or a late lunch."}
{"text":"Today I'm sadden, I have been eating Thai Food from locations mostly on the east side, we happen to see this location and decided to try.  Mi Krob is my favorite appetizer except for Satay (beef) with peanut sauce.  The Mi Krob was NOT cooked (actually partially uncooked) correctly and tasted of dirty oil and maybe sweet and sour sauce gone wrong.  Shared with the server but instead server just said would you like to take home. Mi took it home becuz wanted a second opinion, they agreed nasty ended in the trash.    The Pha Thai was okay except shrimp were not cooked crunchy.  Peanut sauce was okay.  What I did notice was that most people stuck with menu items that are more Chinese style than Thai.   Prices were $$$ pricey.  I'll stick to the East side for Thai Food.  I've read some of the reviews and comment on soup right on...  Save your money and go East Phoenix for Real Thai Food."}
{"text":"Consistently tasty food, generous portions, and always excellent service.  There was one quirky little thing on their menu.   Thai Iced Tea -- $2.50 Thai I.Tea without ice -- $3 Owning restaurants myself, I understand why the higher price but you just can't sweat those picky little price details, especially something that must not come up that often.  Makes me wonder if they are willing to cut costs too severely in the kitchen, also."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai spot. The food has been amazing, and the staff is so nice! So glad I found Line Thai!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not fantastic. I have had some pretty great Thai.  Went in for lunch and got the red curry and yellow curry specials, as well as pad thai.  The yellow curry was dark, and kind of like gravy. The potatoes were cooked all the way through, and smashed easily when pressed with a fork. I've had better.   The red curry was served with chicken, green beans, and bamboo shoots. It was looser and orange colored. Kind of like coconut milk with a hint of red curry, however it had good flavor and heat.   The pad thai tasted like you would want and expect.   Service was good, very accommodating to my 1 year old. They brought him soup complimentary. They did forget to bring our check though, we had to walk up to ask for it.  Overall, it was decent Thai. I would try a few other spots to see if there is one I favor in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch.  We were pleasantly surprised at how immaculate and lovely the restaurant is inside, and impressed that we were immediately seated. The rest of our visit the waiter was attentive and prompt. The food was very tasty, and the atmosphere quite and peaceful.  I wish we lived nearby so we could try more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Just very good food. The area, building and the decor has something to be desired, but we really like the food and the Thai iced tea with cream."}
{"text":"Delicious food. We ordered red curry, cashew chicken and pad Thai to go. The food more than fed 3 of us. We enjoyed a glass of Chardonnay while we waited. We ordered medium spice/heat, but the red curry was super hot. Ambiance inside was your usual middle of the line Thai restaurant - nothing fancy."}
{"text":"SO salty. And completely over priced. The Tom yum soup is okay but the fried rice and pad see ew noodles were way too salty. I used to come here a lot but the last 3 times it's been on the salty side and this time it was way too much salty. I did complain about it and they still charged us s for something we didn't eat. I personally do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We love the food here. The curry dishes are fantastic and we seem to always go back to them. We also find the food to be very consistent which is great if you find something you really like, you can expect the same flavor the next time around when you order the dish.  Service/staff is super friendly.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for lunch at least once a week for about two years.  I absolutely love the food here, and the service is fantastic.  It's also a bargain for the price.    Try the #4 medium on the lunch menu or the Hot & Sour soup.  The yellow curry (#2 lunch), red curry (#3 lunch) and the #6 lunch are also delicious.    I love this place!"}
{"text":"Yep, definitely a fan of Line Thai. I headed here one day for lunch with my mom and wife and we had a very nice time. The food was really well done and presented nicely.  I had a yellow curry that was spiced well - although I would recommend that if you like spicy Thai food you should not be afraid to go \"Thai hot\" here since I thought my \"hot\" was just mild. The dishes my ladies got were also good, but nothing spectacular. This may sound weird, but I have never seen Thai dishes spelled in English the way they do on their menus. It made for some initial confusion until I realized, \"Oh, the 'moo priao wan' is actually 'pad priew wan,'\" among other things. Of course there are descriptions, so don't freak out. I really enjoyed my lunch there and can't wait to get back to try some dinner!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Thai restaurants in several cities in Thailand.   (The best is simple street-vendor food.)  I've also eaten in many different Thai restaurants in the US.  This restaurant is NOT GOOD.  It wasn't horrible, but was nothing to write home about.    I ordered the laab (they spell it lap).  It was just okay.  I also ordered the Panang curry.  It was terrible.  Panang curry should be a fairly light curry with kafir lime and a special mix of spices and a very subtile hint of peanut.  Their Panang was a very dark, heavy peanut sauce with no hit of what Panang curry should taste like.  Really less than good!    First and last time for this one."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai Restaurant! The interior was beautiful, and the service was semi good. The food was delicious, and I really recommend the fried rice and larb beef salad. We have been here twice already and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over 5 years and keep coming back.  The prices are reasonable and the lunch specials are perfect for a quick meal.  You can expect to see most items priced under $10.00  The fresh Spring Rolls are as good as I have had in Thailand, in fact better.  They have a reasonable quantity of shrimp and are very tasty.  I would not be surprised to find out that they were hand made.  I have not asked.  The Curries are just this side of Heaven and they can make them anyway you want, from mild to THAI HOT. The serving size on curries is large and I usually take home about half of the single serving.   Other dishes are great, and if you ask they will cook any item not on the menu if they have the ingredients.    My only complaint is that they do not have sticky rice.  The coconut ice cream is as good as great."}
{"text":"best thai restaurant in phoenix by far!!!! it's crazy, because this place is in sun city and you would probably not wonder in just by looks, but believe me, it is amazing!!!  i'm from chicago and have had great thai food. this is the best!!! try the #66 ( peanut sauce) with chicken and #65 ( yellow curry)  enjoy, and ask for ying. she is fun, funny and will steer you in the right direction!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai Restaurant in the valley. Very quaint Mom and Pop style. Lunch Specials are great too!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've eaten in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Best food and great pricing!! Service is always wonderful! I've been coming for years and will continue for many more!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, having been a server for 4 years I know what it means to be on a 3 top and to be slammed crazy busy. My husband and I went to this restaurant tonight to give it a try as we both love Thai. Our favorite Thai restaurant is located on the other side of town from us so we wanted to try & find an adequate one a little closer to us. We went on a Sunday night, which I called ahead and asked if they was a long wait, and the lady who answered said, \"What do you mean? How many tables do we have in the restaurant?\" I said \"No, is there a long wait?\"\"Oh no\", she said, \"we're not busy\" before briefly hanging up. That should have been our 1st clue that this wasn't a good pick. We got there to stand in the lobby for about 7 minutes before even being noticed. A waitress took us to our table and put the menus down and didn't say anything, just walked away. After 10 minutes of no service we saw the same waitress seat a table of 4 (older people) take their drink order and bring back their drink order at once. We sat there for 15 minutes before she even came over to take our drink order and by that time, we were beyond ready to order our food. She did not apologize or even seem to care the she just serviced the people she just seated and that we'd been waiting awhile. Our food arrived about 15 minutes later, I had the red curry and my husband had the Pad Thai with shrimp. The food was very mediocre. Our waitress not once came to ask how the food was, even after my husband noticed there were only 2 pieces of pretty small shrimp in his entree, he had to ask the bus boy for help because the waitress was of no help. The bus boy says, \"ya it only comes with 2 pieces.\" Paying for shrimp is already expensive, much less to get ripped off with only 2 small pieces. We sat for awhile waiting for refills & the check. The busboy finally brought our check. We left without a goodbye or thank you from any of the staff. My husband & I are in our 20's, we noticed most of the other guests in the restaurant received better care, we can only assume, because they were older. So, so dissatisfied with this place, will never return."}
{"text":"More flavors and freshness than I have ever experienced at a Thai food restaurant before. #75 fried rice with chicken ( med. In the spicey range was a little hotter than we expected, so it was PERFECT ). Pad Kee Mao chicken was fantastic as well. We visit twice a year from Seattle and drive by other Thai restaurants in order to get there. The atmosphere is Thai and never overly-busy. Service was very quick at 5 pm on a Tue. Drive the extra miles and try this place!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here off and on over the years always with enough time elapsed that I forgot why I didn't return.  This time I know fully why I won't.  There is no vegetarian/vegan option among the spring rolls, STRIKE ONE.  Most of the entrees are made to order, so substitution of tofu for the meat takes care of vegan concerns.  I stressed I want the dish to be spicy hot 12 on scale 10, in other words Thai spicy.  Too many Sun City customers have made them timid, at best the dish was about a 7. STRIKE TWO. I asked for their spice rack/tray, I believe they needed to get it out of moth balls. Spice added after the fact is never as flavorful as spice added during cooking, STRIKE THREE.  Now with this posted, I knew why I don't return."}
{"text":"Their curry is amazing. I have disliked Thai curry for a very long time, preferring Japanese curry. But after coming here, my whole curry experience has been revolutionized. The curry noodles and the coconut curry is really good.  Their Pad Thai is the worst Pad Thai I've ever had in my life. I don't even think you can even call it Pad Thai.  I don't know if the other yelpers here have tried Pad Thai before but it's supposed to be sweet and NOT spicy, salty, or SOUR! My husband and I were horrified to taste what they call pad Thai. It was like a Chinese version of sweet and sour spicy pad Thai. I don't even know if that description is correct because we could not figure out what we were tasting.   Another concern is that the bathroom stinks. And you know what they say about how clean a restaurant's bathroom is, it's reflective of the kitchen cleanliness. Just something I thought about.   But besides that.. Their curry is amazing. And we will be coming back just for it."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, very good food, nice quiet environment."}
{"text":"We have been dining here for over 3 years! Both lunch and dinner are wonderful. Full flavors of Thailand. The curry is my favorite! I also love Pad Thai, eggplant, pork and chicken dishes. Staff is very friendly and attentive to our needs. Very fast and reliable service. The half-roasted chicken is the bomb!!"}
