{"text":"Food is always served fresh. Their specials are not at a great price. In fact, the place is rather pricey for what you get, but I keep going back for over a year now so they're doing something right. It's never a long wait for your food. The place is clean. The staff are casual but professional. It's in a convenient location for the Hickory Grove area."}
{"text":"I LOVE TERIYAKI GRILL EXPRESS!! The food is always consistent no matter what it is and all the employees are amazing."}
