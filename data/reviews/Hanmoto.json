{"text":"went back for late night snacks a couple weeks ago. surprised to see empty spots on a friday night. my 2 friends and I shared a few things, including the hamachi tartare and the salmon aburi. loved the salmon. cool spot, happy to return again."}
{"text":"We came for my birthday dinner and were so impressed! The food was incredible and the atmosphere was top notch!"}
{"text":"Food was good if a little pricey given the smallish portions.  The portions are bigger than most Izakaya places though.  

Very small place with extremely small tables.  

Overall, it's a borderline 4 stars.  I'd rate is a solid 3.5."}
{"text":"Not a day goes by where I don't crave Hanmoto (and I live upstairs, so the temptation is there). The tartare, buns, Dino wings, drinks - all of it, delicious. Make sure to get there for 6 to get a table, otherwise you take a lucky chance (it's usually an hour or so to get in). Either way, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The menu is quite small and the correct way to do business if everything you make is delicious - which it is.  They have an open kitchen, brick walls, great music and limited seating to create an imitate atmosphere. I went on a Wednesday night with a girlfriend and we shared 4 plates and dessert. 

Dyno wings - I loved this, it's a chicken wing stuffed with a dumpling.

Salmon Aburi - they're very generous with the salmon portion as we needed more nori to wrap it

Uni bomb- I love uni, but was a bit disappointed in the portion size. The salmon roe on top of the uni and sushi rice was a nice touch

Eggplant - it was ok, again a bit small but presentation was beautiful 

Miso ice cream - it's a good thing we shared this because it can get a bit salty. Very unique texture

Cons: The seating is a bit tight, the menu is quite small and it's not the easiest place to find."}
{"text":"This review is based on the food and atmosphere. 

I was there with a couple of friends after work on a Monday night. You would need to get their early as space is extremely limited to 6 tables only (4 tables that fit up to 3 people and 2 tables that fit up to 6 people) no reservations. 

The good: 
Food was awesome, we got the salmon, chicken, okra and bao. This was split amongst 3 of us and we were all full :) 

The bad: 
The music volume in this place will literally give you a headache, they need to turn it down a notch. Can barely hear yourself. When I say it's hot in there due to tight space and an open flaming kitchen wear less clothing. It's dark and dungeon like in there, almost looking dirty which isn't a good thing, my window sill had dead bugs, not pleasant to look at when I'm eating. 

If you're a restaurant owner, you must take pride in the space you are serving. It's about getting repeat customers and not one timers."}
{"text":"We got to Hanmoto just before opening; short wait for a bigger table for the 4 of us.

Food was amazing, we tried almost everything on the menu and our fav's were the oysters, salmon aburi and fried chicken!

Loved the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"It's the kind of place that's worth it to go once for the food, but the awful service and wait keeps you from coming back. There's much better and more authentic Izakaya food and atmosphere in town without all the haughty bullshit.

Food was delish, Dyno wings and Salmon Aburi were pretty amazing, so were the buns. Enochi was quite disappointing.

Service was garbage though, twenty-something hipsters who were holier than thou. We got there at 7:30, and waited an hour and 45 mins to sit down on a stool with 4 people around a two-person table. Had a super yummy meal, but when we were done after the table had been cleared for about ten minutes and the server had brought us the bill, we told her one of the dishes hadn't come out but we were still charged and asked her to take it off of the bill. She told us that if the chef had started making it she wouldn't, she would just bring out the dish, like 40 minutes after everything else had come out and long after we'd finished the rest of the meal and the plates had been cleared (and it was a cold dish). WE told her we didn't want the eggs, as we had obviously finished our meal (as indicated by her bringing us the bill!) and were getting ready to leave. She argued with us about this, went to talk to the chef (who had obviously forgot to make the dish), came back, basically rolled her eyes and took the bill without saying anything and took the dish off. 
That there tainted the whole experience and will keep me from coming back. 
Also woke up in the night with a stomach ache and felt quite sick... Not really how you want to feel after a meal."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to go to this place after reading all the reviews. After waiting about 5 minutes for the waitress to even acknowledge us, she took down our number and said she would call us when a table was available. Over an hour later, we got seated, the food came very quickly, and then we were shoved the bill with a hurried \"No rush\". 

The food was tasty. 
The decor is super cool. All that deserves 3 stars, I suppose. 
The lack of customer service really turned me off. Although they did the basics and made it pretty efficient, there were no niceties: no \"how's your night going\", no \"how is your food?\", no \"do you want another drink?\" even! Maybe it's not the hipster thing to do. 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"TL;DR: food was decent but ruined by long wait times, poor service, and lack of responsibility by wait staff and restaurant manager.

Food is decent but service is terrible.  Came here on a Friday night with a group of 5, busy spot which was a good sign.  We were told the wait would be an hour so we left our name and went to grab a drink.  Came back 1.5 hours later and they said the table should be ready shortly.  About 10 minutes passes and they offered to seat us at a smaller table that was suitable for 3 or 4 people while we waited.  I made it clear to the hostess who sat us at the smaller table that we'd like to sit at the larger table for 6 once ready given we had waited almost 2 hours at that point.  After a few tapas (10 minutes) we see that the larger table is getting their bill so we ask to see if we can move.  They said that's not possible since they had already let another wait list guest know that the table was ready and they were on their way.  We told them multiple times that we only sat there on the premise of being able to be seated at the larger table once ready.  They just kept chalking it up to a \"miscommunication\" and never apologized once or tried to rectify the situation by calling the larger group to let them know they made a mistake.  After a lot of back and forth we paid on what we ate and needed to find a bite to eat else where as their lack of responsibility and ownership of the situation was disappointing.  We realized the other group who got the table was larger, maybe 8 people or so, so the manager that night probably just wanted to fill up the restaurant with as many people as possible.  Which would be fine if they had actually apologized for the situation and said it was a business decision or offered some sort of explanation instead of chalking it up to a miscommunication when we had a clear exchange before sitting down.  Won't be coming back to this establishment or odd seoul again."}
{"text":"This was a nice little place that was hidden. The interior isn't the normal izakaya look. It seemed like a place that got taken out of a game. But it works! Its located right beside a Beer Store which is a little weird. People can take advantage of this and go buy some beer then go here.

This place didn't take and resos. Thank goodness when we went here we only waited 15mins. 

The cocktails here however were delicious. Also matched well with the food we were eating. We tried almost all of their dishes. The eggplant and the uni bomb were the best dishes by far. 

Their Salmon Aburi wasn't as great as I interpreted it to be. Still good nonetheless.
The oysters were too vinegary to my liking but the flavours work with the spice and arare rice crackers."}
{"text":"Overall, a nice little spot to have drinks and asian bar food.  The dishes were all great for sharing, good flavour, good price.  We only tried 3 of the cocktails but they were all nice and refreshing. 

Highly recommend ordering the aburi salmon, hamachi tartare, oysters, and nasu dengaku.
The cops + rabas cocktail was my fav drink as I love ginger flavour in cocktails. The northtown nashi was also good if you prefer something light and refreshing.  

Unlike some other reviews have mentioned, I didn't find the music to be too loud at all.  Also, service was friendly and prompt. 

I took off one star due to the fact that it was reallyyyy hot inside when we went.  They had a large ceiling fan and the front door was open but we were still pretty much sweating the entire time.  However, the food more than made up for the lack of a/c (not sure if they actually have a/c and just didn't turn it on that night..?)

Anyway, definitely a cute little spot worth checking out if you're in the mood for asian tapas."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, but incredibly heavy. I feel awful today as I write this and I was up half the night. Ordered 2 miso steaks,  1 salmon, 8 buns, 3 dyno wings between 6 people. Drinks were good. Total bill came to $350 or so with gratuity. 

My issue with this place was the server. I get that your trying to be hipster wearing your black glasses and mom jeans. But when you have 6 people that drop serious money, try being friendly for a second. You didnt offer water, you didnt even talk to us. You didn't say thanks for the tip \"have a nice night\" you just brought a bill and left. You said 5 words to us all night. Sorry we weren't hipster like you..... but we spent more then anyone else in the restaurant last night and you walked away with a $50 tip.... at least act like you care!"}
{"text":"Finally visited Hanmoto!  Was worried it would be busy when we got there at 730pm, but it's summer and there were only 2 tables occupied.  It was a hot night, and we were worried that a small space like this would be warm inside.  But they had the fans / AC going and it was very comfortable.

We loved the Salmon Aburi - next time we'll have to have two orders so that we can have one each!  The hamachi tartare was also very good.  The wasabi here is very fresh, and if you have allergies at all, this is the remedy to clear up your nose right away!  We also tried the dyno  wings, moto eggs, and the pork belly bao.  The dyno wings were interesting - it was a little dark in the restaurant for us to deconstruct the \"wings\" to see exactly how they got the pork to stay on the bone, but it was definitely a fun dish!  In future, I think we'll skip the moto eggs and will ask for the pork belly bao to be served without so much \"sauce\".  It was delicious, but very messy, and the sauce overwhelmed the pork belly, which did not need its flavour covered up like this.

Service was prompt, easy-going, and the entire place had a cool, laid-back vibe.  The total bill, 5 dishes + a beer + a wine, was ~$75 (including tax, but before tip) which is super reasonable for what we had!  We left full (not overly stuffed, which is a good thing) and very happy!"}
{"text":"Had to check this place out because i am a huge fan of Oddseoul and the former Swish by Han. 
The food was incredible, I would go back for the Dyno wings alone. Also really enjoyed the Hamachi Tartare. Cocktails were delicious as well, overall everything tasted great. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because of the service. When my boyfriend and I placed the order we were given a funny look. When we asked why, we were told we ordered quite a bit of food and should consider taking something off. I told the server we were hungry and could handle it (I may be a girl but I'm Italian, we know how to eat) but he insisted. Sure enough, by the end of the meal i could have easily had another plate or two. But was too embarrassed to order more food... Next time, make a polite suggestion. Don't make a face and don't tell me how much i should eat. 
Other than that, i would highly recommend this place. Great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"A really great spot! It's a small hole in the wall, and well worth the wait if there's a line. 

If you don't like hip-hop, you may not love the atmosphere as the music is a little loud - but i love it and it made my experience a lot more fun. 

You must try the Dyno Wings and Salmon Haburi - really delicious, and super different than anything else I've ever had! 

Their dessert was to die for too - the miso icecream was again, so different than any other icecream i've tried. The portion looks small, but it's dense and splitting it between 2 is perfect!

The drinks are a little expensive, but taste great. 

It's one of my favourite new restaurants, and a really fun place to come for a date and small group of friends."}
{"text":"We were on a tour of the hood and stumbled across Hanmoto - looked interesting - I walked in - curious - one of the male staff was standing there in plaid shirt and told me what type of food they were serving  - I initially said 'oh, sushi' and he properly corrected me...BUT, his energy was so off-putting, cold, silently judgmental and unwelcoming I turned around and left and told me friend we were 'too old' to eat there --we are hard core Toronto foodies ....this type of energy kills the soul - if you are reading this - think about your behavior and try to work on it - you are in the HOSPITALITY industry. George Brown offers some great courses during the day."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place since I'm such a big fan of their sister restaurant, OddSeoul.  Was a little disappointed.  Most of the dishes were mediocre with the exception of the Uni Bomb. Service was very slow and we ended having to wait for a long time between dishes.  Likely won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been here two times. 
the food is very good, service is good.
smaller joint and special in its own way.
The food tends to run on the sweeter end. So if you don't like your food a bit sweet, you may not enjoy it as much. 
prices are good.
I recommend it."}
{"text":"Reviews sounded good, so I dropped in for casual drinks with a friend. There were no spots but the host offered to text when she could seat us if we went nearby for drinks, which was great. 

The space is too loud for a private conversation and it has the kind of semi-shared seating you'd best be narrow of hip and in firm control of your elbows. When we hesitated over the menu for a second, our deadpan server disappeared to do something else more worthwhile with her time.  

Left to our own devices we chose a couple of the recommended options and were prepared to order efficiently when the server reappeared. My friend picked the dyno wing and the jerk chicken sandwich, me the cold tofu which sounded suitably chill.

I don't even want to scratch my memory for details of the food, so I'll go with \"murky\" and \"limp.\" I nibbled a block of lacklustre tofu and then abandoned the effort, pushing through the \"why\" of the jerk chicken sandwich with difficulty. I didn't even want to tackle my wing, so it perched reproachfully upright in its box until we were finished. I made my friend take it home, in case someone had a craving for a wing spliced with a dumpling.

So yeah, that was Hanmoto."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that I have to give Hanmoto a bad review because the food is genuinely good. This would've been a 4 star review if I was going on the food alone. However, the service diminished my dining experience to the point that I feel compelled to comment. 

I came with 3 other friends and they started off with the hamachi tartare and Dino wings. I ordered the hamachi as well but for some reason, mine arrived almost instantly while my 3 companions were left waiting for their dishes for the next 5 minutes or so. Whatever, not a big deal. I would totally be willing to overlook this small detail if the service hadn't gone downhill from there. 

Twice servers brought food to our table that we hadn't ordered, which is maybe understandable in such a busy place, but their closing note to us, after we had spent 100+ and paid our bill, left a sour taste in our mouths. Not 2 minutes after we paid our bill, our server came by and informed us that \"you guys are finished (we were not, one of my friends was still finishing her drink) and there's a people outside, so do you think you could leave soon?\" I've never experienced any server tell me that in a restaurant before and it came across as awkward and rude. My suggestion is that since hanmoto is clearly so busy, maybe have some kind of seating time limit but at least inform customers about it first."}
{"text":"At first i was really annoyed that they didn't have a phone number, and they don't take reservations, but once I tasted the food all of that negative energy was gone. Yes, it requires some effort to get a table, but you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I've been to Odd Seoul several times and have always enjoyed the food and service despite the typical busy Friday/Saturday nights so I thought to try Hanmoto. Definitely not worth the 1 hour wait. I was very disappointed with the level of service from the staff and would not recommend coming here. The staff was rude and condescending. This was the first time I left a restaurant without finishing my meal."}
{"text":"Tried Okra here for the first time, I'm in love! The food here is amazing! It unique. The atmosphere is really cool too!"}
{"text":"Hanmoto really impressed me. It has been a while since I've been to a restaurant and had tasted something I haven't before.
The Dino chicken wings were good but you only need to eat one as they are coated in a super rich sauce.
I HIGHLY recommend the  Okra and Salmon Aburi.
I tried the curry bun but it was not my fave.
The cocktails are also solid and they compliment the food nicely.
Love this place I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Amazing late night eats. Absolutely try the chicken katsu sandwich, it's outta control. The salmon I've ordered is always fresh. Everything we've tried is super tasty and keeps bringing us back! Cocktails are great too. I wish this place could stay a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"WOW. Don't know how it took me so long to get here. All it took was a stumble over from Churchhill's next door (with their disappointingly closed kitchen) to Hanmoto. Place was bumping at 1:15 AM on a Friday night, but a table was opening up in 10 minutes. Consider it done. 

The surprises kept coming, though I shouldn't have been that surprised considering this is an establishment from the people of Oddseoul. The service was ridiculously amazing and attentive, experts at not making us feel rushed. Started with a Modelo and were offered shots of Jameson to go with it. Thank you! 

Next the food started pouring out. Dyno wings AKA deboned chicken wings stuffed with ground pork and bacon, deep fried with Kewpie mayo, nori, cilantro and hot peppers. What?!?!? I was not ready. It burst it your mouth while staying so intact, like a combo of a wing and a dumpling. Next, the katsu bun, a sous vide pork belly deep fried in panko, glazed in miso and sprinkled with sesame seeds. In a sandwich. Insane!!!!! Had Big Mac-esque, simple flavours while decidedly Japanese. We also had the Nasu Dengaku, deep fried Japanese eggplant with miso hollandaise for our veggies friend. It was perfectly tender and satisfying. 

But, the showstopper was the aburi salmon. SO CRAZY GOOD. Was expecting sushi, but out came a small mound of rice, covered in freshly blowtorched salmon, fish roe, scallions. etc. Toasted seaweed squares are served alongside, so there is great enjoyment is scooping things up and making your own.

Insane."}
{"text":"I've been to Han Moto 5 times and have introduced several friends to the restaurant.  I've eaten my way through the menu and have really enjoyed the food and atmosphere (even when trying to cram 4 people into the really small tables).
My only issue came most recently (Dec 21) dining with 3 friends when our server (who I hadn't seen before there) made our traditionally 5 star experience into a 3 star.  She was indifferent and borderline hostile to the group which did not go unnoticed.  I tweeted the restaurant on twitter and never heard anything back.  I'm less inclined to go back and haven't been back since."}
{"text":"The Moto Eggs have ruined me for life. I have to have more. Next week... no, tomorrow... tonight... right now! The katsu bun is delicious too. Service: friendly, relaxed. Location: hidden."}
{"text":"Its very early in its life but this place has a lot going for it.  When I first heard of this place as a new Izakaya I was eager to have another Toronto take on the style of restaurant.  Having been to Swish before I kinda had some early expectations of a hip and happening place with some really nice twists on traditional food.  Hanmoto is definitely a nod in that direction but also takes on its own  personality in a very warm and cozy way.  Much like the reality of Japan, most restaurants and bars are very small indeed with real estate limited and costly.  Hanmoto (at this stage anyways) doesn't even have a sign up on the door.  Situated on a very quiet residential street you wouldn't know it was here unless someone pointed it out.  Inside barely holds seating for more than 26 people and its a cozy 26 if it hits capacity.  the decor is inviting and hip without really making you feel like your in some made up recreation of japan.  The menu is presented to us on one sheet of paper and a decent selection of items are purveyed.  Having a group of five allows for some tastings as we decide to share a bunch of the dishes at the table while each choosing a sandwich for ourselves as mains.  Every dish actually stood out as great presentation, taste and portion.  We eagerly devoured every morsel on our plates and left feeling full and satisfied.  

Highlights of the meal were the aburi salmon with a the distinct hit of smokey lightly torched salmon served in a nice heap of sushi rice and all the usual accouterments.  The eggplant with crispy beets is another knockout served on a nice long plate and then the enoki is served tasting like it was made with pure butter.  I don't think you want to get a fat content percentage on this dish but enoki never tasted this good.  Finally the pinnacle of the meals the sandwiches are phenomenal.  You really don't want to pass on the chicken curry.  It's simply an awesome explosion of taste, texture and aroma with every bite.  Definitely a defining moment in the meal.  We finished the meal by trying the miso ice cream and even that was an amazing creation that both delighted and left us wanting more. it wasn't such a good idea to share that dessert...

Planning to come back to taste the rest of the menu and have some of the cocktails but I would happily recommend this place to anyone looking for some great food in a cozy atmosphere.

My only constructive comments would be that the speakers for the music seemed to require some wiring fixes as the music would flare up every once in a while and drown out all conversation. likely just a glitch and expected that it will be fixed by the time you visit.

And finally as a personal opinion only. For a take on Izakaya and it  being Toronto as it is, Izakaya's interpretation here is very good but not quite what my usual thoughts on Izakaya would be, usually in japan the menus are quite large with tons of variety of small dishes,  I don't believe Toronto really has ever had a truly authentic take on Izakaya yet, this place is no exception.  Most people will come in thinking of a full meal and this place delivers on that notion but I believe that in Japan it is usually more of a place to go after work and get a few drinks with friends and unwind for the evening with snacks for the drinking."}
{"text":"Best izakaya i've been in my whole life ! Every dish is delicious !!! We ve tried almost all the menu and we are the happiest people on earth. Respect to the chef"}
{"text":"Cant get enough of Hanmoto!! Me and bae are pleased to have found this place as it has recently become one of our favorite places to eat. Its a little hard to find but its worth the trip. I am now addicted to the dyno wings (deboned wings stuffed w. dumpling) and bae loves the salmon aburi. Try out the moto bun as well and make sure you get the miso ice cream before you leave!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the tartar as it was drenched in their tangy sauce; it really shouldn't be sitting in a pool of sauce.  Miso ice cream is very very good!   Stuffed wings are good but mine were a bit too salty, maybe it was just my batch."}
{"text":"Service: 4/5 (Notes: While the service here as been described as rude and indifferent, our experience was anything but that. Friendly and helpful as any other good Izakaya in TO, including soliciting feedback about the dishes. 

Decor: 4/5 (was aiming for a faux seedy look, without making patrons contract herpes from toilet seat)

Food: 4/5 (everything was yummy) 

Value: 4/5 

Repeat: Yes 

Gets crowded fast. Come early and leave your name for a later seating, that is the only way to book ahead for the same evening."}
{"text":"Hanmoto is a very \"hip\" Japanese fusion restaurant. There menu is quite small and between two people, we ordered half the menu. The presentation for each dish was unique and they also tried different takes on regular Japanese dishes. Every dish was enjoyable and did not end up choosing a favourite.

Their miso ice cream desserrt was extremely delicious and is enough for two people. 

Overall, had a decent experience."}
{"text":"Dino wings are delicious. Menu is a bit adventurous. Lots of seafood, not many veggie options. Be ready to try some interesting flavours. Tough to get a seat as it's a small space and it's kind of pricey."}
{"text":"Its hipster,small but interesting*  the food was good and not the typical flavours although it may sound like something you've had at other Japanese restaurants. We ordered Salmon Aburi, fry eggplant with beet, Hamachi tartare, and Dyno wings* For dessert we ordered their Miso ice cream which was different too because it had seaweed powders*   I would recommend all the above*~"}
{"text":"Just when we thought we couldn't easily be surprised any more by food in Toronto, we stumbled upon this fabulous place that is like a dive bar crossed with an izakaya, and the venue and food are both brilliant. We loved the shabby chic room, and were just wild about the stuffed chicken wings, incredible eggplant and some of the tastiest, silkiest tofu we've ever eaten.  All at insanely reasonable prices. A must visit in TO!"}
{"text":"It's easy to miss this little hole in the wall from the outside, but look behind the Clinton's on the corner for an unassuming box with a door and a long bench outside.

The decor is alleyway grungy cool, with a neon red glow that floods the right side and a dimly lit bar/main dining section. The music seems to shift between mellow R&B to upbeat hip hop tracks (thumbs up). I'd say this is not a place to come with a large large group (6 people at most) as the space itself is very cozy.

We ordered the hamachi tartare, dyno wings, salmon aburi, enoki and the miso ice cream to finish. The tartare was delish, great layered flavours. I also really enjoyed the enoki (buttery and soy-miso flavours) but it could have used a bit of acidity to cut the richness. The dyno wings were very good, but I wish I could have just ate the crispy skin with some rice as it was the best part. The aburi was good, though the rice was a bit dry and wasn't anything super memorable. I'd recommend skipping the miso ice cream even though it sounds really cool - it was cloyingly sweet, the miso was too subtle and not enough of the nori sprinkling to cut the sweetness. Save room for dessert and head down to bang bang ice cream or up to little italy. Overall for $28 each with tip it was a good amount of food for the price and we were full for quite a while after.

We didn't sample the drinks this time but I'd recommend checking them out, they all sounded really good and would pair well with the richer food. We came just a bit past 6pm on Sat and were seated right away (granted it was a long weekend). It'd recommend this place for a date night as the seating arrangement works well for this or catching up with a small group of friends."}
{"text":"The inside is a like mixture of hipster vibes meets some sketchy underground asian alley where  some shady deals are about to happen. Like everyone said, the restaurant is hard to find but it's lit up in red at night so look for that!

All of the food was delicious and you can't really wrong. Just don't try eating the rocks that the tapas are served on. 

Our favorites were the Katsu Bun, Nasu Dengaki (eggplant), and the Salmon Aburi which is served with seaweed wrappers. 

The dishes are a little hard to eat since they are all served in small dishes so work up your chopsticks skills before you dine."}
{"text":"Definitely sketchy looking restaurant when you first walk in. Reminiscent of a scrap yard or something lol.

But I think that plays in with their atmosphere and experience .

Food was awesome , try the stuffed chicken wings and the salmon aburi. Only issue is it's very limited seating so due to the popularity it took a while for us to get a table since there was no reservations .

I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem !!!
Love the atmosphere of this restaurant and of course the food is amazing !!

We had:
-dyno wings
- salmon Aburi
- okra
- uni bomb

If possible, you should try everything on the menu lol. Everything we had was so yummy.
The dyno wings are a must-try, it's chicken wings stuffed with dumplings. 

If you like okra- you must order this dish. It's seasoned so well and very tastey!!

This restaurant is pretty busy and i don't think they take reservations. I came here on a Monday night and it was pretty packed.

I definitely recommend this restaurant if you have not been here yet."}
{"text":"This little place is a gem and the food is out of this world. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable, and it is easy to see why this place is a going concern. The oysters are prepared by a genius ,truly the best I have ever had. The steak was perfect , beautifully seasoned and medium rare. Eggplant and the egg dishes were like little works of art. The wings speak to the quality of the Chef s imagination ,they were gone before they hit the Table!  Sapporo is on tap ,and  one cucumber cocktail especially refreshing. I can not say enough about how great  this place is ! A busy hub with a nice buzz of happy diners. Hidden away just off Dundas West , well worth searching it out. We'll done Guys!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! A small izakaya with great ambiance and friendly staff! 
A variety of sakes and cocktails, recommend the cocktail with cucumber(arisaka sour), so refreshing.
Highlight was the miso ice cream- to die for! Sweet and savory.
But I find the foods were TOO flavorful, although delicious. I had to drink lots of water afterwards. Recommend: hamachi tartar, enoki, dyno wings"}
{"text":"One of the best izakaya's in Toronto. 

This place is literally a hole in the wall. It's a bit annoying to find if you don't know where it is. It has no signs anywhere. 

The menu is tiny and the selection is very small.   On the menu, we tried:

Hamachi tartare- It was a tartare of fish. It was good but it wasn't anything mind blowing. I wouldn't recommend this. 2.5/5.

Dyno wings- Awesome! Best thing on their menu! These two wings are massive and are stuffed with a dumpling. Really cool, and tasty at the same time. Get this. 5/5. 

Moto eggs- Yum. It's a devilled egg that comes with a chicken skin and their sauce. Very delicious. 4/5. 

Salmon aburi- Torched salmon that you wrap with nori sheets. It was fun and tasty. 4/5. 

The plates are a bit smaller. I would recommend getting 2-3 plates per person to be reasonably satisfied. 

The service is standard here. Nothing outstanding, but they get the job done and the food to us in a reasonable time. Seating is a bit tough. We waited 30 minutes for a table of two on a weekend night.  Didn't get a chance to try the uni-bomb or the miso ice cream, but we heard good things about and will definitely come back to try everything else on their menu. 

Hanmoto is one of the most unique restaurants in the city. Worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday evening and had a wonderful experience. Not too busy and the service was great. We got the eggplant, the himachi, the salmon aburi, and the pork belly bun. Everything was delicious and well presented. 

Himachi was really flavourful, I found the best way to eat it was to try to get a bit of everything on each bite, which was difficult given the small pieces and chop sticks, but still manageable. Might be nice to have a bit of rice or something starchy to soak ip the sauce because I felt bad leaving all that flavour on the plate!

The soft eggplant with the crispy deep fried beets was perfect match of textures and flavours, and same goes for the salmon aburi, nice charred flavour with rice to soak up the sauce. Added bonus of making your own sushi roll, felt like the seaweed melted in your mouth. 

Finally the pork bun tasted like a mix between a big Mac and a filet o fish, but way more flavourful. 

One of my favourite dining experiences in toronto for sure, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Loved the drink (cherry bourbon). Food was interesting and inspired. Space was way too small. We were 4 shoved on a two top with barely enough leg room to even be able to sit. The room was freeeeeezing. The waitress was....scattered? Aloof??something. We asked what the Moto eggs were and she said \"devised eggs\"--trust me they are way more than this. She took the menu out of my hand while I was looking it over, before ordering a drink.  Since you'd most likely wait for a table here, I don't know if it is worth it. However the food+drink were so good"}
{"text":"Probably the best izakaya I've been to this year. We had half the menu (hamacha tartare, moto bun, katsu bun, enoki miso butter, etc) and nothing disappointed!

Note that they don't take reservations and the place is small, so look to come around by early if you can. We came with friends by 6:30pm on a Wednesday and got the corner table which was perfect for catching up!"}
{"text":"Wow. I don't write many reviews but this was just outstanding. Menu was small but that's obviously the point--do a few things really well. After living in Tokyo for years this would not be out of place...and not in the traditional Japanese way, more in the way that a creative Japanese hipster would have given it a shot. 
Have the eggs. We couldn't split them so we just ordered a second! Incredible bombs of flavours and textures."}
{"text":"When two of the five dishes you order are 'probably the best' you've had of that ingredient, you know you've found a gem. The eggplant is spectacular. The cold tofu rocked, the salmon was apparently fantastic. But the star was the miso ice cream. Serious now, it's not to be missed."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by warning you to pick off hours to come and eat here.  They have enough room for maybe 16 people, and none for groups bigger than 4.

This place gets a legit 4.5 stars.  If you don't mind tight spaces, or walking around in circles to find it (hint: it's beside Churchill), you can get delicious izakaya for cheap.  Had the hamachi tartare (warning it has wasabi), the dyno wings (dumpling inside a wing... what?!), moto and katsu buns.  The buns and wings are super rich - try the okra and enoki for a good mix.  The katsu bun tastes like a glorified sweet mcchicken.  I recommend everything including the cocktails.  Quickly becoming my top 3 spots for late night dining."}
{"text":"Great spot for some quality late night dining. I highly suggest the Enoki mushrooms and Salmon Aburi. Small space so might be tough to get a table with a big party, but super cool, laid back environment with amazing decor."}
{"text":"Good menu, loved the salmon aburi, dyno wings, miso ice cream. The moto eggs and eggplants were ok dishes but worth trying. 

Service was quick, attentive and we really liked the ambience; though for the instagrammers out there, beware it's dark :)

Prices were a bit high but it's to be expected from a place like this. Cocktails were around $13, beers around $7-9. Food prices average at $10 with a couple of exceptions."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Waited forever to get a table. Waitress all seem unhappy working there. Some dishes are very salty. It's really dark inside, food comes so slow. Don't waste your time and money going there. If you want to have izakaya or bar drinks, go anywhere else! Keep away from there!"}
{"text":"I liked the vibe of this restaurant but the food was OK...Odd Seoul so much better. Had the tuna tartare, it was, rich and creamy. The wings were crispy but the dumpling was nothing special which is the same comment for the pork belly bun and curry chicken bun.

Happy I went and tried this place but don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Miso ice cream was amazing and is highly recommended. We ordered salmon aburi and uni bomb too and they were great too. Place is small, and hard to accommodate large groups 4+."}
{"text":"Very industrial feel inside this bar. No signs or anything outaide indicating this is a resturant.

Food was amazing. Tried the deviled eggs, oysters, salmon, okra, dynowings, pork belly sandwich and miso ice cream. 

Deviled eggs - traditional deviled eggs with some an asian spin. Really enjoyed this dish especially the chicken skin and fish roe.

Oysters - were really fresh but would have liked it if there was less sauce. Also a bit steep in price.

Salmon - little cubes of seared salmon with some really tastey sauce and sushi rice. Great app.

Okra - nice spin on okra with a sour sauce and cheese. Really liked this unique dish.

Dynowings - the famous dynowings that brought us to this place. I did not think it lived up to the hype. The batter was a tad on the burnt side. The \"dumpling\" filling is actually the ground pork you would find inside a dumpling. Was really looking forward to seeing some dumpling skin in there. 

Pork belly sandwich - this was my favourite main dish. Tender pork belly which is then deep fried(!) And put between bread similar to a poboy. Recommend this!

The highlight was the ice cream. Very rich and smooth. Ended our meal perfectly.

Next time we visit we will be trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"O-M-G!!! I'm literally writing this as I walk out from Hammoto out of excitement - I think I found my a new favourite!!! This is definitely a hidden gem, the restaurant seems to be reconstructed from a house (I could be wrong). The space is fairly tight and it feels a lot like the street tapas in Japan. 

The food is absolutely AMAZING. Each bite is packed with flavours that just explodes in your mouth. Cocktails are some of the best I've had. Hands down my new fav Japanese tapas in Toronto. It SO rare to find a place with amazing food AND superb drinks. Oh and did I mention that it's very decently priced? I'm SOO happy to have found this new gem THANK you fellow Yelpers!! 

Definitely recommend the Uni Bomb - it's the bomb!!!!! The fried chicken special is A MUST but not on the menu so go soon before they sell out."}
{"text":"Super hip bar, very cool vibes, unique food concepts, but maybe not all of them are well executed in my opinion. 

Got here around 8pm on a Saturday night, and got a little bit lost because this restaurant doesn't have a sign! Just FYI its the place with the glowing red lights adjacent to the Beer Store. Kinda confusing but also kinda cool. We went inside and realized it was actually super tiny and packed. Luckily my friend is a regular and prepared other plans for us as he knew that there is always a wait. After leaving our names with the very friendly hostess we went close by for drinks while we waited for our call 45 mins later. 

The place inside as aforementioned is very small but I guess that makes it feel way more exclusive. The interior is dark with cool red and blue lights giving me kind of steam punk grungy vibes. The menu is quite small but we opted for the okra, the salmon aburi, hamachi tartare, the eggplant dish, and the ever so coveted dynowings. Despite being so busy, each dish came out rapidly. 
The okra came first and was covered in teriyaki sauce and bonito. Usually I love this flavour combination but I found the teriyaki sauce was just sooooo salty that my lips started tingling.
 Next up was the tartare which I thought tasted very fresh and very simple. I love simple don't get me wrong. But when its $8 for barely a handful of food, I kind of expect something a little more innovative.
After this the salmon aburri arrived and this was IMO the BEST dish. The rice was nice and moist with what I think was mayo, fish was fresh and the combination with the nori was just spectacular. While it closely resembles regular sushi rolls. I think it was genius that they decided to separate the main part with the nori as it allowed for more sauce without ruining the crispy seaweed. The smoky torched salmon was also a great touch. Definitely recommend this one! (We ate it so fast there's no picture!)
Last up was the DYNOWINGS! And yea this is pretty cool that they stuffed this much meat into a little wing but I thought while the skin was fried perfectly, the actual \"dumpling meat' was very plain on its own. 
WAIT I almost forgot the eggplants. You'll love it if you love eggplant. Deliciously grilled with interesting fried shredded beets on top. Can't say too much as I'm not a big eggplant person but I though the beets was very creative and brought the dish to another level.

Overall, very cool place with some interesting dishes but be prepared to spend some dough if you expect to be full."}
{"text":"Loved the okra, Salmon aburi, and eggplant dish. Very good flavour combo and unique preparation. Deep fried potato noodles strands on the eggplant is so neat! Dyno wings were a little too salty and just OK (koodos for the unique concept of stuffing it with a dumpling filling), and the pork bellt bun was too saucy but that was OK too. Miso ice cream (not pictured) is cool to try...not sure if we loved it but it was definitely interesting!"}
{"text":"The place is great, not on a fancy side. 
But that's kinda place I like the most - the one that cares about food quality and costumers more then it cares about outside decors and neat looking waitresses.
We've ordered four dishes and I can't pick one that was better then the others! Will definitely go back and try their other ones:)"}
{"text":"So the food here is actually fantastic. But there are some reasons why I might head elsewhere instead of coming back: the too-loud music, the service, the long wait time to get a table.

The first time I tried coming to Hanmoto, there was an hour and a half wait, and I ended up eating elsewhere. Came back another night and the restaurant was pretty much bare. We asked if we could sit at one of the benches/bigger tables, and were told that we had to sit at a small one. The whole time we ate there, no one else came into the restaurant, and no one else was using the big tables. It definitely would have been a more comfortable dining experience if the server had granted our request.

Ordered the hamachi tartare, eggplant, salmon aburi, and moto bun. All of these were absolutely delicious and well presented. We also got the miso ice cream, but I didn't enjoy it much. Found it to be too salty."}
{"text":"A must try in the Ossington area for me. It's a Japanese izakaya-style restaurant. I love the interior - although small, it's hip and fun. Don't expect lots of room - most of the seats are cramped and close together.

Salmon aburi: I've never had aburi salmon like this before. It's a lump of rice with salmon pieces surrounding it (dome-shaped), and it's torched. You use the seaweed provided to wrap up bites. Tastes pretty good, although I prefer aburi oshi sushi, this was a fun take on it.

Hamachi tartare: Not bad, portion wise. Lots of sourness and chilies mixed with the chunks of hamachi.

Dyno wings: Two giant stuffed wings, deep fried and crispy. They put some sort of dumpling at the end of a wing tip so that it looks like a giant drumstick. One per person is more than enough! Juicy and delicious.

Miso ice cream: this was my favourite item of the night. A must-order for me if I come again. The flavour of this ice cream is nothing I've ever had before, and I've tried a ton of ice creams. It's slightly salty, very creamy, and a bit sweet. It's covered in seaweed flakes as well as crispy rice which gives it a nice crunch. SO GOOD!

The fun atmosphere along with the fusion dishes bring this place up to 4 stars. I wouldn't say the food is amazing, but it's pretty good for Toronto Japanese food! Come early because it was packed by 6:30 pm."}
{"text":"This place is really small and gives off a dingy vibe... but I did enjoy my visit here.

The dyno wings are 2 deep fried chicken wings stuffed with a juicy dumpling inside. Although it was very flavourful and was interesting to try, it was way too salty. 
The salmon aburi is torched salmon on a bed of sushi rice. We enjoyed this a lot as it was very yummy, and it comes with nori on the side which adds great texture when eaten together. 
The tuna tartare was really good - more on the citrusy side. It gives off a refreshing taste after eating something oily.  

All the food had awesome flavour. Service was ok, but the place is really dark."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Food : Confirmed amazing! Atmosphere: Real life Boondocks. Service: Informative and unpretentious.

This was my second time at Hanmoto. This time I made sure not to be so drunk that I forgot half of what I ate. I was even more impressed. 

We had the chirashi tartare again, which was amazing, again. The pork belly in coco bun was so fresh tasting, very light flavours but rather pronounced. It made the fact that it's deep fried chunk of pork belly slathered in some crazy delicious mayo wrapped in a coco bun seem less greasy. So good. There was a raw salmon dish where it is arranged in a mound entirely covering seasoned rice, served with nori sheets. The salmon was fresh and flavourful, very lightly torched to provide a charred flavour without actually cooking the fish. The rice was creamy, almost like a risotto. The uni-bomb was fairly good. The presentation was brilliant, but the uni had kind of an odd flavour but I'm really not well versed so it might have just been my palate. The salmon roe was like little juicy flavour bombs that explode when you bite down on them. Finally Dyno Wings... From the last time I remembered being kind of \"meh\" but I have no idea why. They were incredible. The coating was like a shell of caramelised sauce. So much sweetness and acidity and saltiness... The meat was juicy and delicious, the dumpling stuffing added more layers to an already incredibly flavourful dish.

 Everything about this place is awesome. The kitchen is open until 2. Hanmoto is a cook's dream."}
{"text":"Started off with two dishes and ended up trying almost everything. The ambiance, the food, the cocktails and the service all fit a cohesively thought through experience that is superb. Perfect for a date or a group hangout."}
{"text":"Dark, sexy, hip. It's as if you are dining on a post apocalyptic movie set (think: Akira).
The kitchen is so small that it over spills onto an alcove under the stairs to the bathroom. You can see a guy chopping up nori sheets as he munches on some while you dine. Let's face it, you want to come here for the experience. 

That's not to say that the meal doesn't satisfy, because they bring it in the pint size kitchen. The food doesn't shy away from flavours, multiple times they wowed us. Although not everything is a winning dish for us, and I seem to not agree with some yelpers here, our favourite are the Salmon Aburi, and hot hot tofu, and Uni bomb. 

Also had the miso ice cream - would recommend trying it if at least 2-3 people are willing to share. It's quite an umami explosion and not for the faint of heart."}
{"text":"4.5 STARS

My husband and I stumbled upon Hanmoto when planning a date night and decided to check it out. It ended up being a fun, delicious and different night out that we really enjoyed. 

THE FOOD: The food is Japanese small plates style which are composed to both look beautiful and taste amazing. While we were impressed with everything we chose, the dino wings and Nasu Dengaku particularly stood out.

THE DRINK: We both ordered cocktails even though we usually find them overpriced and overrated. But we both loved our choices and enjoyed the unique flavours.

THE SPACE: This place is tiny and eccentric- industrial warehouse with pharmacy-inspired decor. I found that the aesthetic didn't do much for me. I also didn't love that we were seated at a tiny, wobbly table with vintage (read-uncomfortable) chairs. 

THE SERVICE: No problems here, we got great recommendations and although the place was full the service was attentive and fast."}
{"text":"Hanmoto is a fusion restaurant on Lakeview specializing in mixing Japanese and western flavours. Hanmoto looks like a small dive bar with its bare brick walls. The set up invokes the street food vibes of Southeast Asia where you order food at a small food stall and eat the food on the curb, standing or squatting on a small table. This is quite fitting seeing as Hanmoto is serving a lot of \"street food\". 

I would recommend visiting Hanmoto with a group of friends so you can sample a few plates. One of the standout plate is the Dyno wings which is Hanmoto's signature dish. The Dyno wings are deboned chicken wings stuffed with ground pork and bacon then deep fried to a crisp. The Dyno wings are served in a cute Chinese take-out box with Kewpie mayo drizzled over top along with nori, cilantro and hot peppers. Other plates that I would recommend include the katsu bun and hamachi tartare.  

I would recommend paying Hanmoto a visit if you want to visit a fusion restaurant that's unique and out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Eclectic tiny place. U nique menu with delish food combos. A date brought me here, knowing I'm a foodie. My 1 critique would be the Miso Steak..great flavors, but a little tough and too fatty. A FLANK steak would be perfect cooked this way"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food
less than 1 star for their less than stellar attitude and service (at the end of night)  

The night start out lovely but ended on a sour note. We've been to this chic little shop a couple of time with mostly great experience. This time around was a little more than disappointing. The BF and I ordered the karrage special, Nasu Dengaku, Moto Eggs, and dyno wings...between us. Our friends ordered more orders dyno wings, the moto and katsu buns, both the salmon and Hamachi aburi and tartare. There was a lot of food between 5 diners and a sleepy friend.   

Food was good as always. I was not a big fan of our karrage special as it was tough, and lack crisp. It was just lack-luster and boring. The dyno wings were a bit bitterer for my taste. The star of the show was definitely the moto egg. Textually, it was interesting and worked well together. The crunch of the chicken skin added the boost. The temperature and taste were impressively well balanced.    

Food was good in all. Service flowed smoothly. However, issues surfaced come time to pay the bill. At time of seating, we were never told of their auto gratuity policy. The waiter handed us the bill as he mentioned in passing in a \"by the way\" type of attitude. Apparently a table of 6 or more, auto-grat will be mandatorily applied. I've mentioned earlier that 5 of us were eating and 1 of our friends was seated but did not eat. We did not fight them on that. The auto-grat was a whopping 20%, definitely higher than most auto-grat in other restaurants places. We did not argue nor make a fuss. We paid. In the process of paying, another 20% was auto prompt, and if our friend (who was operating the POS), was not coherent or observant enough, she would've tipped on top of the ridiculous 20%. As we were getting ready to leave the venue, we were discussing it amongst ourselves about the fact that the 20% was automatically loaded as a default tip amount and patrons would have to take steps to change the amount. On this matter, I believe that all serving staff should be tipped for their service but the amount and percentage should be set to what the diners see fit. Anywho, on our way out, the server stopped us in our tracks to tell us we didn't tip on our bill. The same server that threw us the \"by the way\" 5 minutes earlier. Offended, confused, and frankly a bit pissed off on the unfounded attack, we asked about auto-grat...without skipping a beat, he decided the best course of action was to explain it away INSTEAD of a genuine apology of our table. That was beyond ridiculous. We left without hearing that apology."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the past year, both solo and with family.  Food is \"sprinkled with crack\" tasty and reasonably priced; cocktails are on par with the food.  I challenge anyone to find a finer mushroom dish than the Enoki here.  Or eggplant.  Or Pork Sammich.  The raw Tuna & Salmon plates are also luvly, Overall management and attention to detail are fantastic, if not oriented to please the chi chi poo poo set."}
{"text":"Behind Churchill on Dundas st. is Hanmoto, I state this because it can be a bit tricky finding the place. It's a small eclectic space, seating a maximum of maybe 20 just by eye. It's cozy, warm and dim. 

I wanted to come visit because I am a fan of Oddseoul, a Korean snack bar. Hanmoto is a Japanese snack bar which features Japanese flavors in very creative and delicious ways. 

I had the whole menu and everything was quite tasty, I was very impressed with the food they whip out of the kitchen. All items are made to share so visiting with a group of 4-6 is a get way to try a lot for much less. Portions are larger than you think and what you may be used to at snack bars, I appreciate that!  

My Favorites:
Salmon Aburi - DIY torched salmon sushi (comes with nori sheets, wrap yourself)
Nasu Dengaku - Roasted eggplant with fried beets and awesome miso Hollandaise
Dyno Wings - Dumpling stuffed crispy sweet chicken wings, blew my mind

Passable
Salmon Face - I'm a eater, but a salmon head is a bit daunting, boney & not worth $12 

Shishito Peppers - a tad flavorless despite bonito flakes, needs a sauce or mayo

Overall, I really enjoyed my meal. The items were all pretty unique, prepared in creative ways but sound and taste simple. Everything makes sense, every bite comes together and portions are surprisingly larger than you may expect."}
{"text":"The food was great and unique, we both loved it.
Its pretty loud inside and get busy.
Its kinda hipster style service so everyone wants to leave cool impression as no 1 priority and the gold service and being nice. Still, good joint for a drink and good unique snack. Glad it's in my hood!"}
{"text":"Unique. Amazing food at a good price point. I'd normally bitch about the beer but the Brooklyn lager is not a run of the mill lager. Anyone who gave this place a bad review is an idiot"}
{"text":"There's very little seating available so the wait times can be long if you come during peak dining hours. Good for a date or with a small group of friends. 

For 2, the portions were not bad as we were pretty full off 4 dishes but I would imagine that a bigger party (of even say, 4) would have to order doubles of a single dish to get a real bite.

It's a small menu but everything sounded very appealing and at reasonable prices too. We ordered the hamachi tartare, moto eggs, dynowings and salmon aburi.

Hamachi tartare ($12) was very good but perhaps the least memorable dish for me.  Loved all the components and it had great texture but there was just a tinge of acidity to it that I wish something else on the dish would help balance out. 

Moto eggs ($7) was fantastic. The chicken skin and sauce really completes it. Everything worked so well together!

Salmon aburi ($10) was great too. Evenly torched salmon that comes with nori sheets for DIY wraps which was fun.

My favorite and reason why this place captured my interest in the first place was the Dynowings ($8). Pork dumpling stuffed in a jumbo-sized chicken wing accompanied with spicy tare sauce? Yes please! It's a dish that really gives you a lasting impression and it would be the main thing I come back to this place for.

Didn't get a chance to try any of their signature drinks. They all sounded really cool and I've heard good things but they're on the pricer side ($12-13) in comparison to the food. 

Food is fantastic. Service is passable. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Hanmoto after becoming a huge Oddseoul fan. Did not disappoint. The menu is rather small but the few things I tried were just delicious. My favorite were the Dyno Wings and the Katsu bun. The prices are decent a bit higher priced than Oddseoul in my opinion. However the flavors are worth it. The service is good and the place IS TINY so you can expect to wait."}
{"text":"This place is really hard to find with no sign at the front of the restaurant and its kind of hidden in a corner. If i remember correctly, its facing the beer store. I actually tried this place a couple of months ago and ordered practically everything on the menu. 

The restaurant environment is quite unique, it's dark and i want to say its a cross of grundgy dive bar/ gothic hipster but idk, maybe it's just me....

I hope that they added some new items to the menu as I'm planning on going again before the summer ends!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations going into this place. The reviews were quite good by most sources (Zagat, Google, Yelp, Foursquare). The food was ok/good but I wouldn't say it was the best in town. I was quite disappointed with the dyno wings. It's basically a ch wing attached to a dumpling deep fried. Personally, the dumpling didn't have any distinct taste. I was hoping it wouldn't feel like a TnT dumping but it did. Some of the items lack of flavor even though the textures were well executed.

Sadly, the best item on the menu is not an appetizer or a main. It's the dessert. The Miso ice cream was extremely yummy. I would go back for the ice cream only. The second best item in our meal was the was the Uni bomb. It's my first time eating Uni and I quite enjoyed it. 

The atmosphere and customer serivce deserve a 5 stars: music level and ambience was on par. I want to love this place but it hasn't sold me. I rather go to the Foxley than wait in line. I will go back and try other items. Hopefully, it will change my mind."}
{"text":"Great home made cocktails, great eats, funky vibe. Great Blues that bartender sometimes sings along to. Can't be a better night out."}
{"text":"Went to Hanmoto this past Friday night, when we first arrived it was about an hour wait to get in. I have no problem waiting when it comes to good food, and knowing one of the co-owners of Oddseoul was behind the newly opened Hanmoto, I was eager to try it out!

The food was truly unique, I've never had anything like it, from the Dyno bones (boneless chicken wings stuffed with ground pork and bacon-delish) to the whole okra (topped with thinly sliced dehydrated salmon- amazing), every item had a twist to it. The drinks were also quite impressive, I would highly recommend the cherry bourbon eggwhite cocktail.

My only suggestion for Hanmoto would be to have your server/hostess', as lovely as they were, to be more informed about the food/cocktails. Nonetheless, the experience all in all was great and we will definitely be returning. If you are a (moderately) adventurous eater, and not vegetarian (lol), you too will see that the food speaks for itself! Thanks Hanmoto!"}
{"text":"Ordered everything on the menu with a group of four people. Dishes are very small. 

Standouts are the eggplant dish, hamachi, aburi, okra (not for everyone though), and the steak special was phenomenal (they should make it a regular). 

Drinks were good, we really like the cops and raba. 

Service was weird, there were too many waiters for the space and they looked bored but a few times they didn't notice our drinks were empty and we had to flag them down for refills. Also, food was paced very quickly. With 12 dishes & 2 rounds of drinks ordered, we were out in 1 hour 20 mins. 

Overall, decently priced, good for a casual weekend meal. Dishes were fun and interactive. Would come again."}
{"text":"This place is not your typical looking restaurant. It's a tiny hole in the wall, pretty hard to find kind of place as there is no signage. They don't take reservations and there is no number to call. The place is always packed with line ups. The place probably seats 30 people max and pretty dark inside. I believe this venue use to be a garage or some sort.

The food is phenomenal! The menu isn't extensive but everything is pretty tasty and flavourful. 

Been here twice and would come back more often if the wait wasn't so long. With that said, the wait is TOTALLY worth it!"}
{"text":"Tucked away on a small street off ossington with barely a sign, this place oooooozes in coolness. Inside its dark and industrially decorated, with photocopied handwritten menus. Its also a really small place. 

we (table for 2) got there fairly early on a Friday night around 6.30pm, so we were quickly seated at the bar after about 10 minutes. They also dont have space to hang your jacket anywhere so theres basically a pile on top of a keg in the corner. 

Loved sitting at the bar watching the food and drinks being made. Everyone gets the Aburi Salmon, a good sized serving of fish, but way too much mayo for my liking. But the slightly torched crips on top added a great smokey flavour. But the Dyno Wings are the best, sticky, sweet and savory. They are large and meaty, crispy and saucy its just a whole lot of deliciousness going on. 

The service was good, young, hip but friendly enough, a few sentence exchanges but then back to the im too cool look. This place is good but very hyped up, Im not running to come back but I would again"}
{"text":"Hanmoto is a restaurant with one of the best and coolest ambience I've ever experienced. This restaurant did an amazing job portraying all aspects of the restaurant to reflect a vintage Chinese food stall theme. Even the outside lacks a sign, and can only be identified with its red lights (haha). 

Onto the food.

We ordered a katsu bun, dyno wings, salmon aburi, and finished off with a miso ice cream.

katsu bun: the tenderness and juiciness of the pork patty, combined with its appropriate and distinct choice of sauce reminded me of a gourmet version of MCD Big Mac! 

Dyno wings: what makes this dish unique is that the wing has a pork dumping fused into where the drumstick should be. At first glance, the wings looked extremely appetizing. And it would've tasted just as good if the flavour was a bit toned down. The saltiness of the sauce made it a little hard to enjoy at the end. Nonetheless it was still a good dish overall.

Salmon aburi: this was arguably the best dish of the night. The combination of the salmon, sauce, and oven roasted seaweed creates a melt in your mount that you can't resist and satisfied our tummies! 

Miso ice cream: a definitely must try! Made with condensed milk, white miso, and tiny rice cake balls was truly a delight!"}
{"text":"What we ate:

- Uni-bomb
- Hamachi Tartar
- Enoki with Miso Butter
- Japanese Eggplant
- Okra

Everything was amazing, including presentation, time to table and value. Service was good and fast. Standout dish was Hamachi Tartar. It was a heaping serving with lots of complex flavour. Unlike any other tartare I've had (and I've had hundreds!)."}
{"text":"Hanmoto is a small bar just a couple of steps away from Dundas and Ossington. Getting sick of hitting up Get Well and the Painted Lady every Saturday night? This might be the right place for you to try. If you can find it, that is...

Hanmoto has a great vibe. There's a good chance that your party is going to be seated at a tiny table, but if you're okay with that, Hanmoto will treat you well. It's candle-lit and kind of grungy with a laidback atmosphere: perfect bait for your average hipster.

If you're in the mood to eat, TRY THE DYNO WINGS. It's what I order every time I come here, and that won't change any time soon. There's a pretty good selection of interesting cocktails, and I haven't tried one that I didn't like.

Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I've heard some amazing things about this place but since it was popular and only seated 30 people I figured my chances to get a table were slim at 9 pm. Fortunately, I managed to make it there when they opened and it was delicious.

This place is hidden away at Ossington and Dundas, I walked past this place several times since it didn't have a sign. The interior was small, dark and a boom box playing beach side music. If I was ever at a Japanese beach and going to get beach food this is what I would expect.

The menu consisted of 10 items and I think its best to share with your table. The prices range from $7 to $15 dollars a dish.

I strongly recommend the hamachi tartare, a great blend of citrus,wasabi and that creamy taste from the avocado was amazing!

Dyno wings: a deboned chicken wing, stuffed with bacon and pork. Deep fried with a sweet soy sauce and Japanese Mayo. Need I say more?

The salmon face was a bit disappointing. The salmon was torched and left a bitter taste. Wasn't my favourite dish of the night.

Moto eggs: Japanese style deviled eggs with chicken skin chips and king salmon roe. This was amazing, each component just worked together and tasted great!

Then the moto bun: this can't be shared and is better for one person. The is a Jamaican spiced Japanese chicken  curry with a coleslaw and was deliciously spicy. Oh, did I mention the bun was deep fried?

This place is fantastic! A must go to hidden gem in  Toronto."}
{"text":"I love Hanmoto!! This restaurant is so small - seats perhaps around 20 people, but their food is delicious and worth the wait. My favourite dishes are the salmon aburi and dyno wings (the wings are rich so one per person is good enough). Their buns are just ok, I have had better. The miso icecream is good and a nice change from regular dessert flavours. I will be back again for their salmon aburi :)"}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place was the literal definition for a hole in the wall. There wasn't even a sign outside telling you the name of the place. 

WHERE IT IS: If you're on the north side of Dundas and you are standing at The Beer Store, it's on the other side of the street. Look for an area that has a long wooden chair besides a door right before the area becomes residential. Go through that door. You should see the restaurant inspection sign that says hanmoto from outside.

Walking in, it's pretty dark inside, but they have an interesting vibe. Their menu was small and their alcohol selection was about the same size.

We ordered the eggs, hamachi tartare and their chicken wings. They were all excellent. The eggs were probably the best in taste and they did take a lot of care in preparing the eggs to make it look like the daruma doll's that were on our tables! I do like their chicken wings, it was fried well, but there were a wing or so that wasn't as juicy. As for the hamachi tartare, that was also nice and i liked the sweet chili, but i got too full by then. The portion sizes aren't that big, I had a small meal beforehand. This place is good if I took a friend who wants to drown their sorrows.

Service: 4.5 / 5
Food: 4.5 / 5
Price Point: 3.5 / 5

Overall: 4 / 5

It's on the tad-higher end on price, but the food was pretty tasty and flavorful. But there were a few slight deficiencies, hence why I knocked off a few points. I'd like to try their drinks sometime. Also, it feels like it was a bit dirty, but you can't tell because it's dark. It was definitely an interesting take on food."}
{"text":"super good, the host and staff are friendly, attentive. the menu is a bit small, we almost ordered every single item on the menu, everything is good, especially the chicken wing and eggplant.  for sure be back again"}
{"text":"Hanmoto is literally a hidden gem in the West end. There is no sign outside - to get inside, walk through the ironically open door inconspicuously located on Lakeview, behind Churchill Pub. The dimly-lit, grungy atmosphere is perfect for their yummy, experiential dishes - from Dynamo Wings (duck-stuffed chicken wings) to Miso Ice Cream (tastes like thick salted caramel gelato) to Hamachi Tartare (make your own mini-rolls). 

Four of us shared seven dishes and one dessert and left satisfied. The service is casual yet personal, and the price is quite reasonable (~$20 each) for a delicious and fun dinner experience."}
{"text":"Hanmoto was rather disappointing. The menu does lot offer a large selection and there are a lot of fried options. 

We got the chicken wings (3/5). They were stuffed with meat and just not very tasty.

The abore sushi (5/5) was the best thing we tried although you have to roll your own sushi! I can see that appealing to some crowds. My preference is that someone else prepares the rolls.

You have to walk through a part of the kitchen and climb stairs to get to the washroom which wasn't a great experience either.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"My fav waitress Hailey isn't here any more? Say it ain't so! Noooo....

Other than that anguish, the food here is awesome.
:-)"}
{"text":"Before you even step in to this place, you'll probably need to take a double take before finding it, as there's no signs and almost hidden on Lakeview. Once inside, you're greeted with a small, grungy space, almost like you're in someone's garage, but in the best way possible. The decor is charming with vintage signs and accents here and there and neon signs to contrast. 

We had the Uni-Bomb, Dino Wings, Salmon Aburi, Roasted Eggplant with Fried Beet, Katsu Bun and to end off, the Miso Ice Cream. Highlights were the Salmon Aburi and Uni-Bomb as the flavours together worked really well although I felt the salmon supposedly being raw was a bit overcooked. The Dino Wings, their most popular dish, was alright. The batter wasn't great, felt a bit too fried and the stuffing just felt like eating a dumpling. Not sure why people rave about this? Also, skip the Katsu Bun, it's not worth the money at all. The roasted eggplant with fried beet was excellent, definitely recommend. Miso Ice Cream, was a bit strange.. Felt too salty and had no balance.  

Overall, great vibes, service was average and food was also only okay. Did not try any of their drinks this time, but I can see this as a good place for a snack and/or drinks after dinner."}
{"text":"A tiny hole-in-the-wall type restaurant tucked away in the West end. Very dark, grungy and small. Good for groups of 2. Eclectic menu, pretty expensive ($40pp with drink). 

We had: 
Salmon Aburi - torched salmon pieces on top of rice, served with seaweed. Usually not a huge fan of the aburi hype but this was good!

Uni Bomb - love my uni, topped with crispy chicken skin!

Dyno Wings - pork dumpling stuffed inside chicken wing. tastes better than it sounds! Nice sweet crispy skin. 

Katsu Bun - a tender pork belly, with shredded lettuce and mayo really reminds me of a slightly upscale version of McDonalds

For drink I enjoyed the Iggy Smalls - grapefruit & thai basil cocktail"}
{"text":"We checked this place out after work on a Friday around 6:30pm, nobody was there yet so we walked right in! 

The servers were terrific and we loved the space, it is small but cozy. 

Every single piece of food was spectacular, my personal favourites were the tartare and the spicy tofu. The tartare was citrusy and tangy, the tofu was not spicy (which was fine with me) and the pickled peppers matched with the sauce were tart and slightly sour, which paired well with the soft smooth tofu. 

Obviously the Dyno wings are a must... Honestly though, every single thing on this menu is gold. 

Lots of options for vegetarians too!"}
{"text":"This is probably heaven for your mouth. The food here is incredibly tasty - so flavourful! Everything on the menu is amazing - no exaggeration. The cost is extremely affordable too! Super low key, laid back place. The music and ambience is awesome. This place is tough to find but it's worth searching for. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've appreciated Izakaya's around the world from the ultra-traditional in small-town Japan, where they are much better at sitting on the floor than me, to the ultra-hip Toronto version of Guu Izakaya.  Approaching Hanmoto, there was no moat of flaming dog turds, just a building that looked like a shack with ultra-loud music and papered-over windows.  In contrast to both the traditional and hip versions, there were no shouts of \"Irasshaimase!\" to greet us upon arrival, merely a flannel-clad waitress looking bored.

The meal did start well-enough.  There are indeed several interesting cocktails on the menu (all $12-$13), which incorporate Asian flavours like kaffir lime and ginger in variants of classic cocktails.  Our first dish to arrive, the Hamachi Tartare ($14), was by far the best, and at the level of the small plates served by far fancier places like Bent.  A beautiful tartare accompanied with some ponzu, avocado, and elements of crunchiness.

We then proceeded to the Nasu Dengaku ($7), the Japanese eggplant, which was lovely in flavor  and texture and covered with crunchy fried beet slivers that provided an interesting contrast.  The menu advertised a miso hollandaise sauce, but the sauce that accompanied it was as similar to that as Sesame Street is to The Walking Dead.  Instead, it was so sweet, that I highly recommend it be adopted immediately as the standard medical treatment for hypoglycemia.  

\"Can I get you more drinks?\"  No, we've only had our cocktails about 10 minutes.

We then proceeded to the interesting Katsu Bun ($7/piece) which consisted of a marinated pork belly served in an aggressively salted soy remoulade.  Too big for a tapas portion for one person, but impossible to share, as the restaurant refuses to provide a knife or cut it in half.  Clearly, it would ruin the \"integrity\" of the dish.

\"Can I get you more drinks?\"  OK, let's have a round of Asahi's ($8 on tap).  Some passable enoki mushrooms ($7) arrived.

\"Can I get you more drinks?\" No, we've only had the beers 5 minutes, but maybe you can check on the Uni Bomb we ordered long, long ago that has been forgotten.   I regretted that request immensely.

Our \"Uni Bomb\" ($15) arrived, which was a do-it-yourself sort of dish of a small portion of uni on top of sushi rice with nori to wrap it in and a few sprinkles of salmon roe.  3 out of 4 of us proceeded to make our little uni wraps and started to eat it.  Unfortunately the uni tasted like rancid iodine...if iodine could somehow spoil.  In the entire collective memory of everyone who knows my boyfriend, he has never sent a dish of food back. Here, and we were in unanimous agreement, we had just been served disgusting, rotten uni, and he politely called the waitress over...

\"Can I get you another drink?\"
\"No, actually, I'm afraid we can't get eat your uni.  I'm afraid it's gone bad, and we want to send it back.  You really should alert your chef so that you don't serve this to anyone else.\"  She turned and walked in silence away.  She whispers with the chef in the corner.  We ponder if someone will come to apologize, or offer a substitute, or acknowledge the problem.  No one comes back to say anything, so we finally succeed in distracting the waitress from the cell phone.  By now the readers at home know what she will say:
\"Can I get you another drink?\" 
\"No, just the bill, please\"

Lo and behold, the \"Uni Bomb\" we returned, which contained the worst bit of seafood ever to cross my lips, is still on the bill for $15.  After being ignored for a solid 15 minutes of candy crushing, the waitress comes over and we ask her to remove the uni from the bill.  

The Michelin-trained waitress explains that they discussed removing it from the bill, but more than 50% of the uni was gone, so they didn't want to take it off.  Aha, well, 3 of us had miniature spoonfuls of it, which we all hated.  She reluctantly agrees to take it off the bill.  

Before, we can get the new bill, we're greeted by the manager.  100% sure of the quality of his food, he proceeds to lecture us that maybe we don't know what uni tastes like.  My boyfriend's mention of living in Japan and eating it often did nothing to shake his confidence.  He proceeded to mention that this was uni from BC, not the Chilean uni they had been serving before, and we might be unaccustomed to its taste.  Ah, so you're saying that sea urchin from BC should taste like the fish that's been thrown out of the dodgy fish markets in Kensington and left to rot for a few days in the sunshine...sure!  Not once was there an apology.

We finally get our revised bill.  We ask the waitress to split it two ways.  \"Sure, but I just don't want to do the math.  You do it,\" comes the response.  

We departed with no shouts of \"Arigatou gozaimashita\" or even nods from flannel-clad waitresses.  Unfortunately, the taste of the rotten uni persisted.  The 3 of us who had the \"Uni Bomb\" also got to discover its gastrointestinal \"bomb\" counterpart the next day."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem of Toronto. My friends and I walked there while in town and made it just a few minutes shy of when they opened. Tiny restaurant with an amazingly cool vibe but plan ahead because within about five minutes of us getting the last seats, they had a line out the door. The drinks were amazing and the bartender was very knowledgeable and helped us pick. The food literally left me speechless. Coming from the Bay Area, we have a lot of good sushi but this was by far the best I had ever had. Favorites were the stuffed chicken wings, pork belly sandwich and the halibut special. Highly highly recommend this place, it's a keeper!"}
{"text":"There are two ways to fall in love with a restaurant: At first look and first taste. At Hanmoto, it's hard to not be excited as soon as you come in. It's located on a residential street in Toronto and there's little telling it's a restaurant until you come close enough to see. When you open the door, you walk into a dimly lit space without much room, with about a half dozen or so tables, paired metal cans hanging from the ceiling and the back wall of the open kitchen resembling a run down, dilapidated former pharmacy. That's all if you can get a seat. The Globe and Mail has called it \"the city's most annoying izakaya.\"

It's true. There are some hoops to jump through. I went with a dining companion and were fortunate enough to get a seat quickly but you can see how the wait could pile up. We were also told that there were no knives in the entire restaurant, so if we wanted to share something then be prepared for a clumsy division or to order two. There's not much of a beer list either, unless you like the Asahi, Tiger or other top brands.

Usually, subversions (I call them that because it's the restaurant finding a way to take itself down with the customer) would be so mettlesome but the food and the atmosphere here is just too good to let that get in the way. 

The first thing you should get are the dyno wings. Our waitress said they were blow your mind and that going back to any other wings, even the others on their menu, would be like dating \"the girl next door.\" She wasn't wrong. They are like nothing I've had before. Hanmoto has found a way to reimagine wings. 

The chef pulls the meat off the chicken bone and then create an exterior and fill it with pork so it becomes a dumpling of sorts, then refry it and give it the shape of a wing. It's marvelous. They only serve two per order and in no way can you not want more.

The aburi salmon is like a deconstructed sushi roll, served along side seaweed so you can pair the two and put it together again. They combination of the slightly sweet rice and the seaweed is perfect. The hamache tartare, with fatty pieces of salmon, is an interesting dish, served in a liquidy base and almost like a ceviche. The curry bun -- which is only big enough for one unless you want to get messy and split it by hand -- is a curry chicken sloppy Joe, in essence, served with slaw.

The whole menu, it seems, is worthwhile and delicious. The waitress raved about the miso ice cream and her compliments ringed valid because she did not steer us wrong with the main dishes and told us to avoid several. When she called the house special that night, a less dynamic order of things, just fine, she was honest and we should have listened.

But by then, we were so satiated and so delighted by everything else we had eaten, there was hardly any room to complain. Hanmoto is unique and imaginative and one of the best 10 restaurants I've visited. You won't find it on any best-of-Toronto list, so the find becomes your own revelation."}
{"text":"5 stars give to Miso Icecream, if there are 6 stars I'll give 6...

It's like nothing you've ever had. The marriage of sweet and savoury flavours work perfectly. The icecream itself has miso in it, and sprinkled with dry seaweed. 

Other dishes we tried and loved: fried wings and the moto bun. Fried wings have a lot of batter but it is flavourful and crunchy. Highly recommend!

Atmosphere is great for dating (especially first few dates). Light is dim, and you do feel like you are in one of those alley bars in Tokyo.

Also: DO NOT ORDER Hamachi Tartare. It is a disaster dish. Fish doesn't taste fresh, and TOOOO much toppings, just way too much."}
{"text":"This place was the highlight of my Canadian experience. It is a hidden gem that I wouldn't have found if it weren't for Yelp. There is no sign at the entrance and is in the rear of another restaurant so it just looks like a kitchen from the outside with a soft red neon glow. When you enter it feel like you are entering into another world; it's decor is as exotic and rustic and makes you feel like you've warped in time and dimension to a surreal fishing boat tavern in 1940s Asia. The restaurant, like it's menu is small but it packs a lot of character. There's a raw side of the menu & a hot side of tapas portion sized dishes. We opted for the deviled eggs with ikura and fried chicken skin, the enoki mushrooms and the Hamachi tartare which was served with nori strips for you to use like tortillas so it was pretty much a deconstructed sushi roll. It was delicious, chick full of tasty hamachi and scallops. The enoki mushrooms were hands down the best I've ever had. The deviled eggs were good but seriously, they are always delicious. They have draft beers which is a plus. Our tab was only $35 it was a steal. We left grateful to partake in such an incredible experience. I would recommend to all foodies far and wide."}
{"text":"That freaking salmon aburi, man. 

Some serious stuff there. 

Imagine a mountain of torched salmon and within it, a kinder surprise of sushi rice with a separate woven basket of nori (seaweed) for you to DIY your own sushi.

mmmmmmmm...

And don't get me started on that hot hot tofu. Pure flavour. 

Vibe and place-wise, Hanmoto's the food version of Cold Tea :-)"}
{"text":"Went here after two days of trying to get a table. This small hidden resto is tucked away behind a larger restaurant. The first day we were told about 1.5 to 2 hours wait. We were way too hungry so we ate elsewhere. The second night we were told 30
Minutes so we just walked around and they called us within 10 minutes. The atmosphere and facade of the place is so cool! It feels like a garage/ typical Asian street food stall. The food was amazing. My favourite was hands down the salmon. The sauce was delicious. The uni bomb was kind of a let down. The flavours didn't marinate as well together. I wouldn't order that again, but was a good try. The only down fall was that it was very cold. Because it's so small people coming in and out of from the door let the heat out and all the cold in. Other than that, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after reading so many positive reviews about it but upon arriving, I became extremely disappointed.

First, we came as a group of 6 and waited for almost 2 hours before we got a table. It's super chilly outside and the waitress wouldn't let us wait inside because it'd be \"too cramped\" if we stayed so we just froze outside. We finally get a table and the portions were super tiny for the prices we paid in comparison to other tapas places we've tried. Some dishes were also really salty. The miso ice cream was pretty good, as was the egg.

Then came our bill... We didn't want to tip to begin with but since we were a group of 6, we had a mandatory group gratuity... Of 20%!!! That's ludicrous as normally it's only 15-18%. I definitely do not feel they deserve 20%. It wasn't even advertised anywhere !! For those reasons, I would not come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night and had dinner in.  It's a small space and it doesn't look like they take reservations.  Normally, I would give this place 4 stars as I was not impressed with their service (more explained below) but the food and atmosphere was so great that one star for those sections were not enough.  I'd absolutely come back here again and again (this may have to be a new Toronto staple).  

Food: The restaurant is Japanese Izakaya which is basically Japanese style Tapas.  The menu is not 500 items long but has a good variety between more raw/sushi like items and hot dishes.  We tried both buns and they were outstanding.  The Katsu bun is slightly better than the Moto in terms of unique flavors but both were very well executed (and a little messy). The waitress told us that the buns are messy and that they do not give out cutlery so you should order two. It's OK, we shared and it wasn't the worst thing in the world.  The Sushi Aburi was excellent and fun to have a deconstructed roll and then you roll yourself.  The Dyno wings were so good we had to order more.  We were skeptical on the concept.  On the one hand I love chicken wings and I love pork dumplings.  But together? There is no middle ground, its either amazing or heresy.  Luckily, it was amazing.  The drinks are also as complex as most of the dishes.  The miso ice cream is a must.  We shared it amongst the two of us and it came with tiny spoons so you could keep savoring it over and over again.  The ice cream was definitely made with condensed milk and had a more kulfi like consistency to it.  The little crunch on top left me with a nostalgic feeling, but to what I wasn't sure.  

Decor: It's like walking into what a late night at a 40s style diner is like when its past closure and all the employees are just enjoying their own meal.  The seating is all over the place but it has a cool fun vibe to it.  It's certainly a good talking point.  It was oddly hard to find the location as there is no sign outside and if I didn't notice people outside smoking I wouldn't know where this place is. 

Service: The waitress we had was fine but we were happily eating our food and they just coming and taking away our plates.  I was still eating some of that garnish that fell on the plate.  It was pretty annoying.  Like no I was not done picking at my food, let me enjoy every morsel please. 

Price: Overall for quality and interest, pretty darn good.

Notable Extras: I think the Dyno wings and decor really suit the place.  It's really is a place that the flavor profiles, decor and ambiance just all marry well together. Kudos to their designer for nailing it."}
{"text":"Two words: Dyno. Wings. Also: So. Great. We visited on a Friday evening at 6:00 PM (right when they opened), and overall, great experience! Just keep your eyes peeled - there's no sign on the door, but rest assured, they are the restaurant located on the northwest corner of Dundee Street and Lakeview Avenue - the one that looks like an entrance to a back kitchen, but is really the main entrance to the restaurant. 

First, parking. We actually found free parking in the area on one of the residential streets a block north of the restaurant. It wasn't too difficult to find at all, and there were a good amount of spots available on a Friday evening.

Second, ambiance. Hipster, rustic - a little bit of country but a lot of hip. It isn't very big and doesn't seat more than 20 people (if that). It's very intimate (read: dim lights, a nice date night spot, but still nice and laid-back). It's also very casual and good for a small group hang. 

Third, the food. We ordered Dyno Wings ($8.00), Moto Bun ($7.00), Nasu Dengaku - Japanese Eggplant ($8.00), Salmon Aburi ($10.00), Miso Steak ($20.00). Overall - delicious. Don't expect massive portions since this is, of course, a tapas-style menu. But, almost everything we had was delicious. The Dyno Wings (i.e. wings stuffed with dumplings (!!!)) were juicy and delicious, the Moto Bun was small but tasty, the Salmon Aburi was a highlight and it was fun putting it together (they serve your seaweed wrap separately, so you can spoon the salmon on the wraps to your liking). We wouldn't get the Miso Steak again - dry and flavourless. But overall, delicious food!

We would definitely come back here again! With tax and tip, we spent around $68.00."}
{"text":"Sadly, I'm giving a low star rating because of service, for which I keep returning and hoping is better. 

I've been here several times and love the food and drinks, but the service on two occasions has left me leaving with a sour taste in my mouth. 

This last time, I put my name and number down on the waiting list, excited for the yummy meal to come.  I asked to use the washroom while I waited and the hostess said NO. I was surprised...really?  She replied saying that there were too many people walking up and down the stairs (there were none at the time). 

What a dumb excuse to say to your customers. Am I only allowed to use the washroom when I'm sitting at the table and ready to pay?  Im not even sure why I asked. I was so bothered that I just left and ate pho down the street.  
Treat all your customers like you want them to come back."}
{"text":"A rustic and cozy little gem in Toronto. I was first introduced to this spot by friends last year and it was so good that I had to make my return. It's a great spot for an intimate date and sharing deep talks over strange cocktails. My favourite dish was the deviled eggs! I've never had better deviled eggs than here and trust me, even I felt like it was peculiar I was returning here solely for deviled eggs! But it's so good you don't want to miss out. Must order! Also the miso icecream was pretty gangsta too."}
{"text":"I was not expecting to like this place so much - it is SO good!! 

My friend suggested this place and I'm so glad he did because otherwise I would have never even noticed this place. It's on this random street and the outside looks super sketch. There wasn't even a sign that stated the name so I have no idea how people are suppose to find this place on their own. 

The inside interior was pretty cool. It was dark, the music was loud, but super chills. There was like only six tables in there so that's why there's usually a wait. 

The cocktail I got was decent. The cocktails are all a form of whiskey sour which was good but not mind blowing. 

Okay now onto the best part: the food!! We got the salmon aburi and omg SO good. It comes with the rice and salmon on top and nori on the side so you can make it yourself which I'm always a fan of - putting together food. We also got the famous wings that apparently would change our lives forever, it was definitely really good and I have no idea how they made it even. It was super crunchy on the outside. We also got some sort of katsu bun and that was also really good but get ready to get your hands full of sauce. 

Overall this was by far the best izakaya I've been to in Toronto - and that's a pretty bold statement."}
{"text":"This place is great, but I might be understating things.  

Dishes ordered : 
Moto eggs - just order this one - you will suffer order regret if you don't. 
Salmon Aburi - I loved the DIY aspect of this dish - it was just fun to assemble and eat. 
Dyno Wings - this one was good - but I didn't enjoy it as much as the Moto Eggs or the Salmon Aburi
Moto Bun - I personally felt that this was a miss in comparison to other dishes - it didn't stand out as much as the others. I did like the spicy kick in it, but overall - I would give this one a miss. 
Natsu Dengaku - this was good, decent balance of flavors; however didn't stand out as much as some of the others dishes. 

Cocktails 
Arisaka Sour - this was sooo good and refreshing. I loved how it tasted and it was very well made. 
Cops & Rabas - this is a wonderful cocktail to start your meal - it is very citrusy and just a slight hit of sourness to get the tastebuds going. 

Space : 
Seating allows for only about 22/25 people give or take. We got here just after opening and we were lucky enough to snag two of the four seats at the bar. 

Note: this place is the type of place you bring on the nights you can/want to do something different and on a night you want to relive your life before kids. 

Lighting is dim to dark, unless you are sitting at the seats in front of the prep bar - where the lighting is slightly better. 

Service is friendly and the pacing of the food is well-timed. 

If you are two people - they do recommend about 4/5 dishes - so ratio-expect to order about two dishes per person give or take. 

Pricing - including the alcohol just under $90 - for us; which overall is extremely reasonable. 

Overall - yeah - kid-free night, I am coming back."}
{"text":"This place looks super sketch (think dive bar meets sketchy alley) with a super hipster vibe. There is no sign on the front, but it gets busy fast (so look for the crowd). This place is hot (AC Is either very weak or non-existent) 

The food is tapas style asian fusion. The chicken wings were on special and they were good, very crispy and well seasoned. The dino wings are a wing with a dumpling at the top, all covered with crunchy fried-ness. 

Salmon aburi and Hamachi tartare are the BEST things on the menu!!!!!! Salmon Aburi is like really busy poke with rice that you can wrap yourself, and the hamachi tartare is closer to classic poke with a slight vinegar taste. 

Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and really enjoyed both times. The dynowings and eggplant are a must try. Also the ice cream for dessert - great balance of sweet and savoury. Service has been good both times."}
{"text":"If you like a dingy place with horribly rude service and mostly terrible dishes then this is the perfect place for you.  The place is very dirty and musty.  The waitresses were very rude, pushy and arrogant.  Everyone was served and there was no queue.  We were told we had to order everything at once.  A gimmick to order a lot up front $$$.  The food was mostly bad, with only one or two decent items, but the portions were enough to feed an infant with no appetite, and at a high price tally.

The most irritating aspect, all else aside, was seeing a hand reach into your personal space over your shoulders, head, etc. to grab plates that weren't even empty and food still in progress of being consumed.  Not to mention lifting the cups and drinks and moving them around our space as if it was some kind of chessboard.  Horrible horrible experience.

The selection of drinks is pathetic.  I don't see the craze over this place at all.  There are way way way better places to enjoy in Toronto.  And since this is a \"sharing\" type of place they told us there is absolutely no cutlery on the premises to cut the \"one piece\" items.  Seriously?  A kitchen without a ****ing knife?  Are those kids or chefs behind the kitchen?"}
{"text":"Hanmoto is just a pleasure. 

I've been to Leemo Han's other restaurant, Pinky's Ca Phe - a reasonably good experience, if disappointing for the most part. Similar to his other restaurants, Hanmoto is designed unlike most other restaurants. Most of it seems to run counter to the inviting design of restaurants past. 

That said, Hanmoto is truly excellent, and perhaps the best izakaya I have been to in Toronto. Many of the dishes are a play on the traditional izakaya dishes - and the subtle, and overt twists are what makes it so good. 

In many parts of East Asia, the drinking culture has given birth to incredibly diverse sets of dishes. Izakayas are, loosely speaking, casual bars in Japan - but in the North American context, where accompanying dishes are rarely as creative, izakayas can be seen as much closer to restaurants.

We ordered most of the menu, and many of the dishes incited surprise - my favourite emotion when visiting a restaurant. 

We started with the salmon aburi, uni bomb, and dyno wings - all must-orders. The dyno wings, in particular, incited an involuntary groan (of pleasure). These were boneless wings stuffed with dumpling stuffing. Absolutely glorious. 

The uni bomb was also excellent - the chicken skin was a nice touch, and there was plenty of uni to go around. Portions were fine, and the food was neither too sweet nor salty. 

By the time we were working on the salmon aburi, I wished there was something to cut through the grease - perhaps with something more acidic. 

Our subsequent dishes were fine, but not as spectacular as the earlier ones. The ice cream was great for the initial few bites, simply because it was such a unique flavour. Extremely rich, like most of the meal, but certainly an interesting thing to try."}
{"text":"I came here with friends last week and we were easily able to get a table for 7 when we walked in close to 6:30pm on a Friday night. Hanmoto has a cool hole in the wall type vibe to it and we've easily passed by this place a few times before, not knowing it was Hanmoto. It's a small place that reminds me of OddSeoul, another whole in the wall place I like.

I ordered wings (the special that night, not the dynowings on the menu) and the pork belly sandwich. The wings had a nice light sweetness with mild spice flavour to it and paired with the spicy mayo type sauce, it was flavourful. The pork belly sandwich was a bit of a disappointment as it didn't taste like pork belly to me - more like a bland burger. Another friend ordered this too and he agreed. 

Others tried the deviled eggs and raw fish dishes - they were happy with their orders overall. The food was definitely pleasing to the eye but I'm not a fan of raw dishes so the aesthetic look of my friends' dishes were not enough to convince me to try it.

The miso ice cream (it looks like a stick of butter) was good - worth a try! It was creamy with a touch of seaweed flavour to it - can't say I've tried anything like it. We got two for the table to share among all of us. Four of us ate one stick of miso ice cream and we each had several bites of it - more than enough to share.

Overall, a good experience here that night. Food was pretty to look at but the portions are small for the price (typical TO!) and be prepared to spend a bit more for this Japanese tapas place. There are some hits but some misses with the taste of some of the dishes. Good company made the night a bit more though than the food for me personally."}
{"text":"I have now been 3 times to Hanmoto and I am very pleased with their consistency. 

The setting is very interesting. It's in a old reconverted garage. They kept the exposed bricks and shelves and added a couple of Japanese inspired wall graffiti.

Place feels intimate has there is only a handful of tables and couple of seats next to the food prep area. There is two larger tables for groups. 

Service has always been good. Fast ,efficient, to the point. Water always replenished and they always make sure our drinks are too. It's nice to see the waiters mixing the cocktails. 

Food has been great. My favorites are the Dyno Wings, tartare, curry bun, eggplant. To end the meal I strongly recommend the Miso Ice cream. Very interesting taste and good portion, good for 2 or 3 persons. Or 1 sumo fighter. Presentation is original and the food has been consistently well prepared.

Music is slightly loud so maybe not best for a first date. And they love Drake. Like, a lot. But once in a while they also have other interesting music selection.

This good culinary experience also comes with fair pricing. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"People have been raving about the food here but in all honesty, to me, it's really nothing extraordinary. I came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night and given what we'd heard, we were very surprised to only have to wait 15 minutes. The concept itself is fun (no telephone number, tiny space, small creative menu, fun decor and music) so everything leads one to expect the food to be equally interesting, and it really just isn't. The salmon aburi is a creatively presented dish but nothing more than a run-of-the-mill spicy salmon roll that you assessmble yourself. The dyno wings again, had a fun presentation and were tasty. The moto eggs were underwhelming - simply deviled eggs with a Japanese touch. I think if you come here, you will end up having a perfectly fine meal in a fun environment at a reasonable price - just don't expect much more."}
{"text":"We got pretty much everything on the menu & it was so great! We were all too full by the time dessert rolled around, but I truly regret not getting the miso ice cream - it was the reason I was so excited to come here! Definitely going to try it next time. 

I would recommend to try anything on the menu as we enjoyed everything we got!

Hamachi Tartare: super strong ponzu flavouring - a nice acidic taste that accented the fresh fish! 

Uni Don: the crispy chicken skin really adds to this otherwise common dish. I really love how they explored different ways to add on to their dishes in a minimalistic way 

Chicken Curry & Katsu Buns: I didn't expect these to be this good. The meat was fried to perfection, crispy on the outside and tender inside. However the curry chicken had better flavouring but both were delicious!

So many other raved reviews about the dyno wings so I'll save my opinion on these. 

I can't get over how good the salmon aburi is! Everything is in their sauce & it works wonders with the charred salmon. 

Deviled Eggs: these eggs were so light and fluffy & the taste was phenomenal 

I really can't wait to go back & try the miso icecream!!"}
{"text":"We came here because I wanted to check out what this new Japanese snack bar was all about, since I was a fan of Swish by Han and of Oddseoul.

The food here was very interesting, creative, and very flavourful. We were a party of 4 and ordered the whole menu, along with a few drinks, and everything was quite tasty. All items, raw and hot, are made to share tapas style.

Our favourites for the night.

Salmon Aburi (410) - Do it yourself torched salmon sushi (comes with nori sheets, wrap yourself). We ordered this twice!
Nasu Dengaku ($8) - Roasted eggplant with fried beets and miso hollandaise. Very unique flavours.
Dyno Wings ($8) - Pork dumpling stuffed into a giant chicken wing. The boys raved about this dish. Each order comes with 2 wings.
Moto Bun ($7) - Japense curry with jamaican slaw on a coco bun.
Hot Hot Tofu ($6) - Cold silken tofu with chili oil, pickled cucumbers, onions, and nori. We also ordered this twice.
Hamachi Tartare ($12) - Thinly sliced hamachi with sweet chilli ponzu, shiso, cilantro, and avocado.
Miso Ice Cream ($7) - Condensed milk with white miso, topped with nori powder and japanese toasted rice balls. This was savoury and sweet, and kept me wanting more!

This tiny, cozy, hole-in-the wall snack bar is a great spot to have drinks, with an amazing menu to boot. It is definitely easy to miss, so remember it is right at the corner of Lakeview Avenue and Dundas Street West. The vibe was chill, it reminded some of us of Thailand or Vietnam, and the music was great, 90's R&B and Hip Hop, if you dig that. 

Overall, we had a great time with good friends, and we'll definitely be back for another round of drinks and good food. 

Parking; Street parking along Dundas Street West or along the small residential streets
Space: Very small and tiny

{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences I've had. Great cocktails and the food was so so delicious. My favorites were the chicken wings, eggplant (unexpectedly amazing) and the surf and turf hand roll. Would go back to try the other dishes on the menu. Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I have come here a few times and have never had a bad experience. This place has a very gritty, but cozy and welcoming feel to it which I enjoyed. They played hip hop music which suited the environment very well. 
The drinks and food selection is small but all really unique and you can't go wrong picking any one  kind because they are all delicious."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good reviews about this place! Came here around 7pm on a Saturday night and only had to wait for 15-20mins before getting a table. This place is not that easy to find as there is no sign at the front. We got seated at the table near the washroom. The restaurant is small and gives out a cool, dive bar vibe but the bench that I sat on was very wobbly and I thought it was going to break at some point (luckily it didn't). We ordered a bunch of dishes to share. Our favourites were the dyno wings, moto eggs and the katsu bun! The flavours were so unique and definitely lived up the expectation. will definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"My love affair with this place began a while ago and since that time i've been a regular here - almost religiously. 

Sister restaurant Oddseoul started loosing it's charm by falling food quality, and i really hope this doesn't happen here.

Hidden off the corner, with nothing but a red light as a sign, there's magical things happening here in terms of late night snack food. Don't get me wrong, this isn't even close to fine dining, but the right time to go here is after 10pm when it's more quiet and you're looking for after bar grub. Their dyno wings is every wing lovers dream, the moto buns are heavenly and not to share, and their salmon uburi is gluttony if you eat it all by yourself. But the game changer is their icecream. Salty, sweet, umami goodness.  

Oh and yes, the cocktails were excellent too here."}
{"text":"It's a really small hipster kinda restaurant served with special sake. The food is great and my favorites are dyno wings, pork belly bun and the salmon aburi. :) Dyno wings are very crispy and crunchy on the outside and stuffed with juicy grounded meat. Sweet on the outside and salty on the inside."}
{"text":"This place is really fun to go to. It's like a lively casual Izakaya with more upscale food and cocktails. The atmosphere and food feels/tastes like something totally new and unexpected, transports you out of Toronto. Love the glass garage doorway hung with little vintage saki cans. It's amazing that it appears to be in an old garage. Actually around 4.5 stars, 5 for the atmosphere, 4 for the creative and delicious food, 4.5 for the service. Service is friendly/casual, young but very quick and attentive. The food is a few steps above typical izakaya food, with creative flavors and everything was perfectly cooked with fantastic textures. We had the eggplant with crispy beets, hamachi tartare, okra, and curry and katsu buns (ordered best to good) The vegetables were surprisingly delicious, so rich and flavorful enough to be a full meal. We had Asahi and it went with the food really well, however the cocktails looked good too.  The buns were mostly fast-food like, way above average bar food, and very satisfying if you're hungry! Can't wait to go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place only has 4 stars, Toronto's a tough crowd.  This place is 5 stars by NY standards.  I especially love how unassuming this place is, absolute miracles come out of their visibly meager small kitchen.  They put these showcase places with big specatcle kitchens to shame.  Dino wings are incredible, their curry chicken burger was phenomenal and their salmon sashimi, superior.  Their himachi tar tar and even their eggplant makes any carnivore a herbavore.  This place should be a staple and should be bigger because they'll start hitting some serious radars the more and more miracles come out of that 5×5 kitchen."}
{"text":"Had a late night, so I decided to check out this place with my best friend past 12:30AM!

We definitely had some confusion finding this place, if I didn't have the yelp photos, I probably wouldn't have found it, simply because they don't have any signage outside showing the name of this place.  Didn't even notice it until I saw someone walk out the doors, and I thought I'd give it a shot to go inside, then the place matched the photos from here from all the yelpers!

It's fairly dark in here, with some green and red lights, feels hipster, and its a small place, but like a hidden gem.  We got seated right away, service was prompt.  

I absolutely loved the Salmon Aburi, mainly what brought me here after seeing the photos from this place.  I did try the Enoki (very buttery and juicy), dyno wings (too much flavour on the outside that made the inside bland), and the miso ice cream (didn't expect the saltiness of the ice cream).  I definitely would re-visit this place, but would solely get the Salmon Aburi."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot! Service is friendly and considerate and the food is superb. I'm only sorry I couldn't order everything."}
{"text":"i must say, this was an outstanding izakaya - there weren't that many menu items but of the few on the list that i ordered, i really enjoyed it. 

OKRA ($8)
the okra was crispy, mixed in parmasean and ponzu. It was the first time I had Okra and i really enjoyed it. All the food had multiple layers of flavors. The flavors were unique and really asian inspired fusion dishes.

KATSU BUN ($7)
this wasn't the usual breaded pork chop katsu but instead, they used pork belly. The pork belly was breaded with panko crust and deep fried, served in a crispy bun with lettuce and dressed with soy remoulade. The fact they used pork belly ensured the tenderness of the meat in the burger. Although my first bite in was a huge chunk of pork belly fat, it tasted bomb.

NASU DENGAKU ($8)
I normally hate eating eggplant, but i was able to eat this dish and more than one piece. This deep fried Japanese eggplant was served with miso hollandaise and topped with crunchy fried beets - the crunchiness really added texture to the soft mushiness of the eggplant.

HAMACHI TARTARE ($12)
There were so many layers of flavor in this dish - I completely loved it! It was served with huge chunks of hamachi and avocado mixed in multiple layers of flavor including sweet chili ponzu and wasabi oil tossed with shiso and shallots. You taste the acidity and the slight kick of spice from the chili. The fried shallots and scallions added great texture to the dish.

MISO ICECREAM ($7)
A rectangular frozen condensed milk base miso flavored ice cream sprinkled with nori powder and crunchy puffed rice balls on top. Never had anything like this before - loved the presentation and its taste, tasted like salty ice cream.

I totally enjoyed my experience at Hanmoto - I liked everything about this place: the food, the atmosphere, the service. The food was really creative with its Asian inspired fusion dishes - not only did the dishes consist of innovation flavors, they were delicious and full of texture! The restaurant is small with not a lot of tables - the atmosphere is great, a perfect intimate spot for a date. They served the food pretty quick with not much wait time. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Another masterpiece in a series of excellent restaurants associated with the Leemo Han name. It has all the telltale characteristics of a Leemo Han joint: 1) exterior \"hole in the wall\" sort of deal, with no signage; 2) interior decor that feels of another time and place (typically vintage, low-key, trendy/hipster, dim, small details like daruma containers used for candles) 3) Asian fusion offerings that really have that wow factor. Hanmoto is tied for my favourite fusion restaurant in Toronto (the other being Juanmoto). My personal choices for must-orders include the uni bomb, the miso ice cream, and whatever is on special (that day it was mackeroll and the hamachi collar). You honestly cannot go wrong ordering anything off their menu. Moto eggs are a twist on deviled eggs that pack flavour from all directions. Dyno wings are their take on teba gyoza (deboned chicken wings stuffed like dumplings, then fried). I picked up the hamachi collar with my hands and went full face in---it was that good (and the server who saw me agreed with my approach). Drinks too were no slouch. We all enjoyed our Arisaka Sours. The miso ice cream is reminiscent of the first time I enjoyed black sesame ice cream---the surprise of umami and nuttiness and how it works in such a setting so creamy, sweet, and cold. Overall, a must-visit."}
{"text":"HIGHLIGHTS 
Hanmoto, an izakaya from Leemo Han (founder of OddSeoul), is of one of my favourite spots in Toronto. It does not take reservations and is open only for dinner/late night eats - and you can easily see why when you come here. I loved the cool and effortless vibe of this restaurant, the delicious Japanese pub food, and eclectic selection of cocktails. 

GOOD FOR:
- Group of friends 
- Casual date 
- Late night eats / bar food before bar hopping on Dundas West (they don't stop serving food all night!)

ATMOSPHERE (5/5)
It's a pretty hidden establishment - keep Google Maps on hand when trying to find it. The restaurant was consistently busy throughout the night on a Friday. It played mostly loud hip hop, was dimly lit and had an open kitchen. Effortlessly well decorated with exposed brick walls and industrial and vintage Japanese furniture.

FOOD (4.5/5)
- The menu is small and is split up into two sections: Raw and Hot. 
- Salmon Aburi (4.5/5) - torched salmon, sushi rice, tobiko and scallions - this dish was served with seaweed. The blowtorched flavour + a creamy, wasabi sauce makes it the perfect appetizer
- Uni Bomb (3/5) - this was a simple dish with sea urchin and rice, nothing out of the ordinary. I'd recommend some of the other dishes for your first time.
- Miso ice cream (4/5) - with sweet miso topped with nori (seaweed) and crunchy rice balls - a weird flavour but oddly enough, highly addicting

PORTION SIZES
Hungry: order 2-3 main dishes to yourself, or share 4-5 with 2 people.
Moderately hungry: 1-2 main dishes to yourself, or share 3-4 with 2 people.
Not-so-hungry: share 1-2 dishes with someone, or opt for just dessert.

DRINKS (5/5)
- The cucumber and green tea infused gin with yuzu (5/5) was refreshing - perfect for cleansing the palette in between dishes.

SERVICE (5/5)
- Service was great, nothing to complain about. Food came quickly and water was topped up without having to ask. 

OVERALL (5/5)
Would recommend? Yes
Would come back? Yes
What would I try next time? Everything on the menu. Especially the eggplant and dyno wings.
What would I order again? Cucumber and green tea infused gin, salmon aburi"}
{"text":"Made a point to arrive just as they opened on a weekday as the few tables will fill up within a half hour. The pork dumpling stuffed boneless Dyno Wings are a must. The Moto Eggs were good but nothing mind blowing. The Salmon Aburi was excellent. Definitely worth a return trip to try the other selections.

This is a very small place with a dirty bathroom and some food preparation happening in a stairwell on the way to said bathroom upstairs. If you're looking for a nicer overall dining experience then check out Antler just down the road."}
{"text":"On a friend's recommendation I tried this new place, I don't know anything about how this type of restaurant is supposed to be run but it was very nice.

The atmosphere is grungy and cosy. The food was good if not a bit expensive. We ordered the Hamachi Tartar and a Moto Bun. The tartar was delicious! Totally worth the price. It's a small portion but easily shareable. The presentation was very nice and it was a treat to order and eat.

The buns were good but the bun was fried instead of steamed. It was a bit too oily and tasted like deep fried pizza dough, the filling of the bun (sandwich - not a traditional bun) was awesome though.

Would recommend."}
{"text":"Hanmoto is a tiny, hole-in-the-wall-izakaya-dive-bar (is that even a thing?) located on Lakeview Avenue, a tiny street west of Dundas and Ossington. It is definitely easy to miss if you do not have your eyes peeled.

My girlfriend and I ordered the following dishes:
- Salmon Aburi: Torched salmon, sushi rice ($10)
- Hamachi Tartare: Sweet chill ponzu, shiso, avocado ($12)
- Uni-Bomb: Uni roe, chicken skin chips, sushi rice ($15)
- Katsu Bun: Panko crusted 24hr pork belly, soy remoulade, lettuce ($7)
- Dyno Wings: Stuffed chicken wings ($8)
- Miso Ice Cream: Nori powder, toasted rice balls ($7)

The unanimous favourites included the salmon aburi, hamachi tartare, uni-bomb, and miso ice cream. The miso ice cream was particularly an eye-opener, with the saltiness of the nori pairing exceptionally well with the sweetness of the ice cream. While the katsu bun was super flavourful, it was a bit too fatty for our palates (i.e. fried pork belly + a ton of mayo, or \"soy remoulade\") - it is definitely for sharing. The dyno wings were also pretty good, but compared to some of the other amazing dishes, ultimately became more of an after-thought.

Overall, the food, combined with the intimate vibe and coziness of this establishment makes it great if you're taking someone on a date, or simply catching up with some friends. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Hanmoto is a new spot that serves up raw and hot items in izakaya style! The portions are snack sized and are meant for sharing.

The spot is nestled away on Lakeview and the inside is VERY small.  There are two larger picnic tables that can accommodate a bigger group but then there's just a few smaller two-seaters and bar stools in the rest of the space.  It is dim-lit, art-grunge and the music is pumping (hip hop).

The menu is small and carries hot items, cold/raw items, cocktails and beer.  We ordered 85% of the menu to share between the 4 of us.

Highlights:
Dyno Wings - 2 jumbo deboned chicken wings stuffed with pork dumpling and glazed with some ridiculously tasty sauce! A definite winner!

Moto bun - This is Japanese curry chicken with slaw on a bun! Very flavourful and messy, hard to cut in half so if you're hungry order one of these to yourself.

Nasu Dengaku - Japanese eggplant, fried beets and miso sauce. BEST dish on the menu which was a shocker.  I don't even care for eggplant but this dish has an explosion of texture and flavourful, that miso special sauce is DELICIOUS!!!

Miso Ice cream - Shiro Miso icecream in a slab dusted with nori powder and puff rice balls.  This was a nice subtle flavour.  Not too sweet and the rice balls gave it a nice crunch.  A nice treat to split.

Basically everything we tried was really good, the only thing I didn't care for was the shishitso peppers.  Usually I love these peppers at Spanish restaurants but they were quite flavourless here.  They topped the peppers with bontio flakes which were wayyyyyy too fishy tasting, we barely finished this dish between 4 people.

The large salmon dish wasn't really worth it either. Seemed like there was not enough meat in the salmon and it was hard to pick at and they just dumped a load of coleslaw on top.  The other salmon dish was excellent though, the aburi salmon!

Cocktails looked good, but were pricey.  I had a beer instead. The beer list is short but some decent options.

Great place, would go back just for those wings and eggplant, mmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"The food here is just really delicious. We got the salmon aburi, dyno wings, and katsu bun. For the salmon, small cubes of torched fish are on top of sushi rice, with nori sheets on the side to make your own rolls. The dyno wings were stuffed with pork, fried extra-crispy, with sauce on top. The katsu bun was a mayo explosion and reminded me of fast food, in the best possible way. The drink list was small but looked good, we just had a few beers.

It wasn't overly busy on a weeknight; we got in right away. The tiny room looks like a dungeon but it does create a certain ambiance. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"It is OK fusion Asian cuisine. The staff could be a bit more happy looking. Good for occasional try out."}
{"text":"After a recommendation from a friend and an adventurous walk to little Portugal, we arrived at this hole in the wall style restaurant. There are no signs outside; just a boarded wall, a metal door, and what looks like a shed on the side. But low and behold when you open that door, you arrive at a quaint little bar, some small tables by the windows, and 2 wooden benches off to the side for larger groups. 

The menu houses about 15 items, and some daily specials that the servers will explain in detail when you're ready to order. We arrived hungry, so we ordered dyno wings, moto eggs, uni bomb, natsu dengaku, grilled hamachi collar (daily special), smoked mackerel (daily special) and miso ice cream to share for 3. As for drinks, we each ordered arisaka sour (oh man was this good. Its like alcoholic spa water. Mmmm) 

Everything was delicious; the dyno wings had a super crispy exterior. Moto eggs were amazing - it literally disappeared into our mouths the moment the server put the plate down. The crunchy chicken skin paired so well with the devilled eggs and the hot pepper. As for the natsu dengaku, I never knew I liked beets so much until I tasted the deep fried beets on top of the savoury eggplants. You have to get this!! 

As for the daily specials, both of them were AMAZING. The mackerel wasnt fishy like a lot of the other places I've tried. The rice is flavourful and they included small pieces of seaweed sheets for you to wrap the mackerel in - what an amazing idea. The grilled hamachi collar was massive and delicious. It was juicy, savoury, spicy and sweet; it all depends on what you eat it with! I would give all the thumbs up in the world for this dish. 

All in all we had a great time here. Come early cause spots fill up extremely fast (the place only has like 4 tables + 2 longer benched). The prices for food is slightly expensive if you order for yourself, but reasonable if you plan to share multiple dishes with friends. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was tempted not to rate Hanmoto because it is such a small place with very limited seating, and I didn't want it to be impossible to get a seat when I return. 

We ordered a few different items off the menu - I can't remember the names of them, and Hanmoto doesn't have a website... (not surprised, they don't even have a sign outside the restaurant). Two dishes stood out for me. The Tartare dish and the dyno wings. Both were outstanding. 

Nice ambiance in this small joint. I would probably rank it in my top 5 in Toronto, I was really blown away. My friend and I found out about it at Odd Seoul, which has the same owner(s)."}
{"text":"Love, love! If you feel like trying something unique, you should hit up this Japanese izakaya place. This little spot is a hidden gem. If you aren't intentionally going here, you would definitely miss it because it's off on a side street with no signage. Despite this, it was at full capacity when we arrived at around 8pm on Friday. It took us about 20 mins to get a table for 2, which isn't too bad given that they take your number down. So you can walk around Trinity Bellwoods nearby to catch some pokemon while you wait. They had about four small (2-3 seat) tables and two 4-6 seat tables. No reservations so I would recommend to come with a small group to get a table quickly.


Generally 3-4 dishes should be good for a group of 2

Ordered
Dyno Wings ($10) - stuffed chicken wings. It was a nice twist with mince pork inside but not something I'll come back for again

Hamachi tartare ($12) - citrus kick, raw fish and avocado just overall a lovely combination

Moto eggs ($7) - Must try! They were just the best pop of flavour in your mouth and the crisp dried-fish flavoured chip added a great texture to it. 

Cocktails ($12 each)
Cherry Bakudan 
- Very strong alcohol taste. I didn't like it too much

North Town Nashi 
- Tasted like a whisky sour, I like it better but not something I'll rave about 

Bill came up to $60 for 2 + tip. I would say it's a great date spot for a bite to eat. I am interested to try more from the menu next time."}
{"text":"Great food. Really cool vibe and decor. Good beers I like the ace hill in cans and Brooklyn lager on tap. 

We tried the salmon, hamachi and uni bomb from the raw menu. Favourite was the hamachi but all were fantastic to be honest. The fried eggplant was tasty too. We also ordered the wings - with the pork/scallion dumpling fused into the drumstick. Pretty epic! 

Their sweet soy sauce was awesome on the salmon - which came with wasabi, seaweed and little crispy chicken skin chips. 

I think we got lucky with the seating - showed up at 8pm and happened upon a great table open for the 4 of us. The rest of the evening a constant stream of people arrived to a full restaurant. They left their cell numbers and were called back when space opened up. Not a big space and definitely popular."}
{"text":"What to try?

Their Dino wings, the eggplant, the salmon aburi and the miso ice cream!

I was introduced to this restaurant from my brother and at first I had trouble finding this place, but I was able to locate it after I saw a few ppl coming out from a door. The restaurant doesn't have a sign so you can't really see it if you're driving by because it's a dive bar. Like its sister restaurant pinkys and odd Seoul, the restaurant runs with a dive bar atmosphere. The restaurant isn't too big and it fits at most 25 ppl and this includes people sitting at the bar! At first I wasn't too optimistic about the food, however my skepticism was soon overcame with the tasty dishes I was served. I liked the uniqueness of the Dino wings because it's essentially dumpling stuffed wings! I also liked the eggplant because of the way they mixed all the ingredients together. I liked the salmon aburi because it was very tasty and miso ice cream was unique!

Last tip?

Be prepared to wait for a table! It's a really small restaurant and it's located just off college street but it's really popular with the locals. The good thing is they will take down your name and phone number so you can roam off to a bar and grab a drink while you wait for your call!"}
{"text":"Love it here. The food is really good, the atmosphere is unique and laid back. I loved the salmon dish. Fresh and delicious. I would probably skip the uni dish next time. 
Hanmoto Reminds me of old Guu, when it used to be good . I am so happy I have found an alternative."}
{"text":"Literal definition of a hole in the wall. If I hadn't been told to go there I wouldn't have even noticed the little restaurant tucked on a Dundas West side street. The dyno wings and tuna are a must get! Have gone back and will continue to go!"}
{"text":"After reading articles online, looking at instagram pics, and seeing the Yelp reviews, I was so excited for Hanmoto. The location is pretty cool. It's not real obvious and is hanging out on a residential street. It's dark and doesn't have obvious signage, so it's kinda fun. It's very low-key and does not have a fancy or pretentious atmosphere. 

As for the food menu, come prepared to spend a lot for small portions (think tapas), but at least I had the USD to CAD exchange rate on my side! The food menu is split into \"raw\" (= cold) and hot items. We ordered a bit from each, a total of 8 different dishes. 

My 3 favorites were: moto eggs, salmon aburi, and miso ice cream. The moto eggs are like Japanese style deviled eggs. Creamy filling, topped with roe and a piece of chicken skin. YUM. The salmon aburi is basically a deconstructed salmon aburi sushi roll. It's served as a mountain of sushi rice that is covered on all sides with salmon pieces. Then, you put some rice and salmon in a small sheet of seaweed, top it with a drizzle of soy sauce, roll it up, and stuff it in your mouth. It was very tasty and fun to eat. The miso ice cream was definitely the stand out! It was creamy and rich without being too sweet. The toppings of arare pieces and seaweed powder made for nice textural components. 

My least favorite items were the buns. We got both the katsu bun and the moto bun. I didn't like that the coco bread was deep fried--it just felt greasy and unnecessarily indulgent. On top of that, the buns were overfilled with cole slaw and dripping with mayo. One small bite of each was more than enough for me. People have also raved about the dynowings. They're not spicy, so don't let the name deter you. I thought they were decent, but too salty and overly fried for my taste. Not sure why they are served in a box. 

I'm really glad I went to Hanmoto, but for me, it's just a place worth trying once."}
{"text":"Hanmoto is one of those restaurants that you're excited to come back to before you've even left. I absolutely loved the vibe here, very intimate, very grungy and very true to those hole in the wall bars or street food stalls you find in Tokyo. The food didn't disappoint either, it's Japanese style snack food but not snack sized, so most dishes are shareable. Everything is quite cheap so we ended up ordering almost everything on the menu. The casual, intimate atmosphere with a great selection of food is why I would rank this joint as one of the best date spots.

Standouts to me were the Dyno Wings, deep friend, de-boned, and stuffed with pork & bacon. The Salmon Aburi which I could've eaten forever. The Moto Bun, mainly because the bun itself was so soft and delicious. 

I do caution that there's very limited seating, especially for big groups, so call ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Hanmoto is quick to remind me that I'm getting old. It's dark, impossibly cool and the music is too damn loud. 

Myself and two buddies came in for some cocktails and dinner and weren't disappointed. I had the lime-vodka cocktail, Cops and Rabas It was refreshing and went down a little too quickly. 

As for the food, I really enjoyed their oysters and deviled eggs, but the rest of the stuff was a little too high concept. Dumplings in chicken wings are fun in theory, but in the end are much too much. No matter how good one might think it tastes... they smell horrible to your neighbour. The buns are sandwiches and big enough to be meals on their own, and they don't have knives making them tricky to share, but I would definitely have the Japanese curry one again for myself. 

Overall, an A-OK experience. But seriously, sonny, turn down your tunes."}

We weren't even that hungry but ordered probably 2/3 of the menu between four of us. ALL of it was amazing, but the stand out for me was the miso ice cream - it was so interesting and unique and totally oozed umami. Yes, it might seem weird for a dessert, but if you're the adventurous type - GO FOR IT!"}
{"text":"Amazing small hole in the wall place with great small plates!! Had the uni bomb and the moto eggs and a moto bun all were delicious! Also the Iggy Smalls cocktail was lovely! Will definitely be back next time I'm in Toronto. The staff is also VERY nice and accommodating- especially the host- so sweet! Sat me at a great spot at the chefs counter :)"}
