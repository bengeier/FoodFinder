{"text":"Pretty good place. Love the salad! Went there too early today around 5:20. We were the only one sat upstairs. The downside is the window can't be open. Service is good as well. Worth to try!"}
{"text":"Tiny and cozy, with a fantastic beer selection and good service. Space-wise it was almost too small so it was a tad uncomfortable but otherwise a great pub."}
{"text":"One of the best gastro-pubs in the city. I have been a customer at the Monk's Table many times over the last few years and find myself coming back for the great atmosphere, delicious food and a wide variety of premium draft beer. I don't live close enough to walk to Monk's to make it my neighbourhood pub, but I wish I did."}
{"text":"Aren't Monks supposed to be silent??  We headed to the Monk's table for dinner and drinks on a Friday nite. We were put on a waiting list  (table for 4) --a bit of a wait, but that was OK. My friend waited outside for us to arrive at the restaurant and then we all came in to see if we could get a drink at the bar while we waited for our table-- a great chance to catch up with friends before dinner.   The server at the bar asked us if we needed a table and we told her we were on the list already. She told us to head upstairs, that they would have table for us there. No problem...right??!!  So, we headed up there. Coming up the stairs we met this FRANTIC MONK and we told him that we were here for our table. He seemed very disturbed that we came up stairs and when we told him the situation the MONK got even more annoyed. I was completely bewildered that he was speaking to us that way. WOW--And the conversation continued to get heated by the Monk, in which he proceeded to mentioned he was the owner.... I think Adam, needs to take another vow of silence and not speak to his customers like that, EVER! I have NEVER been treated that way by any restaurant owner before and this will be the last time.  I am going to be a Rebel and head to the REBEL HOUSE instead; the service and food is much better!"}
{"text":"Pulls off feeling lively, even on a Monday night when there aren't that many people there! Quaint little bar, good selection of beer and nice waitresses. I really enjoyed the cheese & beer fondue appetizer."}
{"text":"The downstairs part of this pub is a little cramped and noisy, so if that's not your thing, try the second floor instead. There's a lot more room, and if you're lucky, you can snag the table by the bay window overlooking Yonge Street.  They've got a great selection of European beers: German wheat beers, English ales, that sort of thing. In fact, they claim to carry a few brands exclusively (it almost made me want to do some more local bar-hopping \"just to make sure\").  When I was here for dinner, we had bangers and mash and fish and chips. Each plate was a bit above the standard pub-grub price (around $14), but definitely worth the price. My fried fish, for instance, was made from a high-quality slab of fish about an inch thick -- it made the fries look a little puny in comparison."}
{"text":"A chance encounter, I very seldom just walk into a restaurant or pub (a term I use loosely as this place does not sport your usual pub food BUT does boast an impressive beer selection) without having it at least recommended by someone else. In fact, we made our way to this place because our first restaurant of choice was packed.  Also, what \"pub\" takes reservations? That's Summer Hill for ya...  Anyway, since we made no reservations, we endured a wait of a whole 5 minutes... Not that the place was empty, but there is somewhat limited seating, BTW, I was being facetious about the wait. I was very pleased that the wait was not long at all.  Moving on... the atmostphere of the place was lovely and cosy with an upstairs and a down. The waiter was a pleasure (and was thoroughly delighted that we in fact were in the mood for dessert as many patrons turned down his offer to hear the dessert options).  But what of the food? The soup special was a creamy wild mushroom soup of the perfect taste and texture. I ordered the steak and frites which comes with red pepper and garlic butter (MARRY ME!) and it was grilled medium when I asked for medium (NOTE: I'm a fan of medium rare but found most places undercook their steak thus why I got into the habit of ordering steaks as medium. So if you prefer your steaks medium and actually WANT them medium, this place cooks them as ordered!)  As for the dessert, I ordered their chocolate pecan pie which admittedly didn't blow me away. It was tasty but sadly a tad forgettable.  For the food we got, I actually think it's very reasonable. Most places charge $28 dollars for the steak I got but this place priced it at $22.  A great eating experience and is a quiet setting among friends."}
{"text":"Expensive!   My wife and I were drawn to this Pub by a great review by Blog TO, but we were disappointed. The food I have to say was above average, I'll give them that.  The portions were surprisingly small, about 1/2 the size of what you would expect. The Shepard's Pie was good (a little watery), the vegetables cooked to perfection.   We've had better food for better value at other pubs and would not recommend."}
{"text":"The Monk's Table is a lovely little pub and self-described Gourmand House.  They have an excellent menu full of traditional British and Scottish pub fare.  The Monk is somehow able to get beers from Europe that I haven't seen anywhere else, and while this confuses me, it also makes me happy.  The congenial atmosphere downstairs lends itself well to the consumption of the aforementioned beer list while the upstairs is better suited to the dining experience.  The upstairs is quiet and cozy and reflects the warm comfort of the incredible food. The downstairs is constantly bustling with people, it's a great place to spend an evening with a pint and some friends.  The food is above-average pub fare, the fish and chips here are excellent, the beef vindaloo is spicy and satisfying, and the sticky toffee pudding is downright amazing.  On Monday nights, there is a 5-course meal paired with samples of beer. You have to reserve your spot ahead of time, but I would love to go with a group and try it out.  The service is great, everyone is knowledgeable about the food and the beer, and they are always friendly and engaging.  If you are heading to the Monk, let me know, and I'll cross Yonge St and meet you there. :D"}
{"text":"Great place. The service is really good and so is the food.  Great choice on tab beers.   It is just a little pricey give  N the location.  I will be back there for sure"}
{"text":"Had dinner at this place a couple of times - love it! The food is delicious! The Monk's Table looks like a regular pub, but every meal is with some kind of a twist - which explains why it is called \"gastro-pub\". Pate is actually a Brûlée Pate (with caramelized sugar on top), juicy lamb leg is served on sweet mashed potatoes, and hot sticky toffee pudding is simply heavenly. The service is very friendly and fast. I will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Terrible service spoiled what used to be a decent experience. I took a client for dinner last night. We arrived at about 6:30. We ordered drinks and decided what we'd like to order. I told the server not to bring the appetizer until we finished our drinks. After about 15 minutes, with the drinks finished, we had no order. I told the server that she could bring the shrimps. Another 15 minutes went by. The shrimps finally came out, but there was no slaw as indicated on the menu.She explained that the chef was \"new\". The bartender brought out the slaw. We waited for another 30 minutes, and no main course. I called over the bartender because our server had disappeared. He was surly and rude. I asked when we would get our meal. He said three minutes. After another 5, I gave up, asked for my bill. The bartender in a very condescending tone said they would not charge for the main that never arrived."}
{"text":"I used to come here whenever I was in town but haven't  been back since it changed over from The Abbott. The service was great, we had the mussels and they were also great. And...Best. Fries. Ever."}
{"text":"I went to Monk's Table on a week night with elderly family members.  I was worried about accessibility but it wasn't an issue; the staff were accommodating, allowing me to reserve a table on the ground floor to avoid the stairs. The food was good and the atmosphere warm, as was the service."}
{"text":"Came here today for a late lunch with a friend, we were pleasantly greeted and promptly seated.  The service was pretty good. There was minimal wait between deciding what we wanted and placing the order. The food also came pretty quickly, I'd say about 5-10 minutes of waiting however this could all just be due to us going there at a time where the pub was relatively unoccupied.   As this is a British pub, I decided to go with something that I could count on to be good and went with the fish and chips. My friend got the grilled cheese and chips. Both meals had generous portions, were delicious and not too greasy.  I normally prefer thinner pieces of fish when it comes to fish and chips and even though the piece of fish which accompanied my chips was on the thicker side, it was still pretty good, albeit I would have also preferred the batter to be flakier.  The chips were thin, long and crunchy. Overall pretty delicious however I would have liked them even more if they were more flavourful, but the salt and vinegar I doused them in did a pretty fine job.  The grilled cheese was crunchy on the outside, gooey on the inside and best of all, gigantic.   There were a few other items I saw on the menu which sounded pretty good, I would definitely revisit this pub to try them in the future."}
{"text":"This is our local. Cozy. Welcomes its regulars.  Pulls a good pint and serves good, reliable pub food. Kids welcome too."}
{"text":"I met a friend for brunch at this cute little pub. I'd like to come back for the beer another time, as the other reviews note - they do have a good beer selection. As for brunch, it was okay, but as Jordan T. has affectionately noted before - I'm a bit of a brunch snob.  I had the huevos rancheros, which was more or less a mini-plate of nachos with cheese, sour cream and black beans and poached eggs on top. It was served with fries or salad - I ended up with 1/2 serving of each. The plate was really massive, way too much food for someone my size. I ate maybe half of the food on the plate and left pretty stuffed. It tasted perfectly good, but I've had better huevos elsewhere. No espresso coffees but really decent drip coffee, which is always win."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly and really really disappointing- we asked politely to turn down volume of music. We were rudely told 'no' by manager or owner - who knows. Less than ordinary food at higher than average prices. Ate brunch for $18- which included cold scrambled eggs and bacon. Served after waiting 30 minutes.   Never going again. Went 3 times. Too bad I like pubs. And I live nearby."}
{"text":"I visited the Abbot On The Hill for the first time last night and attended a dinner paring with International beers - different and great!  Adam, the owner (believe I got that right) was a gracious and knowledgeable host, making sure fun was had by all.....our waiter was just as personable.   I enjoyed myself soooo much, I want to pack-up my condo and move to the Yonge and Summerhill area."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer and great service!  Came in with a few friends last week and we had a great time. Big shout out to our bartender/server Paul. He was funny, friendly and really on the ball with drink refills etc.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Perhaps just a one time bad experience, however went to Monk's Table for supper on Thursday evening and sat upstairs. Service was very slow and food was cold when it arrived."}
{"text":"I don't give 5/5 ratings. I blame it on my years in the academy: scholars are trained that near-perfect anything is, effectively, an Platonic ideal that will never be achieved in the real world. The Monk's Table challenges that basic academic presupposition but, unfortunately, falls short of successfully overturning my scholarly resistance to awarding perfect scores.  I came to the Table because I wanted some decent European beer. It's bloody hard to get a good selection in Victoria (where I'm usually based these days) and so I was excited to get past the 'typical' beer lists that you get a so-called Irish and Scottish bars/pubs. I was not disappointed. The list is regularly changing, with selections from Scotland, Ireland, the UK proper, Germany, and (though not technically on the menu) France. It's a good sized list - about 15 different items on tap - but admittedly is selective rather than excessive.  The Monk's Table sells itself as a British pub and it comes close in most regards. The food menu generally features fare that I find when travelling through Britain though (fortunately!) the food is better spiced than what you normally find in the UK. I ordered the shepherds pie with cheddar cheese topping for lunch, and my dining partner a chicken sandwich and green salad.  The pie was excellent; it's been some time since I've had an authentic version of the dish, and this was about as authentic as it comes. The lamb was moist and the vegetables that were included were diced to an appropriate size where you saw them for what they were without them ever dominating the fork. Also, the veggies retained enough 'crispness' that they nicely balanced the softness of the mashed potatoes and were large enough that they visually set themselves apart from the ground lamb. So, what went wrong? Not much, but the two pieces of bread that were served with the pie were accompanied by a very cold ball of butter.   Little balls of butter annoy the living sh*t out of me. It sounds small, but when I want to add some butter to bread I don't want to have to fight with the freaking butter, and bread, and have a part of the bread that has an entirely uneven distribution of butter. Thus, all butter ought to be served should be at least at room temperature. (This rule really should be a Kantian imperative of bread and butter serving.) The Monk's Table doesn't serve butter at room temperature, alas, which weakened my overall happiness at the meal.  Another thing that upsets me: when cook or wait staff fail to listen to people who make (minor) substitutions. In this case, my partner was lactose intolerant and so asked for no cheese to be put on his sandwich. Unfortunately, this communication was lost somewhere and his sandwich came with cheese. Now, he didn't see this as a big deal because *this kind of thing happens all the time*.   Accidents like this SHOULD NOT happen so often than diners just get used to being given incorrect meals. Bad form Monk's, bad form.  Now, this said: the sandwich was excellent. Big pieces of chicken, beautifully cooked onions, and a plentiful green salad (though without any oils or dressings being offered). On the whole, it was great, though the price for adding bacon to the sandwich was steep at a few dollars.  After we'd been there for a while - three drinks in, after lunch - we decided to get the drumlettes. You get about 8 of them, plus veggies and dip, as well as some fries. I was impressed with the drumlettes; they were large, juicy, and had a nice BBQ flavouring to them. The fries could have used some salt, though that was easily added. The veggies and dip were exceptional in their lack of exceptionality. While a bit steep at $15, I certainly didn't feel ripped off when I ordered this post-lunch appetizer.  The staff was acceptable, though the two servers seemed to have problems coordinating things between them. Once we had a single server our experience was much improved; water was topped up regularly, he was there whenever drinks were getting low, and had helpful suggestions for our post-lunch snack.  Would I go back? Yes: The Monk's Table has become what I consider an essential drinking space in the city of Toronto if you're anywhere near the area. The beer selection alone is worth the trip, and the food only makes it that much more interesting. They do the British Pub tradition proud, and the fact that they have *so much* imported European beer on tap that isn't the crap (*cough* Stella, Heineken, etc *cough*) you get everywhere else really makes this place special.   In short: Come for the beer, enjoy the very good food, and then enjoy some more beer!"}
{"text":"We're from the states but thanks to yelp we were able to stumble upon this hidden gem. It's right off the subway so even though we were staying downtown it was easily accessible off the summerhill stop.  We loved everything from the chilled strawberry soup (I know it sounds weird but trust me) to the lamb biryani (one of the best I've had) to the sticky toffee pudding served with butter pecan ice cream (to die for). Oh yeah the beer selection is quite excellent as well. No real craft beer to speak of, but they specialize in European beers and they have a very nice selection. Might I recommend the Innis & Gunn (whiskey barreled ale from Scotland, but oh so smooth)"}
{"text":"For a local bar the food is amazing and the beer list extensive, and even including some of my favourites from the UK. We just enjoyed a late lunch / early dinner there before heading to the airport for my friend to catch his flight. He needed something substantial before travelling, so we not opted for the burger which was great. A really tasty piece meat. Unfortunately I will be driving so couldn't enjoy the great beers, but at least I managed a little sip."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour last night.  It was our first time here and we were pleasantly surprised.  They have a great selection of beer & spirits.  Wines by the glass were few (I think only three choices) but both the Shiraz and Malbec were very good, and for $9.50 a glass, a nice hefty pour as compared to nearby places that charge $12-$15 for less.  The staff was welcoming and friendly, always available without being intrusive.  We didn't try any of the entrees, just appetizers.  The Beer & Cheese crock was killer!!  Buffalo shrimp were tasty as well although I wish they had been a little spicier.  The bar area is very small but nice & cozy.  The noise level was just right -- a little background music and conversation, but not so loud that you were drowned out.  We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"As I go about discovering my new neighbourhood I was thrilled to find The Monk's.   We tried it for brunch on Saturday morning and it was great. Coffee was good and arrived right away.   I had the vodka cured salmon eggs benedict, which is something I would never normally order but I was interested by the fact that it was served on a potato nest, rather than an english muffin as I'm trying my darnedest to eat GF. The eggs looked nicely poached but their nice shape was the result of a lot of vinegar in the cooking water. The eggs tasted very vinegary. The hollandaise was really tasty and the salmon and potato nest were wonderful. It really was great.   I'm very excited about having such a cute spot so nearby!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written about this place before.  Definitely my favourite bar to eat from in the city.  They definitely take bar food to a very high level.  This was our 3rd time coming here for Robbie Burns night.  Yup, that good.  The haggis: phenomenal.  Again.  We had haggis at Allen's for Robbie Burns once, and it trailed far back of the stuff here.  We took my in-laws here, and they became huge fans as well.  The server we had was also fantastic.  When I told her that I was torn between the root vegetable soup and the Scotch egg as my starter, I told her that I may ask for the egg at the end of the meal.  She brought me both for the starter.  Service like that: I tip nicely.  Great beer pairings as well.  If we lived closer, this would definitely be our spot.  I'm looking forward to going back there again, and have now brought family and friends to this place."}
{"text":"Good pub, but a bit too dark and a bit too loud. The beer selection is decent, but given a choice between Rebel House and Monk's Table, I would go for Rebel House."}
{"text":"I came here after work for a drink and bite to eat. Pearched on the bar, I got a nice scotch, a half pint and the sheppards pie. I solicited the bartendress' advice for what scotch to get. The bar had a friendly feel and for 35 dollars including tip, I suppose it wasn't too expensive. The girls who worked the floor were quite friendly."}
{"text":"The Hubster and I came here for our weekly Friday night date. We arrived around 12:30am and were greeted not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES before we sat down. Once was a guy going outside asking if we had a light, and then said that we were going to love the place. The second time was from his friend (I assume) who said hello cheerfully as we passed him on the way in, then the third time was from the bartender. Two out of three were just regulars at the place, I assumed, and I felt very welcome.  I was very impressed by their beer selection and enjoyed the ambiance, particularly the giant window that was open to the street.   Unfortunately, we left early since I was feeling kind of crappy, but we'll probably return again since it's only a block away from the subway and it was just so darn nice in there."}
{"text":"My friend and I happened upon this small pub (although I'd categorize it in atmosphere as more of a restaurant) by complete accident and were very happy we did.  The downstairs has a small bar and quite a few tables crammed together - and while it feels a tad cramped, it lends itself well to the atmosphere.  We were stopped by the hostess and asked if we had a reservation - so I'm guessing that after-work dinner generally requires them because of the limited number of seats there - we didn't but she was very kind, led us over to the bar, given drink menus, told us the wait would be about 10 minutes and she would come and get us.  As generally happens, the wait was shorter than they said and was a mere 5 minutes.  Our table was on the second floor - equal size to the main floor but with a smaller bar and more tables (with more room).  Our waiter greeted us right away with the mouth-watering specials and took our drink order.  Lots of great menu choices for not too much money (which was unexpected given the area) - I order the soup of the day to start (a wild mushroom puree) for $6, and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich (chicken with a honey-maple glaze, smoked cheddar and the usual toppings) and fries ($12).  My friend ordered the soup as well but went with the Steak with Frites ($22).    Our soups arrived quickly and piping hot (but not scalding!), each a sizable portion with two pieces of fresh French stick and butter.  Fantastic starter - not too salty (as can happen) and very \"homemade\" in taste.    Next came the main courses...the fries were fantastic, my sandwich was extremely tasty (the maple glaze was amazing), and my friend's steak was done just right.  The food was so good, we started discussing the option of dessert.  And though he was nowhere near out table when we discussed it, our waiter came over to clear or plates and offer up their dessert options.  There were three.  A sticky toffee pudding, a Snickers cheesecake, and a chocolate pecan torte.  Irresistible!  I went with the pudding and my friend with the pecan torte.  Both came quickly and with whip cream and strawberries.  The total bill came to $75 with tax and liquor  (3 courses too!).  Well worth it.    The service was fantastic and attentive, the food was delicious and more homemade (and gourmet - very Jamie Oliver) then the pub-like facade would suggest and the beer and wine selection was extensive.  Highly recommended!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere are exactly how they should be, but the food was crap.  Pardon my language.  But the food was really bad.  And this place is supposed to be good for the food!  I'm really surprised by all the positive reviews.  Did I just get a bad roll of the dice?  It's always possible, but then for a dish that can't get any more English pub than what I ordered, I'm at a loss.  Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is close to home so its super convenient for us to walk to. Aside from the convenience its also got great service and good food. This is a place we can always depend on for a good meal and a fun time."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's super low key. Their mussels [in lime curry sauce] are amazing. We always get those. They come with a side of fries and some bread. They have interesting daily specials, but we usually stick to the mussels and the buffalo shrimp. Too bad I have to share.  Service is always great."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighbourhood, went looking for a close place with good food and drink.. Found the best Caesars in the city, bar none. Have had excellent friendly service with each visit. Will continue to return. Yum"}
{"text":"Review #200!  Came here for some fancy beers because we are tired of same old Canadian and Coors lite.  They got some nice selections on tap. We wanted to share some fries. Menu had zucchini fries. Ask for regular fries and ye shall receive (picture below).   Wonderful bartender. Great beer. Cozy bar. Quite quiet. I strongly recommend this place to all beer lovers."}
{"text":"I loved this place as soon as I walked in the door. Mel, the owner, and her staff are so friendly and welcoming. I felt at home immediately upon arrival to the neighbourhood and made it my 'local' on the spot. Never done that.  The food is great and I'm slowly working my way through the menu. Something for everyone and portions/presentation are high quality with fair prices. The pints are from UK and rest of Europe and the bartenders know what they're doing. Actually, I was doing a 'tour' of Caesars in the local pubs and ended up here...and stayed. Mel's Caesar is one of the best I've ever had.  They also do story telling third Monday of the month. great ambience, always new friends.   So glad I was introduced to this little gem."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favourites places to go whether it's for a meal or to just grab a drink with a friend. The food is AMAZING and the service is always great. I highly recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious food, good beer...all these make this place my fav in the area. I will go there more with no doubt."}
{"text":"This pub is wonderful.  I haven't been in a while, so we decided to go there for dinner on Saturday.  We showed up without a reservation, but the barkeep was accommodating and sat us on the first floor by the bar.    We had a few drinks (my husband absolutely loved 'the doctor' cocktail and my kid was in heaven with a very tasty shirley temple - seriously, it was delicious).  We ate the zucchini fries and the cheese crock for apps.  The zucchini was beautifully crisp and I loved the sriracha aioli.  The cheese crock was decadent.  It's cheese.  You really can't go wrong.  For mains - my kid had a mini burger and my husband had the fish.  I don't eat fish, so I can't comment but my husband was blown away saying it was one of the best he's had in a while.  The fries were delicious (I did sample some of those).    I was drinking wine and felt like a 'real' dinner instead of something that comes with fries.  I had the special: chicken supreme with braised fingerlings and asparagus, all smothered in a delicious creamy dill sauce.  It was simple, yet so tasty.    All in all, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back.    BEST PART of the night:  a gruff, possibly-drunk, regular walks into the bar, sits down and yells at the bartender, 'hey!  can you gimme a job!'.  The bartender looks at him and goes, 'sure, I'll put you on door.  You can yell at the customers when they come in.  I hear it's good for business'.  Ok, maybe it's not so funny typed out, but it was a seamless retort and we had a good laugh at the time.  I"}
{"text":"Location - tiny and quiet, in a not so busy area, which means less people and less noise in the restaurant. The interior is decorated nicely, following the whole monk theme, and the candlelit dinner is appreciated. I was actually surprised that Simon and Garfunkel were played in the background. It's great either if you want to go on a date or if you just want to chill down with a drink. Beer - these guys know their stuff. You will find Kronenbourg and Paulaner. I'm no big fan of stouts and ales, but the list for that was pretty lengthy too. Very excited to have found a beer menu that is not filled by all the Ontario-made, watered-down beers. The food- although food is good, it is also the reason why this is a 4 star and not a 5 star.I got the Schnitzel, which tasted amazing, crunchy outside-soft inside and well seasoned. The potatoes were a bit too dry, but otherwise good.My girlfriend got the halibut, which was delicious, but more than 3/4 of the plate was filled with fries, which I found disappointing. For the schnitzel, halibut, Paulaner and a glass of white wine we paid ~65$, which I think is alright, given the few minuses. This place doesn't get a 4/5 because it is not good. I am definitely returning for the beer. In terms of food, ask questions about it so you do end up getting the right dish."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day and can't wait for return trips. The Monk's Table is a cozy pub atmosphere with an outstanding menu high above pub quality. The beer list is extensive, with a lot of English and other European beers on tap and in bottle. No Canadian or American options, not that I mind, as I'd rather an interesting beer list like this than the usual Bud, Coors and Canadian choices. I had the one Czech beer they offered, and quite enjoyed it. There are daily specials which looked good, always an omelet is one of them, and then a regular menu with salads, sandwiches, appetizers, ploughman's lunch and other dishes. I had the Vegetarian Chili with side salad and it was so good I ate more than I needed. Service was attentive but not obtrusive, and they are very knowledgeable about the beers and the food. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The Abbott - not  Monk's for this regular.  Love it - great beer, good food, local feel.  Usually busy, but i always get a table...i usually order the veggie chilly or the fish & chips...but the food is good across the board.  I know people who are there multiple times a week..am deffinitely there a few times a month.  Gastro / brew pub....good beer list...not as good as Comrad's but close.  Have had a few misses for brunch and every so often the service upstairs is slow, but still my go to pub.    It is especially great in the winter months - dark and cozy with hearty food...and can be a great choice for intimate chats..."}
{"text":"After the Toronto FC home opener our entourage wanted to hit up a nice place uptown and away from the headaches of the downtown core. Monk's Table seemed to be in our target area, plus the name! .....but most of all its reputation for good comfort food and craft beer.  Thankfully in this neighborhood, there's plenty of parking and for those not driving, Summerhill station is just around the corner AT FIRST I was quite disappointed when informed that they ran out of their schnitzel (main reason for coming here)..however the Monk's burger was nothing but PURE goodness. Thick, juicy, well presented but most of all, DELISH! Easy 5/5 Adding the blue cheese created extra versatility to the dish. Served with their in house made fries, this complimented the burger.   To wash things down I opted for their Petrus Belgian beer that was served in chalice...Adding some icing to an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Nice food in a small atmospheric bar......a bit pricey but this is Toronto midtown afterall....the barmaid/waitress was rushed off her feet but did a good job keeping everyone happy. Good selection of beers on tap....including ESB,Old Speckled Hen, Fullers for fans of British bitter."}
{"text":"Nothing but love for this small but great place to get a bite to eat and hang out with friends!  It's small so we ended up sitting at the bar and ordered some food and drinks.  I had the mussels and the were pretty good.  It was just enough to fill me up as I had eaten prior.  My friend had the Monk burger (I stole some of his fries - shhhhh don't tell him!) and he enjoyed the burger - juicy, flavorful, and hit the spot after a hard day at work.  We didn't have a reservation but it was packed and we just got lucky with a few seats at the bar.  The beer selection is great, their drinks are interesting and the bartenders are knowledgeable and pretty friendly.  If this is how Monk's live...sign me up!"}
{"text":"Gave them another chance, because friends wanted to go.  The service was awful. Downstairs sent me upstairs for a seat. The waiter upstairs asked seemed upset to see us and asked us why we were there. When we told him the woman downstairs sent us, he told us to go back downstairs. I suggested we leave. My friends disagreed due to the weather.  I wasn't going to order food again, but the fries were great. However, the English mild I ordered tasted sour. I think the lines need to be cleaned."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Biryani and it was so succulent!  With this crazy, cold spring weather, rich Indian comfort food is a wise choice!  I barely touched the salad, which had mango slices adding to a sweet flavour. Maybe next time. You see, these are rather large dishes that can visibly pack the pounds during dinner time!"}
{"text":"I was here for drinks with a friend and her sister last summer and again recently on a date for a late dinner and both times, I must say I was wildly impressed.   Situated on a quieter strip of Yonge between Summerhill and St Claire, the pub stands out against the adjascent businesses by, well, it's woodiness.  The sign looks like a tree has been sawed in half and just put up!  Peeking in the windows reveals a candle-lit and often busy (though slightly small) bar.  The first time I went, my friends and I couldn't find a spot for 3 downstairs, so we were directed to the upstairs area which, Meena A is right on the money, is dark, but not in that sensual and candle-lit way the downstairs is, and likely underserviced.  However, we didn't have a chance to check the last claim as were only there a short time until someone dashed up to say a table for us had opened up downstairs.  Last week, my date and I grabbed one of the tables right across from the bar.  It was a little small for 2 people dining, but sufficient.    The service was excellent both times I've been.  Welcomed almost immediately, coming upstairs to give us the option of changing tables, consistently checking on how we were doing for drinks/decided on food/how the food was without being too in-your-face; these people seem to have service DOWN, which can be a rarity among the newer, hipper joints.    This place takes their heralding of Gastropub VERY seriously!  The drink selection was good: a strong beer selection, some of which I'd never heard of, and a scandanavian cider!  Really?!?!  I tried it; it was good!  They also have a decent sized wine list and could probably make some rather interesting cocktails as well.  The food was EXCELLENT.  Dude and I split some dip with crustini which was amazing; we were actually disappointed when the server took it away!  I had vodka cured salmon with an apple and blue cheese salad with candied walnuts and Dude had the fish and chips (he totally stole my dinner idea); I can't speak personally on the fish (still too early to go stealing off his plate...) but he said it was tasty, but dense, which then sparked a halibut vs. haddock debate as to which is better fish to beer batter.  My salmon was excellent, and the salad was crisp and refreshing.  I'm not generally a huge fan of blue cheese, but it went spectacularly with the apples and the lemon dressing.  My only disappointment was that they were out of mussles by the time Dude and I arrived (which can happen when you don't show up for dinner until 9pm on a weekday evening)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner and it was possibly the worst food I've ever had in Toronto. We ordered the beef brisket and it tasted like pure rubber. We then ordered a different meal and they messed up my boyfriends order. On top of it all the ambience left much to be desired and the tables were so sticky. Our server was nice about the situation but overall it was a disappointing experience and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Ok, the location is a bit out of the way for me, and its easy to completely miss. But they have some interesting draft selection and its nice and cozy in there. Maybe you could even bring a date there. Note i said \"interesting\" selection, not vast. Maybe the place impressed me because I saw La Trappe on draft in Canada for the first time there (some supplier must've made a deal, as I have seen this pop up as an option at a few places now)  I've tried a couple of items off the food menu and they were ok. Nothing mind blowing. but not bad."}
{"text":"I've been coming to The Monk's Table off and on for approximately 6 years now and I have just realized something - I have never once had a bad time here. The service and the atmosphere has always been friendly! No grumpy workers or shady belligerent patrons or snobbish neighbourhood regulars who think they run the place. Usually after going to a restaurant/bar for so long I would have at least one incident that turned me off from wanting to go back, but not here. The beer selection has always been stellar, don't expect your typical mainstream beers, and I have only had one complaint about my food which was promptly corrected. They also have an upstairs bar in case things get a bit crowded downstairs. Clean place in a clean neighbourhood. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I went on a pub crawl with the Toronto Beer Lovers Meetup Group.  It was led by Ken Woods, President of Black Oak Brewing Co.  The first stop was the Monk's Table.  Adam, the owner, took really good care of us. He had an area upstairs reserved.  He provided complimentary appetizers ... mussels, shrimp, fries, dips and chicken wings.  They also gave us a taste of Gouden Carolus Cuvee Van De Keizer Rood/Red ... it was yummy!  There were about 20 of us. They took such good care of us that it was hard to leave."}
{"text":"Excellent fare. Enjoyed the steak!"}
{"text":"Great selection of imported beer and scotch. Menu is better than most pubs and food was enjoyable. Good service and friendly. Comfortable neighbourhood crowd. A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"This small and cozy pub is a good place to grab a pint to get through the long day! The staff here is very friendly and very attentive. The food was alright, nothing out of the ordinary. I can definitely see this place being a good place to grab a few friends for drinks and watch a soccer or a hockey game. Overall, it wasn't a bad nor a great experience. Just \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"The Monk manages to somehow remain low key and unpretentious while offering some excellent food and booze. The overall atmosphere is very laidback and very much devoid of the douchery that endangers some of our town's best watering holes!   What really elevated our experience to another level however was the service. Stef is one of the most personable and knowledgeable barkeeps I have come across in Toronto. She tried her best to accommodate some unusual cocktail requests and her suggestions for food/ Scotch were spot on. For a night of catching up with friends the Monk is a definite win!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food at this place. I had the chicken sandwich and fries, loved it! The service wasn't anything amazing, I would assume it was because I didn't order any alcohol which really sucks by the way. If you are a beer drinker and like good food, this is a great place for you to go!"}
{"text":"The Abbot On The Hill has been renamed \"The Monk's Table\""}
{"text":"I Love THIS PLACE!  Always end up here when I head downtown to see a couple of clients in the area.  I consider it a treat to be there.  You have to ask yourself, is it a pub or a fine food restaurant? Yes! It's all things that we expect from a Gourmand House. Good food, good selection of spirits, wines, and BEERS! Nothing local, just the best selection of imports.   This place was the Abbott on the Hill years ago and luckily whatever biz fallout happened, we ended up with the Monk!  I think we got the better end of the deal!  LOL.  Downstairs is a nice bar. A little tight for space but cozy and inviting. Upstairs has more space and during the summer, the sunlight beams through the windows and it's nice to be there.  So far, I've had a bit of everything on the menu. Everything has been great! I'm not a pubfare kind of guy but their standard fare is good and the chef's creations are excellent.  Highly recommend dropping by this place!   If you have a small group of people, I recommend calling them for a reservation as they can get packed."}
