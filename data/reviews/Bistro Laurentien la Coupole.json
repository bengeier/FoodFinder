{"text":"This place is the WORST I experienced In my life.  THEY EVEN WROTE THEMSELVE REVIEWS! Like people where dumb enough to think that all their 5 stars reviews was so believable when its people who wrote only ONE Review And ALL the same date!

UPDATE! They removed those reviews! Good job, first Step in the right direction! 

 The fact that they \"Moved their Business\" on yelp to not face the review is exactly the same thing as this restaurant. Covering Things up and doing like nothing Happened!

I'll leave you to my previous review which is from a year ago visit i'm still pissed off about every time a think about it. 

*************

We are Saturday and It's Montreal en Lumiere. There's a special Brunch Menu for the occasion. My friend Karine heard there's a special brunch menu @ La Coupole so we decide to give it a try. We make a reservation for 3.

I arrive 10 minutes late, my friends are already at our table. The first floor is completely empty and its 12:40. There around 14  people (approx 5 tables) in the second floor. Our server give us the menu and coffee. 

We get our appetizer after 25 Min. Its a bit long for smoke salmon and oysters.
My oysters are not very cold and only get a piece of lemon and a sour sauce as garnish. Nobody is impress with their plates.

We wait another 40 Min to get our second dish. We all ordered egg Benedict and they are all overcooked. So basically not really an egg Benedict. There's a table spoon of hollandaise sauce and the plate is really sad looking. Finally after more than an hour of service we finally get our first glass of water and toast. If you compared it with eggspectation, im telling you, eggspectation is just Wayyy better and you won't feel riped off.

At this point I don't even want to complain. We had 2 different server and now the manager is serving us. Its really strange because overall we had 4 different server (3 server and 1 manager) doing the service.
The manager took a while before finally taking our finished plates. He made and inappropriate comment to my friend about her not finishing her potatoes that made everybody uncomfortable. 

My friend told me then that when she arrive 15 min early for brunch the manager told her really seriously to wait outside. when she was about to turn around and leave he told her that it was a joke... so you can have a good picture of the brilliant type of manager running that place. 

Finally for our last dish, my friend who is a pastry chef got pastries of course. The cake was sooo dry just trying to take a bite was work. our plates once again looked all very sad. the waiters were all trying hard too look very busy with their now 4 tables. 

For all of us it was the worst service and food we ever had. on top of it we all make better food than this. Why pay for that. 40$ each , I felt so bad.

I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS ON YELP!

Save your money, nobody deserve that, the service took 2 hours. its is now 3h24 and I feel bad for having paid for that."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Food was very good.  Service was personable and friendly.  Not a busy place, surprisingly.  Thought it would be a dressier place as well.  But nothing wrong with casual.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"C'est rare que je donne un si mauvais commentaire mais... C'était vraiment pas bon! Une salade César qui était imbibé de vinaigrette depuis un bon bout de temps... Un poisson réchauffe au micro-onde, raide sec...  Beurk!"}
{"text":"We ate here while looking for more upscale near Bell Centre than fast food or pub. Service and food was good, a little pricey. We had halibut (special),  lamb, salad, carrot/squash soup (special), cheese, local meat appetizers. Good bar scene in this hotel restaurant. A nice stop as we continue our visit to Montreal. We're staying nearby."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I bought a 14$ coupon for the Tartarfest special special menu helt at la coupole. Mindfull of this, I can only do a review about what I have experienced in this setting.

For 14$ (tax and services not included) I had an entrée size beef tartar with croutons, a piece of warm brioche with butter and 3 samples of beer made by the \"brasseurs du monde\" a pilsner, a tea infused white and a red.

It was delightful, everything was top notch. I was really happy I could try this restaurant for such a cheap price!

The brioche was excellent, warm and fluffy with a thin but crisp crust. I really enjoy bread and it pains me to see low quality bread serve and then thrown away. 

The beer and the tartar were decent and good. The croutons were well done, not to crispy, not to soft. But the star of the show was the lichen placed on top of the tartar. 

I was pleasantly surprised to see how the waitress knew exactly the method and stage of preparation of the lichen and was very pleased to explain it to me even if I hogged a seat for over an hour taking my sweet sweet time to get infused by the calm and chic of the place. 

So a 14$ fine dining experience? Yes please!"}
{"text":"I don't understand La Coupole in Hotel Le Crystal. It seems to have all of the ingredients to be amazing. It has a good farm-to-table concept, a beautiful interior design and a well-stocked bar.

We first went for breakfast and I got oatmeal. It was good. I liked it. My side of bacon tasted gross but had delightful texture. They deep fried it. Who deep fries bacon? The server explained that deep frying the bacon makes it less fatty... Not sure about that. It was thin and very crispy. M didn't care for her breakfast.

We also went for drinks one evening. There was nobody to be seen. No host or hostess. It was dimly lit. We thought it might be closed! Then a server happened to breeze past and we told him we wanted to have drinks and maybe dessert.

He brought us upstairs and onto the terrace. It was a muggy evening and sitting outside would not have been our first choice.

All I can say was that service was really, really weird. The drinks were medicinal and we did not like them. We opted not to have dessert. After that evening, we chose not to return to the restaurant even though we were staying at the hotel for the week."}
{"text":"Nice farm to table concept and friendly hostess. The interior was quite nice and felt welcoming, I was shocked at how empty the restaurant was. They told us that the ingredients they use are all local. We had the charcuterie and Caesars cocktail. The size of the Caesars drink I ordered is much larger than in Toronto for roughly the same price which was a nice surprise. Towards the end of our meal we had a different server who was quite pushy about getting us the bill even though we were still eating. He even tried to take away our plate despite there still being food on it. Would have given them 4 stars if they weren't so pushy about getting us to leave."}
{"text":"I came here since I had a gift card, and was curious to try out the menu.
My gf and I had salmon and beef tartare as an appetizer. I regularly eat tartare and was surprised by how good they were, ok size for an appetizer.
We decided to split the 48$ steak which I was curious to see would live up to its price point! Overall, the steak was very good! Would I pay for 48$ of my money for it probably not but the sauce was good and it was a fair size.
We had a creme brûle for dessert which came with a pudding chômeur . The creme brûle was good but nothing amazing either!

Overall this place is good for dates,  it was calm for a Saturday evening. Food is good, the red wine we had was excellent. If you have the budget for it, it's a decent place and reliable place to come to without expecting anything life changing."}
{"text":"Je ne peux pas juger la nourriture, nous n'avons pris qu'un verre! 

Les prix sont chers, mais c'est à s'y attendre, c'est dans l'hôtel Le Crystal! Sinon, beau décor et serveur impeccable :)!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here as our \"last night in town\" meal at a recent visit to Montreal. We were hoping to experience a meal with items and flavors we couldn't get back home (the US) and this place seemed like a good choice and was close to where we were staying. I really liked the way they had the local purveyors they used in a kind of image map up on one wall.

We dined early (5pm-ish) on a Friday night and when we arrived I think were the first ones there. Despite that we had a wonderful waiter who joked with us and remained very attentive even as other customers began to arrive. My wife had the lamb sirloin from Quebec which she said was really good and ate every last bite of. It was kind of a rainy day and I was chilly so I went a bowl of the soup d'jour (potato and leek) and their caesar salad with cured local meats. The soup was fantastic, clean mild flavors and I wipe every drop of it from the bowl with the cornmeal topped rolls the waiter brought. The caesar salad was pretty good. It featured a very thick (think room temp butter) on the bottom of the plate then meat, cheese, croutons, and romaine on top so that I had to toss it around to coat the leaves. The main reason I ordered the caesar (other than I love caesar salad) was that it said the croutons were browned with herring oil and I was hoping perhaps a salt-y, brine-y maritime flavor might come through though sadly it did not. None of the flavors of either dish I had were all that powerful, just clean, and better seasoned that many other dishes I ate while on my trip to Montreal. 

My wife had two glasses of a local white wine whose name I can't recall (or believe I had ever heard of) but I believe was the Domaine de l'Orpailleur, Qc Seyval et Vidal. All nice food, though not particular wow-ing, just well executed and clean and made enjoyable by a very professional wait staff."}
{"text":"Belle place méconue des locaux probablement parcequ'elle est caché dans l'hotel Crystal et derriere le starbucks.. mais à découvrir. Tres bon service et bons assiettes."}
