{"text":"We were looking for a place for breakfast and found Daybreak Diner by accident. Very friendly staff, huge dishes (for us as Europeans) and acceptable price. I'd definitely go there a second time."}
{"text":"Junkyard frittata for the win! MOST of the staff is friendly and helpful, prices can't be beat, esp with all the food they give you. I've only waited for a table during the weekend brunch rush."}
{"text":"my favorite breakfast place in toronto.  great eggs florentine, huge portions (3 english muffin/poached eggs on florentine)."}
{"text":"HUGE fan - i have been a regular for years
-excellent portion size
-great selection of breakfast/lunch foods
-generally excellent service and food quality

ONLY cons are
-can be VERY busy if you're not an early riser
-on a rare occasion service falters (most often a result of brunch rush after bar crowd wakes up)
-roast beef sandwich is no longer a perfectly tender cut from a homemade med-rare roast"}
{"text":"For the price, it could have been better. Also, seasonal fresh fruit garnish was nonexistent. Menu got my hopes up. Perhaps it does not apply to take-out orders or they really had nothing seasonally fresh? Disappointing. Less wallet damage than Cora's but it still left me SMDH.

Anyway, their sausages are amazing & I am so glad I got the combo platter with two bangers. I really like that thing they do with the 3 eggs in one small 8\" skillet 'cuz I don't get excess egg white overhang (being a much bigger fan of yolks). Then again, a lot of diners do this. Imbiss, Corner Kitchen, Sunset Grill (according to pictures), etc. I had plenty of delightfully fattening 'yellow gold' to dip my toast in, even if my eggs were done over easy. 

I resented the fact that they only gave me one slice of bread/2 diagonally-cut triangular slices of toast. My breakfast costed almost $10 before taxes. One slice of bread (even with a flapjack) is a frigging joke. The little nibble of Western omelette with a nice piece of ham I stole from my sister was amazing though. 

Oh, & the hashbrowns? They were so soggy, I had to shove them into my toaster oven on a bed of foil & rotate them every once in awhile-- for 10 whole minutes. 

All in all, I have lots of hangups about this place & find it a tad silly that a restaurant called 'Daybreak' opens about 2 hours after sunrise... especially since McDonalds & most major restaurants start breakfast at 5 a.m. One major upside: I spent much-needed & appreciated quality time with my adorable little sister & consider myself very fortunate for any amount of time or opportunity spent with her."}
{"text":"Wow! Great breakfast and brunch!
Love the atmosphere and the food is quick and hot!
Definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"One day I came here for brunch and Joe Jonas was sitting at the table across from me. I'm not even joking, Joe Jonas from the Jonas Brothers. He was eating bacon and eggs. This restaurant is definitely as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Not amazing, but this is oldschool big breakfast territory.  With real hashbrowns, not the homefries BS that must be endured at most places these days.  It's not \"retro\" a la Fran's, but it's still breakfasty good times.

This is where you go when you're hungover and/or starving."}
{"text":"One big reason I do not intend to move for a while: I have four large breakfast/brunch joints within pyjama-walking distance from me. How would I survive lazy weekends or killer hangover/post-drinking hunger without them?? My muse of late is Daybreak.

Daybreak has a nice corner location which gets a decent amount of natural light on a sunny day. It's also nice to zone out people watching when you feel like a zombie. Their biggest (and it is really big) downfall is their service. SO UBER SLOW. The first time I was here, I dismissed it as the odd inexperienced server, but I've been here a few more times since then and it's always slow. They are still very friendly though.

Must try item: JUNKYARD FRITTATA. It's pretty much like an omelette/breakfast pizza minus crust. It has a crapload of egg, mushroom, cheese, etc. I managed to finish the entire thing the first time I had it, but that's not recommendable on your arteries and thighs. They have a few menu items that have a mexican flare - not my thing for breakfast. Their regular breakfast is standard, possibly too greasy - but I like that they come with pancakes AND toast! I am always that person that wants the best of sweet and savoury for breakfast.

A point of cuteness that people may not notice otherwise: all their plates are large and white... and in the shape of an egg! :D

Atmosphere - 3/5
Service - 2/5
Food - 3/5
Price - 3.5/5"}
{"text":"After previously endorsing this restaurant, I can no longer recommend it.   The service has declined precipitously (painstakingly slow, even with frequent attempts to flag down the servers), the food quality keeps getting worse and worse, and it's lost the charm it once had 5-6 years ago.  Even my previous favorite, the Parilla Mexicana, was a disappointment on my last visit - the egg whites were runny and the presentation was a bit of a sloppy mess.  Plus they no longer provide toast with it anymore.  You just get the feeling that they keep reducing costs to avoid a price hike.  A sad decline for a once solid breakfast joint..."}
{"text":"A middle of the road breakfast diner. Not great but not bad. Had the eggs benny. What I liked was you get three eggs benny with a side of pancakes so you do leave stuffed. Prices were standard. Room for improvement would have been a more prompt coffee refill. Other than that they were good about substitutions and service was friendly."}
{"text":"This place was a delight to find one blustery weekend.  Our waitress was a peach and everyone's food was a delight.  This is traditional breakfast fare, but not the gross greasy version.  Omlettes are massive and served with hashbrowns, toast, and pancakes.  You will not be wanting for starch.  I enjoyed the ham and swiss crepe a great deal.  Rich and delicious.  Orange juice is fresh squeezed and the coffee is pretty darned good.  (Be warned, if you pop in shortly before closing time, your coffee will have that extra bitter bottom of the pot taste, that's just life.  Its still pretty drinkable)

I am speaking as a girl who worked several years at a truly great breakfast joint.  This place definitely measures up."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Waiter has a bad attitude. We later figured out that was the owner. Thanks for spoiling my Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Tons of food for your money, especially if you get the special."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Daybreak.

It's a fairly average breakfast place with average service, but I have been here many times and I have never had anything (and nor have the friends that I have been with) that isn't really, really good. My favourite by far is the ham and cheese crepe. Their orange juice is also very delicious (although that might have to do with the hangovers I have had when I have eaten there!)

All in all, you get plenty of food, on the side of too much, and there's nothing overly negative about the place or the food!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times has always been good.  Today waiter was surly and treated us like we were bothering  him.  Inner door was open and a big wind came in every time somebody opened the door.  Asked waiter if it could be closed.  He acted like he did not hear me. Had to ask twice for  water, my brunch companion only drinks decaf, water refilled both our  cups with regular did not even ask."}
{"text":"Two words: FREE PANCAKES

Seriously, I think they come with everything. Also noteworthy is that their eggs benny includes 3 eggs on 3 muffins. 

Oh and another bonus: it's conveniently located on the cusp of The Village so if you go early you don't have to sit with screaming toddlers - I call this the early shift, because pre-noon / pre-the hangover crowd brunch places are filled with sticky toddlers with syrup all over their faces. Anyway the point of that story is to avoid the early shift at all costs... or if you're up at 8am on the weekend go to this place."}
{"text":"They have a terrible customer service. The waitress brought our check before we asked which I could ignore (though I don't like to be rushed that way!), but she got upset when we pointed out we're qualified for the student discount. I think she was upset because we didn't say we're students before. But how can we if she brings the check without being asked?! Anyways, my friend showed his student card from Univ. of Waterloo, and she said \"oh, the discount only applies to students in Toronto\". I suspect that she made that up to not to change the bill because the sign in front doesn't say discount for Toronto students, it says student discount. I said that's fine because I'm a UofT student and I showed my ID. Then she said \"your photo is blurry and scratched, I cannot accept this\"! Excuses after excuses just not to change the bill, unbelievable! Eventually, I showed her two more IDs with my name on it to show the name matches and it's really me in the photo. When we left she didn't even say bye or thank you, she just turned her back with an attitude.  

By the way, potatoes are uncooked and omelettes are missing the flavor so the food is not even good. They claim eggs are from a farm, but they are tasteless. There is no way that those eggs are from a farm.

We're definitely not going back. There are a lot of other diners and breakfast/brunch places around that area. Don't waste your money and time there."}
{"text":"I took a Vegetarian friend of mine to this place simply because they have a somewhat large menu with some veggie-friendly choices. 

This  place always seems packed and had to wait for our table for about 10min. Okay, no problem with that, most brunch places are like that. However there is something low-rent about Daybreak. The place looks old, and lacks that breakfast vibe you get in some places like Cora's or *some* sunset grills. 

Now, I am pretty indifferent about whether I like Cora or Sunset Grill better, however I wanted to expose my friend to a new place and we were not going to go to the Golden Griddle on Carlton as that place is just depressing looking.

Now I have not been here for a few years, and my three eggs came without much fanfare and although the shredded potatoes were decent, I was not too keen on the free pancakes, as *I did not order pancakes* for a reason. As such both my  friend's and my pancakes went wasted and back to the kitchen, which to me, seemed like a waste of food. I mean, I understand what they were trying to do but they should ask customers if they would want then added at the time of ordering. I mean, what do they do with them if they go back? Give them their freedom? Shuck them in the bin or recycle them?

Sadly, the quality of the food was not bad, their coffee was not bad but everything was just \"Meh.\" 

If I am in the area, and there is absolutely no other option to go to for brunch, then I will come here, otherwise, I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place.
Great local place where the gays and village brunchers come to have a standardly yummy brunch with impeccable service.
The servers are oh so friendly and every single plate comes with pancakes, yo!  totaly bonus.
I heart the servers and I love the running into the regulars at this place.

food = a-ok, but + awesome servers + free pancakes + fun run-ins and playing catchup with friends bumps it up to 4/5

(ok...well service isn't excellent- my friend had to go behind the bar to get me hot sauce and ketchup- but they are sooo nice, even if disorganized)

Busy on the weekends but it's a great locals diner that is worth the wait- you'll probably be too busy talking to people you recognize to notice the wait."}
{"text":"Poor cleanliness.
Of the three breakfast places on this block, this one is my least favourite for both value and food.

Restaurant is poorly designed, and the service does the best they can despite a number of tables out of proportion to the capacity of the kitchen. Except to have to wait for your order.The platters are huge, so if your definition of a good restaurant is huge portions then you'll like this restaurant, but I thought the food unexceptional."}
{"text":"Daybreak does the standard breakfast well - Eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, toast & pancakes garnished with some fresh orange slices. Prices are reasonable and service is quick. The casual atmosphere is welcoming to all and perfect for those weekends when you roll out of bed late and just want to throw on a hoodie and jeans.

Conveniently on the 506 streetcar line and a block or so north of the Ryerson campus Daybreak was a favourite place to eat on weekends during my student years and is a good central location to meet up with  friends for brunch in more recent days."}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly agree with everything Jason R. said below (since I was with him at the time).  I get the feeling that this place is only good after many drinks well past midnight.  The food was not good, although the fresh orange juice was one victory for the place."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mediterranean egg white omelet with no cheese but they served it to me with cheese. Not a big deal, I figured the waiter didn't mention it to the cook or the cook made a mistake. When I pointed this out they were nice enough to take my dish back and make me a new omelette, however, the second omelette had raw onions. I made it known that the second attempt at the omelette was not good because of the under cooked vegetables and that I couldn't finish it. I was expecting to be comped for the meal or at least have them offer an alternative solution, such as a new dish. They did nothing about it which is a sign of poor management and training. Customer service 101 people."}
{"text":"Popular diner located at the intersection of Church and Carlton Streets, the Daybreak Diner is a great place to get large omelet platters (large servings) at reasonable prices.  Prior to moving to Toronto, I would frequent this place with my friends on Saturday, which is always thriving with the brunch crowd. While competition on Church Street had stolen some of the spotlight from it (most competitors have folded and left the area since 2011), it still remains an great restaurant for a small group wanting to catch up.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"The food is great here and the portions are big. I recommend the eggs Benny or Old MacDonald omelette.

The problem with this place is the service. The wait staff are pretty rush/rush, no check ins on food, and they have one debit machine which causes a long queue to leave.
z
A large sign read \"all domestics beer and cocktails $5.50\" but when we ordered, mimosas and other cocktails were excluded. They only will do bar rail - hate false advertising.

We will likely go back, but we would definitely go more if the service was better."}
{"text":"Day Break is a breakfast/lunch/mostly breakfast spot.  Your standard breakfast includes so much food that you're likely to overdose.  For around $12, you get bacon, eggs, potatoes, pancakes, toast and maybe something else? I can't remember if something like fruit is included.  Either way, the pancakes themselves are a meal on their own.

The service here is great, and they're very capable when it comes to handling groups.  I remember coming here after class with groups of 7 or 8 people and everything rolling right along like it was a party of 2."}
{"text":"Went here today for breakfast with my friend. Now the sign on the door says they open at 7am and when we walked by at 7:25am they were still closed. The waiter came out of the back after he saw us looking into the window, we were trying to see if maybe they had closed down. He let us in without any explanation or apology for the restaurant being closed.

We bother got the 3 egg breakfast. I didn't want the pancakes that came with it so they brought me extra slices of oranges which I was ok with. The waiter was fairly nice and attentive. I've been to many greasy spoon breakfast places but this one was probably one of my least favourites. The hash browns were soggy and the potatoes tasted a little stale. The eggs were cooked to a perfect over-easy. The multi grain toast was delicious and I was surprised at the fact that you only got 1 slice! For 2 coffees and 2 breakfast it came to about $27.00. Was a little more of the pricey side for a greasy spoon breakfast. 

All in all it was ok, but I probably wouldn't go back unless the Cora's or Golden Griddle in the same block were closed :)"}
{"text":"Update!  

So I was craving hashbrowns, and I find they are hard to come by at restaurants.  Most places have homefries, and to be honest, I prefer hashbrowns.  Anyway, Daybreak was the only place I knew around me that had hashbrowns, and while I swore I would never come back here I thought I would give it another chance.

As you may have read, the last two times I have been here I have not had much luck with them getting my order right.  This time, my order was right (thank goodness!), but I was charged for substituting olives for my tomatoes in my omelette.  I don't recall them ever charging me for a one-for-one substitution in the past, but nevertheless I would have preferred being told that there would be a $2.50 charge b/c then I would have just asked for no olives and been done with it.  Plus, the feta cheese in the Fat Greek Omelette was seriously lacking.

The service was better than usual - but that could have been b/c the worst waiter ever (who I've had on most of my bad experiences here) was not working.

I'm giving them one extra star b/c this experience was certainly better than my last few.  The food was better, but the experience as a whole still sub-par.  I think I'll just learn to make my own hashbrowns."}
{"text":"Sooooooo gooooooooood.

I'm not sure who wrote their menu, but they left out some pretty key details. For example, the \"three eggs\" breakfast is actually 3 eggs, two pancakes, hashbrowns AND toast. Huuuge meal for super cheap, and the service is fantastic. They were very accommodating when we had to move to a bigger table, and kept the coffee refills coming, which is key on a bright sunshiney possibly hungover Sunday mornin'."}
{"text":"*groan*  I was really disappointed.  I've eaten here before, enjoyed myself and was looking forward to the free pancakes that come with most of their breakfast dishes.  The pancakes were the best part of this experience.

I ordered the Eggs Anastasia (eggs benny but with salmon).  My dining companion and I had just come from an invigorating yoga class down the street and I wanted a proper brunch but nothing too, too heavy.  The amount of Hollandaise sauce was epically overdone.  I scraped it away trying to find my eggs and salmon.  I mentioned to our server that the boys in the back and really gone to town with it and he relied \"yeah, they do that a lot\".... I should have sent it back, but I didn't and I ended up with a good half cup of sauce on the side of my plate by the time I was done eating.  They're just lucky their Hollandaise is good!  

Pancakes were delish, although I was a little dismayed to find upon inquiry that the contents of the authentic maple syrup bottle was just standard syrup.  I felt bad for our server, he seemed pretty apologetic the whole way through our visit.

Ended the visit by freshening up in the ladies room and if I hadn't known better I would have sworn I was at a public pool.  Bleach much?

I might go back, but I'll likely stick to the pancakes, or get Hollandaise on the side.  I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Are you hung over? Are you hungry? Are you part of the family? If all of these apply then you can't go wrong with the Daybreak. I am sure to visit this place every time I come to Toronto. There are rarely waits here, the service is OK if the waiter takes a liking to you (luckily I have big guns so I tend to get good service). The best thing about this place however is the size of the portions. THEY ARE HUGE!! The quality of the food is nothing special (typical diner fare), ditto menu selection, but for the price you are sure to be full up. Daybreak is an institution on Church, well worth a visit."}
{"text":"We started the day here.  The server had a great personality.  She is strong and friendly.  She was handling the restaurant by herself, so was working hard.  Our dishes came out quickly.  My chorizo sausage was very good.  Our meals were fine.  They were a bit bigger than we needed.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed.  We had a good meal."}
{"text":"God I wish there was some consistency with this place.  Took a year or so break from this place to see if they could change for the better.  Drum roll.......new decor, some new waitstaff, but still the not overly friendly French-Canadian \"bear\" still works there and it took an hour to get our food when they were not really busy on Saturday!  And took him 45 minutes to notice drinks were empty.  Too busy chatting up the twinks and his manager to care much about the rest of his tables:(  Sadly, this is my last attempt to eat here.....shows you how one person can ruin a dining experience for anyone."}
{"text":"This is place up again - as always on Saturday - if you're looking for me on a Saturday between 10-noon, there is a good chance I'm here.

What a busy day - but it was Pride weekend and it's really the only good breakfast place in the area - so the volume of ppl was expected.  even with the extra people, and the noise level the staff was all over it.

Didn't need to wait, and we were placed in one of our fave servers sections!  Ms. T was all over it that morning!  The second we sat down she had my coffee in front of me and a glass of water for Vivian V.

As always a kick ass breakfast and an amazing staff :)"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch after a late night is always a must. Pleasantly surprised with the diner! Went in and was automatically greeted with a smile and seated. 

Got the sausages and eggs with a short stack, hash browns, toast $8-9 and a bottomless coffee $2.50

What an amazing deal. SO MUCH food and it was really good for the usual brekky. Only thing was that our food came really late, probably 20-25 minutes. The table next to us sat down half way through the waiting time and got their food at the same time. So clearly they may have forgot our order. Regardless, good food and great staff.

Attentive, delicious, sunny, homey. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Automatically this place gets 5 stars because they give you pancakes with many of the combos. I got a California Benny and it was great. Flavourful hollandaise and the eggs were poached soft and nice. My family got an array of other dishes and were stuffed to the brim. The sausages are scrumptious! You can try all sorts of foods for reasonable prices. The server was very sweet and engaged my talkative parents in friendly banter. Points for sure there!"}
{"text":"Rainy Saturday, and we came across this  gem.

Junkyard frittata - excellent, huge.
Some variety of omelette - also excellent and huge.

LITTLE PANCAKES!  We were not expecting those. =)  With real maple syrup.  What a sweet treat!

The staff here are stunning, the food is filling and well prepared (the veggies in my frittata weren't mushy, and you could tell the difference between all the different bits in it).  The quantity of eggs is amazing, and I don't recommend eating here more than once a week unless you are totally unafraid of cholesterol. =D

The food does not have cute names (yay!) and the staff are really friendly but also really businesslike.  Getting the job done is their primary directive on weekends, it seems. =)

Good tea, good coffee, good everything!  We are going to be coming back here a LOT.  It was 30 dollars for both of us and we were full all day, didn't need to eat another thing.  Can't go wrong with that.

Oh, and in reference to someone saying the Bear Waiter was unfriendly and only helped his friends - he was a doll to us, and we'd never been there before.  Excellent service and great eye candy no matter what your type is. =)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.

They seat you fast, serv you fast, bottomless coffee. 
If you're hungover and you want an enormous quantity of food for relatively cheap, this is the place to be.  

Eggs Benedict are awesome... they give you 3, and it's filling."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I'm not the biggest fan of Cora's or Fran's! Many a nights spent at various residences on College/Carlton St. has made me realize little excites my taste buds on this street east of Spadina.
This makes Daybreak a teeny tiny little gem by comparison; there isn't much of a wait time, the service is good, and the prices are reasonable.

First thing to mention is that you should go here hungry!! Daybreak serves possibly the largest brunch portions of any diner I have been to in Toronto! The standard Benedict will come with 3 large poached eggs, toast as well as English muffins, hash browns, and surprise pancakes! Yes, the famous surprise pancakes are real and you do seem to get 2 large fluffy pancakes with some of the meals (this is a big bonus as I'm always stuck between choosing sweet or savoury items at brunch!)

Overall, The most impressive part of Daybreak for me are the freshly shredded potato, non deep fried hash browns! Beyond the sides, I would recommend the eggs Benny and Chorizo omelette from what I've tried so far, and advise looking elsewhere if you are interested in salads. 
Check it out if you're in the area, not necessarily worth traveling across town."}
{"text":"There was a time in my life when I was obsessed with Daybreak. Absolutely obsessed. I would go every weekend, sometimes twice a week.

And now that I look back at it, I really don't know why. Yeah, you get a CRAZY amount of food for super cheap, yeah, you can have pancakes and eggs and bacon and toast and hash browns all in the same meal, yeah, their hash browns are pretty delicious. ...OK, I guess those are all good reasons.

Basically Daybreak is for those days when you feel like having bacon and eggs but don't want to have to sacrifice the pancakes. Maybe you want a bit of everything. Maybe you're ravenous. This is the place to go. The food isn't phenomenal, but it does the job, and it's adequately cheap. Service is decent.

Also try and get a window seat in the summer -- GREAT people watching location. The fact that it's on Hooker Corner and in the middle of the gay village makes for some really interesting entertainment while you munch on breakfast."}
{"text":"Everything was very good with our experience except for the price.  What used to be the most economical meal of the day is no more.  Don't get me wrong, service & quality were very good but 2 people for breakfast $30 when it isn't haute cuisine is not my type of breakfast.  I remember when pancakes that come with all egg breakfasts used to be so big I think they were served on a separate plate and they were quite tiny now.  If you are not a price conscious breakfast goer this would be great for you."}
{"text":"I paused here during Pride to escape the rain, my hunger, and loud gay noises. Inside I met the worst omelette I've ever had. I suppose it was comeuppance for ordering something called \"Meat Lovers.\" 

Picture: an omelette wrapped like a taco around a kilo of shredded bacon, ham, and bashed up whole logs of sausage. I'm scarcely exaggerating. Does one not add these things to the omelette as it's cooking? Should not the meat be embedded in the fabric of my omelette -- not merely covering it up like a tea cozy? I don't think these are existential questions.

I had my yearly intake of sodium (and homosexuality) that day. I'll get something a little less meaty next time, and I'm hoping there isn't a 'next time.'

Obligatory Title Pun: Slam on the BREAKS.

Menu Readability: Can't remember. I was soaked and it was very gay outside.

Need to mention: My friends swear by this place, so YMMV.

What this place teaches me about myself: I never order the Meat Lovers' anything. What was I thinking that day?"}
{"text":"Three words. TOO MUCH FOOD.

Went here with my boyfriends family (1st time for all of us on). It was on Easter Sunday and we were practically the only people in the diner which is fine by me! 

My boyfriends mother and I both ordered the pancakes... We asked how big they were because both of us weren't extremely hungry. She said she'll tell them to short stack it... The plates came back and she said \"I guess this is the short stack.\" I wish she had told us more information so we could have just shared the dish because both of us left half of our pancakes on the plate. 

Also -- THREE EGGS for eggs benny? (My boyfriend got it.) That's a heart attack on a plate. The Hollandaise sauce is already rich but THREE EGGS complete with english muffins? That's a lot of food... Not to mention the pancakes that were also on the plate... which would have made a much better portion for me than the full stacked plate.

Anyway, I left feeling full and gross. Great way to start an Easter Sunday."}
