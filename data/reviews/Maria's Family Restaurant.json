{"text":"Our first visit to Maria's formerly Gee Gee and Papa's. The food was a slight downgrade from the previous owners. The place could use an update and a slight clean up. Our bench seats had sesame seeds and other bread debris on them. I was hoping for better when they reopened.  The food was bland. I had the breakfast bowl and there was not nearly enough sausage gravy on the meal, I was continually thirsty as I battled through the meal. The biscuits were spongy and did not seem fresh. The sausage patties were difficult to cut and felt like they had been microwaved after having been cooked at some point earlier in the day.  Not a bad place to eat but in order to survive they are going to need  to make some adjustments to atmosphere, cleanliness and menu to survive."}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop diner. Don't expect luxury or a fancy atmosphere, but still clean and comfortable. I come almost every Sunday for breakfast. Food is DELICIOUS. Coffee is hot. Service is prompt. Love little places like this. Try the greek omelet and french toast!"}
{"text":"OK....what prompted me to go in was the advertisement of the \"all you can eat salad bar\". I'm pretty much a vegan nowadays and I didn't want to do anything that evening so I thought, \"Why not?!\"   Being as I don't expect miracles, I kept my mind open going in..... I ordered the salad bar and the person opposite me ordered some kind of chicken dish. That chicken was so SAD-looking (dry and small and sad)!  I ventured to the salad bar to fulfill my hunger and was greeted by plates the size of saucer plates....the ingredients available were freshish and all that but most weren't even ingredients for a salad while obvious salad choices were missing. I felt like I had no options whatsoever as far as what I could eat. In summary, I ate a lot of lettuce and beets......   The waitress was EXTREMELY nice....not even fake or just REALLY good at being fake nice. I'll take it though. The middle-aged woman in high heels clamoring around the salad bar adjusting the ice almost every 5 minutes was REALLY annoying. I found myself waiting and waiting for her to leave as to go back for my next tongful of lettuce and beets.   For what we received and the quality of it, it was overpriced. Especially considering we were the only people in there that seemed to be under 60...possibly 70.   If you want Keno, the smell of impending death, and need a good cardio workout go to Maria's and order the salad bar.   If you just want to eat and do so in a good atmosphere, you'd be better off somewhere else. :("}
{"text":"Update:  The place is going back to its roots... breakfasts and lunches (for now).  I am a sucker for the homemade corned beef hash.  The hash browns are also always yummy.  Perfectly golden, and not overcooked, or burnt.  I've been to this place for breakfast both Saturdays and Sundays... always packed.  I noticed that they started serving a late night  breakfast buffet on Friday and Saturday nights.  Plenty of bar crowd around that should easily support that idea!  I will upload a photo next time of my meal...I always dig in too fast and think of it as I'm halfway through.  (Yeah, that would be appetizing!)    First of all... this is an incredibly ugly building.  The landlord really needs to do some updating here.  I mean seriously... really ugly.    On the positive side:  I've only eaten here for dinner, which is new here.  It has always been breakfast and lunch.  The dinners I've had so far are very good.  Everything has been homemade, and of good quality.  The menu is obviously in the middle of transition, and has an eclectic selection.  I highly recommend the grouper, of all things.  It is truly yummy, and I typically order a second one to go for lunch the next day.  On the other end of the spectrum is the wings.  I'd sell my sister for the wings.  Specifically, the garlic-parm wings are just delicious.  Perfectly cooked, and delicious hot or cold later on.    This is a new business, and it's obvious by the much needed decorating and ambiance needed here.  If they can work on those things, I think it will be successful.  I hope so, as I don't think I've enjoyed better grouper anywhere locally, especially for the price.  I'd rate higher if the ambiance was better, but again, for the price and the quality, I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times and this time I met with a friend. Unbeknownst to me, this guy is very persnickety about his toast and his coffee. The waitress was polite about it, though, which gets this place an extra star.   The service was fast, as usual, and they only overcook my eggs *sometimes.*   That said, the food is cheap and good for the price.  We sat there for over 90 minutes and my friend did card tricks during our time there. Nobody tried to rush us out or gave us nasty looks.   This place has the same quality food with better prices and faster service than Petie's down at Shoregate. If given a choice between the 2 I'd definitely go here."}
{"text":"Always great breakfast and coffee. Great service and love that they have keno. I recommend the breakfast Sandwiches or the meat skillet with gravy. The coffee cups are so cool if you add cream to it."}
{"text":"I like it here.  Mostly quiet. food is OK the ranch from the salad bar is home made and taste mostly of vinegar. So I bring my own"}
{"text":"Our Amanda was excellent and the food was just as good. Wasn't super busy for a Sunday but the staff was attentive and very pleasant. Will be coming back here for breakfast soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for lunch and the bacon cheeseburger was probably the best burger I ever had. Inside is old but comfortable and the staff was very friendly. from the time we were greeted at the door until we left. I will visit again"}
{"text":"My wife will never go here, so while she was out of town, I thought I'd try it.  Well, as I have said so often, my wife was right.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the place is ugly.  They don't do anything to help themselves inside either, as everything was...well...sticky.    I ordered an omelette.  How do you ruin an omelette?  It was awful.  The portions were huge, but when it tastes like crap, that just means there's more to throw away.    On top of bad food and lousy atmosphere, the service was horrendous. The trifecta.  I am only upset that Yelp forces me to give at least one star.  How do you give negative stars?  This place is bad!  I'm hoping I don't get sick!"}
{"text":"This is a greasy spoon! If you are expecting fine dining you are kidding yourself. That being said one the food is great when it is correct and you actually get what you order.   I come here semi regularly and it seems like every time some one always gets their meal brought to them incorrectly. The latest example was by the worst. There were eight of us and 5 of us got our food incorrect. We were missing extra breakfast meat on two plates, brought the wrong kind of toast. Brought toast with butter when we order dry. We had onions when we requested no onions and there was also no cheese when we asked for cheese . More the  half of us had our party had the wrong food. The waitress even brought it out and said hey this is wrong is that okay or do you want me to take it back. Stuff like this has happened almost every time I've been here.   The wait staff is nice and friendly but they either don't pay attention when taking orders and definitely don't pay attention to make sure that the food there bringing to the table is what was actually ordered or not which is actually part of their job so. That being said I would like to remind everybody that the food is pretty great just make sure that you're very clear when you order and you actually get what you want."}
{"text":"This is certainly a strange establishment. Went for breakfast. The food was average. It is kind of hard to screw up eggs. The decor. ..paneling and rickety booths, made the ambiance feel very dated. Service was....not so good. Waitress was a bit snippy with our group."}
{"text":"Very very affordable breakfast!   So mom and pop style!   The waffles are my fav....YUMMA.   If ur in that neighborhood and craving mom and pop style ...u gotta go!!!"}
{"text":"I hate i have to give a place a bad rating over eggs and bad services but this is the case here.   I was in town visiting my family and my sister suggested this diner for breakfast. We get there in order a grand slam meal that includes 2 eggs. She asked the typical question \"how would you like your eggs\" and my sister said boiled. The waitress leaves with the order and return to let us know that they do not have any eggs boiled. She offers to cook them a different way. My sister explains that she only eats her eggs boiled so cooking them a different way is not a solution  and ask if she can substitute them for something else. The waitress of course says no substitution.  We asked how do you have eggs but not boiled eggs - She explains that they usually do but the prep did not boil any eggs that morning so therefore they do not have any and again all she can do is cook them a different way - So I again I repeat \"she only eats her eggs boiled\" . The waitress then rudely replies \"That is not my fault she only eats boiled eggs\".  I then state \"and it is not our fault that you serve boil eggs but for whatever reason do no have them to serve therefore a substitution seems plausible in this instance\".  Again very rudely she replies \"Look there is nothing i can do for you\" and walks away. We just all look at each other in astonishment and get up and walk away. She yells out to us \"Bye have a great day\"  Two words : unprofessional and tacky"}
