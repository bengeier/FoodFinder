{"text":"There are a few vegan options here, and they are labelled clearly on the chalkboard near the cashier (though they don't always write everything they're serving on the board).   Service was friendly and quick, I ordered the sweet potato and rapini pie, which wasn't as tasty as the dish my friends ordered (the cauliflower and soy protein pie). They have a vegan cheesecake that is phenomenal.  It's a cozy little space, and there were a few other folks there when we walked in on Saturday, but it didn't feel too crowded.  I'll have to try their coffee next time."}
{"text":"I was seeing an old friend of mine who I haven't seen in a while, and when we decided to go for a healthy lunch, I suggested Mela Cafe after reading a number of good reviews.   The cozy and cute set up with the front window wall completely open was inviting. It could have been seeing my old friend sitting there that made my first impression of Mela Cafe very welcoming. We were hungry so without hesitation, we ordered right away. My friend ordered Lasagna and I ordered Sweet Potato with Rapini. I asked for a glass of water, but the server forgot to bring it. I was very engaged in catching up with my friend that this didn't bother me much. What was really disappointing for me was the food.   First I gotta say, their portion is more than generous. When I saw this dish through the glass display, it was about a bowl size, but when it was warmed up and brought out on a plate, it was huge. Happy with their generous portion, I started eating. Then I noticed this gelatin looking clear/yellow tinged goo separating either from the tomato sauce or the sweet potato, and just sitting on the bottom of the plate. Not a fan of gelatin or any slimy sticky gooey substance, it was not a pleasant sight for me. Then there is the flavour that needs to be discussed. Although the tomato sauce on top was delicious, the main mountainful of food had little to no flavour. Very few rapini in the dish was simply way too overcooked and the rest of the dish which was mashed sweet potato, was too stringy.     I wouldn't normally call $9 bucks expensive. But for stringy sweet potato with one or two overcooked rapini leaves?? Me thinks NOT again."}
{"text":"Small and cosy ambience. Sometimes the music (Italian, of course) is a bit too loud. Mostly simple Italian vegetarian items, a little on the carbohydrate-rich side, but quite good. The eggplant parmigiana panino is usually crispy and tasty and chewy and wonderful (my current favorite), but it has been variable.  Expresso is good.  Close to where I live, so I go fairly often. Havent tried the lasagne or cannelloni but they look yummy!  Opens out to the sidewalk in the summer, and looks out on a small park and the Yorkville library."}
{"text":"One of the most creative and authentic food places in the city. Whether you're vegetarian or not, what Roberto does with his always fresh and simple ingredients is inventive and satisfying. It's real food, made right there, from scratch. Great coffee, too. An absolute favourite."}
{"text":"The owners are charming, so is the place ... and oh the food! I go here almost everyday for their warm smiles and sumptuous plates."}
{"text":"One thing that I usually love about little places like this hidden place just off Yonge Street (where it's surprising you can hide anything) is their unabashed Europeanism.  And this place doesn't disappoint in this regard.  It's small (actually slightly cramped), it's homey, and the kitchen is in full view of the customers filled with happy \"chefs.\"  But the problem with this place is that it has certain other European aspects that are not so great.  First of all, the portions are very continental.  While my eggplant parmesan was rich and thick, it was a very small chunk.  Each bite was well mixed and the sauce was the star.  I could definitely see why they sell their sauce by itself for home use.  Heck, I would have bought a jar of it if I could legally transport it back to the states.  Still, at almost $9.00 (written out with commas of course) for what would be a lunch portion, I just couldn't totally get behind it.  My lady got a rice and vegetable dish of some sort which just seemed to be the sauce in huge amounts over some dried rice.  As I mentioned, the sauce was great but this dish tasted awful.  I also didn't like the European concept of not having everything that's on the board (despite choosing the entrees that day).  While I loved that they made fresh things, I would prefer to at least know what's available before I make a trek to a restaurant.  Maybe I'm too North American in that regard.  I don't know."}
{"text":"i love this place. i would eat here every day for lunch if i could afford it. the food is delicious and nourishing and so warmly prepared. i always go here when i'm stressed out because they really serve soul food here. it's the best soul food lunch in the neighbourhood. i always feel very welcome. in the summer, when all the tables are full, i take my plate out to the park and enjoy lunch there. roberto the owner is a sweetheart."}
{"text":"The food here is FAB! Their house-made tomato sauce is on everything, but it is sweet and delicious even without any garlic or onion. The owner is Italian and can be seen cooking away at the stove in the kitchen everyday. Great lunch take-away when you feel like you need a veggie boost. I like the mushroom,kale and potato pie. I think there's a bit of truffle oil in there too."}
{"text":"A delicious little Italian cafe with a great location, in Wanda's Pie in the Sky's old digs right off Yonge Street. At Mela you can grab a quick, nutritious vegetarian or vegan meal for dine in or take-out. Service is fast, as the food is all prepared in advance. Almost every dish comes smothered with a really nice tomato sauce that is piping hot and adds a nice touch to the meal but at the same time makes every dish look similar. They also have a nice selection of hot and cold drinks. I will definitely be back.  Update: Tried to return several times and it's never open. Not open weekends I guess?"}
{"text":"What a lovely, delicious surprise we found in this tiny cafe on Yorkville Ave.  Their secret weapon is killer tomato sauce; I knew the moment it hit my mouth that it rivalled my mom's, and that's saying a lot because I'm Italian:-)  A small side of greens to round out the meal (and the price) would be a nice touch. Otherwise, no complaints at all, and that's saying a lot !  Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   I love the wholesomeness vibe of this place. It's very tiny with a counter and an open kitchen space behind, so you can see what they are cooking up. When I walked in at lunch hour, you can see 1 person cutting up a zillion yellow peppers and another washing heirloom tomatoes. They have potted fresh herb plants and baskets of strawberries in the shop front. Clearly they source all their produce locally.  They have a daily menu board with 7-8 selections. Almost all of them were vegan and gluten free. Most things cost $8.08 (kind of random?) so came to just under a tenner with tax.  The food was really good, but it's quite a small portion size for $9.13! I tried the lasagna and it was a very small slice. Granted, it was really tasty, but it didn't come with anything else and wasn't really a complete lunch portion unless you are a 90lb vegan type. They should definitely at least add some kind of veg or green salad on the side if they are going to charge that much.  The service was super friendly and helpful at explaining what was on the menu. Only a few seats but a few outdoor tables which is nice in the summer."}
{"text":"I had a vegan eggplant parmagiana panini and although it was a little greasy, it reminded me of home (New England Italian food).  The place was closed for a catering event, but they let me order some take out. It was a nice and comforting surprise before I take back off to Los Angeles, where they don't have anything like this."}
