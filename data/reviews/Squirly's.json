{"text":"One of the worst servers I've ever had!!! I was there last night and was sitting on the patio. The server didn't even acknowledge we were there, she must have walked by us 9 times and didn't even make eye contact. I don't know who these people think they are?! We had to walk in and get service at the bar, not only that, she did it to another couple. I've been going there for years and I can assure you I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Squirly's for breakfast/brunch?

Why not?
This morning we were on our way to the Harlem Underground based on a Yelp review, for some brunch.  Along the way on Queen West, we passed by Squirly's and a sign outside read: \"You look like you could use some brunch\". and it was absolutely correct. we did. 

The special was poached eggs on toasted corn bread, with avocado slices and hollandaise sauce, with crispy bacon.  And it was quite delicious.  very buttery, but definitely hit the spot after a night of drinking.  And because I was with Dee (veggie), I got her bacon, so it was an obscene pile of pig on my plate. 

the coffee was a bit weak, but regardless, I was impressed that Squirly's, of all places, provided a delicious brunch.  Exactly what I wanted when we went out this morning."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Customer service is horrible and food quality is so inconsistent.
I've ordered from here a good 5 times or more (I work close to here).
I was disappointed when I received my chicken asiago and it looked super old, was missing the tomato and the lettuce and the salad was sooo little compared to other times I've ordered.

My friend also ordered a quesadilla and found a bread tag baked into her food. YUCKKK. That sealed the deal for me, I will never order from here ever again.

They need to be more hygienic, more friendly, and more damn consistent."}
{"text":"The service here is painfully slow. I wouldn't recommend coming here for food with an empty stomach. I tried the baked wings and I'm not a fan. Parts of the skin are soft rather than crispy. The 7 grain salad as well as the nachos are delicious, but not good enough for me to come back and go through the bad service all over again."}
{"text":"Service was slow, but the waitress didn't give us any attitude when we wanted the bill split 5 ways after she put everything on one bill. Had a pint of Wunder Weisse, which was delightful. The beer selection was quite impressive."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink with friends.  Chill crowd, great music, cheap drinks, decent food, funky back patio.  I always have fun there!"}
{"text":"Great place - totally relaxed and unpretentious.
Decent prices and my drinks were well made, which can be rare.
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Squirly's is one of those places that you'll probably miss if you're walking on the same side of the road. It's not somewhere you want to take a first date, but it's definitely great for a casual hang with your peeps. The painted animal print ceiling is begging for a repaint, the wall is crying for a chair rail and the bathroom would probably love to not smell like pee ... BUT ...

- The patio is great
- The service is great
- The food is delicious AND cheap
- The 7 grain salad is yum, as is the burger.

The end."}
{"text":"Nice people work there!

It feels cozy, it's true. It's a smaller place than most bars, but it doesn't feel crowded."}
{"text":"The food the drink the service. Excellent. However the diversity was in low attendance. I'm talking about the eyepatchless bartenders. However that does 't take away from the 5 star service just a friendly note for next time."}
{"text":"Simply love this place. Better food than expected, and the most grungy romantic back room you can find. Please don't come"}
{"text":"I don't know why I gave this dump a second chance. The slow service is legendary, and the hipster-er than though factor is practically a self-parody; \"Perhaps Monsieur would be more comfortable wearing these thick-rimmed glasses and porkpie hat?\"
This was a new low though... It was a beautiful Saturday at lunchtime and we wanted to sit on a patio. For some reason we had Squirrly's patio all to ourselves. We Ordered a pitcher of sangria (which was good) and we're pondering the sticky menus when the wind changed and the patio was filled with a hot rotten garbage smell blowing in from the alley. We retreated to the interior, but the stink saw blowing right through the place. A fitting end to our relationship with Squirrly's."}
{"text":"Went here on Thanksgiving as the last bar on our mini pub crawl. Great dive bar, we sat in the back and it was very cozy. It looked like the garage door could open on warmer days but it was a nice atmosphere for a Sunday night. Definitely recommended for a super chill bar."}
{"text":"Very strange and eclectic decor. The food was good and reasonable. Definitely better than your average pub fare. Stuffed chicken breast was moist and delicious. The pasta special with lamb was colourful and tasty. It was a worthwhile stop."}
{"text":"Why is it so difficult to order a simple drink in Toronto?

Well, I guess it's not too difficult to order a gin and tonic or rye and coke or draught beer. But, why is it so hard to get a bourbon and ginger with a splash of bitters? Seriously, first I have to explain that Jack Daniels is not bourbon, then I have to explain what bitters are...

Not so at Squirly's. There's a selection of bourbons! They have bar bitters. And the drink doesn't cost $10, less than half of that if my memory serves me correct.

The back patio is open all year, the regulars are good people and the food isn't going to win any awards, but who wants their local dive to win an award anyways? Grab brunch in the front window and watch as Queen West slowly steps out of bed."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving such a low rating to a place that I think is actually quite cute and cozy. 

Yes, they have very low prices that suited the pockets of a bunch of my unemployed friends. 

Yes, they have a small enclosed patio, which automatically warrants a thumbs up or high five.

But really, my visit to Squirly's last night was a downer.

The sangria was so bad. I know people joke about using bad wine to make sangria, but I didn't think a bar would actually do that!!? It was by and far the worst sangria I've ever had and I found myself cringing with each sip. 

Then there's the fact that our server was not paying much attention to us. One friend who arrived a little late had to ask for a menu not once, not twice, but THRICE. And each time, the server acted like it was her first time being told this. 

Another friend told us a story about how her server at Squirly's messed up on every aspect of their visit, from mixing up orders to charging extra on the bill. 

Maybe they need to hire more people so the servers don't get overwhelmed, or maybe they need to consider new talent. I won't steer my crowd this way in the future."}
{"text":"After my first Yelp event last night, I maintain my recommendation of Squirly's.  The Chicken Asiago sandwich with caramelized onions and 7 grain salad really hit the spot.  As always their draft beer selection has a healthy mix of micro brews with a local focus.  Unfortunately I didn't get the stellar service of Smokin' Hot Bryenne, but Bridget (I think her name was) did an outstanding job as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely pathetic service. While ordering my friend asked what was in the 7 grain salad and the host stood there with the most\" I hate my fucking job\" look slapped over all his stupid face and muttered \"7 grains\" To top it off they forget to even make what I ordered. No apology. Fuck you squirly's"}
{"text":"The low-fi simplicity of the place is comforting.  I hadn't been there for over 5 years and was pleased that it looked and felt exactly as I remembered it. After a few beers on the back patio with a friend, I pulled out my phone and read some yelp reviews of the place. Thanks for the tip about the wings - they were pretty good."}
{"text":"Definitely a dive bar, no doubt about that. Opening the door to the small interior space you get hit by a twinge of a smoky/funky smell, and small tables and chairs in a dimly lit place. While it may not be the most interesting space for a few brews, during the warmer months the back patio is a nice find in this part of Queen street. Not the biggest or most happening place in the city, that's for sure but if you want a reasonably priced drink and just hang out and chat with your friends, you could do worse."}
{"text":"The place is alright.  The back is dimly lit.  I'm not sure what vibe they are going for here, but kind of reminds of me of those prohibition/back-alley bars.  

The front section seemed a bit more lively and upscale, while the back section was intriguing, to say the least.  When you walk in, you see a sign that says \"wrestling\", so I thought that was strange and cool at the same time.  

As for the service, the waitress was very friendly.  In terms of food, I ordered the veggie burger (made it vegan by not adding mayo or cheese) which was made from tofu.  It wasn't fried, which is definitely a positive, but at the same time, I felt the patty was kind of dry.  It was okay.  I also got a side of soup and that was actually very delicious. 

Verdict: Good quiet bar hangout."}
{"text":"The waitress was super nice, very attentive and I loved the decorations out on the patio. I did order a salad but it was drained in oil which was very unfortunate."}
{"text":"It was reasonably priced. . . but I felt I wasn't ironic enough to return. It was a bit of a hipster-esque place. Not my thing. . .  if it's something that appeals to you, perhaps you'd like it!"}
{"text":"4.99 fresh salsa and chips
great staff
unpretentious ( rare for the area)
great vibe....
funky patio

i love this place"}
{"text":"Hands down, best chicken wings in Toronto. Squirrely's wings are big, juicy, and *grilled* (better than any you can find in Toronto, fried or otherwise)."}
{"text":"The Sunday special ($19 handmade pizza and a pitcher of beer) is something you can't pass up."}
{"text":"i go there when im on the west side, for the patio out back.  its cozy and loungey.  AND its open in the winter with and heated.  there's a decent selection of beer here but not wine.  and it is completely unpretentious.  you can expect simple bar/pub food - ive had the mediterranean tapas plate which has dips like hummous, feta dip, red pepper dip and the like.  But overall i dont think its their food that's attracts the locals.  its the vibe - kitschy, cheezy, lounge-lizardy, but good like your basement is good, good like you feel like you could chill out with a bong and some chips good (though you cant)."}
{"text":"i always enjoy my time when i go to squirly's.  It's very chill, and relaxed.
It is a pretty simple bar. It doesnt boast anything unique in terms of alcohol, but i wouldnt have expected it to anyway. 

Squirly's is a great little neighbourhood bar, and you wouldn't really expect it, but the food is f'n great. The menu is very reasonably priced, and I have been happy with my meal everytime.

The Staff are quite down-to-earth, and un-corporate, which is refreshing these days in toronto downtown.

I like to sit at the bar when i go to a bar/pub.  Generally, you get better service, and can meet all walks of life, however, Squirly's has a great little back patio in the summer if you want to get a table.

I gave it 4 stars as Squirly's is what it is. Nothing Special, but i don't think it tries to be.  It is fine being a solid, good little bar, with no frills."}
{"text":"I spent a lot of time on the back patio at Squirly's this summer, but after going there last night I finally decided to write a review. Quite simply, I really like Squirly's! 

Everyone is using the description of a dive bar like it's a bad thing, but for Squirly's it's actually quite the charming element and I wouldn't have it any other way. The interior and decor is interesting and aligns well with my passion for places with random stuff on the walls. And the food is actually pretty good. I've mostly had salads but have full intentions of having the butternut squash soup by winter's end as my friend swears by it and she is a trusted connoisseur of fine soups.  

I don't go to squirly's for anything fancy, rather just to hang out with my friends, drink standard jack and diets, and spend time surrounded by cool, like-minded people. It's a chill place with decent food and good drinks--one of those spots where you always run into someone you know. What more could you really ask for in a Queen Street West bar?"}
{"text":"Took some visiting family to Squirly's last Saturday night, since on previous occasions I've had a good time there and it's some of my friends' bar of choice.  On this occasion, however, I had the worst service I've encountered so far in Toronto.  Our waiter, who it turned out was also the bartender, attended our table of 8 people less than once per hour, and it would likely have been with less frequency if we hadn't occasionally gone to retrieve him ourselves.  I'm not sure if the problem was due to insufficient staff or sheer laziness, but I suggest if you do go here to abandon any expectations when it comes to service and make your drink orders at the bar."}
{"text":"I don't mind this place at all... I've been a handful of times and it's usually on their back patio with a pitcher of beer and maybe some Pad Thai. I've not tried much of their menu but I've been pretty pleased with whatever I've ordered. It's not expensive so that always works for me... Definitely a good place for drinks, maybe not dinner. But if you're hungry then you won't really be disappointed. It's pub food, you know?
Service is usually on point. Sometimes the music ranges from good hip-hop to terrible speed metal, but whatever. Staff is nice."}
{"text":"My review may possibly be skewed for 3 very simple reasons :
1. It was boiling sunny day an they had an empty patio that was shaded
2. I WAS STARVING and suffering from gut rot of morning ice coffee
3. I had great company.

INTERESTING DECOR - a bunch of great little pieces for a hut sorta theme- great stand alone pieces but maybe not so much together. I am a fan of written menu boards - particularly in chalk  so +1. Comfy looking chairs +1.
The menus were also interesting - I don't think I'm still OVER the cut out pictures of Buddha and random Asia-related pictures  that subbed for a menu cover, or the hand written Saturday menu.

The waitress was great - the water was always refilled, the food came promptly and she didn't ask us a zillion times if everything was okay that I would have to awkwardly try to respond ,\" yes, thank you.\"
It's quite possible she never came to check - I don't know - again , I was in great company so I didn't really notice and she brought me food while I was starving so I was ever so grateful.

ONE THING OF NOTE was that nothing had any - flavour to speak of. 
It was just bland and unseasoned, save the sausages which were unusually salty. Mind you, this could be a great feature so you can dress as you see fit...but I always feel like the home fries should have SOME seasoning - I dunno, do some shake'n' bake? but it was yummy still.

I will try it by myself one day and see if my review still stands the same."}
{"text":"What's my idea of a perfect lunch?  A gigantic sandwich made of fresh, thick slices of whole grain bread, with Brie, avocado and portobello mushrooms inside, and a side of mouth watering 7-grain salad, which doesn't cost extra.  All for under $10.  Plus a tasty orange peel ale to wash it all down ($5.25).  Fantastic!

That 7-grain salad is so good, and so hearty, I can't believe it was an included side for my sandwich.  I thought for sure only a garden greens salad would be acceptable without an extra charge.

The bathroom doors are so covered in graffiti that it's hard to make out which has the W and which has the M.  The women's is first... for future reference.  Being Toronto, the bathrooms are downstairs along a dimly lit hallway, past the last known pay phone, at the bottom of the stairs.  Despite my fears that it would be an unsavory bathroom experience, it was actually fairly clean.  Yay.

It was about 1:30 pm or so when my friend and I came in for lunch on a Friday, so the place was quite empty.  We were served promptly and the waitress was very nice and friendly.  I would be into coming here again next time I am in town.  Maybe when it is busier to get a real feel for the service."}
{"text":"I've been to Squirly's more times than I can count over the last 5 or so years. It is what it is. Slightly above a \"dive bar\", but you're also not going to find attendants in the bog handing you pieces of silk to wipe your arse with either.
 Set your expectations relatively low, and you'll be fine. The food has improved quite a bit over the years, but if you're expecting excellent wait-staff/service...you're probably going to be disappointed. The mood is relaxed, the banter from other patrons can get a bit irritating depending on the volume and the hipster-douchiness on any given night, but - it's a great place to go and unwind, or pre-wound-up for a night out.
 Set your expectations low..a bit lower...aaaaannnnd, yes. Hold it there."}
{"text":"Charming dive bar. Comfortable bar seats. Good beer on draft. Could use a larger draft selection. Music was good. It's got a good vibe about it. I like it."}
{"text":"Three rules: accept Visa, have a patio, serve cheap beer. Squirly's accomplished this without the twist of its tail. $5 CA Imperial Pints. Wingback velour love seats on a patio under a thatched roof. If I just huffed some lavender & dropped a Melatonin in my glass, let me know, but otherwise this is one relaxed reality. Sure, the service is relaxed too -- as in doing shots with pals and hanging out with friends on the patio. Honestly, if you don't like that, then settle down, it's not a big deal. Take in the fact that such a charming quiet environment where the server isn't a server, could be just a pal fetching pale ales for you . If you're looking for a quiet, desolate bar inside, it's there. If you're looking for a low key patio, it's there."}
{"text":"Great diver bar. Totally own it and they nail it. Cheap. Friendly but no BS staff. The food is cheap but great - the chef is so awesome he'll go out of his way to make your something personalized if you become a regular. Awesome spot for a cheap lunch or a post work beer with the colleagues. And great back room - super comfortable you feel like your in an old cozy basement."}
{"text":"Squirleys has bad customer service.  If you go there with this in mind, you will enjoy yourself.  It's just something I accept here without bitterness or holding a grudge.

I am specifically going to focus my review on the chicken wings at this dive.  They are AMAZING.  But they lose a star for not coming with veggies and dip.  The wings here are baked to a crispy outer layer of amazingness.  The sauce is excellent, and they are all around some of the best wings in the 416.

Here is my beef... they have veggies & dip on Tuesdays only.  Yes, that's right, Tuesdays only.  I have twice offered to pay more to have veggies and dip on another day of the week, and have twice been impolitely refused.  That right there (not the impolite part, that doesn't bother me at this establishment - the no veggies part) is negative one star.  If the wings weren't so good, I would probably minus 2 stars from this review because of the no veggies and dip business.

In summary, this place is exactly hat you think it is, except with better food and worse service.  A solid offering on Queen West."}
{"text":"Cool place. I got the wings and the mini burritos with a friend and caught up over a few beers. The inside is perfect for that -- a few small tables in the front area, then some larger ones on the back patio.

The back patio seems like the cooler place to be, but that's speaking figuratively, not literally -- the heating out back, while appreciated, was hugely out of control! It was like sitting too close to some kind of industrial equipment that was too hot. Or like how you might imagine the air felt in the steel factory at the end of Terminator 2. Or something like that - it was hot. We snagged a table at the front and felt a lot better.

I wasn't as happy with the wings as the other reviewers -- they were good. For \"medium spicy,\" they were pretty mild, save a few hotspots, and I'm a fan of a crispier wing, while Squirly's are baked + grilled, not fried or roasted, so you get a more tender but less crispy wing. The mini burritos were good, but pretty mini with a poor tortilla:filling ratio.

Beer was solid, with a lot of local microbrews and pretty reasonable (just under $5/pint) prices.

So: solid beer, decent space, okay food."}
{"text":"Squirly's has a great patio, with very warm heat lamps for when it gets cold.  Would I eat at Squirly's if I wasn't drinking - nope, but its just fine if you're having a few pints and want somewhat mediocre nachos. The back patio is a comfortable place to hang out, and the service is okay, a bit hit and miss. They have good beers on tap, including Great Lakes Orange Peel Ale."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a couple of years, probably, and couldn't remember that much about it, cuz when I went last week, it looked different than I had pictured in my head. In a good way.

I really love the heated patio, decorated with a sort of tiki-Asian fusion that kinda rocks. I had only been here for drinks in the past, but the food was great- I think it was the only time I have *ever* ordered soup in a restaurant in my life (so I guess I'm clearly no soup expert), and you should know that I loved it- Curried Squash, they called it. I also tried the chicken wings which were surprisingly delicious; very round and tender and some kick-ass blue cheese to dip it in. \"Authentic\", my friend called it, so maybe I should spell it \"bleu\".

The setting is likely to keep me coming back, same with the service which was prompt and friendly while managing to keep as cool as the Sufjan Stevens playing in the background."}
{"text":"Squirly's just feels so homey inside, it's hard not to love it. It's a bar/pub type place with a decent-sized interior and a huge patio that is heated in the winter! LOVE heated patios. Last time I was there it was decorated with all sorts of tiki crap -- yet again, how can you not love it? It's like when people had bars in their basements in the 80s (we had one...maybe this was not a common thing?). Basements = cozy, at least ones without water damage.

Anyway this place has average-priced booze, good selection, cheap food and a great atmosphere. When I used to work across the street, I ordered ahead and picked up sandwiches for lunch on super lazy student days when I put my whole day on Mastercard. Sandwiches were pretty delish, and I remember their wings being the biggest chicken wings I have ever seen in my life. Totally worth eating again. In fact, now that I remember how big they were, I will be going back to experience the heated patio and eat some oversize chickens very soon."}
{"text":"Squirly's was awesome. I enjoyed seeing the many black squirrels frolicking about in Toronto. I walked past Squirly's and decided to stop in for a beer. The interior was warm and inviting. The chairs were great to sit on. I met some interesting folks while hanging out at Squirly's and had some great conversations. Squirly's was a welcome change to the many bars that surround it."}
{"text":"Hostess not attentive. She seemed miserable to be there. Mumbles when I asked what the specials were. Gave a sample and said \"if you want something light, this is NOT for you\"  how about you let me sample something in the flavor I was looking for!?! 

Did not check out the patio, didn't want to after meeting the hostess."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab lunch or an after work drink. Very casual (dive) atmosphere, laid back and friendly staff. Delicious food (pasta!) at a great value. Burritos are good, could use some more guac (although i think that's true everywhere)"}
{"text":"Geh. Service lowlights include being told 'nah' when asking if I could have the burritos without beef, and being ignored for 45 minutes. I might have been more amenable to the shabby treatment if I was seated on the patio, but I was relegated to the dark and gloomy interior. Thumbs down for me. (I've heard people I trust give rave reviews.  I'll have to give them a second chance.)

Obligatory Title Pun: Service is definitely SQUIRLY.

Menu Readability: Dingy and uninteresting.

Need to mention: The patio does look pretty enchanting.

What this place teaches me about myself: A seat on the patio heals all wounds."}
{"text":"Consider me an official fan of Squirly's - I love their heated back patio area and the fact that they don't bust my balls about ordering wine in a pint glass. 

The service is pretty good and attentive and apparently there's also a rockin' food menu that I had never even considered ordering from? Who knew! Looking forward to some dinner sometime soon, if I can tear myself away from the tap!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! My friend and I split the  nightly special.. a pound or wings, ribs, pirogies and a garden salad with two pints of beer and the bill came to $30. The food quality was really good for the price and the service was fast. The atmosphere was typical Queen Street bar. I would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Look for the traffic light in the window, and regardless of what colour is showing, be sure to stop if you are in the mood for a patio and some cheap brews.

I am pretty obsessed with their covered patio draped in red velvet couches and mismatched tables. They also have an uncovered smoking patio and all the green plastic crap you can handle. 

I have been here five or six times, yet have never had anything to eat. I've had, however, enjoyed many $6 pints and I think once there was a shot of whiskey, but I can't really remember...

PEPPER POINTS for the kindest staff on Queen W. No pretentious hipster crap, just nice folks fraternizing with their patrons."}
{"text":"I love the food from here. Most favorite dish? Seven grain salad with chicken is to DIE FOR. So good. Seriously. Working on Queen West there are TONS of food options. But whenever I want something a little more healthy and hearty, I'll opt for the seven grain salad here. I've had a couple other dishes here and have yet to be disappointed for the price point. You definitely get what you pay for. 

Check em out!"}
{"text":"This place sucked the waitress was on her phone the whole time so we didn't get refills on our drinks my burger came out still mooing asked for another in the time it took for another to be prepared my girlfriend ate her meal and we sat for 10 minutes at that point I told my girlfriend if they take 5 more minutes we are leaving ........ WE LEFT. 
Terrible place terrible service and I still had to find lunch elsewhere."}
