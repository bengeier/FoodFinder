{"text":"This was the first time we dined here since the new ownership. I was a little skeptical because of  previous experiences here. But, being a local, I felt like I should give them a try. I was hoping it would be a new dining out option for Harrisburg.  We arrived on a Friday evening and was greeted by the bar tender. I do feel like there should be a host/hostess at the front to greet patrons and seat them right away when possible. There were a few groups in the dining room. The atmosphere was fine.  The waitress came over right away and was helpful and attentive during our meal. The food came within a reasonable amount of time and was good, with the exception of the baked potato. I am hopi that Main Street Grill will continue improving."}
{"text":"Someone please help this owner get his act together!! I don't want another failed business in Harrisburg, but he just does not get it!! I was at a Wine Tasting next door and ordered a couple of apps. A cheese platter, a steak sandwich for my friend and some wings, 45 min later, nothing! a cheese platter, really?? We finally got cold food at the end of the tasting. When you walk in there, the girl that works there spends more time chatting on her cell phone than helping out the customers. I actually felt Plate did better. At least he had a menu posted. I complained to the Winedown owner about it. The wine tasting was nice, the food----not so good. and no celery with the wings, just blue cheese dressing!! Unbelievable!! It takes time and a lot of work to make a restaurant successful. I think this guy needs to employ some serious help!!!, and get out of the kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are awesome. They aren't listed in the dinner menu, but you can ask for a lunch menu at dinner time. The meat is ground in house, so you can have it cooked as rare as you like. My jalape√±o cheddar burger was perfectly cooked, juicy, and spicy. The pretzel bites are pretty fabulous, too."}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars, I would.  This is the former Plate/Main Street Steak and Seafood reformed under new ownership and management.  730p on a Thursday night.  We were alone in the dining room.  As in alone.  As in no one else showed up the entire time we were there.  Filthy carpet with stains and pulls.  Dirty vinyl tablecloths.  Ants in the window.  Why did we stay?  We try to support local business!  Pretzel bites for appetizer.  Straight out of the microwave.  Hubby had fish tacos which were really fishy.  I had ribs.  And i have never, before tonight, failed to finish a rack of ribs.  The ribs were freezer-burned.  So tough i couldn't gnaw off the bone.  I gave up.   The waitress was so nice and apologetic and i hate that she will be unemployed shortly."}
