{"text":"First, the owner is not customer friendly, she did not seem to care at all. Second, the prices are outrageous, $3.10 for a donut and $4.50 for a pizza bun which were good but nothing exceptional...Not impress at all...Will not go back..."}
{"text":"We randomly found this vegan bakery while driving from downtown. We were not disappointed. The service was excellent. Although the menu is limited the food is delicious. I haven't had a donut in years since changing my diet. Amazing! 

There isn't much in the way of seating. So it's a better spot to pick up lunch and go. Would really recommend stopping in and grabbing a bite to eat."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I was pretty unimpressed with the staff.

I called about making a special order. They wouldn't take my credit card over the phone. They said I could come in within 1-2 days to make the order in person.

I travelled across the city to get there, only to have them refuse to take my order.

So unless you're in the area, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Not yet Through Being Cool. The food was great but the customer service was pretty awful. The cashier basically ignored me.  When I requested a doughnut, he mumbled incoherently and was just generally aloof. Seemed very uninterested in serving me. He didn't even tell how much I owed him. The atmosphere just felt very stuck up."}
{"text":"Food was good, we had a cinnamon roll donut and a berry scone with coffee. They were both fresh and delicious. However, there wasn't any seating for us to enjoy our snacks :(
The staff were less than impressed with most people who came in. When asked about the different types of baked goods, they would point to a somewhat hidden sign and claim, \"They're all there.\" 
Not even a smile! We felt like we were getting in their way just for being in the store. I guess these people really are \"Through being cool\"
I guess if you're not staying in to eat, (cause you can't) this place is alright. I don't think I'll go back tho because I like to feel welcome in the morning when I get my coffee."}
{"text":"This place is a dream for a girl with a dairy allergy. I came here on my birthday and there were so many options! Their donuts are delicious. I will definitely be back to try them all!! Also the service was super friendly :) See you again soon"}
{"text":"I can attest to their wonderful customer service as the woman at the cash was welcoming, and helpful.

The doughnuts are A+ in appearance as well as taste. I'd enjoy more salt in their scones, but otherwise they are also a delight. 

As a helpful word I suggest the owner/manager add a list of retail cost which corresponds with the huge selection of preserves. Not everyone can enjoy a whimsical, budget-free lifestyle. Make it easy for customers to purchase your goods by informing them of the price."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have bought many, so many things here, and they have all been excellent as long as I kept them fresh! The doughnuts do not age well, I left one out for a day and was disappointed. So don't do that, and your experience will be excellent. Highly recommend their doughnuts if you like a yeasty puffy one as opposed to a cakey one (I know the jury is split on that). If not, go for the lemon square if they have it! Or pizza buns, or ginger molasses cookie, or... I could go on."}
{"text":"This bakery couldn't have opened soon enough

Vegan baked goods have been sorely lacking in this city until now. Infact, a quality independent bakery of any kind has been missing. 

Amazing baked goods, solid coffee, good vibes. 

Sure. The donuts cost more than your POS Tim's donut, but the two aren't even on the same playing field. Lets be real; for a delicious, fresh-out-of-the-oven baked good from an independently owned bakery, the asking price is more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Delicious doughnuts, but the customer service needs improvement. A while ago, I stopped there on the way to work to find the place closed. They had a sign up stating this but nothing on their facebook or Twitter page. I messaged them to complain and they never replied. Now when I'm in that area, I visit Bloomers instead."}
{"text":"For my first visit here, I split two different doughnuts with my friend. The first was peanut butter - the glaze was very good. The second was the crunchie doughnut - we found that it lacked flavour. Overall we were disappointed with the doughnuts and found them too doughy. Neither of us was able to finish a whole doughnut, because it got to be too much greasy dough. 

The costumer service was very good. The girl who was working there was very friendly and helpful. We wish there had been more room to sit and enjoy the food there!

I would like to go back to TBC to try their frozen selections, however I will not be going back for a doughnut."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a vegan bakery and I was very pleased! The girl at the front was very friendly & everything just looked delicious! My boyfriend and I got 3 different doughnuts plus a brownie and after we finished it all we wanted to go back for more lol!"}
{"text":"I don't really like their donuts or vegan sandwiches, but their fruit tarts and pizza buns are always solid. Also, they have a decent frozen foods section if you need a last-minute prepared meal -- I'm a fan of the vegan Shepard's pie."}
{"text":"Good donuts,... huge donuts!  a bit greasy but still pretty good. If you are lucky enough to stop by when they have their giant pretzels definitely grab one!!"}
{"text":"Have just returned from Through Being Cool. Guy behind the counter was warm and charming. I had the Manhattan doughnut, which is modelled after the boozy cocktail, and it's delicious: a hint of orange, a nice glaze, a perfect interior. And it's only three bucks for an artisanal doughnut.  It does the drink justice. I'll be back real soon!"}
{"text":"TBC offers yummy vegan fare and extras like picked goods and condiments. However, the service is appallingly slow."}
{"text":"We visit this place all the time. The hours are a bit all over the place and once they run out... they are out. Here on a random sunday and they have an impromptu flea market going on! Would recommend the vegan cookies, or one of their doughnuts..."}
{"text":"This is a really cute place, I love that they have ready made frozen meals and canned spreads/pickled vegetables. I've been here a few times but I haven't tried any of those. 

What I did have, yesterday, was a Widower sandwich - in the style of a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. And I got the first post-meal exhaustion and next day diarrhea that I've experienced since going vegan a couple of months ago. The sandwich was pretty good, a little heavy on the black pepper but otherwise convincing. I like vegan junk food and I'm glad this exists but because of my...digestion issues...I will probably never have it again. 

Desserts! In the past I've had a donut ($3), a chocolate chip cookie (~$3). Yesterday I picked up a $4.25 brownie. They all looked amazing. They were all *very* disappointing. No diarrhea with the desserts but the cookie seemed stale, hard throughout and salvaged only by dipping it in my coffee for moisture. The donut, apple bourbon I believe it was, had tasty icing. The donut is massive which seems to justify the price tag but it's dense, tough, dry, and tasteless. I think making a much smaller donut with a more balanced icing to donut ratio would be a huge improvement. I tried to keep eating the donut and brownie because I had invested so much money and hope into both of them and I'm not one to give up easily but ultimately both had to be discarded, unfinished. 

Customer service was OK. 

There's another vegan place across the street that I frequent, sandwiches are simple, cheap(er), and tasty. Desserts are always delicious. Customer service is always excellent.

EDIT: Out of desperation ate my boyfriend's half-eaten sandwich that I left out on the counter overnight for breakfast and it was still pretty good. +1 star."}
{"text":"Made a 30 minute trek in the snow specifically to try TBC's famous baked fare.

I came after 3pm on a Saturday so the case was half empty (my fault, popular place!) I tried their pretzel and their gingerbread cookies - both fantastic. I can't wait to get back in to try their pizza buns and a donut. Their bread looks excellent too.

My only complaint - the girl who served me was pretty unfriendly and wasn't interested in making any suggestions. Maybe she was hungover from the night before."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience...horrible coffee lids, make sure you grab lots of napkins. On a positive note the coffee is decent with an expensive donut. It would be nice to sit down as well."}
{"text":"Okay. I love supporting small independent bakeries and shops which might make me a bit biased when it comes to loving the little guys. I have been here quite a few times. Their meal type foods like sandwiches and tacos and pizza buns are awesome, flavourful, and definitely rated a 4/5. I don't think the bakery has nailed their donuts yet. The donuts that are filled with creams and puddings and custards are amazing because the dough is evened out with the sauciness... The donuts without filling are VERY dense and doughy, I mean, for a bread-loving weirdo like me I actually kind of like them but I totally get why their is a ton of donut haterade happening in most of the other reviews. Get the jelly filled donut and you won't regret it, or the tacos or the pizza buns. Mmmmmmmmmmmm. I love them. I mean, vegan too! Woop woop... and they always have cool dinner sauces and spreads in the fridge too."}
{"text":"I stopped by here the other day - it caught my eye because I noticed it was vegan and I'm very into vegan alternatives. I grabbed a latte and a coconut pecan square which was DE-LISH! The gentleman that helped me out was very kind and friendly as well. Great service. It's always nice to see vegan shops and restaurants around, I will definitely come back to this place for another drink and snack and would love to try some of their lunch items as well."}
{"text":"I have to echo what many others have already pointed out, this place's name betrays who they really are, they claim to be  \"through with being cool\" but thats all this place is about, posers and snotty stuck up counter staff who think they are too cool to serve you, but will if they have to... ugh.. Anyway,  tried their crunch wrap which was pretty good, nothing spectacular by any means, nothing i'd go out of my way to get again, it was just merely ok. This place seems to have a lot of hype but i honestly fail to see why, i mean it's decent, but it's nothing mindblowing, there are many shops in the city that do a better job . I've also had their donuts several times and each time i find them just way too dense and doughy, almost not fully cooked. and reading the reviews here, this seems to be a theme here as there are many, many reviews that are saying relatively the same thing about their donuts too. They are flavourful but just way too heavy and dense for me, Bloomers does a way better vegan donut and pretty much anything else thats baked lol., light, fluffy and super tasty, almost exactly like the non vegan kind. Creatively TBC are the right track, but their execution leaves a lot to be desired. So in a nutshell if you want really dense and undercooked donuts that look good, or want to be treated poorly by rude hipster poseur staff, then you have found your place! if you want good vegan baked goods with no attitude, there there are a ton of other places deserving of your money... this place does not. stay away...  (updated)"}
{"text":"I'm sincerely disappointed with the pizza buns i purchased. They were raw in the middle! Additionally, the service was slow and unwelcoming. I expected a little more than that. Come on, guys. 
I recommend going elsewhere like bloomers to your vegan fix."}
{"text":"I rate 10/10 for the \"chicken\" caesar wrap. The sauce was just salty and flavorful enough for me. The \"chicken\" seitan was breaded and soft on the inside while the croutons added a crunch to the wrap that I enjoyed very much. The iceberg lettuce was refreshing and light which further enhanced the wrap. The \"bacon\" coconut chips added the finishing taste of a truly delicious wrap. Foods in tortilla cannot go wrong in my opinion. The chips that came with the wrap is made at the restaurant I was told. I enjoyed eating the chips. I highly recommend visiting Through Being Cool!"}
{"text":"I really really really want to give TBC 5 stars, and if I was reviewing the baked goods alone I would without a single doubt. But guys, PLEASE, PLEAAAAAAASSEEE, make a better seating area! I beg you! There is so much poorly used space in this bakery and the few little seats are always full. Even two little tables, no matter how rickety, would suffice. I travel a good distance for their incredible vegan croissants and sometimes wish I could just sit and eat one right there and there with a nice coffee or one of their house-made sodas. However, I usually have to resort to eating it outside or dragging my goodies home as they get cold and soggy during TTC travel time. I have yet to try their sandwiches for this reason..there is just nowhere I can sit and enjoy one. This especially sucks on a cold snowy or very rainy day. 
 Anyways, enough of my whining. The staff is great and everything there is just so delicious. The donuts are huge and the flavour selection is overwhelming. The croissants are my favourite as well as the different kinds of pizza rolls. It's hard to pick just one thing because nothing ever disappoints. The prices are also very reasonable for handmade quality vegan baked goods."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review because I LOVE supporting veg-friendly and vegan businesses... but I have visited TBC several times and each time I wonder why I even bother. Firstly, the baked goods are very oily; the taste of this greasiness is overwhelming. Second, the customer service here really leaves something to be desired. I don't need somebody to kiss my ass when I walk in, but even a smile or polite nod and a hello, would be much appreciated. Usually I walk in and the counter is unattended... then somebody comes out and seems annoyed that I'm there. Now lastly, this is just an observation, but with such a large space, there ought to be some seating. Perhaps this will help foster some congeniality between patrons and staff."}
{"text":"I'm nursing and my kid is severely allergic to soy and dairy. So when I want baked goods, I'm forced to go vegan. I thought I'd try this place. I order 4 doughnuts and as the lady is cashing me through I ask 'oh shit is there soy in these'. The owner/manager/whoever walked by and barked 'there's soy in everything. No refunds because the donuts are in the box'. I was shocked. The box was sealed and still on their side of the counter!  When I explained I had a soy allergy, she didn't care and shrugged her shoulders. Rude. Who knows if the doughnuts are good - but for customer service - ick.  I gave the doughnuts to the next person in line."}
{"text":"I loooove their donuts. The peanut butter filled one with chocolate glaze is the best ever and I still have dreams about it. I had a chocolate donut once, and that was disappointing, but their other baked goods (cookies & squares) have also been delish, so it may just have been that donut!"}
{"text":"Oh, I just giiive 5 stars to every place that's vegan, right? Wrong! I give 5 stars to places that are vegan, awesome, AND have *#%$ing donuts.

If you know me well, you'll know that whenever the discussion of what Toronto lacks comes up, I talk about two things: bike lanes and vegan donuts. 

Other than the par excellence vegan and gf Homer Simpson-style cake donuts produced by Tori's Bakeshop in the Beaches, there was no one place you could go to any day of the week and buy a vegan donut in this city. Nadda one!

Toronto being the unhip brother to NYC, SF, Austin, and Portland, means that when someone opens a hipster donut shop here, not only does it pale to it's southern neighbours but it never has any vegan offerings. Just tired old bacon, which has been played out so many times I'm starting to wonder how much the pork industry is paying people to make their Twitter bio about it. 

The problem with Tori's is that if you live anywhere other than the Beach, you're unlikely to get one of those donuts before they sell out (roughly 2pm people). Bunner's decided to only make donuts on Saturdays (which makes me sad), Snakes & Lattes let go their best vegan donut girl and espresso guy, so they're dead to me, Urban Herbivore discontinued their vegan donut after a month, and Sadie's gets a very bready tasting donut delivered from, get this, St. Catherine's every Thursday at like 2pm, which is way too late for donut-coffee-newspaper (digital, of course) business like I was taught by Lady & the Tramp.

Toronto is so hard up for vegan donuts that we have to import them from St. Catherine's of all places? Hot Beans got rid of their boston creams and I actually haven't set foot inside the place since. The owner even messaged me to have me remove my photo of them, like they never existed!

Well, this is where my griping and donut dearth ends forever, hopefully! In comes Through Being Cool (named for Save's the Day, not Devo) and in Bloordale no less, an accessible neighbourhood to people that are not millionaires, where the rent is still low, but things are looking up. 

They're selling frozen pierogies stuffed with potato and cheddar, or mushroom and sauerkraut, pot pies, enchiladas, and ravioli with tvp or ricotta. Gluten-free mac 'n cheese in the fridge, and fresh baked pizza buns, pretzels, (if you're lucky) pretzel dogs (if you're luckier), cupcakes, brownies, scones, cookies, preserves, pickles, dog treats, coffee and did I $%^ing mention the donuts? God. damn. vegan. donuts. And they're fried, not baked. 

I didn't become a vegan, because I have an allergy or I'm a health nut. Finally, there's an amazing vegan bakery that practically oozes sugar and wheat! Thank you donut gawds for smiling upon me!

Update: I was the very first to debit machine. There is one now, but it's more important that you know that I won that race."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Toronto, my family and I visited TBC on the recommendation of our waitress at Hogtown.  I do not have the words necessary to describe how pleased we were with our experience.  We're disgusting eaters----  Ordered espresso, chocolate mint, maple, boston cream, and sprinkle doughunts; an apple fritter; two croissants; a pizza roll; and a cinnamon bun.  For the love of God--- everything was amazing!  It's been well over sixteen years since I enjoyed a croissant---  these were INCREDIBLE.  Everything was so delightful that we planned a second visit on our way back from a trip up north.  On our second visit, we arrived just minutes before closing and there were slim pickings left.  We had a blueberry pastry and a mimosa doughnut.  I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the mimosa doughnut was.  regret only buying on of them.  The only downside (because there's almost always a downside) was that the service left a bit to be desired.  The folks working here would have passed as more than okay in the States...  But compared with all of the other delightful Canadians that we encountered on our visit, they were a bit glum."}
{"text":"I had a serious donut craving so I had to stop by this place after seeing all the Instagram posts of their donuts. I decided to drive down, but was able to easily find parking in the Green P lot right beside Landsdowne station, there was also street parking right outside the bakery, but no one wants to deal with that, right?

Their selection of donuts changes regularly. I got their Boston cream and pumpkin donut. The Boston cream had a tofu/soy-based vanilla pudding filling, which wasn't overwhelming sweet and it had a rich dark chocolate coating. The pumpkin donut was just a regular glaze with pumpkin pie flavouring. The Boston cream was by far my favourite. Their donuts are incredibly satisfying and are definitely worth trying regardless if you're vegan or not. 

They also sell some savoury offerings both hot and cold. They have a fridge full of prepared items like vegan cheeses, pies, etc. Their cheeses are made by ladyship and all appeared to be nut based. They are a bit pricey at $10 per tub, but they're great because they don't have outrageous additives."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the neighbourhood. I'm not even a vegetarian but I really liked their take home frozen lasagna. Cupcakes were also pretty solid (that's solid like the kids say not solid like most other vegan baked goods), the cake tasted great and the frosting was perfect. Their soy misto Americano will also make TBC the only other place I get a coffee on the strip if I don't hit the Common. Looking forward to trying other things here."}
{"text":"I feel badly writing a mediocre review but if I were hunting for good gourmet doughnuts in Toronto, I would want to know this stuff before making my way to Landsdown. 

I went to TBC a coupe of days ago and I went for the doughnuts. They looked very nice, huge actually (too huge) and there were so many kinds to choose from so I asked for some recommendations from the lady working there. I picked up 4 doughnuts which I shared with some people I was able to try all 4 kinds. 

The lady recommended the apple bourbon doughnut which was the first one I tried. Since it was her personal recommendation, I had high expectations... I do NOT get it. It was too big, super squishy with way too much dough and it was filled with a completely unexciting apple sauce. I got no bourbon flavour. The only thing good about it was the candy on top. I did not enjoy it and didn't finish my piece.. 

Next, I had a bite of the eggnog (seasonal obviously) doughnut. It was really not good.  The spices did not work at all and there was something actually kind of gross about it. Again it was also really doughy and not enjoyable. I didn't finish my piece of this one either. 

I did not like the cream filling in the Boston Cream at all and it was the same too squishy giant dough ball that I didn't enjoy. 

The berry one I tried was the best of the 4. The icing was nice so I ate the top and tossed out the doughnut. 

I'm so sorry, I like to support small businesses and it's cool that the bakery is vegan, but I just didn't like what I tried at all. I've had great vegan baked good from Bunners and Tori's so it's certainly possible. If I do go back to TBC, I'll try something other than a doughnut but I'm not really planning to go back."}
{"text":"Got a grapefruit eucalyptus popsicle and was pretty grossed out by it -and I actually like both those flavours! It tasted like it had way too much sugar to make up for the assertive ingredients. I also grabbed a scone for my mom which ended up being raw in the middle. It's also kind of a bummer that they don't do anything gluten-free but I guess that's too \"cool\" lol but hat being said the popsicle was all I could get for myself"}
{"text":"Their selection of baked goods is really awesome and their sandwiches are really yummy but the customer service is definitely lacking. There are some friendly employees but majority of them are not very personalable."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast burrito!!!!


Filling burrito, Large burrito for the price, (they make yummy but much much much smaller burritos at vegan D-beatstro across the street). Here you will have enough food for lunch and an afternoon snack. Veeery filling. Did I say yummy? Nice chill vibe at the place, can't wait to try their doughnuts someday! Looks delicious. Yummy AND vegan brag rights? Taaaasty. Puuuuuuurfect."}
{"text":"Vegan bakeries are generally few and far between so I was really excited to check this place out; unfortunately, it fell below my expectations.

I can confirm that the doughnuts do indeed look as amazing in person as they do in pictures, but they were sorely lacking in taste. While the texture and moisture levels were pretty on point, they honestly just tasted bland and my boyfriend and I quickly got tired of eating them. The rocky road cookie however, was amazing; it was soft and chewy with just the right amount of marshmallows and (perfectly toasted) almonds.

Verdict: 2/5 for doughnuts and 4/5 for cookies; would definitely recommend going for the cookies instead of the doughnuts."}
{"text":"awesome assortment of massive donuts- I had the boston creme and chocolate coconut. both very rich and sickly, but in a good way! I also got a pizza roll which was insane- really cheesy and a little bit garlicky- either way it was perfect and one of my new favourite treats. the display cabinet was full of all kinds of things- huge cookies, cinnamon rolls, etc. I also got a homemade cream soda which was lovely! totally worth the 45 minute walk."}
{"text":"Very expensive/pricey, food is good. I bought a focaccia a butter tart and an apple fritter. You may want to consider letting your butter tarts to set before you sell them as the filling was still in a liquid form and ended up coating the inside of the paper bag, or at least tell your customers, that was a real waste considering how much it cost. You also may want to get some bread bags (you are a bakery) didn't expect to have to walk home with a cake box for the focaccia that is a real waste, a paper bag would have been fine. i know they exist (look into it) other bakeries use them!"}
{"text":"I've had a handful of vegan meals in the past and Through Being Cool is by far the best at providing delicious vegan meals where you aren't even aware it's vegan. On a Saturday afternoon, we found ourselves in the Landsdowne area searching for a quick bite to eat and stumbled upon this gem. We shared the Chickun Parm ($10) and a lemon filled donut from their impressive glass display. 

The chickun parm was absolutely delicious. The crispy breaded seitan was hot and crunchy, doused in a tarte tomato sauce with melted cheeze on top. The addition of the pesto give it an extra boost of flavor. The sandwich was sizable - as in I could only eat half before I was full. It also came with a side of popcorn!!  Which was delightful and cute.

The lemon filled donut for dessert was the best!! Plenty of creamy tart lemon filling encased in a soft buttery dough. It was tangy and sweet, the perfect way to end the meal.

The only real downside is that there isn't alot of seating, so expect to stand at the counter or share seating with other patrons. Worth it though. I loved it here!!"}
{"text":"My FAVOURITE vegan bakery in Toronto. I love all of their baked pastries and desserts. Favourites are the sprinkle and chocolate dip donut (basic, I know), the pizza bun, and the sugar cookie with sprinkles. All amazing. And the fact that they're vegan makes them so much better somehow. But you can't tell that they're vegan as you usually can with a lot of vegan foods. Love this place, always come back for more even though it's located so far from me. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"My friends are vegans and brought me here. I lived in Davenport for years and never made it. What a numptie I am. I was always attracted by the name (hello, Saves the Day fan here!) and they love the raised donuts. 

For nine bucks I picked up an enormous blueberry scone, a chocolate coconut donut and a pretzel - treats for days. The pretzel in particular was amazing. Decor is thoughtful vintage with gorgeous window seating at the front of the shop. They also sell lots of frozen vegan eats, zines, too cool for school stickers and wait for it, Anchor Coffee all the way from Dartmouth, NS. 

This place is a winner through and through."}
{"text":"Hm... the last time I had their doughnuts it was pretty disappointing. Didn't taste fresh and the flavoured doughnuts (e.g., Earl Grey) had zero flavour!

To top it off, there have been a few people (long time vegans) who have consistently received terrible service. I'll stick to Tori's in the east end instead, or go to D-Beatstro across the street. I hear they have great baked goods and that they are very friendly!"}
{"text":"Oh TBC how I love thee.  

This spot is a weekend ritual for my bf who is not vegetarian at all, and myself, a vegan.  I have eaten most things found in their glass case of deliciousness, but the most underrated TBC menu items?  Their sandwiches!  When Bf first tried the Widowmaker a few months back, he had to take a moment of pause before exclaiming \"This is the best sandwich I've ever had!\".  Not the best VEGAN sandwich he'd ever had, but the best sandwich, period.  For starters, the bread is amazing; a mini baguette for most options, a round bun for some.  We've asked if they sell it before and were told it was possible if we called in a day ahead.  The Widowmaker features juicy seitan pieces with a mix of sweet & savoury flavours.  I usually go for the Buffalo \"Chicken\" sandwich which is equally delicious.  Really, any of the regular options and the rotating specials are winners.  The ingredients are always fresh, the sauces and seasoning on point, and because it's all vegan, your belly won't feel heavy and beg you to take a nap afterward!

Other favourites: Caramel-Apple Crumble Tart, Pretzels, Pizza Buns, Apple Fritters and the changing cast of limited time doughnuts.  The one's we picked up this past weekend were among the best: Vanilla Bean, Key Lime Pie (with filling) and Peach Filled (with powdered sugar on top).  As other reviewers have mentioned, most of the doughnuts here are dense monsters, they carry some weight when picked up.  So, if that's not your thing, maybe choose something else.  

The staff have always been friendly, the kind who remember you when you come back.  The only thing that's stopping me from giving 5 stars is the lack of comfortable seating/tables to eat at.  The space is massive and with a little reorganization there's more than enough room to accommodate a dining area up front."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  I crave this place everyday.  Their donuts taste JUST LIKE the home-made donuts my grandma used to make.  Try the sprinkle donut.  I've ventured into their pizza rolls and frozen dinners which are equally good,  I highly recommend their lasagna and enchiladas."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous. Every time I go back they've got an even bigger selection of delicious looking treats to choose from!

I highly recommend checking out this bakery. Just an endless array of yummy treats that like a unique and healthy spin on the non-vegan versions of them. I honestly can't speak more highly of this place. I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Donuts that feel like a kiss from an angel--if angels existed in the shape of a pastry"}
{"text":"We came to Toronto in search of the best vegan bakery, and we're pretty sure we found it.

The pain au chocolat/chocolate croissant was excellent, with a crispy outside and good lamination in the middle (see, watching all that Great British Bakeoff has finally paid off!). The chocolate chip cookie was delicious, not to mention huge. 

We were so impressed with the sweets that we got a couple of sandwiches to take home for dinner. The Kraken was very tasty, with a tangy dill-y tartar sauce and a nice crunch, and the BLT had a good flavor, but was too salty for our taste. The jalapeno-cheddar muffin rounded things off nicely. It had a crisp, cheesy outside and a luscious, fluffy middle. 

Thank you, Through Being Cool! We hope to come back someday!"}
{"text":"Excellent treats, friendly staff!  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the baked goods are a wee bit expensive. I am happy to pay for special treats on occasion. 

I have purchased both fresh baked goods and a frozen pot pie. Everything is very tasty, the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"This place is legit. 

So far, through 3 visits, I've tried 4 different doughnuts, the pizza bun, the pumpkin spice and vanilla bean latte. I will be back to try more in the next few days, as well.

Everything tasted great, the pizza buns are pretty addictive as are the doughnuts, which are the only vegan doughnuts in Toronto worth eating. Everything so far has been worth the asking price. If you want shitty, frozen baked goods that cost $1, this place isn't for you. However, if you're after fresh, handmade eats - this is the spot.

In contrast to some reviews online, the service I've received from the owner and the two other employees at the cash has always been really nice - even when busy.

Cash only, which makes getting in and out very quick and also helps prevent lines. This is a good thing.

5 stars because this really is as good as it gets - no extra bullshit you don't need; well-made baked goods, coffee, and smiles."}
{"text":"Instead of writing a review, I'm going to post a video of me wringing out a measurable amount of oil from a donut from TBC."}
{"text":"OMG, I wish I lives closer to TBC! I just happened to notice this place as I was walking along Bloor and decided to pop in and see what it was all about. It's a uber small space with not really any seating. The food was by far the BEST vegan food I have had. I still can't get that homemade mustard out of my dreams.. Best!! I had a sandwich, and a donut. The sand which was ridiculously big, stuffed to the Max and amazingly scrumptious. The donut was fluffy and a decent size. I scarfed it all down in a matter of seconds. I will definitely be coming back to try their other sandwiches and maybe even try some of their frozen goodies!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Fucking RUDE ass male barista working Saturday evening. Stood there for 5 mins while the barista took the order from the white people in front of me, cashed them out. Then served the white  lady standing behind me. Even though I was standing there HOLDING my wallet. I had been pointing at the many doughnuts I was going to buy. 
I asked if he was going to take my order. He said \"I'll be with YOU in a moment\" in an unfriendly way, even though I was there before and after other customers being served. I hate leaving negative feedback but it felt borderline racist. He had no issues serving and cashing out other patrons, but literally didn't even acknowledge my presence. Acknowledging someone's existence is a basic decent human thing to do.

Really too bad because I was looking forward to trying their donuts.

*i think it's worth mentioning that the manager reached out to me and apologized for my experience. She said she would follow up w her staff. I appreciate her concern and thought she was very professional (even though her staff was not). Thank you."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place last Sunday with friends and was very pleasantly surprised! 

I went in to grab a coffee but after spotting their fluffy round donuts and giant cookies I had to take some home. Ended up getting the ginger molasses cookie, pumpkin donut, and pecan donut. I have to say that the cookie was my favourite but I was a fan all three!

Also, the soy cappuccino did not disappoint. 

4/5 due to the slightly slow service but I would definitely come back. Love finding and supporting local vegan spots."}
{"text":"Went in for a chocolate glazed donut. It was not good. Very dense, doughy, and did not taste like chocolate. Didn't really taste like anything. I don't see how that's possible. For $3, I could have had 2 Tim hortons chocolate glazed donuts.

The girl working was very nice though!"}
