{"text":"Went there last weekend with my girl. Nice clean restaurant. We ordered my girl ask for macaroni and cheese. They don't have it. Mind u on the radio advertising they have this and other stuff. All they had was greens and green beans. Smh! The fish and shrimp and chicken is Gd. They don't have any sides. The lady that works there says they only cook stuff if they feel like it talking about the sides. Wtf! We get are dinners open them up they only give u a drop of sides. They rationing the sides off to people. Typically black man. Smh!"}
{"text":"I drove an hour to get here to show support to your business. You post that you are open until midnight but I got there at 11:41 and there was this guy there with the chairs already up on the tables. As soon as I opened the door, he stated that you were closed. My girl stated that the website says that you are open till midnight. The gentleman looked at his watch and stated \"we closed at 11:40 tonight\". Disappointing and messy. I will not be back and I will tell everyone how we were treated. 

We were really looking forward to the food and really felt let down. Businesses need to find employees who will represent them well. This was a fail in my book...."}
{"text":"Food was okay fish sandwich was good side note don't put a hot azz piece of fish on top of a bed of lettuce makes for a very soggy sandwich will not return.. in addition very disappointed no options for grilled fish or grilled chicken..."}
{"text":"The hype is over , from the beginning when they first opened the food was great, I don't know what happened , maybe New cooks but now the food is barely edible,  this will be my last time here , or until someone leave a improvement or better review of the food, all I can say is keep this up and they will be out of business by summer, people not going to pay for crappie food, like over cook fish and salty wings , . 
My recommendation is if you do go there you  are brave , and check your food before you leave,  I normally do but since it was so cold I wanted Just to get home . No more , take an extra minute look it over make sure it's correct,"}
{"text":"This is the worst restuarant cheap quality of food they put they my shrimp po boy on a hot dog bun the fries were cold and hard the green beans was real salty I will never visit this place again"}
{"text":"Sam Sylk's on Lee Rd. Well let me tell u. I heard so much about this place. I had to see if the food was good. I order the shrimp dinner and perch sandwich. The food is not good. This is my second time eating it. The fries was not done and greasy. The hush puppy was old. And the shrimp taste like they was cooked in old grease. The coleslaw look nasty. I didn't touch it. It was all just nasty. NO MORE SAM SYLK'S for me. The service was not good either. I walk in the girl see me. She sit for 5 mins. acting like she don't see me. Walks to the back and then come to the front and ask have u been waited on. REALLY!!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Sam's place & really wanted to like there food. Got a perch dinner was flat out terrible taste mushy & pieces were very small dinner cost 9.99$ should have cost 6.99$.Fries were cold coleslaw was just not good. Also got 3 wings nice flavor but just plain & way to small for 4.50$ Finally the lady at the register went to move her car in back leaving customers just standing there waiting to get there order in, bad when your trying to start up a new business... Unfortunately I won't be back especially when there are other fish & wing places within a mile or two from this spot...My money is good all the time so should the product... I wish them the Best!!!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in my food! Tried Sam sylks for the first time and this challenger?? Was a CHALLENGE getting down.. the staff was pleasant and I was pleased with the prices and the fact that my food was cooked to order.. I ordered the challenger jr and my gf ordered 6 wings.. it took almost 20 mins for our food but I was ok with waiting for fresh fish!! We got home (we live 5 mins from the lee rd location) and I was immediately disappointed. The fries were floppy and greasy (you can tell the oil just wasn't hot enough) and before unwrapping my sandwich I could smell the fish... not in a good freshly fried fish way.. but a super fishy way.. 1. My SANDWICH.. was on a hot dog bun  hmmmm... 2. The fish was not crispy at all and felt mushy and under seasoned.. there was pounds of tarter sauce (I guess to mask the crappy fish) and more bones then I have in my body.. every bite.. full of bones (I only had 3 bites before tossing the whole thing) and the skin was left on.. not tasty on a sandwich! You can tell it's just not quality fish.. Overall I won't be eating there again.. was pretty excited to have somewhere other than sharks! But guess I'll be sticking to what I know.. 2 stars because the woman at the front was pleasant and the place looked clean."}
{"text":"We tried we patronized with this place my family ordered 4 perch sandwiches and a 3 wings with fry special on 3/26/15 the fish was hard and cold and had no taste the fries were terrible cold and tasted burnt. And the chicken was nothing to write home about. Its a shame we spent close to $ 30.00 on this we wont ever order from here again"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I've only had catfish dinners and catfish combos,but it's been great. The fish is fried to perfection and they're not subbing the cat out for swai, like a lot of places now. My cousins have came here after me telling them about the place. They love it too, perfect seasoning. I will continue to come"}
{"text":"Service was fast. Ordered frog legs which the batter was too thick so broke off batter to eat frog legs. Dissatisfied."}
{"text":"So I was going to wait til the GRAND Opening to do my review of Sam Sylk's Chicken and Fish but decided to do it now since reviews for me are ALL about FIRST impressions.  So here goes.. 

My first impression of Sam Sylk's was that it was easy to find and parking was readily accessible.  We walked in and the brightness of the orange and green decor immediately perked me up despite the lateness of the hour.  We were greeted by a lovely young woman who informed us they'd be closing soon so to kind of pick up the pace in making our dinner selections.  Not a problem... Lol. The dinner selection however, was interrupted by the cashier recognizing BH. They went on to have the 'Where Do I know you from?' convo and after a few moments I decided on the wings with fresh cut fries and BH decided on a polish boy.  

Waiting for the food was a pleasant experience.  The two tv's in establishment were tuned into Empire so I made my way over to one of them to enjoy the show.  Sam came out from the kitchen to interact with those waiting for their dinners. Covered in flour, it was nice to see that he was a hands on owner.  We spoke for a few moments then my attention went back to Empire! Sorry Sam.  Lol.    BH came back from the restroom and Sam spoke to him as well.  Come to find out, this dude has a heck of a business sense but we won't go into that, this is about the food right?!   

After we received our meals, we leave and head home. The AROMA from the food was soo delightful and I couldn't wait to get home to enjoy.  I cracked open my chicken and fresh cut fries and the first bite of fries (lightly drizzled) with Sam's special sauce was mmmm mmmm good!  It didn't taste like any of sauce that I'd had before (and there have been many).  It wasn't overly sweet or overly spicy/tangy.  It was juuuuust right and just Sam's.  The chicken was seasoned and fried perfectly. No abundance of batter here!   BH's Beef Polish boy was perfectly messy in all its glory.  He had cheese added to it and I swear he inhaled it in 3 bites.   Neither of us offered each other a taste.   We'll just consider that an mere oversight. Lol.  

Overall the location, decor, service and most importantly, the FOOD were a hit!  BH and I will certainly make our way back there soon!  Thanks for giving us another option in this food category Sam.  You did your homework and it shows!  Great job!! 

The Savol's!"}
{"text":"Saw them on TV the day they opened double dipping shrimps in batter before frying. Very anxious to try them out. Could not get them on the phone to call in a order. Drove by a few times, limited parking. Finally got in.

The place is dirty. Floor hadn't been mopped or swept and it was only 3 PM. Long wait because they were filtering the grease. Not a problem waiting but I watched them do this using a long yellow hose which was dirty and the cooks kept touching it!. The cooks had on latex gloves but I never saw them change them. 

I got jumbo shrimp and chicken wings.

The coating slides off the shrimp so you end up eating a naked shrimp. The shrimp did taste fresh. Billed as jumbo but were not. Just a regular size shrimp. Very disappointed.

Wings were good but small. 

Lots of fries, too many.

Won't go back."}
{"text":"The chicken was good it was fried perfect but it was too much salt you can feel your blood pressure rising as you eat them you know that ain't good for us black folks we already got high blood pressure in our genes. But if they hold out on the salt it'll be perfect"}
{"text":"Sorry Service by Extra Thristy People. More GAMES THEN A CASINO.  AVOID THIS PLACE

Fathers Day and this place means angry and yelling women with other agenda. 

Took Father their and he waited 20 minutes with a PAID TICKET AND GOES Check on the order and they tell.him they were out of the food and gad.an attitude. 


Sam Nasty Blonde hairded girl with no gloves on preparing food. AVOID THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, don't go. The food was over priced. My Sylk Challenger was nasty as you insert word. The bread was soggy and so was the fish. I can't believe the person who prepared this mess is serious. I can't even call him or her a cook. It's was like  biting into a soggy can of cooked fish wrapped around bread. This is my second time getting subpar food from this location. I decided to give them another try. I am disappointed again.    My tilapia dinner was ok the fries were undercooked but the tilapia was fried well.  I called to inform the location of state of my food, no one picked up and I know they don't close for another 45 min after I called. Save your money."}
{"text":"Stopped in Sam Sylks Seafood Sunday afternoon in Lee Rd. Food was hot, fresh and well seasoned. 

Service was great too. I will return!

If your looking for a well run black owned business your search can end with Sam Sylks Seafood. 

Kudos to the Big Man!"}
{"text":"So I eat here for lunch often! It seems that the service is declining.  I love the lunch special for $3. Lately,  there is no sauce, no ketchup... nothing! The staff is too busy joking and playing around in the kitchen to even notice people have walked in to place orders. I get the wrong food often...however,  I'm glad they changed their fries! I hope the service gets better. The chicken bangs! Try it!"}
