{"text":"This casual burger place, located in the former Bojangles space, is a good, quick place for fresh burger and fries.  The IBC sauce is a mayo-ketchup mix, and they glop a lot of it.  I will omit it next time."}
{"text":"I have tried to visit 3 more times since my first time and the place is always closed! I write this because the manager assured me that they would remain open til 7:30 every night! What is a 2nd shifter to do????   Hello, can i please get yours hours???"}
{"text":"You must try this place and support a great small business in the middle of uptown Charlotte, in the old Ivey's building.  The black bean burgers are fabulous, and the fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars because Yelp won't allow for a 3 1/2, which would be my real score.  I rounded up, because I didn't have any serious problem.  The burger was pretty good, not the best I ever had but far from the worst.  I got a Carolina double and it was pretty juicy.  The chili and slaw were also just OK.  It was defintely a good value for the price.  The fries need some work.  While they were seasoned nicely, they were a little limp.  Also, this place doesn't have Heinz ketchup.  Seriously, how much extra does Heinz cost that you wouldn't have it over that Sysco crap?  Don't believe their pictures, they don't have the \"golden\" fries.  The seasoning and coloring reminded me of the Curly Q fries at Arby's.  Not saying that is a bad thing, just that the picture is not representative of the product.  The bun could use some work, it was a tad too soft for my liking.  However, I did walk 4 blocks with this thing, so that could account for the slight sogginess of the bun.  I'd definitely hit this place again."}
