{"text":"Great people awesome service we has Jerk Chicken and Barbi Fri Chicken was GREAT! We ate in while we were eating the take out orders were flying out the door. The beef soup was very tasty. They also serve curry goat, Oxtail"}
{"text":"Amazing Jamaican cuisine! If you order takeout make sure to double check your order. Parking is horrible if you can find a place your very lucky."}
{"text":"With a name like Krazy Jerk, you'd expect the Jamaican flavours to be popping. 

KJ is in quite the random spot (beside a Pizza 3000). Would have never spotted it from the street. We came on a Friday evening around 8:00pm. Pretty dead but there were a few occupied tables. They had a CFL game up on the TV. 

Service is friendly but they disappear to the back. At least they brought us a jug of water halfway through our meal. Oddly enough, they only have one hot sauce to go around for the whole place?

- Passionfruit ($4.00) - very sweet, artificial tasting juice. The label says it's 30% juice...
- Curry goat ($17.00 large) - goat was tender, fall off the bone. Good flavour but no heat at all. Salad is nothing special but the rice and beans was decent. Believe this dish normally comes with dumplings but they were out. Waiter promised to owe us for next time. 
- Jerk chicken ($17.00 large) - only had a bite but the jerk was incredibly salty. I can't phantom eating a whole platter. Again, no heat, uninspiring flavour. 

Found it overpriced and not krazy at all flavour wise. 2.5 stars."}
