{"text":"Took my mom here after golf. Wings were undercooked, which is disappointing since they are easy to make."}
{"text":"I view Carnivore's the way I view some family.  Its a bit quirky and not perfect, but I like it.  Its my favorite place to eat in Oakmont.  Most nights I have a friendly waitress and good food.  There are nights with a long wait, etc, but I still like the place."}
{"text":"this is a fun place to go for great food and a terrific selection of beer. the service iscpretty darn good too for being so crowded."}
{"text":"I have been to Carnivores on business and both pleasure, so I can give you guys a little scoop here. First off, who doesn't love a great brew for any sporting event? Carnivores definitely is a cool spot to watch some pigskin or the big game once in awhile. The beer selection contains a variety of solid beers, I can definitely encourage you to take down some beers during some Steelers games or college football or whatever the heck you want to watch! Food = a deep variety of American, (wings, nachos, ect) and you can find things to share/ split that's your best bet probably, but that's just me. A sweetheart family owmed business that is better than most, which is a must in this industry."}
{"text":"Carnivores food is, in two words, not good. It's never terrible, but it's definitely below average. Service is slow, indifferent, and haughty. Their beer selection is excellent, and their prices aren't bad.   Food: below average to bad quality, average price  Drinks: good selection, average prices  Service: well below average.   Cannot understand why this place continues to attract patrons. Just tried their pizza tonight for the first time...pretty rough."}
{"text":"I have great news for all young women within the Oakmont, Verona, Plum and Penn Hills area.  If you weren't quite bright enough to work at McDonalds or if you could not show your chest off at Burger King, I have the place for you to apply......Carnivores.  A dimmer group of gals that have zero clue on how to properly wait on a table could not exist anywhere outside of perhaps South Oakland.  Unfortunately this restaurant is located in Oakmont not Oakland.  This team of Mensa candidates do not however know the difference.  Unfortunately for me, it has taken me quite a few visits to conclude that this college bar that is not in a college town will never place any emphasis on service.  If you are looking for a bucket of beer and do not care how or if your food ever arrives, this might be the place for you.  For  me, if I stop again it will be for take out only.    Oakmont, you deserve better!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and food is usually good. Beer selection is great. Service is usually good as well. Parking is terrible. Small lot and few spots on the street. All in all I recommend."}
{"text":"Great service, above average pub grub, nice comfy booths, extremely clean and updated environment, great beer and cider selection. Prices are a bit steep but you are getting a very nice facility and friendly staff.   This is not an intimate setting. It's not a date night, nor a place I'd suggest any couple dating less than a year go to. This is a \"Hey, we haven't' been out of the house in 4 days except for work, we should probably make sure we don't turn into Jeffrey Dahmer and go to Carnivores.\"  Only downside is it gets INSANELY packed on weekends. If you can snag a booth, great. If not, I hope you enjoy being cheek to jowl. If not, you'll be miserable."}
{"text":"Food is good. Great beer selection. Service is somewhat lacking, but if you're not in a hurry its a good place to sit back and enjoy good food and good beer!"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. Their food is awesome and their beer and now wine selection is amazing.  However, their service just seems to get worse every time we go unless we get served by some of the more tenured staff.  One time we ordered take out and went to pick it up.  We waited at the bar for 20 minutes to even get noticed and then another 20 minutes to get our food.  It wasn't even that busy!  Living less than a mile from the bar, we got home with the food and it was ice cold.  It seems as if when my husband and I go there or if I go with a girlfriend, it takes forever to get waited on but yet I watch all these younger female bartenders and waitresses flirting and waiting on prospective guys.   Note to staff - a 40 year old professional woman will most likely tip better than those guys anyway if you provide good service."}
{"text":"Always great sandwich's and pizza, fantastic homemade potato chips. Want beer ton's of beer on tap, and hundreds of types in bottles to choose from."}
{"text":"Excellent food, came fast and fresh, priced well, the only complaint was it was confusing walking in, it's apparently self-seating which wasn't clear,  and after we were done, it took a while for the check to come, but I would definitely go back. We got shrimp po boy & tilapia tacos...yum!"}
{"text":"Ate here after a volleyball tournament. Wonderful pizza. Really likes the pepperoni. Staff extremely helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had one of their shaved filet Philly Cheese Steak Hoagies with sautéed mushrooms, onions, green peppers and provolone cheese on a Mancini's bun. It is the Best I have ever eaten. All contents complimented each other to make one dynamite sandwich. I also got an order of the fresh cut fries - so good! Order in or take out. Yum!"}
{"text":"Sitting here, currently going on a 45 min wait for a chicken sandwich. My fiancé got his burger a half hour ago, which was greasy and covered in disgusting nacho cheese. I'll be happy if I never have to come here again."}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent beer selection, piss poor service.  The good food and beer selection was enough to get us to come back several times.  The poor service on a regular basis has now convinced us to stay away.  Sitting at the bar with an empty glass while several bartenders huddle around giggling is the norm at this place.  There are too many other places that are more than happy to pour us a $6 draft!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, friendly bartenders, and had one really good hot dog that I'm still thinking about days later.  For $3.95 you can get a nice sized grilled all beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun with pretty much any topping you could want on a hot dog, and you get an unlimited number of toppings.  Good place to watch a game too."}
{"text":"This places was SO GOOD! With a very large menu, it was hard for me and my friends to decide on what to get! First we started with some apps...we had the pepperjack mac and cheese nuggets, which had the perfect amount of bite, classic busters fries, which was topped with cheese sauce, bacon, and ranch dressing, and the roni roll, which is their pepperoni rolls! Next, my two friends and I ordered wedgies. You can order half a wedgie, which would have been plenty but I ordered a whole so I could pack leftovers for my lunch the next day. All three of us ordered the buffalo chicken one. However, there was a miscommunication somewhere along the line and my friend was served an Italian one. She still ate it, even though they had offered to remake it for her. She said it was good, just not what she wanted. For that, I'm giving 4 stars. My other friend ordered the Philly cheese steak, which he enjoyed too! And that was also large enough for him to take home leftovers. Two of my friends also had beers that they could select from the many coolers that they had on the walls. Overall, it was a cool restaurant with a very appetizing menu and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food is good and they have a huge selection of beer. Their service is pretty bad. All the waitresses are bitchy and don't attend to you if you're not a man. It's a typical bar. The beer selection is the only thing that gives them an advantage."}
{"text":"By brother recommended this place and I'm happy he did.  The wings were awesome, especially the General Tso flavor.  The prime rib sandwich and cheese steak are out of this world.  Great casual atmosphere and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Went here for Steelers game. Very large beer selection. Food was very good had the wings they were the small wing dings I like the larger wings but we're pretty good. Fries with cheese was good very large portion. Would go here again"}
{"text":"The wait times on food can be staggering and when they get \"too busy\" they just take the phone off the hook. It seriously seems like every time we order from there something in our order is wrong. My company orders from there at let a few times a week and they always do fairly well but the repeat issues case me to take away a star and the prices are somewhat high mix that with the phone off the hook I took away another star. Nice place to hang out and watch the game as long as you don't mind the cost of food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Very solid beer selection and the food is ok.  However, why I bump them up a star is because they donated pizza after my sons' basketball league was over.  Reaching out to the community is a great gesture and will keep me loyal.  Well done."}
{"text":"Well I requested we come here...ordered a salad and wings. We asked for a bowl of soup to share before the meal came and it never came till after our meal was ready to be delivered...so I asked that we not get the soup...our waitress w ER checked back with is unless we asked for her to open our beverages since we didn't have a bottle opener...I'm generally not very critical working with the public myself but to not check on your customer and apologize for a screw up? Food was decent service very sad ...beer selection is great.. if you are stopping for a six pack no worries..."}
{"text":"First visit to Carnivores. A friend is moving this way so a group of us met for drinks/food.  Top points:  Beer. Great draft selection and bottle selection. Fair prices.  Bar. Large bar area...plenty of seats.  Service. Our waitress was excellent.   Mediocre points: Atmosphere. Very large open area which makes it pretty loud and not the cozy feel I expect with a bar/restaurant drawing craft beer enthusiasts. It's seems a bit like a chain sports bar.  Food. Eh. Not bad, but not great. I had the shrimp/lobster roll which was basically steamed shrimp and lobster on a bun. Tried the onion rings...greasy. Maybe I should have tried something like a burger or different sandwich. What I saw for the others was not terribly impressive.   Looking for a way to try a lot of different beer? Go here. Looking for great bar food? Maybe have a few drinks and move somewhere else for a good burger."}
{"text":"Food here is very consistent and tasty. Service is attentive and prices are very reasonable. Good selection of beer with the atmosphere of a sports bar. Be warned. This IS a smoking establishment. Our favorites are steak wrap - grade A, with freshcut fries that are nicely prepared and not soggy. We also like the Roni-roll which is a pepperoni roll of ground pepperoni, cheese, and a liitle bit of sauce rolled in a nicely baked pizza type crust. This is a favorite lunch place but you will gain weight if you eat here much."}
{"text":"When i lived in Oakmont, I frequented Carnivores a lot.  Walking distance, great beer, good bar food.  Now that I moved away, every once in a while I head there and want it to be amazing, like visiting my old college bar.  and it does just that for me.   The menu is pretty diverse with pasta dishes, pizzas, wraps, sandwiches, hot dogs and for some reason, a crazy amount of fry options.  ***Burgers come with shoe string fries.  Change it to the hand cut fries.  The shoe string fries remind me of the pool snack bar.  The food is consistently good.  It's higher end bar food and good higher end bar food, at that.  They don't try to be fancy, just keep doing what they do.   A good burger, a nice sandwich, the usual descriptors for bar style food.  The service is a little bit iffy.  Sometimes awesome, sometimes less-than-awesome.  If its busy drinks usually take a little time, but the big timing issue is if I grab a beer out of the cooler, it usually takes a few minutes to have it opened, as it sits on your table taunting you.    Overall, I wil overlook the iffy service for the stellar bar menu."}
{"text":"I can't say I was very impressed with our stop here on a Friday evening.  The place was busy enough, leaving a few open seats at the bar but none together.  We decided to grab a high table near the bar.  It took a while for the waitress to make her way to us.  I asked if the draft list was up-to-date.  I was informed that it was not.  I then ordered another IPA than the one I wanted since I was told that one was out.  While waiting for our drinks I decided to browse their bottle coolers.  I will say they have a lot of beer, but I am not sure how well it is rotated.  I saw Oktoberfest's and Christmas beers.  It was the second week in June.  I didn't find anything that I would have rather chosen over a draft beer which is always my first choice when visiting a bar such as this that hosts several crafts on draft.  Several is an exaggeration (at least on this night) and as I continued to look over the bottles my husband comes up and says they are out of the beer you ordered.  So I return to my seat and go back to looking over the out-of-date list for yet another option.  Thinking she would be back right away to get my order she did not return until 5 minutes or so later.  I was annoyed to say the least.  She made a suggestion and I just went with it.  I can't recall what it was, as I was less than enthralled by it.    I decided to continue to look in their coolers as they are stationed all around the place, and honestly not stationed in very convenient or safe spots.  On at least two occasions, servers nearly ran into me as the turned the corner coming out from the bar.  These locations are hazards.  The one guy swore as he almost crashed into me with plates full of food.  Perhaps moving these coolers is a good idea???  I finally did find one intriguing beer a N.E. Style IPA, from ATWATERS brewery.  Unfortunately for me it wasn't one of the better N.E.  beers that I've had, so I was back to the drawing board for a different selection.  Our waitress was busy running around so another waitress stopped over to help us, which I appreciated.  I said how I was having a hard time since they seemed to be out of a lot.  She made a recommendation only to tell me after that that too was kicked.   Funny all these taps are kicked but no one is replacing them??  Now the only IPA beers left had an ABV of 9.9 and higher.  I really didn't want something that heavy but I was so tired of the hunt, just beer me already.  It was a beer brewed at Otto's in State College, a place I have visited with clients for lunch and always wanted to try their beer but never could so I was happy they did have it though as stated it was heavier than I would have liked.  The flavor was good though and we decided to call it after that.  I don't know if I would ever make it a point to stop back here.  Seems like a lot of hype over their beer selection when they have 5 or so beers on tap that are kicked, but if we found ourselves back in Oakmont I may give it another go to see if that was just a bad night."}
{"text":"Come here usually once  a week and I love it.  Have been here for lunch and dinner and just to drink.  It gets packed, but never so bad that you have to wait too long for a drink.    Has good bar food and an amazing selection of beer on tap and bottles.  Servers and bartenders are great.  Always friendly and always attentive.  Their prices are good and it's a fun place to go for a casual dinner and drinks.  I would say their sandwiches are probably the best thing on their menu.  It gets loud so I wouldn't recommend it for a first date, but definitely somewhere laid back and local.  Try it! and try the Chocolate blockhouse ale. YUM"}
{"text":"Slow service and just not quality.  I am not a fan of TV's in every square inch of a place, but that might be good for some.  No smoking is a good thing and certainly crushes the Oakmont Tavern."}
{"text":"It's hit or miss. Today steak on steak salad was cold and service was not good, and it wasn't crowded at all. Other visits it's been good. Maybe opening The Lot has taken focus and the good workers away from here."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  This place is usually crazy/busy/hopping, so if quiet and relaxed is the decor you are looking for, I don't think this is the place.  I'd like to put to rest the statement that the waitresses are unfriendly, we observed a lot of attentive, friendly service, especially by our waitress, Heather.  The wings are excellent, very tender and juicy.  They just added a new hot dog menu (in last 6 months), so you might look for that."}
{"text":"Could be a 5 star. Haven't eaten yet but food looks good and seems to be enjoyed. I do agree though with what people have said about the bartenders.  It's difficult to get a beer.  Have been here 3 times for a few beers and every time my glass is quite empty before anyone even glances. They are nice and courteous just kinda going through the motions though. Good selection of beers but really need to step up the sense of urgency and serving."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection and just an overall great place. A buddy and I went there on a saturday at noon to watch college football, drink beer, and have some good food. All of the above was accomplished. The wait staff made sure we were watching the games that we wanted on our desired TV's. Nobody does that usually but this place did. I was impressed. Ill be going back for sure"}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday and had a blast.   The following changed my views:  Atmosphere:  - They have a ton of TVs - They have 2 large garage doors which gives the place a college feel.   I was thinknig of asking the waitstaff if I could park my car inside ;-) - You are surrounded by beer.   What more can a person want.  I recommend comfortable clothing (stretchy pants)  Food: Sunday Beer Specials!   $3 Sierra Nevada.     They had more varieties then Old Country Buffet has deserts!  - Pizza was very yummy!   Wings (BBQ / Hot) were good as well.     Service: The waitstaff was attentive and provided good recommendation.   I am now a fan!"}
{"text":"One star for the incredible beer selection that Carnivores has to offer. Otherwise, the experience was a complete failure. The wait staff was exceptional at looking through you and pretending you weren't there. We were only separated by a foot and a half of bar, but it might as well have been two and a half miles.  They managed to screw up both of our orders despite the fact that 90% of the menu is a variation on the same theme (i.e. meat on bread with 2-3 ingredients). We might have said something to a more attentive wait staff, but decided that it was best to make due and eat what we were given less we go hungry. After waiting half an hour to put in an order and another half an hour to get two hot dogs I was willing to make due.  I'll never be able to convince my wife to go back. I may go back just for the beer, but you better believe that I'll be ordering two at a time. A guy can get pretty thirsty waiting at a place like this. I posted our experience to FB and the consensus was that you can maybe go there to drink; otherwise, eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good food, big portions, a lot of beer and cute servers. The place is always busy and noisy, but seems to be a local hang out spot. Overall it's one of our favorite sports bars when we feel like watching a game with some wings."}
{"text":"Carnivores has great food, a nice selection of beer and a pretty cool atmosphere. All the waitresses seem pretty friendly although the bartenders seem not that friendly...there is no smoking here, lots of TVs, but PARKING SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Went there before a movie at the oaks. Horrible food sub par service. The bartenders def cater to men more than women. Thankfully we were acknowledged because I was with my boyfriend. Not going back. Not even a hi thank you or goodbye from the numerous bartenders there. I ordered the ravioli and it came out dry and crusty asked for no onions on my salad the whole salad tasted like onions. The bartender didn't even know what beers they had in the cooler. We were ignored after we got our nasty food until finally we wanted our check and flagged a bartender down.. she was nice but again not even a thank you when we paid tipped and left. You need to train the employees on customer service and fire the chef!!!"}
{"text":"From what I understand, this place looks much better now than it once did but I never had the opportunity to see what it was like before to compare.  But I have to say, I was not disappointed at all with how the place appeared.  Clean for a bar, and nice and roomy, good bar food.    The one complaint I have is the not so attentive wait staff and bartenders... they could use a lesson or two in customer service and work ethic (doing your job).  They seemed more concerned with chatting with one another than taking care of the patrons."}
{"text":"I love the newer staff here!! The young servers aim to please and are not snobby. I had issues for several years with past female bartenders/servers ignoring me and I would have to wait FOREVER to get a refill. New girls are sweet and I am shocked by how often they check up on me. Thanks, girls!!!! Brie gave excellent service."}
{"text":"First off, I need to be totally transparent here - my true venture to Oakmont was to visit the bakery. However, I needed to grab lunch somewhere, and stumbled across this place. Anyplace with a name like \"Carnivores\" has me sold. I'm the opposite of a vegetarian, so I'm all in!  I walked in. Nothing overwhelming or shiny. Your standard, run-of-the-mill sports bar scene. No one greets you at the door. Appears to be a seat-yourself kinda place. It was about 1:30 p.m., so I missed the lunch crowd (I think).  Since I was alone, I grabbed a seat at the bar. Just a diet soda for me. Immediate service at the bar.  Lots of offerings on what seemed to be a small menu. I wasn't sure what direction to go, so I asked the bartender. He points me towards a few specials and tells me \"the burgers are good\".  He doesn't sell me on anything particular. I go with the \"Slam Burger\" with pepperjack cheese since it's highlighted as a special on the menu.  The burger comes with shoestring fries.  I wait for my burger. My surroundings tell me a few things. This place would be great to come watch your favorite sporting event. TVs everywhere. Also... this place flaunts its beer and alcohol selection well. You can see the offerings everywhere.  My food arrives. There's that saying that you eat with your eyes first. My eyes were underwelmed. Nothing colorful or fancy about the plate. The burger was meat and cheese on a bun. No sauces, no toppings. Perhaps that's my fault for not asking for them? Perhaps it's the bartender's fault for not asking if I wanted any toppings? Anyhow, I thought it was strange that this \"premium blend of double ground Angus chuck and short rib\" didn't come with anything other than the cheese.  The food was good. The fries reminded me of a better, more well-seasoned version of the shoestring fries you would get at Steak & Shake. The burger was good, too; but was screaming for lettuce, tomato, mayo, something.  I get the impression that this is a place the locals come to and like. I would return for sure, but do my research in advance.  The service was solid, food was OK, location was convenient. Parking appears to be relatively limited.   After my meal, I took the 5-minute walk to the Oakmont Bakery, then returned to get my car."}
{"text":"One of our favorite sports bars. It doesn't look like much from the outside and could be easy to miss since it is in a strip mall but it is well worth the visit.   The beer selection is amazing! Not only do they have 30 beers on tap but they also have coolers of bottles and cans. The best part is their daily specials. You can't beat Thursday nights when most of the bottles or cans are $3 each. When the specials are limited to a specific brewery, you can count on still having great options!   We also love their food. The gourmet hot dogs are excellent. I'm addicted to the hound dog and California dog. They are filling even without a side of fries. My husband and I are also big fans of the chicken Parmesan sandwich; The bread really makes the sandwich.   I recommend starting with an order of pepperjack cheese balls. Can't go wrong!   A great spot for watching a game. The place is filled with tvs and the booths have individually controlled tvs. The staff are extremely friendly and more than willing to change a TV if need be.   I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, seriously I haven't found anything like it in the Pittsburgh area. The food is so-so. Table service isn't terrible, typically nice but slow.   The bar service is laughably bad. I wish I could say it's only occasional, but I live up the block and come here regularly to take out a six pack, for which you must pay at the bar. If you are a woman you will be ignored and made to feel like a second class customer. No matter how well I tip (usually at least %20) the bartenders literally walk past me and pretend they don't notice until I raise my voice to ask for assistance. I have been ignored to the point where I just leave $ on the bar and walk out with my beer.    The times I've begrudgingly stuck around for drinks there is usually something trashy going on like girls selling test tube shots.  My female friends and I have made a game to see how any times the bartenders will attend to and flirt with the male patrons before paying any attention to us.   Go for the takeout beer, not for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"So busy! There had to have been a few hundred people there (or at least it really seemed like it). The bartender who took my food order noticed me very quickly despite having such a packed bar. I ordered cheese fries to go, and my order was out in a timely manner. I had been here one time before with friends during a much slower week night. I ordered fries and a sandwich and was very surprised about how good the food is and how big their portions are! Prices are fitting to what you get. I love the food :) really good bar food. Definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 15 minutes on a slow night while the waiters texted...then the one bartender came up and asked 1 person if they'd like a beer and walked away and bs'd with the wait staff...Alabama vs Clemson and it wasn't packed...hmmmm...foods half decent but the service sucks...d+...at my job I have to be as prompt as I can...I can't just stare at the phone when it rings and wait for it to go to voicemail...went to another restaurant and I'm getting served...fool me once"}
{"text":"Sigh... it's hard to give Carnivore's only a 3-star rating because their food is tremendous, and it's a place I love going back to for this reason, but honestly I have become so jaded with the lackluster service here that I'm on the hunt for a new place close to my good friend's apartment in Oakmont. This is usually our hangout spot. What keeps us coming back is the great food and unparalleled beer/cider/spirits collection. What makes me want to bang my head off a wall is the service. Here is a typical rundown of my Carnivores experience the past FOUR times.   1. Walk in, ready for a night of experimenting with different beers and awesome food. Meander to whatever open table you can snag. Hope and PRAY an employee is watching you so they know to attend to your needs in a timely manner.  2. Have difficulty finding an employee to give you menus, because Carnivores employees wear normal clothing and nothing to distinguish themselves as staff. Wait anywhere from 2-15 minutes for menus. No matter what day I've been in on, waitstaff is also stretched thin, working behind the bar, too.  3. Get menus and wait another 10-15 minutes to order. Hope that between your waiter/waitress running other food, going behind the bar, and fetching drinks from the coolers that they'll remember to bring your silverware.  My last visit forced me to employ especially ridiculous tactics just to flag an employee down. He didn't tell us his name the whole night. He assumed from overhearing my friend and I that we wanted a certain appetizer, so he placed the order for it, and brought us the wrong food. It took 15 minutes for that to be remade and corrected. Plates and silverware only showed up after we had already eaten our appetizer with our hands. The waiter forgot to put our entree orders in, too, and didn't realize this after 30 minutes. He'd whiz past us every time we'd try to get his attention.   All in all it probably took us over an hour and a half to eat our food. It was really a nightmare, and while I understand, having worked in restaurants myself, the ability to give staff the benefit of the doubt time after time is withering more and more. I truly think for Carnivores to keep their restaurant up to speed on the service end, it would require a full overhaul of the general flow through the place, and staff retraining. At the very LEAST make them wear matching shirts so customers know who to flag down...  Carnivores, I want to love you so much. Your atmosphere is a blast. Your selection of drinks is unrivaled. Your food is awesome - big portions, always fresh - but every time I leave I walk out full, but frustrated."}
{"text":"Changed their pizza. It's frozen pizza now. So disappointing. Still a decent place to grab a beer and some wings. Sandwiches are pretty good. Wings are above par. The pizza thing really upsets me. It was some of the best. I can't believe the switched to frozen pizza."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here for a late lunch. I hadn't been here in years and it changed so much. It's much bigger with a huge bar, lots of tvs and tables. A huge beer selection, I went with some winter beer selections. All were very good. We had a basket of tater tots and the cheese balls. Both were very good. The tots were nice and crunchy and the cheese balls had a little kick to them. We ordered pizzas. The buffalo chicken one was ok, it could have been spicer. The BBQ chicken one was good.  The service was excellent and they had a nice child seat for our daughter.  The one downside is the parking lot is small.  I'll be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! Wait staff is awesome!  And the food is good too! Great for a sporting event or just hanging out one night."}
{"text":"Normally I get my food delivered from here but last week I met a friend there for dinner. Waitress was really nice & always checking in to make sure we needed anything.  Atmosphere is good  As far as the food goes I would love to review it all but I tend to stick with what I love there which is either the Oak barrel steak salad, which is loaded up with real steak cooked to your liking & the burgers which when I want to crush my diet I go for the Mugga burger which is a beef patty with a potato pancake, pierogie & sautéed onions on it with your choice of cheese, I recommend Gouda. All in all this is a local spot that is welcoming to all."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Wednesday evening with my girlfriend while attending a charity event for Family House.  Due to this we had a buffet of food and I am not sure that it is 100% representative of the normal food that is served here.  In any case my initial impression as we drove by this place was that it was small.  However that was proven to be unfounded whenever we got inside the restaurant as it occupies quite a large space and has ample seating.  There are also many TV's throughout the restaurant including individual ones for the booths and I imagine that it could be quite a cool place to catch a game at.  The beer selection here is definitely one of the better in the city of Pittsburgh.  They boast of having over 30 beers on tap and more than 500 in their cases.  Due to this I was able to order some beers on draft which I had not tasted before and also find some more in the cases.  In the end I took home a 6 pack of craft beers for $15 and was more than satisfied with my purchase.  We started off the evening by ordering some beers which were brought promptly by the waitstaff.  Shortly thereafter the buffet was uncovered and it  had on it a salad with blue cheese and strawberries, lasagna, some type of chicken and peppers and a cous cous.  All of the food was decent with the only real standout for me being the salad.  Having both the strawberries and blue cheese combined with their vinaigrette was very nice.  After dinner was completed they put some dessert onto the buffet which was both peach and cherry pies.  Since I was full by this point, I decided to only take a little bit of each.  The filling of them was nice but was more than overshadowed by the amount of butter on the crust.  It essentially covered my mouth and left me with a not so great taste.  It ended up being so pervasive that I asked my girlfriend for a piece of gum to cancel it out.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here in the future.  It would not necessarily be for the food but more for the beer selection and environment as I would like to experience watching a big game here."}
{"text":"Carnivores appears to have found the secret sauce for restaurant success, because on two random evenings when I've been here (a Wednesday and a Sunday), it was bananas crowded both times. The ambiance isn't particularly inviting...it's large, open, and spacious, but a little sterile and cafeteria-like. It's seat yourself, which is annoying since it was super crowded...so may the odds be ever in your favor for finding a table.  On the first occasion we went, the service was okay, but nothing remarkable. On our second visit, service was downright abysmal. It took forever for a waitress to bring us drinks and take our order, and we waited over an hour for our food.   Speaking of the food, it's solid. It's bar food that's done well. The menu is expansive and there's something on there that will suit most tastes. I'm a fan of their boneless wings, the fresh cut fries, the southwest egg rolls, and don't even get me started on the tachos (whoever first thought to combine tater tots and nachos deserves some kind of Nobel prize). So yeah, the food is definitely tasty....but tasty enough to deal with the hassle of hunting for my own table in an uber-crowded space and then deal with poor service once I find one? Ehhhh, not sure about that. 3 stars for you, Carnivores."}
{"text":"Great draft selection.  Tons of TVs and very clean.  Great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since we didn't know what we wanted and drive by it all the time. It was awesome! Seat yourself, plenty of seating and bar room. The bar is actually huge. The place itself is really big, although it doesn't look large from the outside as it's in a plaza set up. There's TONS of different craft beer in coolers surrounding the inside, and also a nice indoor/outdoor seating patio. The menu was huge and everything sounded delicious. Our server was pleasant, although we had to flag him down to place our order and for our check/boxes. We started it out with an appetizer of tot-chos (tater tots topped with salsa, nacho cheese, your choice of chicken or ground beef, jalapeños AND shredded cheese) and let me tell you, it was HUGE. I mean, so big we took a bite of our main meals and needed boxes. For $8.50, it was an awesome deal!!! We still took some home!! For my main meal I got a triple decker Reuben and it was great. It was the perfect balance of saurkraut, thousand island and corned beef plus the toasted marbled rye was nice. My boyfriend got a chorizo philly, which was good but a little disappointing that for 10 bucks, you don't get a side of fries. It just looks a little plain to have JUST the sandwich on a plate meant for a whole meal. He asked for an egg on it and the server wrote it down, but the cooks forgot. We were so full it didn't even matter and just asked we didn't get charged for the egg, and the server was very nice and even asked if we were sure we didn't want them to put an egg on it for us. Over all, we will definitely be back, especially for more of the tot-chos."}
{"text":"Nice little local sports bar. TVs everywhere, great beer selection, very clean, food for the most part is pretty good and decently priced.  The staff is good, and I feel gets a bad wrap. Go during lunch or non-game nights and they are attentive and courteous. During really high traffic nights like playoff games or Saturday nights the service is a little slow just because of the amount of business that comes through the door.  They sponsor all kinds of teams to include adult and kid leagues. Very rooted in the community.   Lastly, go during weekday lunches and talk to Marty, the owner's mother who works there. She may be the sweetest woman in the world."}
{"text":"The best pizza in this neck of the woods. The beers on tap are ridiculous. Very clean inside and out. Parking is a bit challenging but very well worth it. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Tons of tvs. If you're at a booth you can watch whatever you want. Their beer selection is awesome, you can mix and match six packs. The staff is great and they know their beer. They do their best to accommodate special orders in the kitchen. The marinated steak salad is great. I haven't ever been disappointed at Carnivores."}
{"text":"This place is a must go. The food is good. The atmosphere is casual, not too loud, and a great for families or small groups. The music was good, and there was a nice amount of TVs. It was clean and the bathrooms were clean and Kid friendly. The only thing I never look forward to when coming here is the parking. Close parking is hard to find. You may have to park across the street."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Carnivores since the late 90's.  The place has grown a bit and so has the beer selection.  Good crowd and great bartenders/servers.  I will return..."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Beer choice is fantastic, and love going to the coolers to pick my own bottle. They will also run specials for certain bottles, so that is a nice treat. I have been here a few times and all the food I have had is good.  My favorite is any of their wedgies.  Big and stuffed full of delicious goodness, they hit the spot every time. Wings here are also good, so check them out. Service here can get slow at times, particularly on game nights, but it's never so out of control that I've had to complain. Carnivores is set up with so many TVs that it's perfect to watch a game with friends. It is also a great place for groups.  I have also seen people bring kids in during dinner and lunch hours, however I would not recommend later in the evening as people are drinking.  Can't wait for the Steelers to begin, so I have an excuse to go back! :)"}
{"text":"One of the best cheese steak hoagies! My co-workers decided to order from here. Glad I decided to order with them. I usually don't, but when I do I always get a cheese steak... one of the best, if not the best that I've had yet!"}
{"text":"Kumar, Kimi, Tucci, Cope, and Amber make this place the best bar I've ever been to. Food and drinks are always great. If you don't come here you're missing out. I wish I could give it six stars."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, if you order Bud, Miller, or Coors you need to be slapped ;-). Wings - very good, garlic parm mixed with hot - not on the menu but should be! Great staff!"}
{"text":"Carnivores is one of the two best bars in Oakmont.  Thy have an awesome beer selection and always have all the beer selections of one (usually very good) brewery on sale for $3.    They have the league passes for all 4 sports and I imagine can get most European soccer league games as well.  The bartenders and wait staff are attentive and usually pretty friendly."}
{"text":"This is a good spot that I often stop at with family when I'm visiting Pittsburgh. Pretty tasty, typical bar food, generally good service, lots of craft beer- all in all a win!  -Atmosphere is cool. It's a great sports bar with TV's even in some of the booths. There is a good amount of seating and I've never had to wait long here for a seat.   -Love the selection of craft beer, both draft and bottle! They even have a pick-a-six option to take home, but if there's a beer in the fridge that you want right now, you can take it to your table, too.   -I've had good salads and good burgers here. I like the fresh cut fries, too- can never go wrong with ordering them!  All in all, a great little bar to go to right outside of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the carni square pizza is ALWAYS BURNT. I think I'm done ordering from there we usually get take out Pizza because there isn't a decent pizza place in Oakmont or Verona. One time it was so burnt I had to call them to bring me a new pizza which they did. The staff is very nice and I appreciated them replacing the pizza and quickly. My husband and kids go in to eat the wings with are ok. I wish I could give a better review but they are out of chances with me and it seems like they changed their pizza sauce."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday with a client.  Food as always was very good. (Love the tater tots), and the service was impeccable.  We were doted on by a team of employees.  I only wish I could get there to watch a Pens game."}
{"text":"I love this place! Most restaurants/bars you have to wait 10+ minutes before even getting seated at Carnivores you seat yourself and someone is at your table with menus within minutes.    I got the chicken tortellini salad and it was huuuuge. My friend got the wedge and I couldn't believe my eyes, she had leftovers for a week.   I've worked in this business when I was younger, it's a lot harder than it looks. These girls work their butt off! Keep it up! I'll be back tomorrow for the Penguins game wing special!!"}
{"text":"Stemmed like a typical Bar with too many Beers available, but did have my lame Beer if choice Coors Light.  Had the Steak & Cheese Hogie which was very, very good.  Came with some great fries."}
{"text":"Classic pub style food.   I love their tator tots,  but I find most of the food to be a little greasy.  But let's be honest... you kind of expect that with pub food, right?   It can very crowded and because it's seat-yourself I often find myself getting lost in the crowd for a while before the staff notices me.   It's a good option if you specifically want that style of food."}
{"text":"Lives up to its name. Carnivores. They have big meaty sandwiches, the Italian Stalian is my ultimate favorite! And the loaded tater tots are a go to with friends, tons to share. Huge beer selection including my favorite Summer Shandy's and Red's Ale."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection (with on tap and build your own 6-pack options), above average bar food, TVs at the booths for the kiddos, open air seating in the warm months, fast service and delivery, and extremely reasonable prices makes Carnivore's a great stop in Oakmont."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are good. We had a party of 6. The drinks came out at different times, so did the food. On average 15-20 mins apart. This made for a very awkward and unusual dining experience.   Good beer selection -10/10  Food was delicious 8.9/10  Service 1/10"}
{"text":"Good pub fare!    Things I like...good bottle/draft beer selection, pizza  Things to improve...I am fish sandwich freak - no real good one here."}
{"text":"I posted a great review at the beginning of 2016- specific to service as well as food. Since the owners opened a second restaurant in 2016-pub 333- the service has gone down hill. My office is in oakmont so i have been a regular on thursday nights. Im used to the previous manager jen and staff being friendly and accommodating. The waitstaff now are no longer attentive and i have to ask for what i need (past 3 times ive been here)...and i sit at the bar where i would think it would be a lot easier. As i write this, there are 9 of us sitting at this huge bar with no one behind it and my drink is empty. The guy that waited on me is sitting at a table with friends. On a good note- there is an older blond haired lady that is working her ass off."}
{"text":"Next time you want an appetizer for 10, order the Tot-chos.  You've been warned.  As Trump would say, \"It's huge.\"  Then again, you could say that about most of their food -- they don't skimp.  The menu is vast and varied, so when in doubt go for favorites such as Shrimp Like Wings, The Jimbo, or any variety of pizza.  Oh yeah, free popcorn is available if that's your thang.  If you can't find a beer you want on tap, there's a good selection of bottles + cans in self-serve coolers with different drink specials most days.  With their collection of well-placed HDTVs, be ready for a sports hungry crowd, even if there are no other events on TV except CFL game.  Huh?"}
{"text":"J and I stopped here for a quick bite. We have heard good things about this place and figured we would check it out. Parking was decent as it's nestled in a little strip mall and the venue is pretty large. Larger than most sports bars we have been to. They also had roughly 20 large tvs and each booth had their own personal tv which was really nice. The menu is pretty large with lots of different options for a meal, from sandwiches to pizzas, tacos and hot dogs. Another plus is the bathrooms were large and clean for the most part, decorated very modern in comparison to the dining area, and had a tv. The only con about the ladies bathroom was there were piles of dust bunnies on the light fixtures and vents which was pretty disgusting. J ordered an iced tea and I had a lemonade. Both weren't terrible, just really strong. We each ordered the small pretzel bites to start. We got a large amount, close to 15, and they were overcooked. The cheese sauce was made with beer and therefore runnier than we would have liked. J ordered a cheesesteak hoagie and I had a buffalo chicken wedgie. Both were not that great. Way too cheesy. With my wedgie, I was overpowered by the blue cheese that I couldn't taste anything else, and it was pretty sloppily made. I will say that you get very large portions of food which is nice, however the actual flavors are less than optimal. We actually expected a lot based on the area, and the amount of seating, and we were pretty disappointed. Oh, and our bill came to around $44, which J was NOT happy about considering the quality of things. Needless to say we will not be returning."}
