{"text":"Love this place.  Best indian food in the cleveland area.  Very nice place to sit down and have a relaxing dinner.  They also do takeout.

Would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the prices being a little high."}
{"text":"Serves , food, and suggestions  were all top notch.  Coming back to try the Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception catered by Cuisine of India, led by Shishir and it was incredible. He not only catered Indian food, but he managed to perfect west indian, thai and chinese food as we had multiple food stations. The food was delicious and Shishir was wonderful to work with. I would rate his appetizers among the best I have had at any wedding (I may be bias)!! Highly recommend his catering for any event, any size. His prices were reasonable and the quantity of food was better than all of the other caterers that we inquired about. I hope you will try Cuisine of India for your catering needs!"}
{"text":"The owner has a very hospitable attitude and takes great care of his patrons. The food is definitely amazing. Butter chicken and kebabs would be my recommendation. Also, Peshawari naan is a must try. Do visit this place if you really like to enjoy real  authentic indian food."}
{"text":"I have eaten before here once and was really impressed by the taste of the paneer curry and the tandoori chicken. The portions were nice and were good value for the money. 

We went again to celebrate an occasion and were very disappointed with the experience. The portion sizes were reduced by half and the food was very spicy (I can handle spice very well). The biryani was just average.  Too bad."}
{"text":"My husband (who is from India) and I stumbled upon this restaurant when we were in the neighborhood. It was dinnertime, so we decided to try it. The first impression was very positive, as the restaurant is lovely: good lighting, attractively painted walls, a slightly exotic, modern feel, which was surprising given the location. 

My husband had the Chicken Biryani, and it was very well seasoned with multiple flavors and spices balanced just right. He loves Biryani in general, and this was some of the best we've had. The serving was huge and, as with all their dishes, he could choose his preferred heat (spiciness) level on a scale of 1-10. 

I ordered the Baingan Bhartha, a roasted eggplant dish. I'll admit that when it came to the table I had my doubts, as the only identifiable food in the dish of purplish mash was an occasional whole green pea. However, it was DELICIOUS, and while it looked like a small serving (compared to the huge serving of Biryani), I was unable to finish it all and took some home. Like the Biryani, it tasted very fresh and had a great mix of flavoring. I would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Indian in Cleveland and it was a pretty decent experience. 

We ordered samosas as an appetizer. They had too much spice for my taste. We both ordered the chicken tikka masala as our entrees. We were able to choose the spice level. My partner didn't like that it had onions and peppers. He ordered a side of naan and it was a generous portion. 

Our beer was served in a frosted mug which is always pretty neat.

The server was very nice and attentive. The manager or owner asked us how our meal was.

I would come again."}
{"text":"I had read some of the reviews on here prior to checking out Cuisine of India and almost decided against going there due to some of the negative ones.  I choose to give it a shot and take my girlfriend there anyway...  I lived next to the Taj Mahal in Columbus which was a five star Indian restaurant renown throughout the city.   The owner and I were very good friends and he often gifted me with various dishes.  Pretty soon, I had eaten every kind of Indian cuisine imaginable.  With that being said, prior to entering Cuisine of India, the majority of all Indian food I have ever had was from the five star Taj Mahal personally cooked by the owner.  

With this previous experience being considered, I find myself being quite the critic of various Indian restaurants I have tried thereafter.  Upon entering, I was impressed with the cleanliness, interior design, and setting.  It feels somewhat classy without the uptight vibe.  We ordered samosas to start followed by the chicken saagwala, navrattan korma, and peshawari naan.  The water was served from ice cold pitchers into very nice glasses on the table.  The waitress was curious with a great sense of humor.  They started us out with a complimentary basket of \"pita chips\".  I've never had pita chips like they make them at Cuisine of India- We really enjoyed them!  Every dish was on-point and taste was a 9/10.  

If I can offer any constructive criticism to the restaurant, it would consist of the following:  Lose the big screen TV from your main seating area playing the \"top 10\" Indian music station, it's unnecessary and a distraction from the otherwise great setting.   Besides that small shortcoming, this place is phenomenal and I would recommend them to anyone looking for authentic, great tasting Indian cuisine.

{"text":"Obviously, it does look like these guys removed my earlier review. 

Bad Service
Bad food

Indian food is with a lot of flavors and not hot/spicy. This is not Indian food. By throwing in hot peppers/spices, you can't make what they call Indian curry. The dude made it look like it was our mistake that we went to his restaurant for dinner. And BTW I spent $70 for bad food.

I'm not going back again."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Our Pani Puri was a  delicious start, the buranyi and aloo gohbi perfectly seasoned. We are big fans of India Garden in Lakewood and we find Cuisine of India to match or surpass them."}
{"text":"Was here for a saturday afternoon buffet. The best Indian buffet I have been to in cleveland. Good variety and very tasty food. Great service too! Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get Indian food in the Cleveland area. Fresh fresh ingredients, great flavors, love it. Had the buffet, did not leave anything to desire. Happy customer!"}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland. We've gone to the lunch buffet a few times now and it is always great! The place is always busy and the food is always fresh and flavorful!"}
{"text":"According to Toronto Life magazine, Cuisine of India has re-opened at Yonge & Davisville - http://www.torontolife.com/daily/daily-dish/opening-daily-dish/2011/05/20/cuisine-of-india-an-old-north-york-favourite-reopens-in-davisville/"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. I recently had the chana masaledaar, which is a vegetarian dish with chick peas and veggies. I asked for spice level 7 out of 10,  Love spicy, and it definitely had a kick, but was not overwhelming.  i have tired many of the vegetarian appetizers and meals and have never been disappointed. Atmosphere is a little lacking but the food and service are excellent."}
{"text":"I had couple of decent experiences at Cuisine of India. its a OK restaurant. Samosas were nice and crispy. The food was little bit savory  (may be too much tomato puree). They should increase the quantity of food. The prices are comparable to Saffron Patch in Akron (another ok restaurant). However, the quantity is about 60% of what you get in saffron patch. We ordered Kadhai Paneer and there were hardly 5 small-cut pieces of paneer in tomato based curry."}
{"text":"This has been a go-to for us for a long time. We've been to India many times and have had some great food - this is very close to what we had there. I am surprised to see the negative reviews. I have not had any experience like that here. 

I highly recommend their Paneer Tikka, which is as good as it gets. Also, Navrattan Korma and Gobi Manchurian are high on our list. A couple months back I went there with some clients and had the tomato soup - it was amazing! As with any of the Indian lunch buffet's - its okay.

The owners have continually remodeled and they keep the place looking good. As for the service - for us it has always been just fine. 

One big comment: I enjoy spicy but they have a scale of 1-10 and we order a 3. Even that is sometimes too hot. Please do take this comment seriously - I couldn't imagine a 5!

Overall, well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I get take out from here at least once a month, and I have never had anything that I didn't like.  I spent two weeks in India a couple of years ago, and this is the only Indian place in Cleveland that has biryani comparable to what I had in Pune.  I would rate 5 stars if it weren't just a tad bit more pricey than I think it should be, and were it not for the fact that the \"bar\" in the middle of the dining area is just an afterthought."}
{"text":"It was ok food and slow service. Water was not filled only on our table! We were ordering out of menu and not taking lunch buffet. Took too long to get the check."}
{"text":"I have been to cuisine of India may times in last six years of stay in Cleveland.
I have been satisfied most of the time with quality of food. After few bad experiences finally I have decided to write a review. I would give it 2.5 score out of 5 .
Food is okay except for Naan, their Naan is stiff and hard to chew. I always had great Naan at Jaipur Junction soft and fresh.
A great hot and sour soup.
They use good quality containers for carry out.
Prices used to be decent few years back but now they charge you like they are some high society restaurant but really they aren't. I really don't care how the interior of a restaurant should look like , but the place is nice and comfy. 
Waitresses are usually not Indian , doesn't really matter for me but I know they would not be able to explain any dish to a person who doesn't know much about Indian food. 
Once in a while you get food which you can tell is not fresh, few items from appetizer menu.
Quantity is very little compare to any other restaurant (Indian or any other cuisine) specially compare to price you pay for the dish. 
It would not be that bad to eat there any try out but it is certainly not the place where I would love to go again and again."}
{"text":"Good food basic Indian food nothing spacial...only thing about the buffet they never put out enough food its like no one is checking and u have to wait a while if your hungry around that time brace yourself it might be a wait; there's never really any deserts ...the waiter is very smug but other than that great place and atmosphere is good..."}
{"text":"There is a female server who is always constipated and can be rude at times.Food is ok.The server who is there for some time should learn to say hello smile or should be washing dishes . In America it's always better to have basics of customer care , just see the boys and girls working in American stores. If you have personal problems and don't like working as server find another job."}
{"text":"I have had dinner here and really enjoyed it. However, this review is on the buffet. I've had the buffet here three times and it just keeps getting worse. The staff doesnt pay attention to the buffet. The chicken paneer had no chicken in it because it had been picked over. The nan was sitting there so long it was as hard as peanut brittle. Nothing seemed fresh! Also, there was inauthentic items on the buffet like rice noodle. Im not coming here again for the buffet."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty!  We were pleased with this experience.. Hope to be back very soon."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! Ordered a take out- came 40 minutes later and my food was not ready- the waitstaff was on their phones and would not come to greet us. I had to physically go up to someone who was sweeping the floor to tell them that I would like my order. 
Rude.  Sat there for 20 minutes ( this is now 50 minutes after they said my order would be ready) never again. I will take my business to tadka"}
{"text":"Food was ok but service was terrible. Few people in the restaurant but the wait staff basically ignored us"}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall, but when we entered I felt strangely uncomfortable in my running short and hoodie....ahhh I proceeded to a booth because damn-it I was hungry! It has a nice ambiance with the decor and music, ironically its down the strip mall from the shop. 
My boyfriend and I absolutely enjoyed all our food here. We ordered the lentil soup as a appetizer to share. It was great with the perfect amount of spice. For dinner we ordered chana marsaledaar (our favorite) and chicken tikka tandoori. Both entrees were delicious. The chicken tikka was so moist and succulent I actually can't stop thinking about it. I plan to get this dish again fo sho. The chana marsala was great as well. For all the dishes we got a 7 for spice level, which was pretty darn hot. Next time I think we will take it to a 6 so my boyfriend doesn't sweat bullets into our food. 
Our waitress wasn't the best and she kept leaving our glasses run dry. Luckily there was a pleasant young man that came to the rescue!
All in all this place is a great Indian hot spot in the area. Their lunch buffet is supposed to be awesome so I plan on stopping in for this soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the food. The owner of the restaurant personally came to our table & explained the menu to us, he was very informative & friendly. The food tastes exceptionally good,but dinner was a bit pricey. The waitress didn't understand Indian food real well which made for a humorous visit:)"}
{"text":"I asked if a chicken dish could be made with only white meat and I was told no!  Not, I'll check, but no!  After I only ordered garlic naan he came back out and now could make it with white meat.  No thanks. 

As I was checking a phone message suddenly, there was a man rubbing my back!  YUCK!!  GROSS!!  GET YOUR DAMN HANDS OFF OF ME!!!  Not exactly sure who he was, but I believe he worked there. He was talking to someone at another table and then came over rubbed my back and then rubbed the shoulders of my son's friend.   

My son and his friend said their food was ok.  My garlic naan was burnt and had no garlic.  

I will never go back."}
{"text":"Updated review, now a days their naan quality is reduced a lot and their weekend buffets are not that great. They used to have a lot of options, now they have reduced them a lot. I had to request for chutneys and many items a couple of times. btw they didnt change the price. I used to love their Naans but not anymore."}
{"text":"They screwed up on the spice level. My boss had ordered the spice level \"7\" (out of 10) and the dish was not even \"-1\"!! My dish was at \"5\" even though I order the spice level of \"9\"! Also, my boss' samosa was cold. Very disappointing visit!!! The service is very slow. It took almost 30+ minutes for our food to arrive (I guess they warn you about that in the fine prints on their menu!!)."}
{"text":"This place has pretty nice decorating... and the food is to die for!  Their Chicken Vindaloo is really great -- I recommend that particularly.  Their Palak Paneer-like dish I had was alright too, but it couldn't compete with other's dishes I've had.

Overall, I'd recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"The food is really good but what smart business closes as dinner time starts and reopens after dinner"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Service needs work. Frustrating dining experience on several visits due to incompetent or untrained wait staff. Hope they will correct this and then 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant for lunch because the food is excellent and the service is top notch.  It's not the fact that I like Indian food that keeps me coming back, it's that the food is well prepared and made from scratch with real fine ingredients and spices.  Keep up the good work and I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE Indian food fan, have had it internationally and back home in New York. I regularly seek out new Indian restaurants in new cities that I visit or live in. I have to say, Cuisine of India is one of the best that I've been to!

The food is very fresh and made with quality ingredients. My husband and I really enjoy going to the weekend buffet-which also includes MIMOSAS!  The buffet has a variety of regional dishes from across India, many dishes I've never seen available on a buffet, or even listed on menus! It's fantastic to see various regions represented culinarily. They also have an assortment of ever popular Indo-Chinese dishes like haka noodles. The buffet is always clean and very well stocked. Service, which often is lackluster at a buffet, is ALWAYS great. 

We've also had sit down dinner and take-away from the restaurant. Service is, again, always excellent. Their full menu has all the choices from the buffet, as well as many more options. I love their navratan korma, chicken makhani, and paneer masala. My husband loves the chili chicken (his favorite), and a variety of other dishes. We highly recommend the garlic naan, it is to date our FAVORITE garlic naan!

If you're in the area, and looking for Indian you must stop here! 

Oh-they also cater to Jains, vegetarians, and vegans, and many of their dishes can be altered to suit your dietary needs."}
{"text":"do we really need another melt or swensons review?!?!?! 

cuisine of india is awesome. for many reasons. including: absolutely delicious malai kofta, chana masala, samosas, and i'm sure everything else on the menu too. even better the day after for leftovers. the service is really, really good, including top notch service from the owners and tri-c servers. what's better is that it is RIGHT on my path homeward! the interior is not much to comment on, but it seems in the process of being renovated since there is a new bar smack dab in the center of the room that was not there the last time i visited. oh, and the best part is nonstop bollywood videos and indian mtv on the flatscreen -- saw the rocket singh video TWICE when i was there!"}
{"text":"This establishment boasts itself as a great place to eat Indian food. I (along with 4 more) recently visited this restaurant. We had an extremely bad experience. Let me first say that food was ok. It could have been hot (not warm as it was served). Nothing to write home about. Usually I overlook this if the service is outstanding. Alas, it was not. There were two individuals: Apollo and a short stature bar-tender. He was in hurry to get our order even before serving our appetizers. There is nothing more irritating than having your main course served before appetizers are finished. Food was warm, and I wish it was hot. Nan was good. Rest of the dishes were adequately warm. Rice was ok. In the end the waiter started to pick up dishes and people were still eating. That was the height of rudeness. I had to tell him (Apollo) to wait until all are done. If there was crowd waiting to be seated, I would have understood this rush. But there were only three other parties (4 and 3 people each) in the restaurant. I was furious. I asked for the bill which he brought. However, he stood there waiting for me to pay. I had to tell him that I am not quiet ready yet. If Mr Shah (the owner) really cared for his customers, he would take some action. By the way I have heard that he is quiet pushy as well. I rate this restaurant as \"Below Average\" with lot of room for improvement. I don.t think I will go there again, and my advice: stay away until those two individuals are gone.

{"text":"This little gem is tucked into a little strip mall on 130th. It's a great Indian place for dine in or take out.  The food is consistently good. 

The dining area is nice. Warm colors and low lighting create a cozy feel. 

For me, this place is good when we want to stay close to home."}
{"text":"Excellent and consistently great Indian food.  The menu is extensive and never disappoints!  Worth the trip to Parma Heights."}
{"text":"Every other day, for nearly 6 years, I walked by Cuisine of India and never really paid it much attention until people who lived no where nearby started recommending it. then i began to notice that lux cars were always parked there; it's one of the only places around this subway travellers' strip with a parking lot in front of the restaurant. and, as far as I can tell, it's free to park. 
but certainly there's more than the parking that caused these commuters from other parts of the city to rave about Cuisine of India. driving is one thing, but in this weather, i wondered, 'is it worth walking?'
so, i rallied my girlfriends living nearby to see just why commuters from other parts of the city were flocking. 
we got the impression that few local residents ever visited, since the host quizically looked at us (the group of asian girls) when we entered and waited to be seated. after establishing that, indeed, we were there to eat, yes, food from Cuisine of India, the service was attentive, patient, and warm. 
the a la carte portions at Cuisine of India are small, and yet incredibly rich. so you can sample a few and be full, without getting a food baby. unfortunately, i don't remember the names of the dishes we tried, but i recall that the curried cauliflower dish was very well-spiced, without being spicy. the naan are excellent, as are the spicy cracker-like flatbreads. the latter are served while you wait for your meal and the heat really does hit after a few nibbles, so pace yourself as you wait for your meal. 
Cuisine of India also serves a lunch buffet but I haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in the city...everything is great.  WIll  not however win any awards for it's decor! Moreover....they seem to have a permanent problem with their electric supply...everytime I have ever been there (I have been there a lot!) their lights are continually flickering...annoying and funny at the same time...food is fabulous."}
{"text":"Indian cuisine, let's not underscore my love of Indian food. for my fiftieth review, have to stay true and claim chicken curry with basmati is one of the best. medium spice and my sinus cold was clear for one day. what a delicious meal. Naan and pepsi to complete the starch and who is the big winner my friends. I have another craving for Super bowl today need to make a dash. let's see what Peyton can do, these Cavs don't have anything going on."}
{"text":"Best Indian hands down for Cleveland. I myself always find the best Indian in Cincinnati, Ohio. But this place is great. Service is excellent and they really  know how to do the spices! OHHHHWHEEE"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I judge all Indian places by the quality of their Saag and this place rates an A.  Today I tried the lunch buffet and was not disappointed.  Plenty of variety.  Just enough spice.  And only 10 bucks.  I like other Indian places around town, but there are none that I like more than this.  This is one of very few  5 star reviews I've given."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the caterer for my nieces Indian wedding & the food was delicious! Before the ceremony there was a full buffet of appetizers.  Although I don't know the proper names, my favorite was the chick pea salad -- very refreshing flavor! After the ceremony the dinner buffet was really a lot to choose from.  Again, not knowing the names - but there was nothing I didn't like & plenty I really enjoyed very much! The lentil soup, very nice flavor & not spicy.  I really enjoyed the huge platter of roasted & seasoned vegetables -- especially the eggplant.  There were a couple chicken dishes and a lamb dish with a sauce that was fabulous!
I'm in Cleveland a few times a year & look forward to visiting the restaurant to try more of their food.  We were very impressed they could do catering with large quantities with such high quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I did some bicycle touring in India for several months. We are not from the area and we're craving some Indian food. Found this place on yelp and it exceeded our expectations! The garlic naan and paratha were awesome and so were our dishes: paneer tikka masala (with gravy) and chicken tikka masala. The couple behind us ordered the paneer tikka dry and that looked great too. We topped it off with a deliciously sweet lassi (the sweetest we've had, coincidentally the tastiest we've had). The service was EXCELLENT and the owner was extremely personable and friendly. Thank you for such a treat!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give Cuisine of India more stars. This place is wonderful. Food, service, atmosphere, and value are all excellent!

I have returned to this restaurant many times since my first review. On our first visit, we had dinner and that was wonderful. However, we learned of their lunch buffet and that has been our go-to for a great meal. 

Their lunch buffet runs Tuesday to Friday for $9.95 and then the weekend champagne brunch buffet costs $13.95 (I think)  There is no lunch buffet on Mondays. 

The weekday buffet has many different items. We've seen tandoori chicken, chicken curry, Singapore noodles, basmati rice, vegetable fried rice, pakora, naan, lentils, tomato soup and  other entrees whose names I've forgotten.  Every single item is superb. 

The tandoori chicken is some of the best chicken I've ever tasted. The pieces are nice and small, which make them more flavorful. My husband and I agreed that it was far better than the chicken at Jaipur Junction (another local Indian restaurant) The same goes for their chicken curry - excellent, just excellent. 

Everything is flavorful, nothing is too greasy. If you enjoy Indian food, this is the place for you. 

The atmosphere is nice. Tables are clean with silverware and paper napkins. Lighting is good and there's Bollywood on a large screen tv so there's that LOL. (My husband and I enjoy watching the videos while we eat)

Service is very good. Used plates are removed quickly, water is refilled promptly and the servers have been extremely friendly. 

The weekend champagne brunch buffet offers more items, including chicken biryani and papri chat (hope I spelled that right). Papri chat is a great dessert with many levels of flavors.  Also included  are fruit juices, hot chai tea and yes, champagne. It didn't look like the expensive fancy stuff, but who cares, it's free! 

I know I'm gushing but honestly, Cuisine of India has become our favorite place to eat. I love Indian food and I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good North Indian food . Buffet is excellent.

Any craving for creamy shahi (royal) food - This is the place .(Dont expect the spicy Andhra food here ) 

My favorites are Panner Tikka Masala , shahi Paneer , Veg khoftha and chat.

Good ambience and a nice place to take some one who is new in cleveland."}
{"text":"We were treated very rudely here.  We called ahead to make a reservation and were told that none was needed, to just come in.  We got there about a half hour later.  Although the restaurant was only about half full, the server left us standing in front of the \"Wait here\" sign for literally ten minutes while he walked around and talked to other tables.  When he finally came to greet us, he told us that the restaurant was too full and they couldn't serve us.  I told him that we had called ahead and were told that we didn't need a reservation.  He responded that maybe they could serve us but that we would have to wait at least twenty minutes.  Are you kidding me?  I was so angry we walked out.  I have never been treated like this at any restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but nothing amazing.  My samosa was cold inside, but besides that it was good.

Service was clunky, and we were cheated out of using a coupon because the server didn't understand it."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Indian joint.

Decor is nice. Very orange. Bold colors. Strange huge bar with no seats in the center. Must have been something else in this space before??

Food was excellent. Can't go wrong with the Butter Chicken, spiced nice and hot the way I like. Billowy clouds of Naan...mmm

Service was good. They kept our water filled (a must with spicy curry!).

I'll be back...SOON!"}
{"text":"Cleveland, OH. I am not local. This is the second time in September  2015. I have come here. First time was in March 2014. Both times, I have  ordered only the Amritsari Paratha for my meal.

One of the best stuffed paratha I have ever had. It is almost a meal unto itself unless you have a big appetite. It is stuffed with paneer (Indian cheese), cauliflower, carrots, peas and potatoes, and garnished with fresh cilantro. Just rightly spiced. Made in tandoor (Indian oven). Served with yogurt raita. You may never eat pizza again without thinking about this paratha. Tells me everything else has to be real good if just this paratha is so exconsistently excellent.

You could order it as an appetizer for 2 to 4 people. Ask them to make it well done and crisp. 

Salt lassi here is very good, light, frothy and freshly made.

 Service with a smile. HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped over here as a recommendation from a friend on our way from Buffalo, NY to Columbus OH. We opted to go with the lunch buffet. I must say that service was mediocre to poor at best. The owner was around bit was focused on a table of ladies who seemed to be flirting with him and complementing him on his hair do. That being said,the food was mediocre as well, we had to actually ask the staff ( 1 guy ) to fill the line. The line was almost always empty and there was no concept of refilling water at the table, come on, you shouldnt have to ask for water to be refilled at your table. If the owner is reading this review, you ought to visit Buffalo, NY and see what customer service is like."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant. Always wanting to come back, I've been going almost once a week at this point. Best samosas I've ever had. Mutter paneer is my fave."}
{"text":"Although the place came with a fair bit of recommendations from friends, our experience has been so-so. The food has generally been unpredictable, with some days being really good, and others really bad.
The service has also been so-so. There was an occasion where we had been seated for 20 min, but no one came to take our orders. When we tried to get the attention of one of the staff (passing our table) to take our orders, she just gave us the cold shoulder and asked us \"can't you see I'm taking someone else's order\" and proceeded to spend the next 5 mins chatting up some customers who had just come in and take their orders. Needless to say we had the pleasure of exiting stage-left, and have not gone back to the restaurant since. The owners are generally very pleasant & very good at their service, but the other staff are not professional enough."}
{"text":"Good food , liked it . We had biriyani , my wife wants to give 5 stars , but I think it's only a 4 stars"}
{"text":"After a string of bad reviews I've written on Yelp, I'm more than happy to turn things around for Cuisine of India. 

I'm originally from Calgary, Alberta (any area with a very large number of Indians), so Indian food is a cuisine that I have come to be very picky about. It is hard to find a good Indian restaurant and even more difficult to find one that offers a buffet that is reasonably priced and tasty.

I went to Cuisine of India with 15 or so friends from school. Only a couple people had been there before but after calling ahead, the owner went out of his way to accommodate our group despite the fact that it is a smaller restaurant. They even went as far as to add items to the buffet which one of our classmates requested  ahead of time. The service was second to none and they made us feel like family.

Although the buffet was small when compared to some of the \"super-buffets\" that we are used to today, there was a good selection of items, all of which offered a unique taste of India. The butter chicken, my favorite, was done perfectly and had me going back for thirds. The food was flavorful but not overpowering and was constantly being refilled for us.

I was extremely impressed with Cuisine of India and will certainly be back in the future. Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times and have always walked out satisfied. The buffet on saturdays is very good. One night, they had no servers or cooks apparently so the owners were running the whole show. They were over apologetic and I'm pretty sure the paneer paratha was pulled out of the frier. That is the only bad experience at Cuisine of India. I always get the same dish (lamb vindaloo) and it is always to die for. Their chutneys are very good too. One of my favorite Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I really enjoy the food here. Generous portions and fair prices. Delicious food. Most entrées come with rice. Service is friendly and fast. Sure to return!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet during the weekdays and weekends are both amazing.  Large variety of dishes and appetizers.  I've been coming here for the last year and the restaurant has gone through so many upgrades inside and with the wait staff.  Will be back next week!!"}
{"text":"Did NOT like the flavors of the entrees on the lunch buffet at all. Kheer was pretty good, but was so thick it was like oatmeal. Never encountered that before. No match for Tadya."}
{"text":"The place closes at 10 PM and we entered at 9:15 PM. Late? Yes, one might argue. Hasn't it always meant that the closing time on a restaurant is when it's kitchen closes and the doors close, implying anyone who has entered and ordered can stay inside. This restaurant deeply disappointed me on this regard because the manager (maybe? She had food stuck on her fingers in a manner that would be gross) told us that they would have to make sure that we leave at 10 PM.. that was literally how she greeted us. I ask her,\" so can we or cannot we eat here?\" To which she replied,\"It's your call.. we can get the food in 15 minutes but you will have to leave  at 10\". 
Reviews are usually left for food, ambience and service taken into account. I leave this review just based on service. Ambience wasn't great when we visited because there was a tantalizing smoke with customers coughing all over. Stayed there for a mere 3 mins but managed to acquire a cold hearted service, a bout of cough and a stench in our clothes without having a chance to taste the food"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Cleveland. We hired this restaurant to cater our Indian wedding in Cleveland, and they exceeded our expectations. We were concerned about having Indian food catered, as any food served on a large scale can be risky; however, this was not a problem with this restaurant. Our guests were raving about the food the entire night, and continued to mention how delicious the food was the next day. My husband, who is Indian, tried a few different Indian restaurants in Cleveland, and his whole family concluded that not one compared to Cuisine of India. The owner was so accommodating, helpful, and friendly, not to mention he offers the most delicious Indian food that we will eat for years to come. We highly recommend this restaurant, and already gave out the information to our many wedding guests who asked where the food came from. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried it for the first time this week. Their lunch buffet was small but nice. There were 2 kinds of rice with Several different options of what to put on top. There was soup, lots of sauces, raita and a small salad. They have a full bar and the restaurant was VERY clean."}
{"text":"Apparently this used to be a restaurant before..but now it's turned strictly into a catering service.(  which really bums me out b/c it is DELICIOUS!).  My friend used it for her wedding   and everyone was raving about it.  The lamb rogan josh was melt in your mouth scrumptious.  The pakoras were the right mix of crispy and soft...the nice hint of spice and flavours in each bite.  Everything I tried was pretty amazing.  I think I may even just call them up and see if they do catering for one :)  Per the website the food is halal.  They also have a lot of veggie options as well.  I'm dreaming about their food right now!"}
{"text":"The first time I dined here, I enjoyed the meal. But the second time was another story. I was sat down by the hostess/waitress/bus girl (honestly I couldn't tell). The manager eventually came out to assist us. I asked for vegan options and he suggested an eggplant dish. When I asked how it tasted, he said it was like baba ghanoush. I went in with that impression, but it was nothing like that dip. I asked for a level 5 spice and it tasted like an 8. I couldn't taste the flavors because of this. The texture was horrendous. My party offered to share their dishes which they claimed wasn't that fantastic. The waitress they had on hand was very insecure and mumbling. Although she was sweet, she was very unsure and didn't know how to reassure her guests. Instead, she took my plate to the manager, who refused to come back out. I NEVER complain about a meal or ask to dock the bill, but I had to in this case. They said they wouldn't remove it from the bill, but that they'll fix it. When they brought it back, it tasted the same. I asked her if I could speak to him, but he refused to come to our table. My sister has worked in restaurants for years and was shocked. It's bad enough not to remove the uneaten meal from the tab, but to refuse to at least apologize in person was poor professionalism. My sister said \"They're not reimbursing or offering a future coupon--but to ignore your customers shows a lack of business integrity\". I gave it to my mother to take home to my brother (she fixed it herself and said it tasted better with the right balance of seasoning, which tells me it could've been fixed but they either put in little effort or they're not very intuitive at cuisine). We paid for the food, but didn't pay tip, because the service was awful. I refuse to return or bring anyone here because of the blatant disregard for customer satisfaction. It's a restaurant's job to provide good food and service, it's my job to provide money for the food and service. A customer shouldn't be forced to pay when both those things aren't being met to standards. And if they are being forced, they should be extended some kind of courtesy or apology. None was received here."}
{"text":"Upon my first visit, the dinner was amazing.  I was a little nervous because I've never been asked to rate my preferred spicy level on a scale of 1-10.  I went for an 8.  The couple sitting behind us gave me a look.  After the server walked away she commented that she had to stick around and see this because she never went higher than a 7.  I became nervous but it was not anything I couldn't handle.  I have decided that 8 is my max and I will not be going any higher anytime soon!  I have returned a handful of times since my initial visit.  I really enjoy the buffet especially when the owner's are present and they mix the \"chat\" (please excuse any improper spelling ).  Recently there has been some remodeling but overall the experience still seems to be quite savory!"}
{"text":"Mimosas/champagne now restricted to one serving per person."}
{"text":"First of all the waiters here are very bad mannered... one of them was a girl.  She is rude and arrogant. Even her tone of talking with customer was offensive... didnt even come back and ask us once whether the food was ok or not... even when we were leaving, no one came and thanked. These are normal etiquette of any resturant. I dont know how they got job. 
We asked for one bhuna ghost and one shrimp. Both of them were supposed to be served with basmati rice. But they served only one rice. Taste was ok. Little overpriced. But the two waiters specially the lady messed up entire charm of dinner. Who wants to be treated poorly in a resturant where you are paying from your pocket..."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. just your run of the mill Indian restaurant .
The service is decent 
The samosa was good.
My wife and I ordered 2 different chicken dishes  ( butter chicken and tiki masala) we could not tell which was which they because looked and tasted the same.
They gave us one serving of rice for our two chicken dishes , we had to ask for a second serving of rice.
This place will do in a pinch, but I would not make a special trip to come here"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time. This place comes pretty close to the best Indian meal Cleveland area has to offer. I ordered lamb makhani and my wife had lamb saagwhalla. On spiciness and seasoning, both dishes were perfectly seasoned. The Saagwhalla had a pretty tough lamb in it. They would've got off calling it mutton. The Paratha came piping hot out of the tandoor. That was great. We ordered samosa but after asking two different servers for it when it never came, we gave up on that. The ginger ice cream was a nice, cool finishing touch to a very savory meal. The experience was good all together except for that moment when another party's tandoori meal was served sizzling and smoking on a hot skillet right at the bar, in the middle of the restaurant. A display that sent most in the restaurant into a coughing and sneezing fit from the vaporized chiles. Needless to say, this place is good for clearing your sinuses as well."}
{"text":"The food is good when it is replenished on the buffet. We come here often, but I feel like we Wasted our money today."}
{"text":"Our second visit at the restaurant and this time the service was even worse and beyond repair. It is a shame that this restaurant CANNOT find good help because the food is pretty good. The servers are beyond horrible. 

We came in as a group of 7. We got menus and AELZEA(sp?) asked for our order and we told her we want some samosas. And she couldn't comprehend how many we needed since we had two different people asking her for them, so I had to spell it out for her \"we need two orders of samosas.\" 

Then she took our food order and wasn't friendly and did not know how to help the first person who gave her order, who had never been here before, what she meant by \"level 1-10?\" I had to explain she meant how hot do you want your food. After getting our orders she mumbled them back to us and then walked away.

I noticed we hadn't gotten drinks ordered so when she came back I mentioned it and she replied back with some comment that could have been interpreted as rude.

We get our food and she gave A TABLE OF 7 ONE PLATE OF RICE. We immiediately asked for another plate and she brought it out soon after but one or two people barely got any the first round and had to wait, while their food got colder, for more rice.

Flash forward to our paycheck which is by far the worst point of the night. \"How are we splitting up the check?\" Then when we answered her, she replied \"Yeah, I'm going to give you a piece of paper and you can write it on there.\" I was confused until she brought out one check and a piece of paper half the size of the check to WRITE DOWN HOW TO SPLIT IT UP. 

This is your job sweetie, and I will not do it for you. We ended up having everyone give one person cash and then they put it on a cc.

One of the couples who lives very close to the restaurant, and who was with me the first time said they've come here and Aelzea was their server then and she was just as bad.

I WILL NEVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN. IF I DO, I WILL ORDER OUT BECAUSE AELZEA, & ALL THE OTHER SERVERS ARE HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"One of the best Indians restaurants in the Cleveland Metropolitan Area. This food is very hot, fresh and delicious. Whether you decide to come here for dinner or come for their lunch buffet, you can not go wrong. The lunch buffet on the weekend does have a wider selection of dishes than the weekday."}
{"text":"Love the food, ambiance is quirky but warm. The staff is pleasant and attentive, though not high end, it still makes a great date night."}
{"text":"I went to this place because they said they have vegan food. My son and I went on a Saturday afternoon. They had a buffet which we did not want because I had no way of knowing what was in the dish. So we asked for a menu. They gave us a menu and never came back. We waited almost fifteen minutes and left. I wish I could speak about the food but they never gave me the opportunity to do so."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant! I have never been disappointed with the food here, and have eaten it countless times. Overall service is good and they cook it according to your spice level (1-10). I usually go with a 3 to get a nice kick..(don't want to imagine what 10 is lol). Would definitely recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Cuisine of India is pretty much as good as it gets in OH and the closest thing you'll find to a high class Indian restaurant. Even though it has a buffet, it's mainly to allow people to try things as a lot of customers are new to Indian food. The owner is a very friendly and helpful man, and the staff are polite. Place looks good and has a bar, but they're currently not using it much due to lack of a skilled bartender. The food is presented to be visually appealing and tastes great, they nailed the right spice level I was looking for on my vindaloo and the side orders like pakora are surprisingly spicy as well. If you're looking for delicious and spicy food you should definitely check it out, their buffet changes every day so you might find something new."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner Friday night. It was just us, and 3 other booths in the entire restaurant. Service was attentive, food came out fast and delicious. We had the bhuna lamb (spice level 6) and chicken tikka masaala (spice level 3) - fantastic! We also had a side order of naan which was also really good. Overall, fantastic, looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian food! Service was attentive and friendly. Atmosphere, decor and ambiance could be better."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in the Cleveland area. First of all the food is always at the perfect spice level. You can pick the spice level that suits you. The range is 1-10 with 10 being the spiciest.  I always pick 3 which is the spice level of the buffet.  

The staff is wonderful. My fiancé and I have been going here for over three years, and the owner always remembers us and takes the time to talk.  

The decor is recently remodeled with a nice open style. They have a full bar and play bolly wood music videos on a large flat screen. It's fun and not over bearing. 

If you have never eaten Indian then I have some suggestions. Start with the samosas as an appetizer.  Then choose a couple dishes to share. I suggest 1 veggie and 1 meat dish. Then order some bread (naan). The chicken biryani (sp) is my favorite for the meat dishes. 

Oh and as a word of warning, the after dinner candies taste like the worst thing in the world. They were not meant for western pallets, but if you want to trick your friends into eating them then by all means. Lol"}
{"text":"Great food but boring atmosphere. I've come here for 4 years and love the buffet the most. Butter chicken is smooth. All their types of naan are fresh to order. You will not be disappointed in the freshness and in how well all the dishes are spiced."}
{"text":"Recommend with hesitation.  Unprofessional owner and very rude and loud to employees. Ok to customers.  Food is good and delicious. Quantity is less. Prices r above average. Customer services is poor.   Not well trained staff.  Could do much better.  Location is average."}
{"text":"I wanted to kill myself eating at this place.  The waitresses were absolutely retarded and did not know anything about Indian food.  I was quite surprised to find different ethnicities trying to pronounce Indian fare.  Call me old fashioned, but ethnic food has to be authentic.

We waited 30 minutes for the apps and 1 hour for the dinner.  Other tables got so pissed that they started making their own drinks at the bar.  

Stay away.  This place absolutely sucks."}
{"text":"This is one of the Indian Restaurants near my place where I go for their weekend buffet. They have a pretty decent spread on weekends and the price is competitive. I like their curries, mutton Rogan josh in particular. They can spice up the dish based on your preference. I usually go for 8 and above with my curries as I eat really hot food."}
{"text":"This is a solid Indian restaurant in the 'burbs. Went for lunch and to be honest Indian buffets really turn me off. But I appreciated that this one only offered around 8 dishes (including rice and naan). I reluctantly got the buffet when everyone else in my party opted for the buffet but I was pleasantly surprised. They offered a veggie masala, a paneer dish, and a chicken curry that I found to be really good! This doesn't compare to the amazing Indian cuisine restaurants in Chicago, but it'll do."}
{"text":"It is my third visit to this place and I am fairly disappointed with the service especially at night after 9pm. My friends regularly visit this place but for some reason at night the service is poor and servers try to avoid the customers because they are in a hurry for closing the restaurant. Today I had a friend visit me from columbus and I took him here but the attitude of the servers was a disappointment in itself and I really felt embarrassed. Moreover there was a thread of hair found in my friends dish which further insinuated the bad experience. No compensation was provided for the incident and even before my friend completed his food the server came in with the bill. We don't expect much but in a great place as such one should not compromise on customer service. It is very annoying for a regular customer to be treated this way at your restaurant."}
{"text":"Tucked in a strip mall, I was pleasantly surprised at the warm, welcoming atmosphere as I walked in.  Vibrant colors and elegant but minimal decorations make the restaurant feel very homey yet modern.

I came for the Sunday champagne buffet, and while it didn't offer hundreds of selections, there was plenty to satisfy our group of 6 comprised of both vegetarians and non-veg folks. 

Every item I tried was delicious and fresh, and several dishes had me coming back for second and third helpings.  The samosas are crispy and light, the butter chicken smooth and flavorful, chicken biryani tasted fresh and bright, and the carrot halwa had me going back multiple times because it is just that delicious and sweet.  They also offered gobi manchurian, and although at the time I had no idea what it was, I returned for multiple helpings and just couldn't get enough.

The buffet also offered orange and apple juice, an offering of desserts, champagne (there did not seem to be a limit) and hot chai, which was a lovely complement to the meal.

The staff was very welcoming and gracious, especially to a relatively large group that came in with bags of holiday gifts to exchange (this was in February) and where very kind about us taking up a large table and several hours. 

I will definitely go back, and often, and will be recommending Cuisine of India to all my friends."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Nicer decor than expected, you'll forget it's in a strip mall. We went for dinner around 8:30p on a Saturday. 

My wife and I split a chicken rogan josh which came with basamati rice, and the portion size was perfect. We were able to choose our spice level on a scale from 1-10. We like it spicy and 6 was plenty. 

We also ordered a double order of garlic naan which was great too, along with a mango lassi (better than my sweet lassi). 

Total bill came to just $28.

They have a lunch buffet (9.95 M-F, 11.95 S-S) which will be fun to try.  The menu is large, and they even have several goat dishes I'm dying to try on the next visit."}
{"text":"I went to a party recently that had their food catered from Cuisine of India.  I can't comment on the prices but the food was amazing.  I liked all the appetizers and mains especially the Chicken Tikka and Butter Chicken.  My sister-in-law had ordered from here and requested that all the main dishes to be mild or non-spicy.  For me it was perfect but my husband who can't handle spicy food was only able to eat the Butter Chicken & Beef Masaladar.  For the first time, my husband actually enjoyed Indian food because there were dishes that was actually not too spicy.  A lot of times at Indian restaurants, when we ask for non spicy it is still too spicy.  We really enjoyed the Butter Chicken which I plan to order soon for a holiday party coming up in December.  There was also an eggplant dish called Baigan Patiala that was also delicious but it was pretty spicy.  I might order it for my party and see if I can get this dish to be non-spicy.  I'll update this review when I get the full experience of ordering the dishes myself but the food was definitely really good."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here yesterday, Friday night after work. It was only 6pm and the place was already getting busy, so it's obviously a popular spot.

The food was INCREDIBLY good...amazing, in fact. I would give the food 5 stars but I'm bringing my rating down to 3 stars because I thought it was expensive when you factor in the portion sizes and the fact that the decor is kind of ghetto. 

I've been to some really nice Indian places downtown that have the exact same pricing but much nicer decor and slightly bigger portions. I'm a 115lbs female and if I thought the portion was too small, I imagine if you have a man-sized appetite you'd have to order 3 dishes for yourself.

I had the murgh lababdar which is an absolutely gorgeous chicken curry with some tomato, onions, cilantro and cream base. It was $14 and it came with about 3oz of chicken (4 large cubes) and 1/2 cup of sauce...just to give you an idea. It tasted absolutely amazing though! 

We also tried the channa masala (chick pea curry) which was equally tasty. I had a garlic naan bread (best naan i've ever had) and we ordered some pappadoms with mango chutney to start.

The service was fast but I wouldn't save the waiter was especially friendly, didn't say much, but he took our order and served the food quickly. Water glasses were filled up promptly. The building is kind of old and they should think about at least cleaning up the ceiling and slapping down a few coats of paint at minimum."}
{"text":"Two of us ate there last night. The ambience is fine - looks good smells good feels good. 
The following comments sound like a negative review. But they are all workable issues and I write them only so that other diners are aware when they choose this restaurant and to hopefully aid the restaurant in ironing out these details.

The service was an interesting play. Our conversation was interrupted at least once every five minutes by one of four different people coming to check on us. It was amusing. Very amateurish but with very good intentions. The waitress asked us what level of spice from 1 to 10 and she assured us that choosing three would be mild. We both have a decent tolerance for spice and don't like things bland. The dishes were inedible-so hot as to require a fire extinguisher. They took one back and doctored it up but it was no longer interesting, I think they added cream to it so the sauce was now very soupy.
The most disappointing part was that it was all extremely oversalted. This was not obvious until later when during the night I kept waking up and needing to drink water!
The salt problem is going to be up to them to figure out - if I ever go back I will know to order the spice level at zero or one. The amusing but mildly irritating service could be fixed with A manager observing and educating the well-meaning staff."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet there today. The restaurant is nicely decorated and service was good. I thought the buffet was a little small in selection. The quality was good. I must admit I am not an indian food expert but all in all I thought it was a-ok."}
{"text":"This place has changed owners so many times over the past 10 years, but the food is still so so good! 
I loved the navaratan korma and butter chicken. This time we got chicken sagwala as well and it was just so good! The garlic naan hit the spot and was perfect for scooping up the extra curry. Still my favorite indian spot in the area."}
{"text":"We ended up lovely the chicken tikka make Marsala! But if you really do not like spice at all don't even order a 1! A 1 was way too hot and wet had to send it back and order a zero!"}
{"text":"Went to the buffet on Saturday. The food was ok but not the type of Indian we like.  There was no chicken tiki masala.  Tried some new things, but if this is what you are wanting and it's not on the buffet then it's just not the same"}
{"text":"Whenever I get a craving for Indian food, I come here. This place is amazing! The food is very authentic and the atmosphere is great. A good friend of mine is Indian (who was born and raised in India) and he says this food tastes as if it's home cooked. We've been to a few other Indian restaurants, but none of them beats Cuisine of India."}
