{"text":"Wow, amazing food, i loved it and so will you. This is da best! I have been looking for a place that makes Pasteles and Gandule rice just like Hawaii but now i know where to go. This is the real deal, you have to try it."}
{"text":"Every dish made by Ino's rice is always the best! Down home cooking with down home ingredients. The pastele is made all from scratch! You really can not get any better around town. If your looking for Hawaiian style catering I highly suggest Ino's rice... Plus the owner is one hardworking lady!"}
{"text":"I've been craving pasteles for a while now... I grew up with Puerto Ricans in NYC, so you know, I know a thing or two about their pasteles... 
After searching on Yelp, I found Ino's.  I bookmarked it and I've been meaning to order for a loooong time.  Well this past weekend I saw an ad on Facebook so I finally messaged them and put in an order.  

The owner, Conchita was super nice and answered all my questions and made a delivery to my hospital room (I've been in the hospital for quite some time now).  I ordered almost her whole menu and boy, it's worth every penny!!!  

I inhaled my plate of pastele lumpia (her special recipe), gandules rice, pastele and malasada within minutes!!  It was so good!!!  Almost every single bite had juicy pork in it.  Whole olives... even meat in the rice!  Everything was just tasty and well balanced.  Every bite was just awesome!

I'm gonna try her stew next time.  And I'm def gonna order more pasteles... I love how she uses organic bananas too!  

I've been eating the pasteles all week and is sad that I'm almost out.  Have to call in for another order!

Yum yum in my tum tum!"}

{"text":"The BEST pasteles/pastele stew/pastele lumpia and Gandule rice EVER! Can't go wrong wit mama ino's cooking. She has passion for the art of pastele which makes it the best! Bomb dot com! You'll be craving for more."}
