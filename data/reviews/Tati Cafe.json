{"text":"Very nice place and service great. Their breakfast is very good. I ordered the vegetable breakfast mix but they have several options with chicken and sausages"}
{"text":"This cafe is a hidden gem!   I went there with my friend and tried the iced coffee and the Persian tea as well as the smoked salmon and turkey sandwiches. My favorite one was the Persian tea served with saffron sugar.  One small pot is $4.99 but can serve at least 4 small cups (as shown in the photo). The coffee flavor was also pretty good and I could finish it with milk without adding syrup.  The sandwiches were very homemade and delicious. A sandwich costs about 6 to 7 dollars depending on the ingredients.  I think this price is very reasonable given the location and price premium usually charged on food items at cafes.   We came here on a Thursday night.  The atmosphere was quiet and nice. The owner collects books for customers to read at the cafe.  Feel free to bring your old novels to add to their collection!"}
{"text":"A fresh new cafe in Richmond Hill and everyone need to give it a try!  We were walking down Yonge St and decided to try out the cafe, and we are very happy that we did, this place is another hidden gem and a great place to stop for a coffee, tea or snack. Tati Cafe is run by a lovely lady named Tati and she is very proud of her place, and she also designed the place.  We had the best Chai Tea Latte ever! It's made fresh from vanilla black tea, not that overly sweet mix used in other cafes. I'm not a tea person or a Chai Latte person, but I will definitely have another one of these!  We also tried the Cinnamon Latte. It starts with a nice latte, very well flavoured, not too strong, not to bitter, just right and lightly flavoured with cinnamon.  The soup of the day was a homemade beef barley, very tasty and well seasoned, and it's served with a side of whole grain toast.  I stopped by on another day for lunch and had the Chicken Sunshine Hot Pan, served on a hot skillet, as the name implies. A skewer of marinated grilled chicken, juicy not dry at all, two perfectly cooked fried eggs, a good serving of veggies including beans and broccoli, lightly sautéed potatoes, all very well seasoned. I would order it again and will try the other Hot Pans."}
