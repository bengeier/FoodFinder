{"text":"This is the best pizza and wings I have ever had in my life.  I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep, so I travel everywhere.  When I come to Cleveland I make sure I eat at Joe DE's Pizzeria.  I live in Chicago, home of the pizza and every place I've tried at home has nothing compared to Joe De's.  Order a Deluxe pizza and chicken wings with buffalo sauce.   I don't know what some of these negative comments are for but I think they're trolling."}
{"text":"Don't waist your money! I agree with the other negative comments! You don't get what you pay for, price is always changing for the same thing! If you order a deluxe you get barely anything on it lucky to get 1 piece of anything on 1 slice! I've noticed to someone is following the bad reviews with a good review!! Buyer Beware!"}
{"text":"This pizza is great! I got a large salad and a large pizza for 10 dollars! That's pretty cheap if you ask me. Couldn't have been happier. The guy who helped us was really nice too, gave us a menu and a magnet for our fridge and seemed to be proud he worked there. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Isn't worth one star. Quite honestly it's a flavorless chunk of dough with no sauce, you could take a piece of toast, and ketchup, salt and pepper and get more flavor than this lump of clay being passed off for pizza. The best way to judge a company is to look at their negative reviews, if they give an attempt to rectify the matter than they are worth dealing with. Now if after every negative it's followed by an abnormally huge amount of positives........ Then! EATER BEWARE. Google and yelp are great resources when used together. It's unfortunate I can't rate a 0."}
{"text":"We saw this place when we were driving down Fulton and picked up a pizza to go eat in the park.  Their pizza is great!  Since then we have been ordering from them often."}
{"text":"My all time favorite pizza pie. I drive 20 minutes to get take out from here. I love their pizza, I can eat an entire Joe De's pizza by myself. I also like their chicken wings too. They are breaded and fried (to perfection) and served with just an average side of thinned out BBQ sauce. It's not brain surgery, just deliciousness to go. Give them a shot, I know my stuff."}
{"text":"Dont think I'll be coming back. Pizza didn't have enough cheese and phillys , subs and fries were short and they cost an arm and a leg might have to tip with a finger R:(1/2 star)"}
{"text":"Onion Rings were terrible.  Mostly batter when you bite into them.  The onion itself was tasteless but there was an onion flavor like a seasoning put in the batter.  I like to have a little crunch when biting into a ring.  Not on these.   The Steak Hoagie was good.  I did order extra meat.  Just missing cheese.  Not sure if it comes with it but I remember asking for all the toppings.   Also ordered the Butter steak Sandwich. Not used to the lettuce and tomato on this type of sandwich but was okay.  I like them smothered with mushrooms and the sauce with the cheese and onions.  Different areas for different taste I guess. Buns tasted good and were soft like they were steamed before completing the sandwich and serving.   Was offered fries but found out they were just packaged type from a distributor and seasoning added so I declined.  Was not interested in fast food fries from a place that you had to wait 20 minutes for the food.  Do not mind the wait when it is hand prepared and good but they could have also cut fries from potatoes daily from a machine and have a much better taste.   Did not taste any other items.  Maybe the pizza's next time.   I think the prices were high."}
{"text":"Entirely mediocre. I've been driving by it for 5 years and decided to finally give them a shot. The only reason it gets two stars is because it wasn't entirely inedible. I ordered a Large Supreme and a De's Deluxe Hoagie. According to the menu, that should have been $17.00. My total was $24. So, either gratuity is included and I shouldn't have tipped the driver, their delivery charge is SEVEN dollars(!!!), or the menu is incorrect and their prices have skyrocketed. I just got the menu a month ago.   Pizza was ok. Sausage was good, pepperoni was boring, mushrooms were definitely from a can. I could barely taste the sauce and the cheese was bland and from a bag. Crust, meh. Every corner deli store in the country has this crust.   As far as the hoagie went: standard frozen sub bun, VERY thin layer of meat, bland cheese, iceberg lettuce and a few slices of tomato. No sauce, no peppers, no onions... BORING.   I guess the worst part is that I just spent $28 on a bland pizza and a shitty sub. You know what, upon further review, one star is what you get guys. Sorry. Shannon, if this is your all time favorite pizza, sweetheart, you are missing out."}
{"text":"2nd order was better then the first! Delivery time was accurate, food was hot, driver was pleasant and friendly! Small problem with bottom of pizza being a little moist last time GONE! I am a customer!"}
{"text":"Have been going here over 30 years, the best Pizzeria in the near westside, they treat you like family, know my voice & what I want to order..."}
{"text":"We love ordering delivery from here!  The sauce on the pizza is so tasty not bland like other pizzas.   The wings ordered crispy are wonderful!  Antipasto salad with their Italian dressing - yummy.  Great delivery service!  We order every week or so & have never been disappointed.   5"}
{"text":"I stopped at the St. Rocco festival the other day on Clark & Fulton & tried a couple slices of plain cheese. I was very impressed. The dough tasted very fresh & it had that sweet buttery smell that I remember as a kid when my great aunt would make homemade pizza. Also the cheese was nice & gooey, kinda tasted like brick cheese that my family uses instead of stringy mozzarella which always slides of the crust. They also actually put sauce on it as well. I hate it when you get a pizza & there is no sauce on it. I want pizza not bland bread & cheese like a lot of white breaded Americans places prefer. I've had pizza in New York, philly, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, LA, San Fran, all cities with high proportions of Italians who know how to do pizza & from what I tasted the other day at the festival This is going to be go to spot from now on for your basic but homemade authentic pie."}
