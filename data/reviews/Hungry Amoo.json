{"text":"We came for brunch and the food took over 30 min to arrive. Mimosas were garbage and the service was slow. We had eggs Benedict, the breakfast burger and the pancakes and the only thing of quality were the pancakes and the burger patty, everything else was sub par."}
{"text":"I went there on Sunday Night and I enjoyed everything about it. The staff are unbelievably nice and friendly, the food was delicious and their handcrafted drinks were simply WOW! 
It is a must go for everyone."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday in the evening and had the Tamarind Beef,  Mini Octopus,  Scotch Egg and Amoo's Salad. Entering the restaurant,  I really liked the decor and ambience of the place. There are several nice artwork pieces on display and there is a nice balcony with photos of various hollywood stars. Definitely a cool spot to a get that perfect Insta shot! 

Now on to the food...The Tamarind Beef was so juicy and pulled brisket was so crispy yet tender. The date sauce combined with the peanut created a very rich flavor and certainly created a fusion feel to the taste. This dish is definite  a must have! Your taste buds won't be the slightest bit disappointed!! 

This was my first time trying Scotch Eggs. I enjoyed the taste and how well it went with the house made sausage. 

The Amoo's salad is a light salad I'd recommend to anyone.. even those not big on salads. At the time it had beets which added a very spring freshness to it while being light on dressing. 

If you go there make sure to also order their signature cocktail with Saffron!! There's no drink like it anywhere else. 

Lastly, i had a chance to come here on a weekend again in the evening and found out the place was open til 2! They play a sweet mix house music which def got the crowd in a great vibe. 

Will definitely be coming back here! 
Good food.. Good drinks.. Nice art.. Even better service"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was great. Cocktails were fantastic. Stand out dishes were the tamarind beef, the burger, the pistachio soup. The chicken & popcorn and the falafel were also delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, been going since they opened in August. Love the tamarind beef and falafel is on point! Houman, the owner has a top knotch team of servers as well!"}
{"text":"Since Hungry Amoo's opened, I have dined there 3 times, and definitely I am  going  back for more jap chea and tamarind beef. Delicious foods, amazing drinks, friendly environment, and their enthusiasm to listen to customer's feedbacks are enough good reasons for my returns."}
{"text":"We were walking up Ossington looking for a place to have dinner and a nice guy outside gave us a 10% off coupon for this new restaurant. Menu looked good so in we went. Were we glad! The front half looks more like an upscale bar but there is a cozy section in the back with lots of tables. The menu has full dinners like manicotti, burgers etc but we tried the small plates section, ordered the charcuterie board, scotch eggs and tamarind beef. Everything was yummy. The board had just the right balance of tastes. Haven't had scotch eggs in a long time but they were done perfectly and tamarind beef was lovely.  The service was great and has a  really nice feel to it, cozy but modern with great background music. My dining companion was so impressed with the food told the waitress it was one of the best places she had eaten in Toronto. Guess the waitress told the chef how much we enjoyed out meal cause he sent out a dessert on the house!!  We will definitely be going back, just wonderful place, very well priced for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Delicious cocktails, amazing food and nice staff. One of hot new spots in Ossington.
Dont miss the Tamarind Beef and the Falafel. Chicken and popcorn is also exceptionally tasty."}
{"text":"We went on what must have been their worst day. They were having an issue with their internet and so they were cash only. They didn't tell us this when we arrived. They were clearly overworked and struggling. Another group of two sat waiting to pay for most of our time there. Two other groups got their food before us even though they arrived well after us (I think they actually gave them our food in the confusion) Unfortunately, the presentation of the food was lacking in my opinion and I was pretty hungry by the time my food arrived. I assumed I would find it enjoyable but I still didn't. 

Again, it was obviously a really bad day for them and I would try them again at some point but with all the other options in the area it won't be any time soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic Brunch Today!! Beautiful and Delicious Pancakes and the Brisket Eggs  phenomenal!! Can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Great choice for brunch in the hood. Pleasant change from the trendy overcrowded other restaurants in Parkdale...tasty food friendly service all reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto visiting friends and came to brunch at this place. Ahhhhmazing food and drinks! I ordered Amoo's Benedict. It was delicious!!!! 
I highly recommend this place. Staff were very friendly too. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Best service and amazing food. Tamarin beef & Amoo's Benedict were out of this world! Yummmmy"}
{"text":"I always get excited when a new spot opens up in this neighborhood. This one did not disappoint. Everything from the ambiance to the drink selection to the food was on point.

They have a great wine and beer selection, but if you're feeling a little more adventurous, they also have some interesting cocktails on the menu.

From what we ordered, the pistachio soup and tamarind beef were my personal favorites, but my friends were all really happy with what they had as well.

I hear they're offering brunch now. Will definitely be back to give that a try."}
{"text":"They forgot to put honey on the baklava.  Waiter was nice enough but still charged full price for shitty food. They were extremely slow Despite the place being literally empty. Starting to wondering how much I can trust yelp after this experience because this place was real real bad"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious food, amazing cocktails and great service!
If you are looking for a modern mediterian resturant, this place is a must! Try tamarind beef and the falafel."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try out this new restaurant!   Everything we had was delicious.  I highly recommend having the scotch egg and the tamarind beef...but in all honesty you can't pick anything on the menu and be truly satisfied!  

The gentleman taking our order was very informative and helped us make decisions.  Also, they have a small but great wine list.  I think it is the first time I have found a South-African Chenin Blanc on a menu.  I was over the moon.  

In conclusion...great food...great wine...great service...amazing price! It is a must go!"}
{"text":"A group of about 11 of us came here the day after Boxing Day and the entire place felt like a private dining room for us. With all the positive reviews on here, there weren't more customers coming in even around 9pm, except for a small group of people who sat at the bar. 
Ok, I think this had its good side in a way because we definitely were tended to by the one staff who acted as both server and bartender. And the entire two and a half hours that we were there sailed through in a pleasant and cherry vibe.

Before ordering anything I was keen on trying the Pomegranate Spritz and the taste of the vodka definitely hit my tongue but was also countered by the sweetness of the Cointreau.

I had already decided before going to Hungry Amoo that the stand out dishes I'd like were the Scotch Egg and the Cheesburger. I was not mistaken, because a few of my dining companions also picked the Scotch Egg to start off with. The sausage enrobed quail egg was crunchy with a good taste of the sausage and each person who ate it had nothing bad to comment. Other appetizers that were also picked were the Chips and Dips, Pistachio Soup, Amoo's Salad, Falafel which also another highlight of the restaurant and the Mini Octopus.

For my main, I had my sights set on the Cheeseburger which again amazed most of the diners as it all made a fuss about the way it was stacked and how I was going to try taking the first bite out of it :-) The Cheeseburger also hit the spot and the fries was were just how I like them.
Most of the table decided to get the Dirty Chicken with Basamati Rice plate and that choice was enjoy by those who ate their orders.

And to end the enjoyable dining experience, a couple of people decided to get the donuts which came on a generous bed of hazelnut spread with a few pipings of cream. I tried a bite of it and the cake texture paired of with the hazelnut spread definite got my up vote on it.

I hope Hungry Amoo gets more customers on a normal day. I was definitely happy with the laid-back and enjoy dining experience that our group had on that evening."}
{"text":"Cool, chill place . Staff are friendly and attentive . Food is amazing and I don't use this phrase lightly.
Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Went for summerlious. Wasuper dissappointing. We tried all the dishes and almost of them were lousy. Also when we arrived the host gave me attitude showing me his hand like \"talk to the hand \" when i was just gunna ask for the regular menu.  Wouldnt go back at all. Some of these reviews must be fake cuz the author only reviewed them. I guess they fooled me but hopefully someone will see this  lol  youve been warned. Oh also the place had like 4 tables and they still managed to take an hour to present us with undercooked rice amd what looked like baby food"}
{"text":"Great food with a touch of middle eastern ingredients. Tamarind beef is a MUST-TRY! Falafel dish is just amazing paired their house made hummus. The cocktails & wine menu offers a variety of tastes including sweet, sour, spicy and etc.

We went back again for brunch, great options on the brunch menu as well. I loved the mushroom and caramelized onion benny. Their pancake tower is again a Must-Try, it is probably the best pancake I have had in Toronto; it comes with bananas, banana whipped cream (delicious) and maple syrup. The right amount of sweetness and saltiness. The chef def knows what he is doing."}
{"text":"After leaving Ontario Place, my friends and I were hungry and looking for somewhere to eat dinner. We consulted several smartphone apps and a friend for recommendations but we still couldn't decide where to go. A friend suggested we try the neighbourhood around Queen and Ossington. I had heard there were some good restaurants around there. With so many choices, we still couldn't decide where to go but settled on Hungry Amoo because it had good ratings and an interesting name.

The space looks trendy, cozy, and intimate, with dim lighting, exposed brick walls, and patrons dining by candlelight. Very nice.

Our server was very helpful in explaining some of the dishes on the menu since we weren't very familiar with Iranian/Middle-Eastern food. He also told us that Hungry Amoo means Hungry Uncle. We chose the Tamarind Beef as an appetizer, Whole Roasted Eggplant as an entree and two of us chose the Kebob.

The Tamarind Beef was pulled brisket with roasted cashews and cauliflower, date sauce, and garnished with crispy lotus root chips. Delicious and very nicely presented! The meat was tender and the sauce didn't overpower the dish.

The Eggplant was also very nicely presented and colourful with the yoghurt sauce on it. It must have been good because there was nothing left. I did, however, get to taste the lentils and liked the flavours.

The lamb Kebob was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Delicious! The jalapeno puree added a perfect little kick and the pickled corn had a nice acidity. The couscous was perfectly fluffy and buttery!

Overall, we all agreed that the food was excellent! The ambiance and service were equally impressive. The chef/owner chatted with us for a while. Nice personal touch. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, 12$ pitcher(s) of mimosa, and great food. The baked eggs with house made hot sauce has easily become one of my favourite meals. 5/5 will come back soon."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Hungry Amoo for brunch and I was glad I took her recommendation.  The service was great and I loved the modern twist on the Iranian menu- the pistachio soup is my favorite.   All the food is delicious and fresh.  I would highly recommended it to locals and visitors.  When I am back in Toronto, I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Omg the brunch is beyond imagination! If you are a meat lover definitely try the brunch Burger or the Amoo's Benedict. For dessert try the pancake tower  also there is an exotic menu of alcoholic and virgin drinks"}
{"text":"How to attract people into a restaurant 101: Have an Aussie guy outside handing out coupons. 

It worked! My friend and I returned the next week for dinner. Hungry Amoo is a long narrow restaurant with a cozy, relaxed feel. It's a great place to catch up with friends, which from what the waitress was telling us, is exactly the vibe they were going for. 

I ordered the manicotti, which was just the right portion of flavourful pasta with mushrooms/truffles. Very delicious! My friend had the cheeseburger which she said was great! 

We didn't try the cocktails or share plates this time around, but we will definitely be returning to this establishment! Impeccable service and incredible food - highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Hungry Amoo is a casual restaurant and bar located in Toronto's trendy Ossington neighbourhood.  The word 'amoo' means uncle in Farsi which seems fitting as Chef Houman Pourmarz opened up the restaurant with his father and uncle.  Houman's vision of a cozy and intimate restaurant is a reality, with the space being in one of the oldest buildings in the heart of Ossington Village.

The food at Hungry Amoo is inspired by Middle Eastern cuisine and features a creative fusion of ingredients and flavours.  Chef Houman likes to use quality, seasonal ingredients to make his staple dishes really stand out.  His extensive experience working in fine-dining establishments in Canada and Iran and his passion for the culinary arts really does shine through in the unique menu,  the beautifully decorated space and in his strong commitment to making sure guests are satisfied with their experience.

The menu features many shareable items and main dishes.  The first shareable dish I tried was the Tamarind Beef which is incredibly tender beef brisket cooked in a date sauce and served with cashews, cauliflower and lotus root chips.  I for one would not share this dish with anyone.  I happily ate this entire thing on my own and was in flavour heaven.  I can't remember the last time I had such tender and juicy beef doused in an incredible sauce. This is a must-try dish at Hungry Amoo!

The next sharing dish I tried was the Falafel served with pita, hummus, charred tomato and pickled mango. The falafel tasted quite traditional but I found it to be a bit dry. The hummus was warm and flavourful and the pickled mango was a great sweet addition to this dish.

For the main dish I went with the Stuffed Chicken Leg served with rice, fava bean, leek, eggplant and kashk.  This was a huge main entrée that was plated so beautifully. The chicken was juicy and filled to the brim with rice and beans and surrounded by a delicious eggplant puree.  The flavours of this dish were mild which I really enjoyed.

For drinks, Hungry Amoo features a number of crafty cocktails, wine and craft beer.  They've also recently launched a brunch menu that I'm eager to try out.  The Pancake Tower sounds so enticing, it's a stack of pancakes topped with bruleed bananas, whipped cream and blueberry dust.

Hungry Amoo is a great choice for food and drinks and is a welcoming and laid-back spot on the Ossington strip"}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time with my parents. My mom called ahead and asked if they had vegan food (for me), what impressed me is that the chef spoke to her personally and asked her to tell them once we're there. 
We came to this place - very nice interior design, the music was pleasant and our server was great. I got a personalized vegan brunch from the chef - which was not on their menu. It was excellent. I wish I took a picture to post. I had fresh salad, lentils, and beans, but the combination of flavours was incredible. It may sound plain and boring here, but I assure you, my taste buds were happy. The only thing I have to mention is, they don't have any soy or almond milk. I wish I could have ordered a latté but I cannot have dairy because it makes me feel sick. I hope they'll expand their menu to add vegan meals because their chef is talented. You'll definitely get more traffic from the vegan community.
Thank you again and hope to visit you soon!
