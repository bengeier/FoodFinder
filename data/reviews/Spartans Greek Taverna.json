{"text":"I have eaten here about 5-6 times now and have NO problem coming back. I noticed it for a while before finally giving it a shot. They are not in the most prime location but I can honestly say their food is fantastic! What brought me in the first time is a sign outside advertising lunch specials for $10. What that gets you is insane - souvlaki (chicken, beef or lamb) on a bed of rice pilaf, a salad and the most delicious lemony greek potatoes out there!
I was told they have plans for future \"Greek\" nights which would feature entertainment and festivities. So far I have only been here for lunch but I definitely want to bring some friends over there one evening for dinner."}

{"text":"Food is great and fresh.  The best pita bread I've ever tasted.  It was fresh, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just enough salt to taste.

The staff was friendly and inviting.

Wait times were a little longer than expected for lunch but we also were with 8 people so that might have been a factor.

I tried the Moussakas (eggplant) which was delightful.  The lunch size was $11.95.  It came with the really good pita bread."}
