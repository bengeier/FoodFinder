{"text":"Another surprise - a dedicated Hot dog shop, right across from the Thai food stall. (Montreal has no outdoor Hotdog vendors.) But it narrowly misses that third star.  If there's one thing I appreciate about \"The Hot Dog Guys\", it's that they are confident about their product. Ask for a recommendation, and they'll give it. The Angus Beef is really as good as I've tasted from the best west-coast street vendors.  The problem comes from trying to adapt west-coast eating to this Indoor-stall style. I'm not going to dock points for the wait - expect 10 minutes, if there's no line - but rather, the toppings. This isn't like a sports stadium where the ingredients form a protective shell - when they hand you that hot dog, it's bare. Sure, there's a ketchup and mayo pump. But mustard, relish, olives, peppers? The other dozen ingredients you'd see at a street stall?  You have to either ask upfront what you want on it, or grab a few packets and hope for the best. (Their hours are also problematic, although I tend to write that down as being part of the food court.)  Don't get me wrong. The beef is great, and the fries worked out well too. Heck, it's possibly the only place to get a decent hot dog without taking the train!   But anyone who has been to a baseball game knows that a bare hotdog doesn't fly."}
{"text":"Le Faubourg & Corner Guy Street (Guy-Concordia subway station) The Hot Dog to end all hot dogs this side of the St. Laurent. If you are craving a hot dog, and I mean craving a hot dog this place is IT! Situated in the busy, busy 2nd level of The Faubourg Urban Centre, this place makes a ballpark Angus beef dog, I got the chili dog with sauteed onions and fries. The dog was big and the first bite was a mouthful. The chili was perfect, and we aren't talking about Michigan style, which is just brown spaghetti sauce with no beans, this was the kind you want to have a big bowl for later. The fries were old school, chunky and cooked until cripsy and golden and served in brown paper bag. I am going back for more, since the menu boasted a Pizza dog, A Quebecois (Bacon and Cheddar fondu!!), Le Francais (Fine Herbs, Gruyere, Moutarde Dijon- a very refined dog). Each dog is only $4.25 and a great deal! And have a 'tude, wiener dude! - If you know where I got that quote from the first hot dog is on me!"}
{"text":"Just had The Hod Dog Guysss and it was amazing! Juicy hot dogs with very creative toppings! I tried the \"Greek\" which was topped with Tzatziki, Onions and Tomatoes. Truly an authentic Greek Hot dog with all my favourite toppings. My friend had the \"Montrealer\" which was topped with Cheese, Sauteed Onions and Mushrooms and BBQ sauce. I took a bite and I was blown away by how good it was. The fries were really good too and you get a lot for the value. Reminded me of La Belle style of fries. VERY VERY GOOD for the value and I will definitely be back to try the other types of Hot Dogs.  *One thing to note: now that I think of it, the \"Greek\" could have had feta on it to truly make it an authentic Greek dish*"}
