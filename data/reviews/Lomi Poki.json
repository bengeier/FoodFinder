{"text":"Excellent food & service.  Fresh & delicious meal with healthy ingredients.  I got the salmon & Hawaiian tuna with brown rice and a mix of vegetables."}
{"text":"Did someone say sushi burrito??? Lomi Poki in my tummy! Being an LA Native, I def can be particular about my poki. Happened to be at the Best Buy store next door and saw this place. Walked in, place was clean and inviting. Staff were friendly and educated me on the various menu options. I decided on the sushi seaweed burrito with marinated Tuna & Salmon. Oh! and they did not skimp on the fish portions, good size chunks. With all the toppings and sauces you need, edaname, seaweed, roe, crab, avocado, spicy mayo ect. They also have this special contraption that rolls out a perfectly flat bed of rice for your burrito base.

Now for the taste test.....deliciousness!! Fish tasted very fresh and flavorful. If only you could see my first bite face. I will def be back for more."}
{"text":"This is by far the best poki place I've been to. They offer quinoa too instead of rice.They have fresh ingredients and large portions for a fair price. The staff is informative and friendly. They even have poki burritos!"}
{"text":"It's about time this part of town got a Poki joint.  I am big fan of Poki, and is always an amazing healthy lunch pick, if made in the right manner of course.  

Came in for the first time today before the lunch rush, and the service and staff are super friendly and very knowledgeable about their food.  The Poki was cool and fresh and to top it off they have a really great mango lemonade! I have they have a punch card because I will be back frequently!"}
{"text":"We found this place on a whim while looking for another restaurant nearby and it is delicious.  Friendly staff was helpful with our questions .. we tried the poke bowl, noodle soup and JianBing .. my favorite was the poke bowl.. they have several options to choose from... I got the quinoa with Hawaiian tuna & calamari - soooo friggin good! My 2 yr old daughter drank the noodle broth with a straw after demolishing the noodles .. think it's safe to say she enjoyed it! We just got the regular JianBing and my husband and I agreed that we could have done without it but was worth a try. We'll be back for our freeby for the review soon ;)"}
{"text":"First timer.... since I have been back from
CA haven't found any decent Poki. Saw the reviews on this and gave it a shot today. It was very good and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Service!! Huge portions and generous scoops.  Place is very clean. Lomi Poki! Yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"I got the Hawaiian tuna & Lomi salmon sushiritto. OMG, yes! The server was super helpful and wrapped my gigantic burrito without bursting it. Mad props cuz I always get everything on it. The spicy mayo was not overkill and the flavor is on point. I'm ready to go back and I haven't even left yet haha!"}
{"text":"Very fresh, good service, food tasted great, kids enjoyed it too. definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ok. Has a black mushroom salad u can use as a topping that I havent seen elsewhere. Nice size pieces of fish. Spicy tuna tastes like made with jalape√±os. I wasn't a fan of that. Cucumber salad over priced. 3 bucks for a side of it. And only was cucumber and vinegar sauce. Better one at poke bar. Rice was hot and made the fish sorta warm. They have poke wraps which might be worth a try. Charged extra for additional scoops of seaweed salad. Other places give u bigger portions for the price. Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"Got two Poke bowls, one with brown rice, Loki salmon and shrimp with toppings, and an Arcadian bloom bowl/ (salad bowl) with salmon and spicy tuna. Both were delightful! Bubbly atmosphere with friendly staff with clean workspaces. Lemonade is sweet and tasty, especially the mango lemonade mixed with green tea. The gelato puffle was awesome! The soft, but crispy bubbly waffle complemented the cookies and cream gelato nicely. Would definitely have it again. Ask for a double scoop though because the gelato to waffle ratio is just a bit off ;) We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Poke is everywhere in the Valley now and this one is one of the newest addition to Scottsdale.

They share a dining space with Green Bing. After I ordered my poke, I kept looking at their menu and am thinking about coming back to try them next.

They have the usual fresh fish in addition to pre-marinated salmon and tuna. I think this was the first time I saw pre-marinated salmon and I had to try. Pre-marinated version is all I saw in Hawaii. Tuna was just okay for me when I visited but I really liked their salmon.

Don't forget to leave a room for dessert! They make puffle. Combine with gelato, makes a perfect dessert. It looks big but actually quite manageable to eat one on your own as Puffle is very fluffy.

Two scopes of poke is less than $10. $1-2 cheaper than other poke places nearby. They have more unique side toppings such as dried radishes and dried onions. Same poke concept but added uniqueness to make this more special."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, AMAZING selection of toppings (best I've found in all of PHX area).  I will 100% be back.  Great pricing too!"}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh and clean food!!
Traveling and it's always a challenge to find places to eat. I would eat here everyday!! So many great options!!!"}
{"text":"Place is amaizing, came in last night, and back Today. Super fresh food and the owners are just lovely people. Friendly and super gracious..A must try for Poki lovers. Bing will be the next thing that we try here."}
{"text":"Brand new (even smells like it still)! Food is really fresh and while they are working on portion sizes every employee is super welcoming and cheerful. Tasty toppings and their fish is juicy and fresh. Thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Super fresh and friendly staff. Freshness of poki and great portion. The egg waffle with gelato it's a bomb. They also have jianbing crepe and will comeback to try those out."}
{"text":"Great tastes on Poki Bowl.  Nice serving size.  Fair pricing. Great topping selections. Clean and bright restaurant. Friendly staff. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very good,  i ordered the \"wrap\" (sushi burrito) Hawaiian Salmon/Tuna.  Really good flavor,  the young woman who made it is terrific,  she smiled, was very informative about what is extra , great suggestions when I want sure what I wanted & made the order just how I wanted. I failed to get her name, She has a bunch of tattoos long hair & supper friendly/ helpful, with a Midwest accent.  . I will return. 
The one bummer is the cost of the green tea $3.50!!! Kinda steep,  I will bring my own water next time."}
{"text":"First time! I'm impressed with the staff and poke. I went twice in the first weekend. I didn't get there until later on the Grand Opening day but they gave a discount anyway! Both visits were togo.  The fish was delicious. The vegetables were fresh. I ordered brown rice one day and spring mix the next.  I tried a few sauces and loved them all.  I will definitely be back. Super convenient location for me. Finally something affordable, healthy AND DELICIOUS in that area. The staff make it 5-stars. They seemed so happy and were helpful. I love that."}
{"text":"Wouldn't rush back here ..... nothing to rave about. The portions were great but the sauces and toppings were meh! The guys who worked there were so out to lunch and didn't even let me try the different types of proteins ( every other place does.)."}
{"text":"This place continues to exceed my expectations! The restaurant is very clean and pretty. The food is fresh and the servers are always incredibly nice and polite. Definitely try this place! Also there's cooked meat here as well, so if you're considering poke but are too afraid about the raw meat, try the cooked meat!"}
{"text":"Great service. Got exactly what I want. Very excited to dive into this! The restaurant super clean. Staff great suggestions."}
{"text":"Went in for the grand opening and they were giving away free poke bowls to the first 50! It was delicious and I'll be back. Everyone was super friendly. So excited to have fresh poke in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"It's kinda like a sushi version of Chipotle but with better \"burrito\" wrapping skills. 

The fish is fresh and doesn't taste fishy. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty good poke. This spot lets you pick if you want a bowl or a wrap (more like a burrito) which I liked. I went with a wrap because I hadn't tried one before. 

Standard poke format, you pick your protein scoops (you get 2 at a base price here) then select sauces, toppings, dry toppings, and you're good to go. I opted for salmon and tuna, house dressing and a little spicy mayo, cucumber, pineapple, red onion, seaweed salad. 

The guy who made my wrap and the one who rang me up were both nice. It was a little odd being the only people in the restaurant at 5pm on a Saturday, but overall I had a good experience. 

The only downside to the wrap was if you take the paper off of it, stuff falls out of it pretty easily. Not a huge deal but can be a bit messy if you don't eat it strategically. My total was also a little more than $10 and for that price, I feel you can get more at other places. But it was tasty. 

Cute atmosphere and I'd return to try their desserts. 

Update: came back to try a bowl. I have to say, I enjoyed this more than my burrito (personal preference) and I think its the better value. Fresh food, friendly service, and large portions!"}
{"text":"Fish was fresh and delicious! Awesome customer service. They give you a generous amount of protein too."}
{"text":"Went at 415pm on Monday and it was, of course not very busy and quite.   However, the food shouted out value, freshness and great tasting.  I'm an older guy and only finishe 60%, but 13 year old devoured it.   I had hawian style tuna and salmon with house spicy sauce and son had plain tuna and salmon with house sauce...tasted great!! No, it's not the quality of Kodo, but then again my son and i didnt spend $85 and it's not Japanese sushi....we paid $20 bucks for 2 scoops each for fresh poki and we really enjoyed it and all the toppings you can handle (avocado extra $).  Can't beat quality or quantity of food for this price point. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Amazing!  This place is quite the gem.  You get to build your own bowl and choose whatever fish and toppings you want.  The fish is incredibly fresh and the portions are huge.  You get two scoops of fish and the entire bowl is only $9.  You can also add more fish for $1.99.  It shares a spot with Green Bing so you have even more options."}
{"text":"Yet another one-off poke place that has popped up and that I just had to try. Seemed reasonably priced at a glance at $9.50 for a two scoop bowl but then they nickel and dime you to death with an extra $75 charge for EACH crab salad seaweed salad, muer salad and masago. By the time I was done it was more expensive than my favorite go to spot and definitely was not as good. The fish was average quality and freshness but nothing to write home about. It is the weekend so maybe it wasn't the best day to try them. It's actually a split concept sharing the same dining area with something called Green Bing? Probably a good idea to hedge their bets since the poke half was not exactly a stand out. I'll probably give the counter next-door a try and see if their chicken bowls are better."}
{"text":"No time to sit and eat a poki bowl? Well, try the poki wrap. It's the ultimate lunch on the go. Tastes just like the poki bowl without the need of utensils. 

The rice is already molded into flat square and placed on top of a seaweed sheet. Then they start adding the proteins and toppings as you select them...just like you would for a bowl. It is then rolled up and sliced in half just like a sandwich. 

It was surprisingly tasty. I tried their cooked salmon salad and tuna combo with various toppings. I chose the spicy house sauce and it went really well together. 

Highly recommend at least trying once."}
{"text":"Saw this place Everytime I go to Best Buy and I saw they are open. It was empty when I came in but I don't giving it a go! Friendly service and fresh ingredients. 

I had the poke wrap ( or sushirito) here with Hawaiian tuna and salmon. The marinated in the Hawaiian tuna is delicious . I recommended this place for a quick lunch pick up or something decently priced for Poke!"}
{"text":"Great service and HUGE portions!  Our waiters (are they still waiters if there is no wait?) helped us a ton by letting us sample a few of the different types of fish before we chose the final version of our poki bowls.  Each ingredient scoop was very generous, and the resulting large-sized bowl was giant and filled to the top.  I actually wasn't able to finish the entire meal, which isn't usual at all for me, especially in poki restaurants where you often leave regretting the fact that you didn't decide to go to an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant instead.  The price is extremely reasonable as well, with our total per bowl being just under $10.

There's some sort of Chinese street food option down the aisle in the same restaurant that we'll probably try on a different day... if my husband can drag me away from the poki option."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, reasonably priced .   My favorite is the Hawaiian tuna. Don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"Have to come in. I know that no one is ever in here but I promise you the food is fresh and delicious. Plus everyone is nice here. The fish is traditional poke and Lomi lomi salmon. Nice change from typical fast food"}
