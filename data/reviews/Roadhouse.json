{"text":"I'm lost for words for how embarrassing this place is, please see Doug S. review. This place STINKS."}
{"text":"Seriously....I do believe prices have soared....12$ For some frozen small chicken strips with no FF! and another .75 for an extra sauce.....could not believe we paid $12.75 for those and the pretzel is back to being stale! There is no table service, which is just fine,  but not reflected in the cost! So once again people are parking and going across the street to eat and coming back for a drink. We are betting they go up again during Bike Week."}
{"text":"A big thank you from the Hellanbach Crew for all the hospitality during Arizona Bike Week! We made lots of new friends and never got tired of the food! We love you, Cave Creek! Thank you for everything. See you next year!  -Hellanbach Inc."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative number I would.  Arrived with family for dinner Saturday evening about 7:30; place is not packed.  I learned from the bartender that there is no wait staff - you turn in your own order, get your own drinks and wait for your name to be called.  Disappointing, but not the end of the world, and then this happened:  after waiting nearly 30 minutes for 4 sandwiches, fries and onion rings, I walked back to the window and was told they were waiting for the fries.  The young woman working the window offered to have me take the items that were ready - one burger, cheese fries and onion rings - while they finished the order.  I returned to the window as she was scooping fries into two sandwich baskets,  I pointed out that there should be 3 sandwiches coming and after a few seconds of debate with the line cooks, I was told they didn't have any roast beef for the french dip!  When I asked why I wasn't told that when the fellow took my order 30 minutes ago,the response was \"he's new\".  I took the available food to our table and returned to ask for a refund for the missing sandwich I was told she would send the manager out to our table.  Turns out the Manager is the same guy that took the order and didn't know what his kitchen did and did not have available!  I will say that while this guy was standing there apologizing, the kitchen staff came out with a couple orders of onion rings as an apology for the mess.  Ok, so stuff happens and we were just too hungry to get all worked up over the whole thing.  But the kicker is this......as we prepared to leave we noted the Manager and the young woman from the kitchen - her sitting on his lap and a lot of what I'll call \"cuddling\" going on....they just happened to be sitting in the corner of the outside patio near the patio bar with customers present!  Never, ever going back again."}
{"text":"Slow ass service. Ding dong bartenders talkin about work drama. Hideaway next door is much better."}
{"text":"Remodel is very nice. The expanded outside patio is great. The food however is a different matter. You have to order from a window which isn't a big deal. But then you wait and wait and wait. It was crazy long. A person next to us waited 45 min for a salad!"}
{"text":"Rude bar tenders, horrible service. Fair food. Much better across the street. Don't waste your time at Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Great music and good vibes from everyone all around, with events and chill nights in beautiful cave creek, and a wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"So disappointed we were just coming in for a drink. No service at all!! After a good five minutes. Mind you hardly anyone is there The bartender starts cleaning the table next to us doesn't even acknowledge that we are there. Bye!"}
{"text":"Today I had a patty melt it was good and the fries were great fun place and great service"}
{"text":"As you walk in there is a sign that says \"Seat Yourself\" so we selected a table near the bar.  After ten minutes waiting for a server and making eye contact with the bartender three times with no acknowledgement, we decided to leave.  It was sorrowful the way these employees just don't have the concern for their customers at 4:30 on a Friday afternoon.  Maybe it was because of Good Friday, probably not!"}
{"text":"You know that song, \"I love this bar\"? Well, this might be it... Great venue, huge garage doors open to Cave Creek Rd,  huge patio, really high ceiling, fans keeping it cool, vintage Harleys  suspended  from the ceilings and flanking the stage! Yummy food, great staff and entertainment!  The best Karaoke  in town on Thursday  nights, live music on Friday  and Saturday  nights. Great place, stop in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Under no circumstances go to the Roadhouse in Cave Creek on a Tuesday night as you will be blasted out of the building due to the most god awful Karaoke known to man-kind!!!  Someone managing this place is actually dumb enough to think something this obnoxious will increase business.  It is beyond comprehension that anyone involved with a biker bar would think that bikers would want to listen to such pathetic entertainment.  What an insult to the bikers of Phoenix!  Bottom line spend your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Good place to stop for a beer. It has biker decor, and it's nice. Refreshing, coming from stuffy Carefree area."}
{"text":"Cruising through the area with a group and wanted to get a few beers and something to eat.  The place was packed so I figured it had to be a good place.   I asked the parking person at the entrance if there were parking spots for the disabled as we had a person who uses a wheelchair.  We found the disabled parking to our left in the back and helped our disabled person get out of the car and transfer to his wheel chair.  We found a ramp and once we were up at the restaurant level, THERE WAS NOT ONE TABLE WHICH COULD ACCOMMODATE HIM.  All tables were barstool height.  We went around and around and nothing.  I was shocked.  Isn't this a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act?  We spoke to a waitress who was not really sympathetic making our disabled person feel humiliated.  A man came by and said that he may be able to dust off a folding table somewhere in the back.  A folding table?  Really?  At this point we all felt we had to leave.   The management needs to be aware they they are violating the law when a person in a wheelchair cannot eat at a table that is a regular height."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. First, it has no AC so think about that first. Next, you sit at a table, but there is no waitress service. You order at a window, but if you want a drink, even a soda, you have to order at the bar. The food, nothing special. I ordered a Cobb salad for $13. No turkey, no egg, no bacon, no cheese that I could see, just basically a salad with ham and croutons.   I could go on and on but you probably get the idea. With so many great places in the area, I don't know why anyone would go here.  Also some words of advise. If you see a restaurant with half 1 star reviews and half 5 star reviews, you might want to believe the 1 star reviews."}
{"text":"We didn't eat there this time but had great service.  Love the atmosphere with all the Bears stuff!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place just needs a few improvements in my opinion .. Drinks are good"}
{"text":"Dont eat here. Terrible and pricey. The worst combo. Probably a fun place to drink though."}
{"text":"Keep on going... to another place. We ate here a couple of months ago. This is all you need to know: VERY loud, obnoxious patrons (they seem to like it that way), low quality food, no service from bartenders (unless you are wearing a HD t-shirt).  Cave Creek needs a lot of things. Roadhouse is not one of them. It just reinforces the community as a destination for drunks.  I had a burger. It was over cooked. The fries it came with were just your every-day food service stuff out of a box. My beer was cold. My friend had the nachos, loaded. The chicken was very dry and the plastic-cheese became a solid mass quickly. I am willing to give them an honest try, but I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"BEWARE...only pay with cash!  We had a bad experience with one of their bartenders trying to swipe our credit card.  We paid our tab and when we realized our credit card was not on the black book with the receipt we immediately asked where it was.  Our bartender, Brie insisted she had given it back.  Then she intentionally avoided our end of the bar.  Finally, I got her attention and insisted she get a manager out there.  After manager arrived the card miraculously appeared.  After the manager turned and left bartender Brie proceeded to verbally insult my friend.  I hunted down the manager again.  His attitude was very nonchalant and told me all about how she had worked there a year, did a great job, etc, etc.   BEWARE....ONLY PAY WITH CASH."}
{"text":"Really cool bar. Came here for the mcgregor vs may weather fight. It was awesome they did not do a cover charge like every where else. They had tvs and screens inside & outside and seats and tables outside too. It was so packed! The line was crazy long to get food! But it was delicious and pricey lol. They did have specials on drinks. There wasn't enough seats that we just stood to watch the fight. It was cool but it's kinda annoying that you bump into people and people can't see when they are short.   They also had live music playing.   Really cool little western town to visit.   It's located right across buffalo chip & saloon."}
{"text":"For several years we have been going to the tap house and had some good bike weeks there too.  I guess it changed to roadhouse recently and guessing management and staff did too because it was terrible.  Waited for 15 mins to get a drink at the main bar which was not crowded being run by three unprofessional bartenders. Did not even make eye contact with my wife and I.  We eventually left to go across street to get a drink.  About the only good thing about this place now is a good place to park your bike and go to the bars across the street.  Really disappointing how bad this place is now."}
{"text":"Whelp - I used to go to the Tap House every so often to get a burger, and it was pretty decent - but now that it's the Roadhouse they must be trying to really set the scene for a dive biker bar because that's what it is.  The burger I had was awful - like it came out of a pack of frozen burgers - tasted like cardboard.  Service was provided, so of, by a biker chick in a thong like thing.  It was just nasty.  Never ever will I go there again.  Maybe it's OK for getting drunk and watching a band..."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 rating, I would. Crappy bartenders with crappy attitudes. Hell no I won't waste money on that. I ask one simple thing. Not even ask. I just say, \"Just something fruity please.\" If you can't think of something off the top of your tiny blonde head for a damn fruity drink, don't be a bartender. And don't tell me you don't have time for me! WTH. That girl could have handled that situation so much better. But no. Had to be a witch. I won't ever go back. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"Cool, Hideaways little brother. It's nice to bounce back and forth between the two bars. We are live music lovers so Sat & Sun we start at Roadhouse listen for awhile, then head to Hideaway and listen to more live music. Drinks are decent here, didn't have any food. I have no complaints about this kick ass biker bar.  NOTE WORTHY: Go to the bathroom here before you head to Hideaway, bathrooms are 10X nicer here."}
{"text":"Absolutely scandalous, the person who is preparing my food actually dipped his finger in my side of ranch dressing and tasted it and then handed it to me over the counter. I actually saw him double dip on it.....which makes it even more nasty. No manager on duty at the time of my complaint, this person should be fired immediately.  I guess you get what you pay for, a stupid kid not properly trained."}
{"text":"OH YEAH!! Cave Creek's finest.  I was put on the back burner for food, but we have indoor and outdoor music, good food, good service and a great ambiance.  You should check this out!"}
{"text":"Great for drinks on a nice day.  Staff was friendly and expedited the drinks.  I'd stop again."}
{"text":"The Roadhouse has a lot of character - picture a western biker bar complete with motorcycles hanging from the ceiling.   You're not going there for a fine dining experience, a farm-to-table meal or the latest food trend.   If you're going to eat, it's for greasy bar food that you order at the counter and pick up when they call your name over the loudspeaker.    We stopped in for lunch while we got the car washed across the street and did not have high expectations for the food.   We were surprised at how good the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwiches were.     The chicken was large, thick and very juicy.     The side of fries were thin and crisp with mild seasoning."}
{"text":"It's Sunday night 530. We want some food. Dumb concept. U have to get up yourself if paying cash and order from other section, then wait to have your name called and go pick up your food. Ridiculous for 2016. We order wings. No wetnapkins. Wait for bartender 15 minutes to get plates and napkins. Never happens. I tell my husband to eat them all since I have no plate or napkins; he doesn't care as much. Also had been waiting for 2nd drink at least 10 minutes. He tried yelling excuse me 3x but bartenders were busy talking together. There were only about 8 total at bar. So as soon as we finished we left. Yes we rode on a motorcycle for a nice outing. Sure I'll try again, however I think management needs to get service better, your bar staff hAs no interest."}
{"text":"My five stars are for the great service and selection of draft beers. We didn't eat so no comments on the food. We enjoyed the music and watching the bikes from our front row seating. If I ever eat there I will comment on it. Hope our next visit happens soon."}
{"text":"Jeepers cats! This might sound like a lot of my other reviews but I mean it when I say this place is very nice. A lot of tvs!  Coldest beer this side of the Alamo! Also lots of tvs!"}
{"text":"There's some really cool bike decor here and not only that our food was pretty darn good. The employees were very friendly and I felt a great atmosphere. My chicken sandwich tasted charbroiled which is perfect for me. My BF was very happy with his Reuben. The drinks were worthy. We sat out on the big ass patio with slews of seatery. It was sort of random with some creativeness. A mix of people and was cool to bide our time watching the parade of vehicles go by with the beautiful backdrop of mountains."}
{"text":"Complete waist of $65. Seriously the worst food, drinks, and service I've had in 2 years. Waitress highly recommended the sliders and Reuben sandwich. . . Clearly she has eaten primarily through the state lunch school program (she was barely legal to serve alcohol).  The Ruben . . . Tasteless unless you think butter is the only flavor involved in a Reuben.  The fries were fresh cut however ruined by that old grease flavor all to well known by improper cleaning. And then the amazing sliders . . . The hamburger patty on the sliders were so hard I could have thrown them around like frisbee's.   I should have tried and maybe it would have at least given me a funny memory/experience. Service was slow with only 8 patrons and two servers. To top it off I couldn't even blur the memory with alcohol due to our requested \"chilled\" Patron tequila shots were served hot . . . Total waist!  Not one thing was done right. The one positive . . . Friendly patrons and its dog friendly."}
{"text":"This place is my go to- I'm a local and I enjoy this place any day of the week. Weekdays are calm, weekends can get crowded but it's not terrible. People that come here are friendly- The food is great, if something is wrong/off they've fixed it for me right away. Taylor and Bri (the best bartender) are my favorite people. Taylor's beyond accommodating and Bri always remembers my drink of choice. Thank you guys for being a home away from home!"}
{"text":"Ya know. It's just one of those bars. Always fun, cold beer and almost always something going on! And... the food is surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"Great weather today. Great burger and cold beers. Live band is setting up and the smell of bikers fuel in the air. Great place for nice weather."}
{"text":"Awful service! In fact no service at all. Stopped in for a few beers on a Sunday afternoon. Sat at the bar and was ignored for 15 minutes by three bartenders. No A/C and flys all over the place. Walked across the street and had our orders taken before we sat down in a clean, A/C cooled establishment. Next time we won't even waste our time using the parking lot."}
{"text":"Nasty bar maids and prison quality food.  If that floats your boat, go there.  They don't even serve your food,  you have to go to the kitchen several times as your \"food\" is ready.  So many other good places. Plus you can't get a beer until they abscond Your credit card."}
{"text":"Fun place to ride to and meet friends for food & drinks.  The food is pretty good, but not the main reason to run here.  Enjoy the scenery, lots of bikers & bikes and fun people watching.  Good music too."}
{"text":"Prison food is better than what they serve.  If they're going for the world's worst burgers, fries and onion rings, they have succeeded."}
{"text":"There are better choices in town nothing special to warrant going back. The fries were awful! Frozen thin fries all soaked up not very appetizing. I had the pulled park sandwich and it was good. My friend had the chefs salad and it was good. Very loud inside so we sat outside. Difficult to find a place to sit outside without getting soaked by their misters. Enjoyed the old bikes hanging from the ceiling inside and great parking."}
{"text":"Mark's new location brings the feel of the original hideaway into a new venue and does it well.  The serving staff is fantastic, the food is delicious and the beer is cold.  While I personally prefer the Grill, the atmosphere is very welcoming and the decoration brings a great ambiance.  It's also much more welcoming for the non-biker crowd with car parking and more inside seating.  It's also a better location for the sports enthusiast with more televisions tuned to the current games."}
