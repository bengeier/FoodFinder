{"text":"Food takes a long time to prepare... had to send my filet back because the chef doesn't not know the difference between rare/ medium/ well. It still wasn't correct the second time around. They do have great flatbreads and pasta dishes, especially the Pasta Lulu. They also won't take reservations for 5+ around actual dinner time. The options are up until 5pm (which on a Friday isn't going to fly if you work) or 8pm... which is totally inconvenient and should probably be advertised on their website somewhere so you can adjust the group size accordingly.  Overall, this is a place that I WANT to love, and I really used to before they expanded. Now it's mostly just a disappointment."}
{"text":"It's fine.  Living in the area this was highly recommended by many folks I know. My wife and I always wanted to try it so we recently went here for an early Valentines Day dinner. I had pretty high expectations, but all I can say is that it was just ok.   We were seated in what seemed to be a small overflow area, neither in the dining room or the balcony. It was sort of like dining in someone's somewhat finished attic, with a cheap electric fireplace, melamine tables and basic metal chairs. Not the vibe I was hoping for.  It took quite some time, well over 20 minutes actually, to even place our order after we were seated. The service was friendly but fairly absent. We had to ask for practically everything, even a water refill. While waiting for our food I noticed that the servers seemed hopelessly confused about who ordered what. I once saw a server come in with a big tray of meals, look around with a lost expression, then start randomly going to tables asking if they ordered anything. It was almost comical.   The food, while good, was only that. It was your standard Italian menu with a few upgrades. I for some reason thought their pasta was homemade, but pretty sure it wasn't. Honestly I think I'd have had just a good a meal at a place like Bravo. That's not to say that Bravo is bad at all. This place just isn't much better.  If you're in to wine I would recommend it for their wine list, but don't come out of your way for the food. It also seems to be a good place for groups or if you want an Italian family dinner that's a step above Olive Garden.   But meh otherwise. If you want something a bit better in the way of Italian dishes, new American or fine dining in the Gibsonia/Allison Park area I'd go to Cala Lilly, Olives & Peppers or Blue North. All three are better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Do not go!! The food is average with small portions and very overpriced.  But the service is really what was awful! It was packed so obviously some folks like it but our experience was a HUGE disappointment.  Until management realizes they have to train their staff if they plan to charge those prices and provide a casually elegant experience I doubt it will change."}
{"text":"Staff is horrid. Hostesses are poor and can't seem to understand much. More to be there to look pretty (but lack the ability to smile) than to direct customers.   It's very loud. Way more than it should be, even the outside seating. Doesn't say much for the servers or the restaurant's regulars."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here last evening.  The food was average as was the service. We ordered the blackened scallops with linguine and the strip steak.  Both were good.  Ambience is a bit loud with the high ceilings, young children, and music wafting in from the attached patio."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance are a decent but we would never return thanks to the horrible service we experienced."}
{"text":"This is for the great food. The spinach artichoke dip is awesome, as is the bread and oil they bring out, that stuff is addicting! I am not a wine connoisseur by any means, and I don't think this stuff is award winning but it's good and fun to try a bunch of different kinds.   I always get the spicy shrimp pasta in a cream sauce and it's amazing. I honestly have never ordered anything different because it's so good! I think sometimes the hostesses aren't super friendly, teenage girls who think they are super cool. Just be nice to customers, we're paying for your spray tan and hair straightener, so be courteous.   Aside from that I really like this place, ambiance is really nice and service is good. Really enjoy coming here and like the addition of an outside bar, great idea."}
{"text":"Come because of the Chef. Leave because of the Service.   Our first time tonight. The building is gorgeous and the property wonderfully located. We enjoy most of their wines, and just being in this place gives one a good, gourmet feeling.   Looking at the menu there's nothing bad to say. It's a simple selection of very basic dishes. Each one we had was wonderful in taste, texture and price.   However, in short order; the appetizers and main entries were cold to luke warm, the ambiance was sterile to blasé, and the service service was below sub-par.   I would recommend grabbing a bottle or two of their great wine and take out to heat up when you get home. Otherwise you'll have a great possible meal that will be destroyed by the awful service."}
{"text":"We've only been here once but we're definitely going back. We sampled wine before dinner, chose a favorite bottle each, and sat around waiting for our table. The bread and accompanying dip is fantastic. We liked the dip so much that we bought some to take home with us. The spinach and artichoke dip was also very good. We were so stuffed by that point we barely dove into our flatbread, but it was a perfect leftover. Going back next week - can't wait."}
{"text":"We have had private parties, eaten here as a couple, eaten outdoors on the patio.  We have been here many times and have always had great service!!  And the food and wine are always to notch. Not one single complaint here. This is one of my favorite places to go. The atmosphere, the entertainment... It doesn't get any better than this!!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love dining at La Vite! To start, the bread and dipping oil are amazing. I really enjoy their salads, and all of the entrees I have had here. My fiancé always gets the shrimp and lobster Arabiatta. I have tried pasta lulu, chicken Marsala, and many others and they are all delicious. I am a big fan of the wine as well. My favorite white is the Seyval Blanc and I absolutely love their Cabernet Savignon. Before dinner, you can do a wine tasting to see what you want to order. They also have a nice gift shop where you can buy several bottles and other wine related merchandise. It's so nice to eat outdoors when it's nice, but their indoor dining is very spacious as well. They also have live entertainment on the weekends which is really nice. All in all, this winery and restaurant is top tier!"}
{"text":"Just home from dinner. Great facility. Food very good. Service a severe disappointment. Prices reasonable. Would rate much higher if we received reasonable service. We eat out at least three times per week, so we know good service. We will give them one more try."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Went today for my birthday lunch as I had always wanted to try.  The atmosphere outside was wonderful , even on a hot July day.  We were seated quickly but service was slow...that was fine for today but normally for lunch on a Wednesday if I was working would be unacceptable.    Our zucchini appetizer was very good and the marinara was quite good. The warm bread and dipping sauce was exceptional.  My salmon was underdone  , the seafood cannelloni was very good and my daughters capellini pomadoro was good.  Nothing special.  What was unacceptable was the price.  For a mid week lunch, you pay evening dinner prices.  We had one appetizer , one side salad(not included) two iced tea, one ice water and three entrees for over $90.00. We did not have wine as we were with my underage daughter. And the service was slow.  I would go elsewhere unless you planned , like many others I observed, were two lunching ladies getting a pizza and a bottle of wine while the kids are at camp and the hubbies play golf."}
{"text":"Brilliant atmosphere and great staff.  I only wish their food was better.   I know the locals love this place because whenever I am visiting certain clients ask to dine here.   The setting is beautiful, a countryside vineyard with rows of grapevine growing on their trellis. Inside is also very elegant and airy.   You are always greeted by a kind face and rear service.   Stick to a simple salad and you will be fine.  As you exit there is a nice little gift shop where you can get a small present for your wife, mother or secret girlfriend.   Wines. I wish I could tell you about their wines. It is my impression from friends that they are okay and that this is a fun place to come on a weekend night in the summer.   As a business traveler I haven't been able to experience that yet :)"}
