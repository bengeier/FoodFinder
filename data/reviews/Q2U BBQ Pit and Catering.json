{"text":"Went with boyfriend as we got a decent deal with a groupon.  The staff was friendly and the building/bathroom was clean.   The chili cheese fries where decent.  Had the brisket plate.  The brisket was tasteless and a bit on the chewy side.  The hush puppies where ok, overall the fare was just that ok, nothing to be excited about and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place has really good food! When you walk in though you are not greeted in a friendly manner. We were not anyway! It was the first time we had eaten there. We stood at the door watching staff walk around and we were not sure if it was seat yourself or what! There was a bartender, and a few waitresses and they did not acknowledge us for a few minutes! We were then sat. Once we were sat, service got better and the food was great! My favorite was the spicy green beans!! The blackberry cobbler was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pulled pork, ribs, hush puppies, & barbecue stew. Yummy banana pudding, too. Good variety of sides. Cute decor - good atmosphere. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really dissapointing! We had a Groupon for takeout family meal for $17 and that was overpriced!!!! The corn on the cob was overcooked and mushy, and then thrown on a smoker, also a large side of corn was 3 small pieces. The fries were standard frozen crinkle variety with some season-all sprinkled on top. Also included in this meal were 4 white plain hamburger buns; and capped off with some okay pork. It certainly was nothing that stood out or would make me go back for given the underwhelming sides. Unfortunately we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is good, but WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. A hot dog is $7. Service ok, food ok, $ will do them in..."}
{"text":"We have tried this place three times- terrible ! The last time we took a pound home. Again, vile!   The BBQ  was full of fillers. Pass this place by- you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ , beans a little too smokey but the hush puppies are great. A little hard to find but well worth. The effort!"}
{"text":"This place rivals Mac's Speed Shop BBQ. The meat is good, the sauces and outstanding and the sides are delicious. Well worth the trip across the state line."}
{"text":"Awesome barbecue and service is fast and friendly. My son said mac and cheese was the best he'd had! They gave the kids pig shaped cookies after our meal. The directions were bad using their address on yelp though. The road is right but it is right across the bridge next to the lake in Lake Wylie plaza."}
{"text":"Great barbeque and hush puppies! Outstanding customer service too. We picked up take out last night but found an item missing when we got home. Went back tonight for more hush puppies to go with leftovers. We were very happy to also get the previously missing item with no argument."}
{"text":"Not worth it even with a Groupon. The BBQ is average.  The chicken was juicy the first few bites but quickly seemed to dry out. I've been here just a few times and this will be my last. The only thing I've liked is the ribs and corn on the cob aside from the fried things.  A small party filled the bar. It was a bit distracting.  I'll stick with Mac's speed shop."}
{"text":"We had our wedding on Lake Wylie, so getting our reception catered by Q2U just the other side of the lake was a natural choice.  Brian was so great to work with in advance, answering all of my questions, and working with us to make sure we'd have everything we needed to satisfy both meat-eaters and vegetarians alike.  Everything was hot and ready for us when we picked it up, and the price couldn't be beat - tons of food for less than $10 per person.  

All of our guests (and we) RAVED about the food. He gave us vegetarian collards (per our request to accommodate our varied guest preferences), which were great on their own, but probably even better if made with ham/pork ;)  Baked beans (with meat) were amazingly delicious. Corn on the cob was spiced just right.  And the 'Q...oh, the Q!  Three great sauces, each as great as the next, and the meat done just right.  Our vegetarians loved the grilled smoked portabellas he provided for them, too.

Thanks for such a great experience. Would highly recommend to everyone!  We just wish it were closer to where we live in CLT...the Q is the best of what we've had in the area!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings.

If I were to eat this BBQ at a catered event where I wasn't paying and I wasn't at their location, I would give them 4 stars easy.

Meats were good. Potato salad (although I'm sure it wasn't from scratch), was tasty. Mac and cheese was pretty good also. The beans were awesome. Smoky and meaty and really, really good. 

The problem for me is that I found the prices to be pretty steep for BBQ and I'm not picky about paying for good food. $9 for a three veggie plate (fries, beans and potato salad in my case) is high. The sandwiches were in the $7-$9 range and that included the sandwich (and not a large one), two small hush puppies and a condiment size cup of coleslaw. Literally two tablespoons of coleslaw. Once you add a drink and fries, you are way over $10.  In some environments I wouldn't even mind this for BBQ, but this place is bare bones. 

The main reason I would not go back here, despite the good food, is that the entire restaurant reeked of air freshener. I feel like they were trying to cover up some type of funky smell that inhabits the building because I could kind of smell that too. Maybe a musty smell, not sure. At any rate, I want to smell food, not fake cherry or psuedo spring meadow.  The air freshener was just completely over whelming and my nose was running by the time we left.  I feel confident this wasn't a one time thing, I'm guessing the freshener is on a timed release given how consistently strong it was during our visit. Yuck. Maybe I'll go get the beans to go."}
{"text":"First visit! Read mixed reviews so came in guarded and was pleasantly surprised! Great food and great price! The staff was great as well! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Average at best. It is very expensive for what you get. The bbq tastes ok but I can get ok bbq for a lot less elsewhere. The collards and potatoes were super spicy so my kids couldn't eat it. Our waitress was very grouchy and seriously didn\"t get a smile out of any of the staff. They could use a good lesson in customer service!"}
{"text":"Pulled BBQ chicken, with 2 sides (I picked the collards and BBQ stew)... Outstanding !!  $11.99.  Where you going to find a better deal for dinner in Lake Wylie ??"}
{"text":"I am always on the hunt for a great BBQ joint, so I decided to try the relatively new Q2U in Lake Wylie. When we got there, I was shocked at how small it was. There are three pinic tables outside and only like eight tables inside. We went on a Saturday afternoon, so I hope they do better at lunch on the weekdays! There was only one gentleman eating when we arrived so that made us nervous. You place you order at the counter and then they bring it to your table.
   I had the BBQ plate which was 7.oo dollars and I must say I was a little disappointed that you could not choose between a small and a large plate like at almost every other BBQ place I have ever eaten. I also ordered a small order of hushpuppies for 1.50, because you just gotz ta have good puppies with BBQ!!! My girlfriend ordered the BBQ chicken breast plate. Each plate come with two side and we both had french fries and cole slaw.
   Our order arrived very quickly, as it should have since we were now alone in the joint. My bbq was not a very big helping at all and I knew I was still going to be hungry when I finished eating it. I was extremely disappointed. It was quite moist and they have three versions of their own BBQ sauce to apply to it, I like the thick myself. They did give an ample amount of fries and they are crinkle cut and the cole slaw is very, very good! I would have eaten more of that had I had it. The hushpuppies are delicious! Very, very good and I would stop in just for them! My girlfriend's chicken was also very good and it was a very large breast. It was worth the 8.50 for that plate.
   Overall, I'd say I'd give Q2U a 6 out of 10 on a scale. It's nothing to go crazy over, but if you're hungry and driving by and want some BBQ, then give it a shot. I hope you aren't real hungry though because you'll still be hungry when ya leave."}
{"text":"Had a catering package last night for the Lake Wylie Rotary. Everyone raved over the food and everyone who had not had it before asked where it came from. There was a lot of food and every one got a doggie bag to take home too. Definitely a hit!"}
{"text":"Great food, cozy atmosphere, a local favorite."}
{"text":"Glad we used a Groupon for our first visit because it was not worth the regular price. BQ nachos were OK and had a lot if meat. Pulled pork sandwich was on a cold store brand bun and meat was super dry, cold, and tasteless. French fries were good but that was about it.  Cole slaw was straight from the store, and hush puppies were over cooked.

Restaurant and staff need some cleaning up too. Kitchen and servers were walking around openly  eating, sitting on counters were food was being prepped, cooks and prep were not wearing any kind of gloves, yelling orders to each other (not sure what the point of the computer system is), and they brought out our appetizer and meal all at the same time. Do not sit on the kitchen side if you don't want to see anything about how your food is prepped or cooked."}
{"text":"Food is actually decent but they are incredibly under staffed and the staff they do have, well let's just say... It about kills them to smile. Tonight, we believe 1 waitress served the entire restaurant. We waited an extremely long amount of time for her to take our payment. We had to track her down to give it to her."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a friend of mine, I stopped in for lunch today.  The BBQ joint was not busy at all, so I was promptly seated.  I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich combo with baked beans and sweet tea (which for $6.99, including the drink, is a good deal)!  I also went ahead and splurged on adding 3 ribs to my lunch (for an extra $5.49).

It will take me a few more times of visiting here to get a thorough review, but I will say it's worth the 30 minute drive when I'm in Ballantyne to come over and grab some 'cue."}
{"text":"Been going to this place since they opened. Thought the food was good - a bit pricey, but we returned from time to time. 
Recently, we went in for a meal  and now we'll be taking a break for some time. 
An earlier post said you'd leave hungry - we did. I've heard less is more - that was the case on this visit. 
Got a side corn on the cob for our little one. $2.50 for half a cob of corn? Seems excessive but then again we should have looked at the menu."}
{"text":"We got a little of everything! Everything appears to be over fried (blackened sweet potato fries), over seasoned with what I believe was cayenne pepper powder (due to the caking of red powder on and around everything. However after spending $80, I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding!! The brisket could make a Texan slap their momma! They are a bit pricey, but that's probably due to their lack of operational hours. I wish they were open a little more! But I'm sure good food is exhausting!!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints. The food is pretty good and the location is perfect. The staff is friendly and the food comes out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Q2U is one of my favorite places for many reasons...

The Ribs here are very-very good. They win awards with them and I can see why. They are always meaty, sometimes too much meat. And these guys know how to smoke them.

The Hamburgers here are some of my favorite! The meat is awesome and cooked exactly as you like it. I like to add some pork to my burgers, gives them and extra pop with a shot of their SC sauce on it.

Their Steaks are also top notch. The rib eye is just plain awesome. It's hard sometimes to come in here for dinner and not get it but sometimes you have eat those ribs.

Their hotdogs are also very good, and a LOT to eat.

Their pork... first you need to know they pull the fat. So it's different and sometimes can be a bit dry as a result. This one always seems to be a hit or miss thing. Sometimes it's awesome and sometimes not so much. They have a great Vinegar sauce to put on it which does a nice compliment job and can moisten it a bit.

They make a very good banana pudding here. Always get it as a side.

I'd really hit them with 4.5 stars because of the pork but... it's still good and you cannot do .5 stars so I lean them to the 5-star."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because the Corn fritters were very very good.  My wife and I order the loaded baked potatoes.  Very disappointed!!!!  Extremely disappointed I mean.  Potatoes and meat were cold.  Cheese came out in a plastic container, sour cream in a pre packaged rip open package, and the butter in a packet.  Potatoes were basically microwaved and the amount of pulled chicken on my potato amounted to about a tablespoon.  I asked for my food to be warmed up and my wife didn't only because she felt embarrassed asking.  I believe the manager came out with my food and I got a simple sorry about that.

Super disappointed and won't be going back for another try."}
{"text":"WTF?!? You have a Groupon that expires on a day that you're closed? Ironically, I was there on that Tuesday that you were closed... closed on a friggin' Monday AND Tuesday? Your \"Q\"  better be pretty damn good to be closed 2 days a week but I'll never know... Domage!"}
{"text":"Small, informal restaurant with a couple picnic tables out front, which I have to admit is in a somewhat rundown looking shopping area.

However the BBQ is the best I've had in the Charlotte area. Quality meat and they have won contests with their sauces. They started oit catering so it is also a great option for bulk take home. The cold slaw is one of my favorites too."}
{"text":"Great Southern Fair, Ribs just fall of the bone. Not impressed with their Brisket though."}
{"text":"The Best BBQ Spot in the Carolinas!! my favorite ribs and steak! Cant go wrong with any side. Great costumer service and I heard they do catering cant wait to order for my next football party!"}
{"text":"The expanded dining/bar/booth area is awesome. The food, terrific. Friendly place that feels like it's been there for much longer than it has. Probably my new favorite place in Lake Wylie, I think that's worth another 1/2 star right there. Can't say anything about the ribs - they were out so I couldn't try them. Maybe that tells you something about how good they might be? I assume they don't run out because they're not good. Pulled pork is great, brisket is good, sides are outstanding.Will be watching plenty of football at Q2U this Fall! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ! I wouldn't recommend the brisket but the pulled pork was delicious.

Depending on what you order it can be a bit expensive. They had incredible baked beans though and pretty good coleslaw."}
{"text":"Drove past this place a few times after grabbing bagels at the Bagel Boat, but didn't stop in until recently. Pork BBQ was very nice...the only food issue was we ordered way to much. Service is good, but I can tell this is the kinda place that improves with each visit. We'll be back, so that's not a problem."}
{"text":"The sides here are amazing. I am very particular when it comes to my hushpuppies, and theirs are the best I have ever had A++!  I had the pulled pork plate with hushpuppies and Mac n cheese with an additional small side of cole slaw. I give the Mac n cheese and cole slaw both an A.  The actual pulled pork was mediocre so maybe a B-.  They have 3 different sauces which are all a sweet vinegar base (original, hot, sweet & thick). They have a unique flavor but not my favorites so I give them a B+.  I have heard the chicken is very good so I will try it next time. The portions were very good for the price.  The sides were top notch and the pulled pork and sauces were average so overall I gave it 4 stars and b/c of the sides I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've been here and both times were fantastic.  Today we had the brisket  and it was wonderful.  I thought the price was dead on...you can also take home bulk meat and that price was great.  Wish we lived closer, but well worth the drive !!!"}
{"text":"Decent 'cue. Good service. We both had the pulled barbecue chicken, me with mac & cheese and cole slaw, my daughter with mac & cheese and baked beans. When it was all over, we had empty plates and full tummies.

The cole slaw was nothing special, but the mac & cheese was great. Gooey cheesy center with firm noodles but mine also had some crunchy cheesy crust from the top of the pan. Delish! The chicken was not terrific but it was good and there was plenty of it.

Their sweet tea is VERY sweet."}
{"text":"Great food but super expensive!  We did take out for three people and it was over $50."}
