{"text":"Stars: 4.5  Ordered the Mandi Lamb and 6 beef samosas for takeout. (they have a deal for samosas- 6 for $5)   Everything was so good! The mandi lamb came with rice and two sauces.   The service was fast and friendly, and while we were waiting for our takeout the chef cook or maybe he was the owner -came to the front and gave us complimentary spinach and cheese samosas to eat while we were waiting.  I def recommend all to try this place and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mandi Lamb - tender lamb in saffron rice.  Owner friendly and welcoming. The owner kindly offered appetizers and dessert as a combo price.  Daughter explained each dish as they arrived."}
{"text":"4 stars only because I'm not a fan of eating off of paper plates. The food is 5 stars all the way. We had the Lamb Mandi, the Motabak, and the Tabouleh. The lamb, at $17.99, was the most expensive but with three large pieces of lamb and a generous portion of delicious long grain rice, it was easily enough for two with leftovers. The lamb was tender, perfectly spiced, and fell apart when eaten with the plastic forks. (Knives, plastic or otherwise, are nowhere to be found. They are not needed.) The Motabak, a flatbread stuffed with vegetables and served with a yoghurt sauce, was crispy and delicious. The tabouleh was lovely, and the smaller portion was still a generous amount that fed the two of us with leftovers for the next day.   The d√©cor is Spartan and the tables are Formica, but the food is fabulous. I recommend getting it for take-out, since you're going to be eating from paper plates anyway, and taking it over to the nearby pub The Only to enjoy with a cold pint of craft beer. (The Only doesn't mind people bringing in outside food.)"}
{"text":"Tastes great but sizes keep decreasing (especially the rice) to the point where you feel like you're overpaying"}
{"text":"The owner is a really great guy and fun to talk to.  The food is unique, delicious, and authentic.  A true taste of Yemen.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"What is it with \"Yemeni\" Mandi and bland rice? Every Mandi restaurant I have been to who labels their Mandi \"Yemeni\" has had tasteless rice.  Lamb Mandi:  The Lamb was cooked very well with Bone Marrow still intact and Meat very juicy and tender, however, the rice was just normal rice *not* cooked with the meat so it had no essence of it.  Chicken Mandi: This was tasteless throughout, chicken was tender and juicy, however was pretty tasteless and the rice was the same as Lamb rice.  Service: Two cute little girls take your order, Parents are in the back making food for you. Doesn't get any more \"family\" than this. So thats a big plus.  Again, if I am looking for good flavourful Mandi, i would probably walk down the road to Al mandi."}
{"text":"If you want reheated lamb and rice for $18, this is the place for you. Lunch was inedible...the lamb mandi, the rice and the mixed vegetables. ...all tasted a day old. After a few bites...I just decided to call it quits and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered food online and the owner called to double check the order and came himself to drop it off... Very good service"}
{"text":"Ordered the Lamb Mandi. Both rice and meat were stale. I've had authentic Mandi in the middle East. This is no where close to it."}
