{"text":"We had a really nice dining experience. The food came promptly, staff made nice recommendation on beverage (she recommended the plum juice, definitely also recommend if you enjoy the beverage). Soup base was good -- one spicy and one beef bone with tomato. Nice environment as well! Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"As good as the competition. Had a mix pot of beef soup and medium spicy malah - Anything ordered came fast. Like faster than sanic kind of fast. - Meats were high enough quality for the price point. Vegetables were fresh and crisp. Frozen tofu was frozen long enough - Spicy was spicy enough. The beef broth was also pretty good. The malah was sufficient chili oil to last the entire meal - Instant noodles were the good stuff, none of that cheapo noodles  - Was sort of hard to flag down a waiter, and when we did, they weren't super fluent in English - Had to wait for a seat, but looking at the size of the place, I guess that was expected - The sauce bar was empty on soy sauce for around 5 minutes - Have to pay for plum drink unlike that other place down the road - Pricier than that other place down the road  All in all, was a good meal. 8.5/10 Would return"}
{"text":"Good selection, good service, and good portions.  Only thing not so good is the high price.    The menu is quite extensive, with lots of meat, veggie, noodle, and mushroom selection.  They have everything you'd expect at a hotpot restaurant, but no premium items such as lobster.  However, there's a wide variety of the basics which to me is good enough.  The portion sizes were very generous and was more than enough without having to order multiple rounds of the same food.    The servers I had only spoke mandarin and English.  Everything that is ordered is entered by them on a tablet and the food came out very quickly.  They came by frequently to refill water and clear used plates.    The only downside is the high price that's charged.  At $27.99/person on a weeknight, with soup bases starting at $7, this is a high premium that I'm paying for hotpot (which also seems to be the norm for all these new hotpot places).  I also didn't find the soup bases to be interesting as both tasted the same (I got the Beef bone broth on one side, and the HK style soy broth on the other).  Another plus is the pot I had was quite big and square shaped, which means lots of capacity for your food."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the same exact thing other places offer. 29.99$ plus extra 20$ for spicy soup base or18$ for two bases.....That's prob why they were so empty on a Saturday night. There are couple of other hot pots, maybe 2-5 min away from this location. Although their food and selection was good. The price is def NOT worth...AND. The deal breaker was when The waitress came back and told us we didn't tip enough and we have to pay them at least 10%. We paid, left and never coming back. Regular price is 27.99$ and 10$ extra for soup base. 14$ for two soup bases."}
{"text":"I would say Taste Hotpot is like every other AYCE hotpot place. The selection and quality are similar.  Nothing really mindblowing.  For some reason, they kept bringing us lamb even though we ordered beef.   They have some desserts included in the AYCE. The jelly is limited to 1 per person. The deep fried milk is never available."}
{"text":"Nice trendy decor inside. They have individual hot pots and shared pots. As well, they have private rooms available. This is an all you can eat buffet, but on top of the per person price, they also charge for each pot of soup (which I feel should be included in the price, but oh well).  There are several flavors of soup, we had one beef bone and one beef bone with tomato. Choose from the numerous items available on the menu. They have a good variety of meat, seafood, vegetables, tofu, etc. Dessert is also included. Fun way to spend the evening with friends."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening on the recommendation of a friend. The price is typical of the hotpot places in the area so expect to pay ~30/person + extra for the soup bases. We got a large pot and split it into two - one side spicy, one side not. The spicy base was DELICIOUS and more suited to cooking meats & thicker noodles & fish balls - with thinner things like vermicelli the numerous peppercorns get caught and are difficult to remove.   I found the beef to be too tough when cooked - no matter how little time I left it in the pot. The lamb, however, was SO SO SOFT and almost melts in your mouth. Would definitely recommend.   The service was prompt and polite. What I really enjoyed about Taste in comparison to the other places is that the tables are relatively spaced out so you don't feel incredibly cramped. You could probably still eavesdrop on the table next to you but if you pushed your chair back you wouldn't have to fear hitting another chair/table and getting dirty looks.   They now do lunch for about ~20/person and I can't wait to check it out!"}
{"text":"Waaaay to pricey for hot pot. Probably why the restaurant was practically empty on a Friday night.  Food was ok but definitely not worth $29.99 plus extra $7-9 for each soup base!"}
{"text":"Hi Pot and Kim Tao used to be the two best hot pot places in richmond hill until HiPot's owner sold the resto and Kim Tao came under horrible, unfriendly, new management, as well as failing a couple of recent health inspections. Ever since then I've had to go to Little Sheep in scarborough or somewhere downtown for good hotpot.  This place just opened up recently and I think I've found the new go-to hotpot in richmond hill. The price is slightly more expensive (a la kaka ayce pricing) than the other hotpot fare around but some seafood is included in the price which more than makes up for it.   In addition, u tell the waiter what sauces u want and they bring em to u in little serviettes so u hve ur own custom sauce bar at ur table. The meat is really thinly sliced and also nice and fatty.  My fave soup base is definitely the pork and corn infused broth. It was sweet yet savoury at the same time. Service can vary A LOT depending on who u flag down so be warned haha. Most of the waiters only speak mandarin with the exception of one or two who know english, so be patient."}
{"text":"The fish ball, meat and veggies are in average quality.   The design and the overall furniture placement are pretty good as well as the traffics flow.   However, it's a little messy on the station you are trying to get the sauces and some spices.  Also when you check out, the waitress will Force you to pay more than 10% tips. If you do not pay it, they will start giving you the attitude. That's why this restaurant only deserve two stars."}
{"text":"The predecessor in this location was a hotpot place before but it has now changed hands to another hotpot restaurant.   Overall decor was not bad, one could tell thoughts and money were invested.    The variety of the sauces bar was catered towards a northern mainland Chinese palette unlike competitors like Day and Night.   The variety of dishes, meat and veggies were limited and the portions were unusually small. When we, a party of three, ordered lettuce and spinach, we were each given one stalk and one leave each, go figure! The mutton came with blood clots!   For the price of 22.99 plus cost of soup base, there are tons of better alternative hotpot restaurants out there!! Not seeing value here!"}
{"text":"I think this is my new go to for hotpot- it's only $19.99 on weekdays, and when you split the soup base costs it stills comes out to under $30pp after tax.   Nice decor with comfortable seating, not too crowded and well ventilated. The staff is also surprisingly patient- they stand there with their tablets checking off your whole order (which could take a while in a group even though I was trying not to be a jerk). It has all the essentials that I would order at hotpot and the quality seems decent.  The only thing I would not recommend was the \"secret dried spices\" which was an extra $1- we like chilis in our dipping sauce and didn't see the option so decided to try this out, and it tasted more like a dry rub for seasoning meat. Or maybe I'm doing it wrong, but it wasn't spicy at all."}
{"text":"Just like the other review mentioned the price is on the high side. Yes, in general all the hot pot places in the area has raised their price and this place are kind of inline with them. However, they charge alot for the soup base which is extra. If you get individual pot, that's even worse. Food quality is not bad. Service is great. Decor is modern with alittle industrial. I can find better hot pot place in Markham with similar prices. Will only come back if they reduce the price on the soup base."}
{"text":"I think this place got the best hotpot I can find in Ontario. I came from the city of hotpot- Chongqing. And I have tried so many times of hotpot at different places, none of them are as good as this one.   I like a restaurant that cares. They care about service, the plates that comes with food, the decorations, and music.   I can't find one single thing that disappoints me. Also price wise, it was more than fair. Hotpot ayce are generally pricey but here you pay $20.99 for weekend dinner.  Also nobody mentioned the better comes with shape of a bear? How cute is that!"}
{"text":"??????...good quality and tasty, I like tomato soup base, and my friend say the spicy soup base is very spicy... But they have a two hour time limits, me and my friends with a one year infant eating and chatting for 1 and 50 mins, they come to ask us to leave for 3times... I deed check the time!!"}
{"text":"This place took a while to finally open, but alas it finally did late last year. New hot pot restaurant that replaced Lucky Season Cuisine, which certainly didn't last very long (and was rated very poorly here).  Interior is very modern, a complete makeover from the previous establishments here. I came here on New Years Eve and found this place to not be terribly busy, but maybe word hasn't gotten out yet. There were definitely teething issues when I was there, such as some conflicting information on special deals (they were doing an opening special that was the same price as cash only, except an employee told us cash only was 10% off the opening price).  Selection is decent, however I found the meats here to be of lower quality. The beef in particular breaks apart easily when put into the hot pot. Similar case for the lamb as well unfortunately. Everything else was pretty good though, including the broth choices.  Service, as I mentioned, was not top-par and very disorganized. Hopefully it was opening month jitters and nothing more."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Service was awful. I felt that unless you spoke Cantonese, the wait staff completely ignored you.  I had asked for water, napkins and to have dishes cleared several times, staff would just walk by and would attend to nearby tables that asked for things in Cantonese.  We asked about some items on the menu and the response was \" I don't know\", when a big plate of seafood came out, I asked what one of the items were and we got the same response, \"I don't know\". Other tables were getting their soup pots refilled and water glasses refilled, while our table was ignored.  We did not feel welcomed in this restaurant. If you do come here, maybe bring a Cantonese/Mandarin speaking friend with you."}
{"text":"The service was excellent super attentive , very clean and friendly place . How ever the prices were way to high on a weekend night you go in thinking it's $30 per person,but there is a lot of extra cost for soup base,  spiciness of the base and what not !! Not that much variety on the meat selection and basic vegetables ."}
{"text":"People who come here and complain about prices are hilarious: have you seen competing hot pot restaurants? Taste Hotpot offers better service, soup bases, and overall atmosphere.  They have attentive waiters that understands the menu well and makes recommendations unlike other places who enjoy hiring zombie workers that know nothing except punching in buttons on their staff iPads.  If you prefer saving your money eating Hotpot then get your own portable gas stove and meat and vegetables and eat at home."}
