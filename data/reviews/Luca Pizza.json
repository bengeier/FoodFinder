{"text":"I had just arrived in Toronto from a flight from Vancouver and checked in at the Homewood Suites near the airport around 11:30pm. Unfortunately the hotel I stayed at didn't have room service so I browsed their restaurant suggestion and only Luca Pizza was able to deliver at midnight. The service was fast and the food was huge portion not to mention tasty. I wish I had cash on me to tip the delivery guy because the payment machine was closed after I had provided my info over the phone at time of order. Thank you for saving the day or else I would have gone hungry with no dinner to be found."}
{"text":"We go to Lucas at least once a month. Good food, really nice staff, and great quality! Gotta support and love a local business."}
{"text":"Best family run pizza place in Missisauga. Been coming here for years.

I'm originally from NY, so my pizza standards are quite high and while everything else in Canada is AMAZING.... it is a bit of a pizza desert.

This brings me back to what I like about pizza places. It's small, has a homey decor that doesn't look like it's changed since it opened, same guys right behind the counter always making the pizza. Nice non-nonsense atmosphere, come in get your stuff and get out. Love it.

The dough is well made, very good flavor and not thick. Sauce and cheese are good as well. It's on the pricey side, but that's what you want -  if you want cheap pizza you're more than welcomed to go to a chain place, but if you want quality come here. I always get the veggie pie or a greek pie. They are VERY VERY generous with the toppings. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I was a long time customer of Luca Pizza - that ends today. Ordered pizza at and was told it would take an hour for delivery. 1.5 hours later, I followed up and the pizza still wasn't in the oven. No courtesy whatsoever. They told us, in the manner or assholes, it will be another hour, \"I'm just a driver\" was the man's response. Never been talked down to as such.... Pizza business is competitive, you've lost us and our circles forever."}
{"text":"Generous ingredients really nice crust. Great pizza!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  But their wings are to die for.  Their crust is what sets them apart from other small pizzerias.  

When having ordered for delivery they take longer than other small local pizzerias and they've delivered the wrong drinks on 2 separate occasions - not a huge deal but still an inconvenience.  

We order from them probably 3-5 times every year.  We are just sure to pick up instead of asking for delivery."}
{"text":"called for delivery... didn't even get a hello and was instantly put on hold... when I asked for a delivery order the man on the phone was very abrupt and rude ... they say quick delivery on their add but told me it would be an hour for a small pizza and a salad...I don't care how good the food is/ might be  .... first impression was terrible.... I thought we had better customer service than this in canada."}
{"text":"Great clean pizza .
Not greasy  nice thin crust hot and crispy 
The sauce  was mild a bit of sweet fresh not burnt 
The pepperoni had a mild but spicy taste to it .
Fresh vegetables. 
PIZZA was baked perfect  with tips  a little burnt ."}

On a random evening my girlfriends decided we should order pizza and one friend in particular suggested this place. I hadn't tried this place before but my one friend (m) offered to pay. 

Who are we to say no to the invisibly delicious offer.

Pizza gets here, it's a cute older gentleman and he's hilarious. Or maybe it was the wine. Can't be too sure. 
The pizza wasn't the greatest. The dough was really thin. It seemed they had rolled the pizza to stretch it out. If you're into the thinner dough but more toppings, then you might enjoy it. Personally, I don't like when my toppings start to fall off because the dough isn't thick enough to keep them on the pizza.

The wings were amazing! I'm not a fan of hot sauce but for some reason I couldn't get enough of them. Again, it might have just been the wine so I cannot be too sure about how much hot sauce I was actually consuming. I did really enjoy the wings. They weren't breaded but they were very meaty. They were very generous with the side sauce too. Cool beans. 

Large pizza- 4 toppings (8 slices)& 1lb of hot wings from Luca Pizza = 30.74
Unique pizza ordering experience = priceless.

{"text":"Good solid pizza. Our first time here so we ordered the Canadian (pepperoni, mushrooms, real Canadian bacon). It was excellent. We ordered to go, took about  15-20 mins to get a medium 14\" pizza. 

We'll be ordering from here again. As a note for families, this is a take out spot only. Just a handful of standing spots if you opt for a single slice."}
{"text":"The best pizza! If you're looking for a quality amazing tasting pizza this is the place to order from. You gotta try it. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Luca's Pizza is a surprisingly good pizza place that is a great alternative to the usual pizza chains. 

Bruschetta is really good here. I feel like their standout item is the cheese blend. They use higher quality cheese than pizza pizza and dominos. 

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Horrible! If zero stars was an option it would be a zero. Should have gone with pizza pizza! Ordered at 10pm. They estimated 45-1hr for delivery. 12am come around, nothing. I call back and they have no idea why I haven't received my delivery. I tell them I would still like my food so they make it again. 1 hour goes by again and I call back. I confirm again that the delivery can call on arrival, They guy on the phone is rude and says how can I fix it the delivery guy is already out. ... it's 2018 and we live in a work of cell phones!! Don't order here  if you want your food. Food is horrible! Don't even waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Great pizza takeout spot! We have ordered from here several times... great experience each time. Pizzas not overly greasy and not dry like the big chains. Great specialty pizzas, lots of topping choices, delicious cheese. Delivery was quick.. friendly service. Wings are not their forte.. kinda dry."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from Luca over the last 8 years and can honestly say we have never had a bad pizza.

We never had a missed delivery and the folks are always nice. 

There are fancier pizza places out there but Luca consistently delivers."}
{"text":"Best pizza in mississauga by far!!! Fantastic service and even more fantastic pizza yummmmy!!!  Ordering from there ONLY from now on! Introduced to my work colleagues and it was a HIT!"}
{"text":"Randomly came in here to try the pizza as per suggestion of my boyfriend. I have no regrets!!! 
One of the most simply made and tasty pizzas I've had in the GTA. 

There's a nice crisp with the pizza and the flavour is perfect. If you're looking for a simple pepperoni, they'd make you a good one. The amount of cheese and pepperoni they use is perfect for each bite. 

Honestly I love pizza, who doesn't? But this pizza is definitely going to be one of my favs! I didn't even bother taking a picture for you all since I was too busy eating it. Anyways Luca's pizza filled my tummy with happiness and I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Well the pizza was not as good as everybody said it was the Calzone was not cooked through!
Very doughy"}
{"text":"If you love thin crust pizza like I do then you will love Luca Pizza.

Not far from me at Dixie & Bloor I particularly like the cheese blend they use."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've ever had in Canada always consistent always fresh the toppings are real toppings my go to pizza shop"}
{"text":"Don't do business with them if you are American FYI. I called their phone number for delivery. I specifically asked them to charge my MasterCard before delivering the pizza to me (just like dominos, papa John's, pizza hut, pretty much every pizza place does) and they told me NO. Now if you travel extensely you would know that some American banks may or may not place a hold on your card when traveling overseas. HAD I been able to pay over the phone and it had declined I would have been able to call my bank ahead of time to fix it. However they sent the man anyways to delivery  my pizza for me to pay in person with the credit card machine. Once the guy arrived, I swiped my card only to have it declined. Tried it again and it got declined. Again I'm using an American credit card so because they didn't take my order over the phone all these wasted energy only to have it declined in person. I gave the pizza guy a 5 dollar tip for his effort and for what..pizza taken back..No pizza, no nothing. I understand I'm in Canada but had they swiped it at the store ALL of this could have been AVOIDED. So in part I paid 5 dollar for NOTHING. Yes I practically just gave away money to this slow minded pizza company.  WASTE OF TIME AND USELESS!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  I would highly recommend.   We were all delightfully surprised with our order.   We ordered a basic pizza (cheese & sauce) and a pepperoni, mushroom, green olive.  Toppings were fresh and delicious and the basic pizza was almost as good as the pizza pie in Staten Island or Brooklyn NY!"}
{"text":"Luca was my second choice the other night after Marconi's kept giving me a busy signal and if it were slightly closer (and the construction on Dixie Road wasn't so ridiculous) I'd actually make it my first choice for pizza more often. I'd never tried it before but had heard about it from someone or read about it on some 'best of Mississauga' list and really, it didn't disappoint. 

I was actually in a way preparing for disappointment for a number of reasons. Firstly there is no pricing anywhere on their website (that scares me), the guy on the phone was neither friendly nor particularly helpful (I was afraid he took my order wrong) and I've lately experienced a string of pizza disappointments, places that have solid reviews or reputations yet turned out to be decidedly average. Maybe all of this tempered my opinion but I was impressed with the pie. 

The cheese was not only very good but also piled on rather generously, something that I've noticed a lot of places aren't doing anymore (rising dairy prices, I guess). The crust was tasty and nicely cooked, though I'd probably ask for it well done next time...just my personal preference. Toppings were also more generous than I had initially thought (mostly covered by the cheese) and certainly fresh. All in all a very good pizza, one that I'd instantly rank as among the best independent pizza places in Mississauga with confidence. 

As for the price it wasn't super cheap but not as much of a fortune as I feared. It came to $21.60 with tax for a very good sized medium pizza with artichoke, sundried tomato and onions (plus a rather dinky dipping sauce). So roughly in line with what other similar places charge...see my review of Mickey's Pizza for a pretty detailed cost comparison. 

So I'd definitely recommend and again would probably even place it on my list of Mississauga's best, if I ever get around to actually making one!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!!! 
Amazing dough ! U can taste the difference & freshness ! They're specialty pizzas are all delicious! 
Their wings are also very good! 
Love them!"}
{"text":"The best homemade pizza in town! You would never be disappointed with Luca pizza !!! It's drool! Yummmm and the wings are awesome as well! I am not a pizza person but this really hits the spot all the time! It's delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh... had much better
Sauce tasteless, little cheese. Caesar salad with fake bacon bits??? Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Great pizza whether it's just a walk-in for a slice or a delivered meal to your home. Always our go to for poker nights, the Luca Sports Special never disappoints!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a classic-style pizza, no chicago deep dish, no stone oven just regular classic, Luca does this the best! Best toppings, best cheese, perfect dough. Mmm"}
{"text":"We waited for 1 hour and 45 minutes and were told, \"if you want quality, you will wait\". We got dove wings and burnt pizza. 

Never again. The manager was a jerk and stated that he would give me 5 or 10 dollars off. Should have been free!"}
{"text":"We are visiting Toronto for the weekend, so unfortunately I won't be able to say that I'll be a regular at Luca Pizza.  We chose Luca PIzza because of the good Yelp reviews and their website said free delivery on orders greater than $17.00. The food was absolutely delicious.  I'll go into the specifics in a little bit.  The rules and regulations that you have to abide by and basically hoops you have to jump through to get free delivery are a bit much.

5 stars for food.
3 stars for service
posting 4 stars for the review.

I called in my order for spaghetti and meat sauce (10.00), garden salad (7.99).  Cleared the $17.00 delivery minimum, or so I thought.  The gentleman on the phone very nicely explained to me that the delivery minimum has been increased to $20.00 a few months ago.  Ok, I'll go along with that and I ordered 2 cans of pop.  He puts me on hold for about a minute and tells me that he spoke to the owner and the owner said the beverages don't count toward the $20.00 delivery minimum, would I like to order garlic bread.  Geesh!  At that point I wanted to ask 'Are there any other rules I have to abide by before I can place this order?\"

So I added an order for garlic bread with cheese and  THAT finally put us over the $20.00 food-only delivery minimum.

The food arrived in about 35 minutes. That was a reasonable delivery time.  They delivered right to our hotel room door.

This may sound weird but the spaghetti and meat sauce was the best spaghetti I have ever had at a restaurant!  I think I am saying that because it tasted so much like my Mom's spaghetti and meat sauce.  YUM!  The spaghetti noodles were cooked perfectly al-dente.  One order was enough for 2 people to share.

The garlic bread with cheese was good.  When the order taker asked whether I wanted to add garlic bread to the order in order to meet the $20.00, he didn't tell me that garlic bread was included with the spaghetti dinner.  It is not stated on their website either. So now we had ALOT of garlic bread.  Once again, it was the best tasting garlic bread I have ever had!  I loved the garlic spread they used on the soft Italian bread.

In the end, I am glad we ordered from Luca Pizza."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here after reading the yelp reviews. Ordering was very friendly and easy. They said 45 to 60 minutes but took 1.5 hours. The pizza did come hot and we really enjoyed it. We got the super and I was impressed with the real bacon and fresh toppings. More of a thinner crust. Overall we enjoyed and will order again."}
{"text":"Dreadful.  Food, delivery, everything.

Average tasting crust.  Absolutely no sauce on it, so dry.  (I don't want it soaking wet, but I do want sauce on it!!)

Toppings are ok, but not great.  Quite expensive.  And I could get much better from other true gourmet places, or frankly, pizza hut.

Yelp is extremely reliable, I find, generally 90 percent of the time.  However, it's EXTREMELY incorrect for this business!

CASH ONLY.  Yelp info is incorrect on that as well!

The worst part?  DELIVERY IS NOT FREE.  There is a 20 dollar MINIMUM CHARGE.  If you spend less, you have to pay the 20 BUCKS.  And if you're home alone and ordering a small, you won't spend that, until they charge you the difference.

This is ILLEGAL.  Unless you are informed when ordering, which they choose not to do.  

It is also extremely unethical to not disclose such a minimum, each and every time that a customer calls.  Frankly, it's a really bad way to keep a customer.  Cause you won't!"}
{"text":"We live close by and often order Luca's pizza. It was our first meal when we moved into our house. And we were so excited to have such an awesome pizza place in our neighborhood. Fresh. Tasty. Cost effective. Great for an evening in or to treat friends! They do deliver and are open till 1AM. What's not to LOVE?"}
{"text":"Definitely for those who like a thin crust on their pizza. If you're looking for something thicker and more substantial in the crust, don't order here. However, if you like thin crust, this pizza is very good. The sauce and cheese blend are one of the best I've tried, but sadly the pizza overall is a tad too oily for my taste.

The bottom line; would I order from here again? Yes. Would it be my first choice to order from? No."}
