{"text":"Likely the worse Mexican restaurant I have ever been to.  The food is just tasteless and seemes to be re-heated old food."}
{"text":"I have eaten in Don Jose' a few times since they opened- and I am a fan. I can never get over how quickly  the food is prepared- yet it is always fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere in side is clean- but cold and there is not much of a bar, but for good food, you cannot go wrong. Their lunch spvcials are inexpensive, yet give you plenty of food. The queso is one the best I have had and they also have great happy hour margarita specials. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent homemade mexican food. Don't let the hidden sign fool you. I'd love for this restaurant to be more popular. Way better food than El Campesino. Tasty burritos, best chile rellenos, amazing carnitas..."}
{"text":"I was happy to learn that the owner used to own Ole Jose' by the Robinson Mall.  That was was my favorite Mexican restaurant until it closed.  The owner brought the same great menu and service to the new location.  The new location is bigger and the bar is very nice.  Will keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This is just like every other place I've tried,  if you went to El Camposino or Patron's it is the same.   I got iced tea and asked if you get free refills and was told yes but when I asked for a to go cup I was charged for drinks twice.  Since when does free refill mean pay for it?   Then they act like they doesn't understand when you ask about the double charge.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Five stars for what it is. It's not a five-star restaurant but for a local Mexican restaurant,  it was five-star. Food was great. New spot for our Margarita Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Tasty with a wonderful level of spicy heat.  My new favorite Mexican Restaurant in Robinson.  The prices are great,  the service fast, the food tasty.  I love Chile Rellenos and these met my high expectations.   The chicken burrito was stuffed with thick pieces of chichen breast.  Their salsa is thin with a kick.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yum!  I'm very picky and I thought this was delicious!  Got the plate with a taco, a quesadilla, rice and beans.  The taco had ground meat, lettuce, and lots of cheese, the quesadilla had lots of cheese in it, though it was just a little bigger than the taco, it was crispy and delicious! My bf got the plate with a burrito and a chicken enchilada, the burrito was juicy, chock-full of beef and tomatoes and that's it! I was expecting a refried bean mush-fest like Taco Bell!  But it was nothing like that, best ever!  The enchilada contained tons of pulled chicken, peppers and onions, and was also very good, even though I don't like peppers!  They have a special on Tuesdays with tacos for 1.25$, soft tacos 1.49$. They have lots of Veggie options too!  We used a BOGO coupon from the Enjoyment book.  Definitely will be back  =)"}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican restaurants I've been to in Pittsburgh. The carne asada tacos were great and reasonably priced. Great chips and salsa too"}
{"text":"This hole-in-the wall in the old mall (by Eat-N-Park) is a good place to get a hardy Mexican-style meal that doesn't break the budget.  I suggest you split a plate with someone; portions are generous, and come with salsa chips.   It's easy for 2 people to fill up on tasty food for $10 here. I'll return."}
{"text":"Place is somewhat hidden in a litte strip of stores, but great food. Salsa was great, cancun burrito was fantastic. Two steps ahead of Campesino and Azteca in my opinion. Didnt make happy hour, but looked  to have good deals on margs."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Clean.  Friendly and prompt service.  Huge selection of appetizers and entrees.  Gluten free options aplenty!  Definitely going to be a go-to for some good, local and reasonably priced Mexican !"}
{"text":"While in town for business, a co-worker asked if I would like to try a new Mexican restaurant for dinner. My answer of course was: \"absolutely!\"  The only issue here, was that he could not remember the name.  As he navigated our way to the restaurant I launched a brief investigation through Yelp to see if i could crack this case and figure out the name of this mystery establishment.  The case quickly escalated to red alert status as my findings were leading me to believe that we may be headed to Plaza Azteca, a rapidly growing Mexican chain restaurant!  As we continued the journey, I began to break out in a sweat.  As we got closer, and he said \"it should be right around the corner here,\"I clenched the arm rest tightly and said a quick prayer and played out my exit strategy/speech in my head: \"Oh Lord Jesus it's a chain restaurant, got out of the car, and ran for my life, didn't grab my phone, laptop bag or nothing Jesus, I just ran for my life!\"  But as we rounded that corner, my prayers had been answered as signage for Don Jose Mexican Grill gloriously appeared!  Phew!!!     The things I put myself through can't be good for my heart!  Fortunately, fine Mexican food certainly is, right?    DJMG is tucked away in a small strip mall.  The inside of the restaurant is subtlety and tastefully decorated.  They do not not go over the top to the degree that you see many Mexican restaurants go.  The lighting is somewhat dimmed, creating a soothing and calming environment.  Service was just fair.  Our waiter did not come across as a very joyful soul.  He appeared at our table, pad and pen in hand ready to write.  When questions were asked they were answered, just not with any excitement or enthusiasm.  I am not saying he was rude because he was not, just could have displayed more of a welcoming demeanor.  Complimentary chips and salsa certainly get you bonus points, although it really should be an expectation.  The chips were served warm with a nice sized bowl of salsa.  Not the best salsa, not the worst salsa, just fine salsa.  As many Mexican restaurants have, DJMG has quite an expansive menu.  The combination platters featured allow you to sample a few of the offerings in one sitting.  I also like that the menu had descriptions on the back cover as each item was thoroughly described.  If you need a refresher on a \"chalupa\", just turn to the back page.  I ended up going for the combo including: chalupa, beef enchilada and a chile relleno.  I am pleased to say that every thing was very good, nothing was left on the plate.  The highlight for me here was the chile relleno, outstanding!  My co-worker also thoroughly enjoyed his burrito.  It was certainly a monster as it stretched almost both length and width the entire span of the plate.  It is also worth mentioning that DJMG has a full service bar.  Many of these type of Mexican restaurants are turning to BYOB.  You can grab a Dos Equis draft accompanied by a lime at DJMG.  If DJMG is a chain, it is not one that I have ever been to before.  The food was great and would certainly be willing to relive this adventure some day soon."}
{"text":"The places looks very nice and updated. The service is friendly and they are constantly refilling water cups and salsa bowls. The food was delicious. I got carne asada tacos which I was happy to see on the menu. So far I've gone to many Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh and this one has beat the rest. If you are looking for good and real as it gets Mexican come here. They serve tacos in corn tortillas not that flour or hard shell stuff other restaurants do. I'm from Los Angeles and finding good Mexican in pa is close to nearly impossible but this place I can vouch for. Try it out. It's not expensive and it's worth it. They even have happy hour. I haven't been here for happy hour so I can't say from experience if it's good or not but it's 3.49 for a margarita and 2.00 for domestic beer and 3.00 for imports. Glad to hear I can get my margarita and corona action on for cheap on the weekdays :)"}
{"text":"We had a quick lunch here while shopping in Robinson.  I agree with  Gerret W. that the chips were terrible--ours were definitely stale.  I thought the salsa was just OK.  The food, especially the lunch specials, is very reasonably priced and definitely authentic, a rarity in the 'burgh.  I had a spinach enchilada with rice and beans--not spicy enough for me, but that's the authentic preparation and luckily they had my favorite habanero sauce on the table.  I noticed that they had snow cone syrup gallons by the maragarita machine--not a good sign.  I would skip the bar here, but if you're looking for a quick, cheap, authentic Mexican meal it's a good place to get one!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. My fianc√© and I love it. It's our favorite Mexican place close by. The chips and salsa are great. The food is very authentic. The staff is always very accommodating. The atmosphere is always quiet and laid back, and it is never difficult to get a table."}
{"text":"Of the three Mexican places to choose from in the Robinson area (Don Pablo's & El Campasino being the other two), this is by far the best. They have a nice, very reasonably priced lunch menu which you can order from on a Saturday (seems like most lunch menus only good M-F). My Chicken Chimichunga was very good and my wife's fajita even better. Some very good happy hour drink specials which i'll check out someday soon."}
{"text":"On TV there is Flip UR House.  This is Flip UR Restaurant.   Mexican now but it was Korean not to long ago.   Not sure, but I think our waiter said the owner had another Mexican restaurant but lost his lease and was happy to find this space.  Service was very good and friendly.  Two waiters served us.   Good on refills including the chips and salsa.   The chips were warm and fresh.  The Salsa relatively spicy.   The food and menu were somewhat similar to other Mexican places.  The guacamole was pretty good.  The relleno and chalupa were a hit. The beef burrito was just OK.  The beef tasted as if it had been in a warmer for a long period of time and just not that good.  Don Jose has beer and Margarita's."}
{"text":"Service was excellent!  I thought the chips and salsa was very good. Chips were warm and if you want very HOT salsa, just ask!! I had a combination fish and shrimp that was Mucho Bueno! = Damn Good!!  Music playing is great. I will be back!!! I definitely recommend this place for Great Mexican Food."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Authentic Mexican food at a seriously good price! The staff is friendly and attentive, and the chips & salsa are plentiful and mouthwateringly delish!! We love their chicken fajitas and the quesadilla rellena - but everything is so yummy you can't go wrong. Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Two things every Mexican restaurant should excel at: chips/salsa and margaritas. The salsa was awesome, the chips were capital-T Terrible. The margarita was huge, the flavor was store bought, oversoured, and poor. The margarita on the rocks was also warm... Tacos were good, the rice was oddly sweet but had a great texture and flavor, and the lunch menu had a good selection. As I said in the title, a mixed bag. Some good, some bad, but enough bad to keep me away. THINGS TO KEEP: Don't ever change the salsa recipe THINGS TO FIX: Make your own margarita mix, and make it cold Change where you buy your chips Take some of the sweetness out of the rice"}
{"text":"A relocated \"Ole Jose\" (from less than two miles away), this location isn't as easy to locate, but the food remains consistently good. The extended family owns at least two other Mexican restaurants, and they all share a similar menu. (Chippewa's El Paso is our favorite, so far.)   Being from California, we have a different idea of \"Mex\" than many locals. I'd love to swap out the \"crispy\" taco shells, for example, for \"real tacos\" with soft corn tortillas. But, overall, the food stands above the larger chains is the next best thing to home.   I had the \"Grande\" meal to sample a bit of everything. The relleno is excellent, and the rice and beans are much better than the nearby chains (Don Pablo, Mad Mex). The enchilada was okay, not spectacular. I love the salsa, which has a nice roasted taste.  We'll return and I'll try to pay more attention to details. While not a \"wow\" experience, it was good; it's simple and a better meal than most other Mex places in the region.   The prices are a value."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Aliquippa:   It wasn't gross but our dishes had no sauce on them. Enchiladas and whatever else we had were just ground meat in wrappers with no sauce. No spices, no flavor. It was like were being messed with. Like a joke. A lot of food, just no flavor whatsoever. Their fajitas are delicious. (Someone else in our party). Will never go back unless its for the fajitas. Their traditional dishes are crap."}
