{"text":"Can only comment on the Korean beef poutine. This is a MUST try. Perfect amount of flavour and portions are on point! I look forward to trying the other menu items :)"}
{"text":"The Korean Beef sandwich is delicious! Also tried the Jerk chicken poutine which came out piping hot and piled high, very tasty too. I was a little annoyed with the .25 cent charge for a tiny I mean tiny container of hot sauce. A small restaurant in a strip plaza, new and it's clean! If you're in the area and feel like a tasty lunch, I would highly recommend trying the sandwich."}
{"text":"They don't have a washroom so you cannot wash your hands. That is kinda weird for a food place. Buy otherwise I got their Philly cheese steak sandwich and korean BBQ beef poutine. The sandwich exceeds my expectation but I think the poutine can use more meat. Otherwise, I enjoyed the food there."}
{"text":"Delicious! Little shop with great pride in the food they serve. Been several times now - each time the food has been consistently great. Sandwiches are always fresh, portions are generous. Combinations are superb. And you can call your order in ahead of time so it's ready when you get there. New favourite spot!!"}
{"text":"1st time - take -out  Tasty.  JUST ate the veal sandwich.  Local, and reasonably priced so that's good.  It was tasty.  Personally, I'd try again; however, California sandwiches are a bit tastier (but also a whole heck of a lot more expensive).    Hubby enjoyed his Philly cheesesteak sandwich and inferno fries; disappointed that they no longer serve the butter chicken poutine (it's still on the menu :( )  Boy enjoyed his Cuban sandwich.  Well priced and tasty.  Definitely worth another visit.  Good to support local business."}
{"text":"Excellent service, Excellent Cuban sandwhich, now I want to go back and try other options. The chipotle mayo dip is amazing. Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I have been in many times But failed to write a review.  This place is great. Love to support local places and this place is awesome.  I have had many of the sandwiches.  My two favorite are the jerk chicken and the Korean beef.  They taker phone orders which is helpful if they are busy.  Saves time.  My only complaint had to do with ambience.  The blue tooth speaker behind the counter does not spread the music well.  The place is great"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this joint. I have tried multiple sandwiches here. All top notch. My favorite by far has to be the \"Lomito\". Do yourself a big and go try it. I have ordered this sandwich multiple times. Safe for me to say it is the best sandwich i have ever had. Hope this place picks up and sticks around."}
{"text":"Upgrading now.  They have one vegetarian sandwich (eggplant parm) but the eggplant was fried and I didn't want fried food.  The co-owner asked if I would like the chef to customize something and just whip something up vegetarian and he came up with a satay vegetable sandwich which was absolutely delicious.  I love how they are open to new ideas and customization.  BEST SANDWICH IN 'SAUGA."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches I really enjoyed there Korean beef and kimchi. It's a small place just recently opened up. The owner is a nice guy good service. I would recommend this place if your looking for a good sandwich on the go."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Quick service and the food was both fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the Korean Beef Sandwich and Jay's Original Poutine... so good! Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday afternoon around 1:15 PM, and the place wasn't terribly busy, so we were able to grab a table to eat in. Note that the place only had 2-3 tables when we visited, so it may not be a good idea to eat in with large groups. We noticed a lot of people picking up take-out orders instead.  We weren't too hungry, so we decided to split a sandwich, just to try the place out. We ordered a) the Korean Beef Sandwich, and b) an order of the Inferno Fries. Honestly, that sandwich is what dreams are made of. I hate it when sandwich bread scrapes the roof of my mouth, and, additionally, first world problems jokes aside, I really dislike it when sandwich meat is too dense, hard to chew, and flat in flavour. Jay's sandwiches fixed these problems perfectly. The bread was nice and soft. The beef was perfectly seasoned, marinated, and soaked in delicious sauce - so much flavour, and such a pleasure to consume. The fries were crispy and had a great kick to it. In short, we devoured our shared meal.  For two people, our order came to a total of approximately $14.92. We will definitely, absolutely be back. And as an aside, thanks for the great, friendly service!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend had the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich and the jerk chicken poutine. Both were absolutely amazing!   I had the pulled pork sandwich. It was great. Nice flavour to the BBQ sauce and the pork was tender. The bun was fresh.   Will definitely have to make another stop in to eat. I wanted to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"We came in yesterday to try the jerk chicken sandwich. My girlfriend saw their flyer while doing laundry at a laundromat and was like we have to go. The wait was quite long, I won't lie but it was well worth it. The owner was by himself so we understood he was busy - I'm sure in the future when business starts booming (because I'm positive it will) he'll have help and the wait won't be so bad. We also saw a couple ppl that had come in to pick up orders they called in - so if you don't want to wait, that's an option. Our meal (2 sandwiches, reg order of fries, reg order of sweet potato fries) came to $26. Tad pricey as you have to buy the fries separate (their combos only come with pop and chips) but if you take away the fries the sandwiches are reasonably priced and filling on their own. The jerk chicken sandwich was delicious!!!! It was hot (spicy) but not too hot to where you couldn't enjoy it. I didn't need to use the side of hot sauce. The sandwich is shredded/pulled chicken with a yummy jerk sauce piled with coleslaw and fried plantain on a soft cocoa bun. Perfect blend of sweet & spicy. It's a bit messy but that's what made it so good, in my opinion. I had a side of sweet potato fries (chipotle mayo is 50 cents extra and the downside is you really dont get a lot - definitely not enough for the amount of fries given). Jay came out and apologized for the wait but as I said, it was really worth it and we told him so. Big smile from him. You can tell this guy takes pride in his food and was happy his customers enjoy it. We'll definitely be back to try all the others on the list. I HIGHLY recommend this spot - I'm in trouble since I live just down the street."}
{"text":"This is a small sandwich shop located at a strip mall along Bloor St. near Cawthra Road. There are only a few tables so it is mostly takeout.   Jay's offers a variety of sandiwiches from... you guessed it - around the world.The menu is definitely a talking point as it is very diverse. For example, they have the Lumito (Argentinean), jerk chicken sandwich (Caribbean), and the Korean Beef sandwich (Korean). There are many more sandwiches to round out the menu.  Thus far, I've had the lumito and the jerk chicken. Both were cooked with fresh ingredients and tasted unlike other sandwiches I've had before. The jerk chicken sandwich had fried plantains on it - that was a nice touch. The lumito was interesting.. It was a steak sandwich with fried egg. lettuce, tomato, and Jay's homemade lumito sauce. A unique taste and very good, but probably not something I'd order again.   I enjoy going to this place to get Jay's take on different cuisines. He manages to create interesting fusions and pack them into his sandwiches. I look forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Sangwiches of da world my goodness. My first and only trip to Jays was for the Jerk Chicken Sammie. First the interior. Tres chic!  Lol. No glam or glitter here. The sangwich. Juicy, melt your bun to mush, messy meh. I probably should have ordered something else. I went at an off hour so there was no wait. Dayaam I had such high hopes for this place. Oh well. The Search continues."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches around. Tried them all love the Korean beef, jerk and the hip the most but there all amazing. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was good but the poutine had a weird after taste so it wasn't that delicious as it looked maybe because we came in an hour before closing time so the oil mustve been used from all day to get that weird taste. Tried the Korean beef one."}
{"text":"This place became my favorite after my first visit,tried Korean,Lomito,Cuban,Veal and JERK,they were all very tasty and delicious:)Cuban and veal are definitely my favorite!Tried Korean pouting and it was incredible...I have to admit I am there minimum 3 times a week..owner is very friendly and place looks clean spotless. ."}
{"text":"Nice owner.  Inferno fries are definitely spicy.  Korean beef was a good sandwich.  The kind of lunch that leaves you craving A SALAD for dinner. Tasty, not very healthy."}
{"text":"Had to try this new hot sandwich spot. I was really excited to try the jerk chicken sandwich. It was a good size, and had good flavour... It wasn't too spicy and the plantain was a nice sweet touch!  The coconut bun was nice and soft but I wish it had more of a coco taste to it. The coleslaw was normal old fashion coleslaw... Would've been nice if it was a Caribbean type of coleslaw with ginger etc. All in all it was a 3.5 sandwich.   Customer service was great so I'm giving this place a 4. I'm planning on coming back to try their other sandwiches and then update my review.  P.S there is a \"Help Wanted\" sign if anyone is looking for a job :)"}
{"text":"Went here after reading all the good reviews and I was so disappointed. The quality of the food just reminded me of being in high school. It's they or of place you'd stop by while walking home from school with your friends and want a snack. The school cafeteria fries, gravy and cheese all passed through a window so you never really see what's going on. The concept is good but very poorly executed. Always boggles my mind how one off shops can bother using powdered gravy and junky cheese and call it a poutine."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much and sadly wasn't surprised with anything special or great.  Philly cheese steak sandwich was good, problem was the chicken parm sandwich literally had the texture of a rubber glove.  Customer service was poor too, was asked by the attendant how our food was, I replied 'to be honestly the chicken on my sandwich is very tough.' She didn't have anything to say or offered a replacement or even considered to look at it or resolve this issue. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"After read some reviews thought I would check it out.  Ordered Philly cheese steak sandwiche and an original poutine.  $18.50 for ones meal a bit pricey they should have combo menus to make things easier to try on the menu.  Philly cheese steak sandwiches was really tasty I believe it was 7-8 inches long and it was very cheesy.  Poutine was a small portion size for $7 probably would steer clear from there next time unless there some combo prices on the bar future.  Definitely have a lot of other items I would like to try on their menu. Looking forward to checking this place out again"}
{"text":"Great new sandwich spot!  Read about it on another food blog. It's a new business - met Jay who prepared my sandwich - great guy who understands just how important a great tasting sandwich can be!   Tried the Korean Beef - priced right, tastes like a home style sandwich. Fresh ingredients, bun was soft and tasty, and it was nice and filling.   He also has his own hot sauce that he makes which is quite tasty. Worth asking for!  Also seems to have interesting options like a butter chicken sandwich, jerk chicken sandwich, and other choices.  Bottom line: tasty sandwiches at reasonable prices with some unique choices. Will be back."}
{"text":"i tried the korean beef yesterday and it was so GOOD. it reminded me a bit of the kalbi beef from banh mi boys. the bread was soft, there was alot of meat and yummy sauce (i love things drowned in sauce)  i will totally be back to try other things."}
{"text":"This is the place for a sandwich!  Al and I had a Phillie Cheesesteak  and a Korean Steak sandwich and we split them.   Both were tasty and hearty.  The bun was fresh and crunchy.  This place is new located on bloor st. And Mississauga Valley.   Give yourself a treat and give them a try."}
