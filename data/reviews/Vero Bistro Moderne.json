{"text":"The food here is magical.
I had the Sterling Silver Pork Chop, and I can honestly say it was the best thing I ever ate. It was so good I think I was momentarily disorientated. It was definitely a large serving, nothing skimpy here like at other pricey restaurants. Service was pretty good as well. He forgot our tea, but gave it to us for free later. It is a very, very small restaurant, so make sure you have a reservation! This would make an amazing place for a date. Very intimate."}
{"text":"Recent brunch experience, such good food, such uncomfortable seating and marginal service. No hosting, taking coats without us asking. Good waitress left mostly on her own by owner/manager to run her tail off. We sat with finished plates while he re-set empty tables. Beautiful designer chairs will give biz to local chiropractors they are so uncomfortable. Too bad, the great food doesn't over-ride the apathetic service. Plus, strict rule, Cafe Americain, no refills allowed, only choice, for a Brunch!!??"}
{"text":"I had heard great comments about Vero, but it wasn't until a few days ago that we finally decided to try it out for a Wednesday night dinner with our friends. 

It's a fairly small restaurant so it is better to make reservations in advance, specially if it's a weekend night, or so we were told. Despise of the great atmosphere and service, we were not impressed with the menu nor the taste of the food. There were a few healthy options, a decent variety of fish and beef entrées, all from $30 - $40. I had the BC salmon, presentation was gorgeous but taste was just alright. 

If I am in the area I would not mind eating at Vero but I would not go out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch. 

The service was great. Ordered the steak and egg (on top of fries) and the bacon/shrimp eggs benny. Both were delightful! This food is NOT healthy diet food, so expect lots of butter and olive oil in the dishes! It's very heavy but absolutely scrumptious. I would definitely come back again to try the other menu items!

Ambiance: the acoustics in this restaurant are some of the worst in Calgary. I could literally hear one man's very personal conversation from over 20 feet away. I was hesitant to talk much due to other people hearing my life story. The voices echo off the walls in the worst way (especially men's voices) so that you can barely hear the person in front of you speaking. I highly recommend acoustic ceiling tiles to dampen the noise. This restaurant is too cozy and quaint in size to handle the noise level without acoustic management."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while, but decided to try it again.  They used to advertise a $15 lunch special, but wasn't offered today.  The bison burger listed on the menu wasn't available, so I tried the substitute - the steak sandwich with chips instead - ended up being $20 with tax..  The presentation was beautiful, and the food was very good.  The waiter Bill was nice and efficient - I had eaten there before, and had a waitress who seemed a bit less friendly.  The chef came out to serve some food at one point, as it was getting more busy, which I thought was nice.  I would definitely come back - the atmosphere was nice, but food here in Calgary is just more expensive than what I'm used to in general."}
{"text":"My bf and I made a last minute reservation here for Valentines Day and we were both amazed by this place. There was a set 6 course menu for Valentines Day made up by Chef Jenny and it was quite pricey. It was $95 a person for the meal and $25 per person for wine pairing. We normally don't splurge $286 on a meal but my bf and I thought \"why not....we don't do it often so lets celebrate\". It was worth EVERY penny. The proscuitto from Spain was the starter and it was absolutely incredible. It just melted in your mouth. Next course was the pan seared bay scallops followed by the gnocci in a cream sauce. The filet mignon was the main course and it was so tender. It was easy to cut through and it melted in your mouth. I know i'm missing one other course and the dessert was fantastic. It was a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream with a baked caramel wafer. Sprinkled around the ice cream was rock sugar of some sort and when they poured the amazing chocolate sauce over it, it crackled like rice crispies. Then when you ate it, your mouth tingled. It was incredible. The meal was so good that it forced us to eat slow because we wanted to savor EVERY bite. My bf and I were having a bit of buyers remorse as we normally do not splurge like this on a meal however like what I said before....it was worth every single penny. The service was incredible and the fact that Chef Jenny came out afterwards to greet the customers and ask how their meal was, did it for me. You can tell she has the passion for creating great food and ensuring her customers are happy."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday, the food was delicious but definitely on the very pricey side. I thought it was a little too dark in there though.. But I guess it's just for mood. Wish it was a bigger place a bit."}
{"text":"Another pretencious fine dining restaurant in town. I ordered the lobster mac and cheese, the noodle was overbaked and the texture is hard. The food tastes bland and is greasy. There's small puddle of oil at the bottom of the bowl! disgusting! The worst part is the lobster is OVERCOOKED and it tasts like a frozen lobster from supermarket. The dish is a total failure.Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant three times now. I've enjoyed it every time. There's no question that the food is spectacular. You definitely need a reservation. I found the portions a bit small, but the quality of the food was excellent. A bit pricey, but a nice treat."}
{"text":"We dined at Vero on a Sunday, the Sunday menu is a \"tasting experience\". This means that a large dish of food is placed in the centre of the table. Then all members of your party dishup their portion to their own plate.  The 5-6 course meal was delicious, I would highly recommend Vero to anyone."}
{"text":"Vero is impressive in its menu, service and atmosphere.  

Firstly the food. Each dish stood out on its own. Consistent quality made for an impressive menu.

Lamb shank special: Vero has daily specials and I was lucky enough to get this glorious version of meaty goodness. A full lamb shank still on the bone with veggies and a very good mash made for a solid entree. 

Lobster Mac and cheese: This dish is built to impress. Unlike other lobster mac & cheese, Vero serves this dish with a whole lobster tail in the shell so that you know you are getting your money's worth. A mix of rich cheese with well prepared lobster means this dish is well done. 

Chocolate mouse: yum yum yum, chocolately goodness.  

Mango cheesecake: The only minor let down of the meal. It was still good but not anything special. 

Service & Atmosphere
Service was warm, knowledgable and the perfect balance of involved but not intrusive. Was the last table in the restauraunt but did not feel any pressure to finish up and was able to relax and enjoy the meal rather than feel rushed.  

Well done Vero, you have won me over. 

13/30"}
{"text":"Very good food and decent wine menu.  

The food menu could be updated more often and include some more non meat dishes - fish and vegetarian.  The three course set menus on specific days are a good way to try Vero, but obviously you lack the option to choose your preferred dishes from the menu.  

Good ambience and decor / subtlety stylish small restaurant.  Was a little too much air conditioning."}
{"text":"Vero best brunch spot.. they have the best eggs Benedict and French toast stuffed with passion fruit creme brûlée.
The decor is modern and classy. It is always spotless in there. The staff is so friendly, I love everyone who works there.  I really have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. I love how the menu has gluten free options and locally sourced ingredients. The eggs are even organic.
The flavours of the bennies are unbeatable and even the presentation is top notch.
If no one has tried brunch at Vero, you must try this place!!!!! You will be happy you came."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! The guys at Kensington Fitness told me about it and I so happy they did. (They were eating dinner and it smelt sooo good I couldn't resist asking where it was from).

Anyways the restaurant is so cute, and the staff are nice and helpful.

But it's the food that is amazing, so yummy. They've got lots of classics with a unique twist. My fav is still their steak but their cranberry bread that they serve before the meal is really good.

If you are looking for a great place for a date this is the place!"}
{"text":"I don't think I'll ever eat this well again.  Expensive but so worth it.  You're literally forced to chew in slow-mo because you don't want the experience to end.

Sea bass.... *drools*"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is just amazing & very nice classy place. I just don't like how they close up early"}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfast on a sunny patio. Stuffed French toast for my friend and an incredible eggs Benedict with smoked meat. Excellent food and presentation at this terrific restaurant."}
{"text":"Expectations were high and our whole party was dissapointed. Table wasn't ready for our reservation and the server was nice enough but missed a few little things. Food was hit and miss as one appetizer was amazing while others just fell flat. None of the meals blew us away and considering the price there is no way I would return or recommend."}
{"text":"I've been on a gnocchi kick lately, so on my most recent brunch escapade with my lovely ladies, my heart and belly were set on the sweet potato and sunny side egg version that Vero had to offer.

I was almost swayed by the eggs benny (which a couple of the girls did get) but had to stay true to my desire. Microgreens garnished a heaping of gnocchi (that was complemented with wild boar bacon, walnuts and a maple butter) and a bright organic egg. There was a perfect balance of salty and sweet, and walnuts gave the dish a nice added texture. 

Granted, it is a bit pricey here, but worth the splurge every once in a while you want to treat yo' self. You will not be disappointed with the atmosphere, presentation and service."}
{"text":"Love this place. The rest of the team is FABU!!! There a few items on the menu that I'm not a huge fan of but for the most part the good stuff is to die for!!! the chef jenny chu is amazing.  There desserts are really good too, appy's and meals delic!!! This is a place that I bring everyone I know to. 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a coworker-I've been meaning to try it for awhile.

We didn't have reservations but they were able to get us a table-I would recommend making a reservation though if going at a peak time as it isn't a huge place.

Their lunch menu was great-basically a 2 course meal starting at $15 going up to about $22 with most being under 20. Lots of choice so there is something for everyone for sure. They were out of one item (Bistro burger) but were able to recommend another great option (Mac and Cheese). The food was fresh, filling in a way where you felt like you got your money's worth but could still work the rest of the day.

Both of our meals were a little salty but I think that was the nature of what we ordered-at least it was fresh cooked food made by a real chef rather than microwaved plastic food from a chain. The service was professional, quick and attentive.

The decor was nice too-simple but edgy. I was already planning when I could introduce someone else to this spot halfway through my appie. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My gf and I randomly stumbled upon this place while we were searching for a nearby brunch place. It's small and so easy to miss but I'm so glad we managed to find it. If there's one place that perfects poached eggs, it is here. I highly recommend the smoked salmon and jumbo prawn poached eggs on top of the croissant. The eggs are organic and the croissant tasted very fresh with a slight crisp on the outside. I was a huge fan of the hollandaise sauce and white balsamic the eggs were topped with. Another major plus is that they don't skimp on the smoked salmon and jumbo prawns.

Great place to go for brunch if you're tired of typical brunches that just offer a bunch of egg/hash dishes. The dishes here are very fresh and unique."}
{"text":"I was at this location 3 years ago.
Bad bad bad fron service to food.
The prices where outrageous. I am going to go back one more time to see if things gave changed and gotten better there."}
{"text":"Nice intimate restaurant with attentive service. Portions are generous as well for a bistro. 

Tip, Try the hand made gnocchi  app! It is to die for. And I am not a huge fan of gnocchi usually. 

The lamb was cooked perfectly. 

Chef Jenny is amazing!"}
{"text":"recommend for up to 4 people group. room is cozy but small for big group. busy ob Saturday. foods are delicious."}
{"text":"I guess I should start by saying a ton of good reviews about this place happen to be regarding their brunch, so maybe it's better then... we however, went for dinner the day after Valentine's Day.
First negative is that they charge for water- come on people... a $1.50 for still water? And it was lukewarm at best.

I have to say that my expectations were high, as I expected the prices to be, and they were. We were lucky that we got a generous gift card because had we not, I think we would've just gone to the poutinerie next door...

I had a glass of wine to start because the cocktails were pricy and small. My husband tried the orange blossom and it was more like very tart orange juice with a hint of booze. Later he tried the autumn cider one and it was tasty, although still small.

Appetizers: Sweet potato gnocchi because of the reviews about it on here- and yes this dish lives up to its reputation! It was warm and a good portion- with the boar bacon it was divine. I hate gorgonzola so our server told me she'd talk to the chef and go easy on it- I never tasted the gorgonzola flavour so that was lovely! My husband had the veal meatballs and they were average. I don't get the difference between veal and regular beef taste-wise, though that might be because the dish was too spicy to tell!

Mains: I had the seafood stew. I can't actually say if it tasted bad or good because it was so spicy! It had a very generous amount of seafood in it but it was just so spicy that it ruined it. The menu didn't say anything about spice. And for the steep price, I could go to a different place and get the same dish with pasta and not spicy. It was nothing spectacular. My hubby had the salmon dish and it too, was very spicy. I can't believe for the price we paid that it was served on a bed of lentils. LENTILS? I buy those at my local wal-mart and I sure don't consider them up to the standard of such a high-end bistro. The salmon had a decent crust on it but again, nothing extraordinary. I could've cooked his meal in my own kitchen for 1/3 the price. It wasn't the decadent or fancy meal I anticipated.

Dessert: They ran out of tiramisu first off- if you have a small menu how do you simply \"run out\"? No excuse for being unprepared... now, taste wise- average, portion wise- pathetic. I had the passionfruit creme brulee and it was ok... the ramekin was a tiny little heart-shaped thing that was barely 1/3 full, and my sugar was burnt and you could taste it for sure. The menu said it came with pop rocks (?) but it didn't. My man had the glass dessert which was chocolate mousse and we got this teeny little jar that gave us each hardly two bites. And it had these crunchy little chocolate balls in it that didn't compliment the flavour of the mousse at all.

I don't know if my expectations were too high or if I just don't \"get\" fancy, modern bistro cuisine but when we are paying prices like that, I expect nice flavour, decent portions. We walked out feeling like we had missed out and we were glad dinner wasn't on us. I won't return unless someone pursuades me into the brunch, because it sounds like it has potential. I just hope they're buying!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and I'll be back again soon. 

Today it was brunch. I opted for smoked salmon and jumbo prawn eggs benedict. It was not only the most attractively presented eggs benny, but the tastiest benny I've ever had, and that was by a long shot. 

The flavour was so great, I had to have more: desert. I had a passionfruit creme brûlée. Wow! It was great. 

So, this is a smallish, I say cozy, place with friendly helpful service, and gourmet eats at prices that are just a couple of dollars more than upscale diners around town. Portions are good -- I say this is great value when you want to treat yourself. 

I have to concede to other reviewers, this is no Chinese menu with the standard 1100 items. It's a smaller menu, completely in line with what I've found typical of many finer dining places. The menu is diverse enough to please most, I would think."}
{"text":"An highly overlooked brunch spot that doesn't have an 45-1hr wait on the weekends. I had the sweet potato gnocchi (without the meat because vegetarian) and my friend had the vero traditional. The sweet potato gnocchi was plated on the bottom, then a egg, topped off with walnuts and sprouts - one of the best breakfasts I've every had. My friend's traditional was not that traditional - it was sausage with poached eggs, olives, and green salad on the side with a fresh croissant on the side. Get a table outside on a sunny day and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Have been waiting to try this restaurant for a long time and called today to get a salad to go for lunch and they refused to do it, saying they don't offer take out at all. I understand not wanting to provide all menu items for take out but a salad?...Give me a break."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here twice, once for their famous \"no menu Tuesdays\" and another time for brunch. 

On Tuesday nights is it best to make a reservation as the restaurant is usually always full. However when my friends and I came for brunch it was empty and I don't know why! Their brunch menu is absolutely divine! The plate presentation is on point and their eggs benedict is nothing like I've ever seen before! It is served on a croissant! My boyfriend had the sweet potato gnocchi and that might seem a bit odd for a brunch dish but it was drizzled with maple syrup and bacon pieces, so good I was always munching off his plate! The server was always attentive and even made a specialty martini for a friend of mine.

The prices are high but it is totally worth it. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I feel like Vero is one of the most underrated restaurants when it comes to the breakfast/brunch scene in Calgary. For one, they take reservations, so thankfully no hour long waits during the weekend. Their menu is quite unique so you won't find your typical eggs benny here. What you will find is very fresh, healthy food which is supported by local farms. Their versions of the benny sit on top of a freshly baked croissant pasty which in my opinion is better than an english muffin. And with different toppings like wild boar bacon and prawn, montreal smoked meat or forest mushroom fricassee, you really can't go wrong. Every other menu item I've tried has been superb as well, some highlights being the sweet potato gnocchi with poached egg and even their steak and poached egg. I've been here for dinner a few times which has been equally as enjoyable, but I find their brunch menu more enticing."}
{"text":"It was a superb meal. The restaurant itself is tiny, but it is intimate. The food is just amazing, I loved everything."}
{"text":"The service was good, the food was well presented and tasty 
but we felt it was too expensive, so we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere. difficult to find, the sign isn't quite obvious for some.
It's a tiny place but very worth the food.
I've been here several times now.

Menu changes constantly.

I especially like the red backdrop.and the huge bouquet of flowers near the bar, as well as the candles.definitely good for the atmosphere

Tuesday is a set menu - you don't choose. Which can be nice"}
{"text":"Booked reservations for Friday night at 8:30. The table was ready when we arrived.

Great atmosphere - mood lighting, funky decor and great energy. They even offer you pillows if you find your chair not that comfortable - which I did not use but was very curious about.

The service was fanastic. Our server was passionate about the menu and very helpful with questions. She was appropriately attentive throughout the night.

The meals were amazingly delicious. Would definitely go there again.

Next time want to try it out at lunch!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday recently, which happened to fall on a Wednesday. We decided to have a nice dinner before heading to see a show at Jubilee.
Apparently on Wednesdays, if you order a bottle of wine (any wine, cheap or pricey), you get a dozen oysters free. We decided to not bother with the wine and just get dinner, as we wanted to be out of there in a reasonable amount of time. The decor of the place is really nice. It reminds me of those chic places in Montreal (oh how I miss thee..).
I ordered the lamb, and it was quite delicious. Soft, tasty and falling off the bone. Really quite good. I liked the atmosphere too, and at the end of the meal, the waiter gave us some little chocolates.
Speaking of waiter, that is my only caveat. It looked like he was the only one serving the area where I was sitting - and quite frankly, I was not very impressed. He was overly formal, too abrupt, very cold, and a tad bit distracted. I like my waiter to talk to me for a second, smile when taking my order, and atleast give me the time of day, especially when I'm spending almost a fair amount on my meal. But no luck here at Vero. maybe he was overwhelmed by the number of customers he had, or he thinks doing tricks with the napkin is going to be enough to win me over.. but not so, unfortunately. 
I will go here for lunch, because it is $15, but perhaps not for dinner, unless I want the oysters for free. The food was great, but the experience was lacking due to the service."}
{"text":"Vero Italian Bistro is a small italian restaurant in Kensington. When we walked in, I was pleasantly surprised at the nice ambience inside the restaurant. We were a group of 4, but this would definitely be great for a date night! The server(s) were attentive and pleasant to talk to, the food was lovely with a nice twist on the classics. What took it down a notch for me was the way the feature wine was presented, with the bottle left on the table. All in all, it was a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Vero Bistro has been on our list of must do restaurants for a while - and only because we were waiting to be able to go on a Tuesday. Both of us were intrigued by 'no menu' Tuesday, and we were not disappointed.

We had choice of 2 salads - one with lentils and the other with confit duck. Each tried one and the duck was a clear winner. Think this may be the best duck I have ever tried. Would have eaten that salad another 2 times and gone home happy.

Mains was a choice of 3 options. I went with the short rib over potato + sweet potato gnochi - one of those portions where you think it will be just enough, but you get 1/2 way thought and have to stop because otherwise you wont have space for dessert. The boy had veal in these hand shaped triangle pasta pockets with ragu over top. Both were delightful and such different flavour profiles.

For dessert is was meant to be a coconut cake, but as they ran out it was changed to whipped cheesecake with passion fruit (I think) topping and oat-crisp type bits. I have to admit I was disappointed not to try the cake... until I tried the cheesecake. Oh man whipped cheesecake for the win! 

Service was fantastic. James was lovely and attentive, but gave us more than enough space to take our time to enjoy the meal and each other. He also took me through the menu 3 times because I kept getting distracted by how fantastic all the options sounded :)

We will be back, on a Tuesday or otherwise. Have you seen the pictures of their brunch though? Maybe we will be back for that!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night where they had a set 3 course menu. The server impressed us as she remembered the entire menu in great detail. 
I didn't plan on drinking so I had a peach purée beverage with white cranberry and soda. This was more of a breakfast beverage IMO. The choice for dinner was a salad or veal ravioli/steak frites or paella and dessert. I chose the veal ravioli in a sage sauce and the steak frites with garlic truffle butter. The flavors were amazing, rich sauce and the steak was melt in your mouth. I almost didn't believe it was steak! The chef sent out a dish of meatballs in a marinara sauce which we enjoyed, however there was a lot of meat and we would have preferred veggies (veal/steak/meatballs). Nonetheless, a kind gesture which was unexpected! For dessert they served us a chocolate mousse with mango purée. The level of service was great and we would return again!"}
{"text":"(This review is long overdue!! I visited Vero in June 2014)

My partner and I were having a vacation in the beautiful Alberta in the summer of 2014. We got there in an afternoon, checked into the hotel. While I already made reservation for dinner that night, I checked the menu again and decided to switch (which I do A LOT)! I wanted to go to a good, nice Italian restaurant, and found Vero. The menu was very interesting, so I decided to call for a table around 5pm. We got lucky because the restaurant was booked full, but since it was early, they were able to take us in 30 mins. Given that we visited from Eastern time, 5:30 dinner was just right!

The restaurant was on the small size, so reservation is needed. The restaurant was already full when we walked in, with a large party occupying one end. We were sat right away, and got served immediately. As I browsed the menu, I noticed the executive chef owner's last name was Chan, which is my mon's maiden name, and that's how people from Hong Kong spell the last name. I confirmed with our server, Jenny is indeed from HK. It is refreshing to know someone from HK who has a passion for something other than finance!!

We both ordered appetizers and entrees. I had the cured meat special which was full of flavors and my partner had the veal meatball. My main was the hand rolled noodle in bolognese and my partner had gnocchi. All the dishes definitely had a modern twist to them. Like the veal meatballs are full of delicious Asian spices and my bolognese noodles resembled udon noodles. Refreshing!!

The best part of the meal was Jenny came out to chat with us, knowing that I am also from HK. I mentioned to her my excitement about the Asian twist on her food. And she told us stories about her annual trip to Italy for new inspirations! She also treated us with a nice moscato at the end!

After traveling around Alberta for 10 days (Edmonton, the Rockies, etc). We were back to Calgary, we weren't as lucky this time since we couldn't get into Jenny's restaurant because of the stampee. I would go back to Calgary just to go to Vero again! Hopefully it will happen soon!

Again, what a great start to an unforgettable vacation in Alberta.

P.S. What prompted me to finally complete this review is I am making lasagna tonight, and rather than using traditional pasta noodle, I decided to use wonton wrappers instead, inspired by Jenny's great Italian cooking!!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a nice dinner i ordered lamb and it was perfectly cooked and the restaurant had great renovations but a tiny bit to small, not the best for parties"}
{"text":"this was my first visit to this place and I intend to give it another go. I had meatballs with poached eggs for my brunch, my partner had bison sausage and poached egg, and a friend of ours had mushroom egg Benedict. I though that my meatballs lacked salt but that is a personal preference. Eggs were cooked to perfection but I found a bit of crunchy bits in my meatballs which puts me off, also I could not taste the hollandaise sauce at all. My portion was adequate for $16,50 as I am not a big eater. My boyfriend's meal was big enough too $17,50. Egg Benny on the other hand is too small for a man to be satisfy. It's one egg Benedict without any potatoes the veggie one was $17,95! 

The place is tiny and they have squashed too many tables. Staff are good when you are already seated but when you are waiting by the door don't expect any attention, I understand they were busy but it took good 10 min before anyone approached me despite having a reservation. I used electronic reservation system that is pretty useless as you will be waiting along with the walk ins. 
I will give it another try for sure."}
{"text":"The brunch in this place is awesome! You've got to try. The restaurant is nice and clean. And the service is always good."}
{"text":"Always a favorite, as it offers friendly, efficient service and delicious dishes.  Vero never fails to please.  I am impressed with their willingness to adapt dishes or offer alternatives for this vegetarian."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch, it was very busy when we went in so I was glad to have an Open Table booking. I had the sweet potato gnocchi, which was so tasty. I'm actually wishing I could have some now just thinking about it. The gnocchi was accompanied by roasted walnuts, bacon, Gorgonzola cheese and two sunny side up eggs. My hubby had the spicy salami eggs benny and not a crumb was left on his plate. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Overall experience: 4/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

My first time here was for lunch with a friend. It's a small bistro with seating for maybe about 25, and has a nice, modern, jazzy upscale atmosphere. There was a red and black colour scheme; Red cushioned side wall, black ceilings, booths and tables. It's quite cozy but one complaint I have is the chairs. Either it's because I'm short, or the chairs are actually lounge-like where I had to lean pretty far back to properly sit in my seat. The service was average. Nothing to brag about. He seemed kind of nervous but still managed to give us a detailed explanation of the lunch special which was informative.

The menu is simple and refined. It had the usual fair of appetizers like calamari and brushetta done 3 different ways, soups, salads, pastas and mains. I came here specifically to try their 2 course lunch special for $15; however it was essentially just paying for the main. The appetizer was really disappointing- a piece of crusty bread with a small leaf of lettuce and a thin slice of smoked salmon with a balsamic reduction. The main pasta dish however, completely made up for it. It was a shell pasta with organic turkey, capers and a uniquely blended sauce of crushed and roasted tomatoes, salty capers, with a touch of dill and creaminess of shaved Parmesan. Beautiful depth and balance of flavours; every bite was addicting. It's one of the best pasts dishes I have had going out and worth every penny.
 
Although I only came here for lunch, I can sense that their dinner items are just as well thought out and delicious. I highly recommend a visit for a quick lunch and I will definitely come back for dinner! I fantastic Italian \"nook\" in the heart of Kensington =)"}
{"text":"It's so cozy! I love it! It's a mix between trendy yet very comfortable! I love the bold red. 

I planned a birthday lunch here for one of my best friends. I'm dying to go back just for the service! I think the owner/manager was the one serving us - she was great - she had such a positive and helpful attitude (unfortunately this is very uncommon in Calgary). She was the epitome of what a great server needs to be!

Since we were there over lunch we got to take advantage of the lunch menu! It was (I think) a 3 course meal for $15 -- what a STEAL of a deal! The chef even comes around to speak to all the different tables. 


The food is excellent, cheap, flavourful and well prepared. I'll definitely need to come back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"I'm going to follow suit with Stephanie S's review and say this place was rather disappointing for it's price and quality.

First off I'll go ahead and mentioned that the service was great. They were friendly and had a great attitude. Even though it was busy, their pleasantness buys them the time they need having to cover a room/patio full of needy people.

We started with their calamari fritto, which was pretty much deep fried calamari. I can't complain, it was well fried and far from the rubbery alternative I've had in the past.

Next we jumped to the secondi or MAIN DISHES (for crying out loud). I had the bolognese, and my companion had the salmon served on quinoa on \"MIXED GREENS, APPLE PEAR, QUINOA, PUMPKIN SEEDS, HEIRLOOM CARROTS, CANNELLINI BEANS, YUZU DRESSING\" which really was, just a salad. This is where I became vastly disappointed with Vero. The salmon was grilled well and avoided dooming itself into dry and flaky oblivion, but the salad really was just a salad, I couldn't discern certain pieces from another. The bolognese (allow me to put on my food snob hat) looked like fast food Filipino PALABOK, which is a peasant's dish. It was watery brown sauce with ground beef and lacking in aroma. I could compare it to something else that's watery and brown, but that would be unappetizing. I'm not sure what they put into their slow cooker for 12 hours for it come out like this, but I don't think it's what bolognese is supposed to be made out of. Their handmade noodles were chewy, which was fine by me, but didn't stand a chance in holding the sauce together. The marriage between noodle and sauce is italian cooking 201 (101 teaches you how to boil spaghetti) and for an italian/french bistro, this was a GREAT miss.

Our bill came to just a shy 100$ I was happy to be full from a day of skipping meals, but felt I could have just gotten a better experience if I'd have driven the other side of the city to boxwood, where I would have paid much less."}
{"text":"We came here while exploring our favorite Kensington area. It was 11 a.m. Sunday morning and we're looking for a place to have brunch. This place was perfect.  The ambiance of the restaurant is so cool. It's a good surprise from what you're able to see from the outside. They serve good quality food that's organic, very tastey, and good value. We had the Vero traditional- green salad, Croissant, 2 eggs benny, and bison sausage and the skillet meatballs that also came with a croissant. I also ordered their peach frizz which was a very refreshing drink. My husband loved his meatballs meal and I thought the whole meal was very satisfying. It's perfect for a brunch meal. Service was good with friendly staff. 

My husband thought, though, that having a chair in the washroom was a bit odd. But I think it's useful for the ladies.  

We'll come back here again to try other things."}
{"text":"I'd give it a five for presentation, and for passion! The taste and culinary prowess are also top-notch here (I'm no Michelin critic by any stretch; this is just my own scaling). Fantastic! But I gave it four stars instead, because the menu is limited, and I can never get just what I'm craving. They need to focus a bit more on something memorable! So that I'll come back! Fantastic dessert! Really nice and dressed up! Again, presentation and taste--service too-- are a five. Expensive though Xo"}
{"text":"Huge fan of the brunch here. It's a couple bucks more than the standard price, but the food is worth every penny and more. I ordered the eggs benny with boar bacon and two huge prawns. The hollandaise sauce was light and buttery, not that yellow glop you get at some places. The croissant was homemade and flaked apart in separate layers. The bacon was really crispy and shattered when you bite into it. All the flavour and none of the grease. The tomatoes tasted like they were just picked from a garden, dotted with pesto. The egg was beautiful, the yolk firm but warm and creamy. I liked the addition of the micro greens as it gave the dish a freshness. 

I like the ambience here. The room is small but you have enough distance from other diners. You can make reservations, so no obnoxiously long line-up! Woohoo! As good as it gets!"}
{"text":"I passed by Vero Italian Bistro by chance one afternoon in Kensington and a photo of their classic Bouillabaisse - filled with mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops, seasonal fish and tomato broth - made me stop and take a closer look. 

A few days later, I had a leisurely lunch to catch up with a good friend. The menu at Vero is constantly changing, making room for local and seasonal produce. And the menu offers something to thrill most any palate, and budget, with both a set lunch - starting at just $15 for an appetizer and main - and a la carte options. 

The restaurant is small and intimate, with a quaint patio that extends out onto 10th street, but is surrounded by a privacy wall so conversation is comfortable. Our server was polite, attentive and helpful. My risotto was divine and the grilled scallops - a notoriously difficult dish to prepare - were cooked perfectly. 

One visit was all it took to put Vero on my list of personal favourites - I'll certainly return."}
{"text":"Minimal brunch menu selection, but good choices.  Restaurant interior is great.  Cozy and modern.  Food quality is very good."}
{"text":"We went to Vero for brunch on a Sunday. We were glad we reserved a table because when we got there it was packed. Everything from their menu looked awesome so it was tough for me to decide what to get. I ended up getting Lobster egg benny.  I was glad I picked that because it was absolutely delicious. place is really small but nicely set up. Next time I would go for their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Great location in Kensington. A modern boutique restaurant that has a varied menu (think 'the Keg' options). Both the steak and the lamb were absolutely amazing, cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasoning. Although I was far less impressed with the plating presentation and the sides. I just don't ever expect to get rather plain (but good) fries with a steak in a place like this. The risotto that came with the lamb was quite good too, but nothing unique. 

They also have a late night tapas menu and a $15 3 course lunch that I may go back to try."}
{"text":"First time here and it was outstanding.  The chef feature was beef tenderloin with Dijon curry and sweat potato gnocchi.  It was to die for delicious.  This is a most eat at restaurant and you will not be at all disappointed.  Absolutely try the tiramisu so light and heavenly.  We were waiting for the tiramisu and was taking a while so they brought us a creme brûlée which was also tasty and light.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not a lot of love for Vero after my weekend birthday dinner and first visit.   I didn't dislike it, but I wish I went somewhere else. 

My original plans were cancelled when my first choice closed for a private event the night of our reservation but we got last minute reservations here and I'd heard good things. 

As a vegetarian I get one option on a menu in places like this and I loved the dish on the menu on their website and that was a deciding factor.  Unfortunately, there was a totally different menu when we got there and my heart sank because I had to have risotto and that's a bit heavy for a warm August evening.  

I had the peach belini and it was just OK.  It was a bit too tart and for $10 it's passable. 

The table had the sweet potato gnocchi and truffled edamame,  Both were good but the edamame didn't go with anyone's main as far as taste profiles.  The gnocchi I wished was my main. 

My main the crimini mushroom risotto with white beans.  Over all it was bland and not cohesive and not what I wanted to have in the first place.  Somewhere between all of the ingredients there were sometimes hard crunches like biting into broken glass so much so I had a really good inspection.  I think it was slightly under cooked risotto in a number of grains and no so much glass.  Still unsettling.  

For dessert I really wanted chocolate but their menu was sans chocolate.  They had two coffee flavored dishes and two cream dishes with fruit flavoring which is a shockingly uneven selection.  I ordered the passionfruit creme brulee.  The presentation was nice until you looked inside the little heart shaped ramakin and wonder who ate the rest of your dessert.  It was 1/3 full and although it was a perfect amount it looks stingy in the dish.   I liked the fruit flavor of the cream and LOVED the poprocks.   The crackle and the zing of the flavor paired wonderfully.   Almost made me over look the unintentional crackle of my main. Almost. 

We did tell the restaurant we were celebrating a birthday and noticed another dessert come out after ours with a sparkler so our server just didn't remember I guess.   I didn't know I could have expected pyrotechnics but as soon as I learned I could have I felt much less important to Vero and my server.    

Overall the food was good quality and lovely prepared with exception of the risotto but it lacked any kind of fireworks for me (literally and figuratively) and without a dollar figure attached it might have been acceptable but once you attach the actual bill to that meal I start thinking of the dozens of other places I would have loved to drop that kind of money.   I also wouldn't have left ANY of them with an unsatisfied chocolate craving."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with friends while visiting in Calgary. First time here and very impressed. Great service and food was absolutely delicious. Ambience is high end yet it feels like a local hangout. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food offerings, cozy atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Make a reservation if you are going in the evening as this place fills up fast. My only concern is that the restaurant seems to be challenged by food allergies. Not sure if it is the kitchen or very busy waiters that don't talk to each other. Both times we experienced a contamination. This can be remedied by sticking a toothpick with the label \"allergen\" in the designated meal so that there are no mix ups. Not sure we will go back as we don't want to risk another severe reaction."}
{"text":"Had the Father's Day brunch. Everything was superb, from the delicately crisp crostini with the mortadella charcuterie, to the perfect temperature of the prawn sides of the wild boar bacon Eggs Benedict on a delicate house-made croissant, to the delightfully subtle mango mousse cake with mint and raspberry. Even the fresh-pressed orange juice was palate-pleasing!"}
{"text":"I have been twice, and each time had great service, great food, and a great time. They are very accommodating of food allergies and everything is high quality and good tasting."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything from the food, drinks and dessert is great. I've been here several times and I suggest it to others on many occasions. 

The service and staff are great. The location is right in Kensington and central."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Probably one of my all time favourite places that I have been to here in Calgary. It looks like nothing special from the outside, but inside it has the atmosphere and vibrance of a typical European bistro. Vero reminded me of some of the bistros that I went to in Germany and Austria, and its as if they bottled the atmosphere and brought it here to this location.

The food...yes the food...sooo DELICIOUS. Our meal started with a snack of balsamic vinegar and olive oil dip for the bread. I decided to skip the appetizer and go straight for the jugular...the entree. Since everything on the menu looked as delectable as the last item I read. I went with the waiters recommendation of the Feature (the meal of the day). 

When my plate arrived, I was a bit puzzled at first. Because I thought I would get veggies, mashed potatoes and meat. Turns out the mashed potatoes where hidden below the veggies. The meat was so tender you could have cut it with a spoon. The best part of it was that it reminded me of my mother's and my aunt's cooking from yesteryear.

All in all an amazing experience."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a birthday with a party of 5. It was raining so we were all inside for the day, which was unfortunate because the patio seemed nice. I'd say to start the place is small and the decor is okay, nothing fancy. We started off with the handmade veal meatballs and charcuterie board. We then ordered a bottle of wine and after that the service went downhill. We were served both by the waiter and waitress in the restaurant. After a few minutes we all got to ordering, around 7pm. We then needed some assistance and we called the waitress over and she just made groaning noise when she came to our table. The entree took over half an hour to get to the table, and she was the only one nearby, so we asked when the food would be ready. We were worried they may have forgotten about us. This waitress just had a stinky attitude. Every time she just made us feel like we were an annoyance to her, she'd respond in an unwelcoming tone. When my boyfriend's mom was opening up her present the waitress felt the need to make a comment about how she didn't like her gift. The comment was completely unnecessary and unprofessional. 
Overall the food was good, nothing amazing. I've had better service at earls. 
The layout of the restaurant felt small and crammed, but if it had better service and with the food I wouldn't have mind."}
{"text":"I returned here for brunch over the weekend with my fiance and my mom. I was hoping we would have a better experience this time, as it wasn't a holiday like last time, and we could order from the actual menu (vs. the Fathers Day Brunch menu).

We arrived at 11:15 to an empty restaurant, which I thought strange. I realized the Yelp hours are incorrect and it read \"Closed\" when in fact, it was open. Our waiter was extremely friendly and gave us a moment to peruse the menu.

First disappointment was their menu is different than the menu online. Super frustrating since we came here for a specific item that was listed online, but not available anymore. Our server explained that this was due to the menu changing daily, despite the fact that it was a) the same one they had when I was here in June, and b) dirty, wrinkled, and obviously NOT printed that day, like he said. 

I ordered a Caesar to start, while Josh ordered an espresso and my mom had a mimosa. The Caesar was COMPLETELY watered down - you could hardly taste the clamato and it was heavily spiced to drown out the nonexistent flavors. I would have liked soup, as it was cold out, but they didn't have soup that day (despite it being on the menu). Our mains were excellent - I had the two eggs over sweet potato gnocchi, while my mom and Josh both had the smoked salmon & prawn eggs benny. My dish was probably one of the best I've ever had!! Large portions, but too many greens - my mom commented that she doesn't typically eat that much salad for breakfast. 

The biggest disappointment to me is the price. I thought we were gouged last time due to it being Fathers Day and paying $36/each for brunch. But I realized that's the norm here - the breakfast dishes are $18-$24 each not including drinks, plus the additional eggs we ordered (and needed, otherwise we would have still been hungry). Although our food was tasty, I'm definitely not going to return here due to them not having anything I asked for, and having ridiculous prices. There are many more great breakfast joints in this city that don't cost an arm & a leg."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about the food and service so I gave it a try. 

Before I get started, safe to say I felt cheated and did not tip well. 2 stars will do because the food is pretty good but service can make or break your business. And if the server is reading this. Make up a better lie next time. 

The first time I came here was a long while ago in June 2017. I went with a friend I haven't seen for a long time and we did some catching up, speaking in English (weird, but you'll know why I point this out later). We went around the afternoon where they have the 3 course brunch menu and if I remember it correctly, whatever they had for the menu was $30 but if we were to pick steak and frites it will be $40. 

My friend and I both picked the steak and frites and everything went perfectly. First we had cream of mushroom soup, steak frites and lastly a lovely mango sorbet. The lady that served us was pretty friendly. 

The review so far seems great but here's the thing:

The second time I went here was with another friend around Oct 2017. Since the first time I had a great experience I thought I would introduce this place to another person. And like last time I went, we arrived around the same time of the day and we both ordered the exact same thing, steak and frites, which is $40. Mind you, this menu is the exact same as it was when I first went in June 2017. 

This friend of mine we are used to speaking Chinese. And since we haven't seen each other for a long time we had some catching up to do. We were the first customers that day and a couple came in shortly after and was seated beside us. While we were finishing up our main course the couple were just getting started on their dessert. I was pretty excited about it and told my friend their dessert is bomb. It was the same server and she took our plates and added: \"is there anything else I can get for you ladies?\" I wasn't thinking much of that comment until she said: \"would you like the machine?\" At this point I was confused. I asked her wasn't there dessert after? And she had the audacity to say \"Oh.. I'm sorry dessert doesn't come with the steak and frites\"

So, I did the exact same thing I did the first time, ordered from the same menu but with a different friend speaking a different language. Oh and I paid the same price I did as last time but apparently steak and frites don't come with dessert from your THREE course brunch menu. 

I don't know what's your deal lady. But that's pretty lame if you ask me."}

{"text":"Came here during The Big Taste YYC 2015. I wish I had discovered this gem sooner. The restaurant is quite small, so we were glad to have made reservations well ahead of time. Service was quick and efficient throughout our meal. I loved the personal touches in the wall décor of the restaurant, being able to see the face behind the menus was wonderful.

Their plates are dressed beautifully. It really illustrates the phrase \"a feast for the eyes\". For my main course, I choose the \"Organic egg benny with wild boar bacon & jumbo prawns, heirloom tomatoes, hand whipped hollandaise, fresh baked croissant\" and the bf chose the \"Hot skillet house made beef meatballs with puttanesca sauce, 2 poached vita eggs, croissant, arugula, reggiano shavings\".

It was love at first sight when the egg benny arrived. I lovedlovedloved it, and can't stop thinking about it. The croissant in place of the traditional English muffin was a welcome change, I think I could eat a dozen of them just on their own!  I typically don't eat that much bacon... but their boar bacon... I was speechless. Now I know why the table beside us had ordered two side orders of it on top their meals. The benny was not overly dressed with hollandaise. It was a perfectly balanced dish.

I would highly recommend Vero for brunch and am looking forward to trying out their dinner menu as well. So much excitement and anticipation! If you should go down for some brunch, make sure you order some extra boar bacon, you surely won't regret it."}

{"text":"We went with my partner to Vero recently. It was a great experience, good service, food was delicious, but after the dinner we didn't feel like it was worth $200 or so..That's why I cannot give it \"5 stars\".."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a couple nights ago - it was amazing! The gnocchi is so so good and the service here is very good. Definitely will recommend this place to friends!"}
{"text":"Started out very bumpy and slow.... but still had a good time w friends.

When restaurants make mistakes, as long as they own up to it I have patience.... and Vero definitely made up for their mistakes.

Service was not very good. They said it was a busy night but the place is pretty small.  we waited 20-30 mins for our drink orders to be taken.... and then another 30-40 mins for our appetizers to come out. Our water glasses were empty most of the night and we had to flag down the waitress to get her attention.   But they made up for it...  They apologized, and comped us 2 apps, and when the dessert was almost inedible due to it's extreme tartness, our prosecco was on the house. 

Now the food.... we had:

Amuse Bouche - Uni risotto ball w/ chilli plum sauce
Mushroom Bruschetta (comped)
Sweet potato Gnocchi
Clams & Mussels
Taro chips
Olives (comped)
Lamb entree
Lobster mac 'n cheese - smoked gouda, white truffle - to me lacked flavour

Food was ok. I enjoyed the lamb, the rest of it was just ok. 

Chardonnay & prosecco were delicious though!"}
{"text":"Vero is an intimate restaurant located in the Kensington neighbourhood.  I was here for the big taste and the restaurant was fully packed on a Friday afternoon.  I had to circle a few times for a metered parking spot but it was manageable.

The appy platter which came with two bruschettas, prawns and veal meatballs was great.  I enjoyed the porcini and truffle bruschetta the most - I can probably eat a whole plate of that by myself :-) As for the mains, I ordered the beef short ribs with sweet potato gnocchi. The gnocchi had good flavour and texture while the short ribs was tender and flavourful.  My date ordered the mussels (the menu read: Fresh P.E.I. Mussels - cherry tomatoes, capers, white wine, lemon beurre blanc, grilled bread).  In our minds, we thought it would be a bowl of steamed mussels but instead, it was 3 mussels on a bed of pasta. Maybe we should have asked.

The dessert was nicely plated gelato with some purée, crumbs and a slice of dehydrated orange.  Overall, a decent dining experience.  I may come back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for the big taste week. Glad we did! Had a lovely lunch with my coworker. Chili Prawns, meatballs and a toast with two toppings. I had the sweet potato gnocchi with short rib and she had mussels. Absolutely deelish! Dessert was mango sorbet. 

Definitely want to return for Wed night steak frites and Tues night open chef selection. I have eaten here before but never wrote a review as it was as before I joined Yelp. Service was spectacular and ambience is cozy and decadent - exactly what an upscale diner should be!"}
{"text":"My sister is engaged and hasn't gotten around to planning anything for her big day so when I heard the wedding fair was here, I knew I wanted to have a little sister day with her.  I've been wanting to give Vero's brunch menu a try so we planned brunch for the Sunday afternoon before heading to the fair.  We made reservations via Opentable. 

Vero Bistro is located on the main strip on 10th Street in Kensington NW, right beside the Poutinery.  Street parking should be available, especially on Sundays.  When we arrived, we were greeted immediately and sat at a two person table top.  It seemed most of the tables were full.  I noticed the bright red back drop and the dimmed lighting which was very classy.  Water came without question and we were handed menus.  I knew I was going to order the sweet potato gnocchi with a sunny side egg because my first visit 6 years ago, I fell in love with the gnocchi and haven't had it in a while.  My sister went with the Vero traditional.  Our server was great, always coming around to fill our water and I noticed that all the other servers were very attentive and working as a team.  

Our meals came and we were stunned.  What beautiful presentation it was!  I went for a bite of my gnocchi and it was just like I had it the first time!  Soft gnocchi bites with a touch of crisp and full of flavor.  It reminds me of my dads stuffing! MMM!   My gnocchi also came with an egg on top with some wild boar bacon pieces, sprinkled gorgonzola, walnuts all drizzled with balsamic reduction.  Delicious.  Danielle's traditional brunch came with Berkshire pork sausage, wild boar bacon, 2 perfectly poached eggs, with a side salad that came with beets, olives and wonderful dressing as well as a freshly baked croissant and house made cherry jam (which may change daily). Danielle was super impressed with everything, as was I.  It was like you can taste the love put into each dish.  Each of our plates were perfect sizes, filled us up without making us feel overly full.  We were extremely satisfied.

We couldn't stop talking about how amazing our brunch meals were at the wedding fair.  Vero is definitely a place to hit up for AMAZING brunch or even dinner.  I think it's a perfect place to bring your date if you really want to impress them or bring your other half just because.

I will be back Vero....over and over again. Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Food: EXCELLENT! The menu is tiny (about 6 options for appetizers, 6-8 for main course, and 4 for dessert), but they specialize in what they do, and they do it well. I love to cook, and always appreciate going to a place where I cannot replicate my meal at home. This is that kinda place. They change the menu every 2 weeks, our server said. Be warned though, though Yelp gave it $$, it was actually more like $$$! We spent an average of $45/person without any drinks.

Ambience: Tiny restaurant (fits 30 people max) with tables close together but modern and very nice, though a bit dark.

Service: It was okay. Our server failed to remember who ordered what, so when the check came, *I* had to divide it up and tell him how much to charge on each credit card. There were 7 of us and it was kind of a pain. Also, they automatically charge 18% for tips on parties of 6 or more (not 8 or more, like most restaurants). Went there a second time with just my husband and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"5 stars for not only the food but the attentive service. We had the pleasure of being served by Jeremy who was awesome. Best forest mushroom eggs Benny with incredible flavour as well as an artistic plating that made it even more enjoyable to eat. How did this place fly under my radar ??"}
{"text":"Invited to join some friends at an Italian Bistro for breakfast, I was intrigued by what the menu would have. 

As you enter this quaint Bistro you are met with an amazingly calming atmosphere. Very different than your usual breakfast bustle. The decor is modern and classy. Highly recommend it to relax with friends on a Saturday morning. You will have some great food met with very personal service.

My choice for this morning was the Mushroom Benny. Very creative presentation and great flavours. Egg was done to perfection. Next time I may ask for an additional egg and some wild Boar bacon in the side."}
{"text":"Vero's food is not bad and location is great. It's a small place so unless you make reservations, do not come with a party greater than 4. 

Restaurant prices for a bistro. Not particularly Vero's fault, Calgary restaurant owners in general do not realize there is a difference between a cafe, salon, bistro, brasserie and restaurant."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident while strolling Kensington with my wife while visiting Calgary.  We only stayed for staters and a glass of wine.  The sweet potato gnocchi were an absolute explosion of perfectly balanced flavour.  The maple balsamic sauce combined with walnuts and wild bore bacon was such a perfect balance - and so good.  The waiter recommended a pinot noir that was terrific and well priced.  What a great spot."}

Located in trendy Kensington, the restaurant behind a frozen patio almost missed on first pass given its small size and signage far more subdued than other stores along the block, Vero Bistro Moderne was suggested for Brunch on Saturday by several sources and publications, Chef Jenny Chan's unique take on French-Italian cuisine said to be one of the city's most inspired ways to experience some of Western Canada's very best seasonal ingredients.

Rumored to be popular during the weekend, a reservation thus made for 11:30am, it was precisely on time that I entered the front doors reading \"Welcome to my heart,\" a man named Michael greeting me with \"just a minute\" before wandering away for more than seven, much of it spent kibitzing with regulars as patrons both entering and exiting were forced to squeeze past me in the chilly, tight foyer.

Admittedly a bit annoyed when a young lady finally emerged from the back to seat me, Michael intentionally ignoring a stare from the door, it was with Coffee declined that water was filled and a menu presented, the one on the website completely identical and thus allowing for an expedited order.

Finding the kitchen far more efficient than front of house staff, the sleek and narrow space run by just two, it was only perhaps fifteen minutes after an order was placed that two plates were presented, the cast-iron skillet containing nine Meatballs still bubbling hot beneath melted Cheese and golden Eggs while the mixture of Sweet Potato and more traditional white dumplings were each pillow-soft amidst nuggets of Wild Boar Bacon, whole Walnuts and Maple-infused Butter plus Balsamic.

Eventually allowing the ping-pong ball-sized Meatballs enough time to cool, the majority smooth and rich though residual heat from the skillet had unfortunately rendered some a bit rubbery,  an accompanying laminated pastry was fairly well constructed and nicely paired to zesty Yuzu Marmalade with flavors a pleasant prelude to Tiramisu served in a flower pot with well-separated layers of creamy Mascarpone and sopping-wet Ladyfingers beneath crunchy Chocolate 'soil.'"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday during Sun & Salsa Fest to avoid the rain outside! Ended up being a great choice - had the organic egg/vegetable frittata with a side of local pork sausage (with bruschetta and greens). The frittata came in a hot iron pan and was escorted on a wooden block by a nice flaky croissant. Altogether, this was quite a bit of food and I left feeling very stuffed but satisfied!

Service was excellent and extremely friendly! Ended up having a hot cider because of the chilly downpour outside and it hit the spot - cinnamon stick and all.

To top if off at the end, Chef Jenny was nice enough to comp me a mango sorbet/puree/cream dessert. The staff here is really top notch and fun!"}
{"text":"Got to enjoy a really great brunch here last Saturday on the patio with the sun shining down on us. The interior is very chic looking. The food was unreal, I had the montreal smoked ham eggs benny with arugula and my friend had the sweet potato gnocchi which tasted like little candies every time you had a bite of one. You never got sick of it! The dishes were presented very well, everything was neat and tidy when served to us. Taking the folks there this weekend, I think they'll be a little impressed."}
{"text":"Arrived at restaurant at 9:02pm. Unfortunately.  The info on Yelp was wrong or they didn't want to seat one person with 48 minutes before closing.   Waitress said last seating was at 8:30"}
{"text":"Really nice place!!... The service was excellent and the food really really good!! They have a no menu Tuesday (the chef will decide all dishes to serve) and on Wednesday they only had 2 options, one is the 28 days aged beef which is awesome and the other one changes every week... I think this is a very original idea to have different menus 2 days a week for people who likes to try new things... All other days they have their regular menu, which is great! 

The only thing that can be improved is the parking; as the wine and cocktails are very good, so definitely would become a frequent customer of this restaurant..."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place in Kensington or dare I say in Calgary if you want some excellent Italian food. They got it all brunch, lunch, and Dinner. This is the place you want to go with a date  if you want to impress or simply a place to treat your family too. Just exceptional food no gimmicks or frills. 
The dining experience is good too just a bit dark with lighting but other than that there are no complaints by me. The place is a bit on the smaller side though so at times it feels a bit crammed.
The price is a bit pricey but totally worth it. If I had the money I would come here everyday!
But 5 stars for the food and the service!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday evening with the family. It was a set menu, absolutely delicious. The staff was extremely friendly. Peanut allergy, no problem. Vegetarian? Not a problem either as the staff made quick menu changes for me without any problem. Highly recommended."}

{"text":"Came here for brunch. First plus. They take reservations! So our party of 8 were cool as cucumbers as we made our way into Kensington on a Saturday morning.

Our server was attentive and courteous, I have never had so many cups of coffee. I had the jitters upon leaving. It was very good coffee too!

The restaurant itself is funky, with red walls and mirror-ie things, I was ensconced against the long black booth side complete with throw pillows.

Our party size allowed everyone to have a sampling of pretty much everything on the brunch menu. I had the sweet potato gnocchi. So you get a delicious egg on top, then boar bacon, then cheese. DROOOOOOOOOOLLLLL. It was delicious.
Then I was kicking myself for not ordering any other dish as mine was the only one that did not come with a housemade croissant.

They make their own croissants people, take me to heaven! I see now they offer it as a side, so I should have been smart and added it to my order.

My husband had the meatballs, which looked fantastic, but didn't get to try any of them, as he made sure he was the only one to taste them and their infinite greatness.

I can't wait to come back here again, for brunch or dinner!! Or just all three of my daily meals."}
