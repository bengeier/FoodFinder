{"text":"Short version: Great Haitian food, superb service. This place is delicious and you should go!  Long version: I heard about this place from a friend of a friend and decided to go on an early Wednesday evening. It was pouring raining and there was nobody on the street so we were the first people to sit down. As soon as we ordered the rain stopped more people came in. The decor is fresh with a summer island feel and was a welcome change from the dreary rain outside. The server greeted us with a smile en français and English. She answered our questions with good recommendations, and attentively checked in with us during the meal. She and the chef/owner (who we chatted with while paying at the end) were genuinely nice people and super easy to talk to. The meals are reasonably priced at $12-18 for mains and $2-5 for starters.  Speaking of which, I had the Acra as a starter... Damn. No I mean DAMN. The fritters dipped in the sauce! THE SAUCE! It's super tasty with just a small bit of spice at the end from a Scotch Bonnet hot pepper. For the main dish, I got the Poulet boucané which is barbecued chicken. The quarter chicken came with beans and rice, plantains, a kind of choucroute salad, along with a dipping sauce for the chicken. So comforting and filling. :)  My friend had the pork (which of course I tried a bite of) and it was amazing! Probably better than my meal (but you know, the grass is always greener, yada yada). I have no idea what restaurant that other reviewer Martin was eating at because it certainly wasn't Kwizinn.   One last thing: if you order a drink, go for the Crémasse. It's kind of like Bailey's but with a subtle twist of cinnamon and coconut. Incredible and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Probablement le pire griot que j'ai mangé de ma vie !  Tout était fade...le porc avait plus l'air d'avoir été bouilli que frit, le riz ressemblait plus à du riz minute trop cuit et sans saveur.  Même le pickliz (beaucoup trop gros et sec) n'avait pas le oumph habituel.  J'aurai essayé mais je n'y retournerai plus.  À vous maintenant de faire votre propre opinion."}
{"text":"The rice was tasteless, patty had almost no meat in it, chicken was just aight. Overpriced... meh... not the best"}
{"text":"We were a party of four. The waitress was so nice and polite. The food came super fast. Iam still thinking about those crispy plantains YUM. The musis playlist was impressive, with stayed for a solid hour after closing and they did not give us attitude or anything like that. I wanted to try the pain patate but i was too full to even bother. Cant wait to go back. Real food , nice decor. Iam sold"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch and ordered the griot. The plate came with a side of rice and beans which was simple and tasty. There was also a spicy cole slaw, delicious plantain chips and macaroni salad. I'm not familiar with Haitian food but I feel like this is the perfect comfort food."}
