{"text":"We had a marvelous dinner. The tandoori shrimp was the best I'd ever eaten : Huge, juicy shrimp richly seasoned with a complex and broad range of spices. My husband requested his chicken vindaloo be spicy, and it was ! He's been disappointed so many times before in the Midwest. Their samosas were delicious, served two per order, cut apart and layered with chutneys and relishes. Our sons had the mixed tandoori. All the Meats were wonderfully tender and perfectly seasoned. The basmati rice practically melted in our mouths. The naan bread came with eight flavors to choose from! What a perfect meal. Sigh....  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The food quality, service, & environment here are top notch. I have been to too many Indians restaurants in my life to count & this is in the top five. The food is fresh & authentic w/ plenty of variety.

Our goto place in Madison for Indian food. Give it a whirl!!"}
{"text":"I go to Swad at least 3 times a month for thier lunch buffet.  Sometimes even twice a week!  They change up their buffets with different dishes, bring out fresh naan to your table.  AND the service is amazing.  If you go there enough, they will remember you by name.  They are truly amazing and always delicious!"}
{"text":"Swad is incredible for a number of reasons: the food, the service, the advice and the willingness to customize any dish for a particular customer.  This is a perfect place for any Indian food novice or beginner.  Our entire family (including a picky 7 year old) can find food here that exceeds our expectations in every way.  Also, the knowledgable staff is eager to answer questions and make suggestions that have been spot-on time and time again.
One of our favorite restaurants in all of Madison.  The only knock against it would be the modest decor, but I would choose quality of food over atmosphere any day."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian food I've ever had, with service to match. Highly vegan-friendly too, which makes my wife ecstatic. 

This restaurant may not look like much, situated as it is in the middle of a small strip mall, but the interior is very nicely decorated. I felt a little underdressed walking in mid road-trip wearing a t-shirt and shorts, but that was similar attire to the other patrons.

My wife and I started our meal with complimentary papadam, which we were already prepared to order. They arrived promptly with several types of chutney, all vegan-friendly no less. Crisp, delicious and left us wanting more...but not because we hadn't had enough. They were just done perfectly. 

The rest of our meal consisted of steaming-hot Gobhi Manchurian, Bainghan Bhartha, rice, Chapati for my wife and Garlic Nan for me. It all arrived at once, just as quickly as the Papadam. The battered/fried cauliflower was chewy but crisp, perfectly spiced (we went for hot on both dishes) and paired nicely with my Garlic Nan (also excellent). It was the standout dish of the meal for me. The eggplant was excellent as well, with good roasted flavor. 

Throughout the meal all the staff was very attentive. Our waiter specifically asked if we were happy with the spice level of our meal. Our water glasses were rarely more than half empty. At the end of the meal one of the staff even brought over steaming-hot lemon water-sprayed towels to clean up with. 

By the end of the meal we were both nicely full, for a very reasonable price. Just an all around excellent experience. I only wish it had been closer to home."}
{"text":"Lot of variety and pretty tasty food. Momos are tasty but need freshness and softness. Staff is very polite and friendly. Restaurant is maintained clean. I'll go back for sure. Oh and the wide variety of days mmmhmmmmm and they  have kulfi nom nom"}
{"text":"Not normally a fan of buffets, but they kept the food fresh and hot. The coconut soup was delicious as was the Tandoori Chicken and homemade mango ice cream. Several fo the dishes were milder than expected, but perhaps that in itself is to be expected. Service was timely and attentive."}
{"text":"Hi, today we have been there as a team of 14 people & the food tasted excellent.

Service took bit late & tables jumbled around, because of the huge inflow of people, which did not bother us as the food was excellent, well re-filled the buffet as quickly as it needs. Veg was a lot fresh tasting. The Chutney's were not stale/frozen like the other indian restaurants.

The owner himself was running around to make arrangements for the guest."}
{"text":"I went for dinner last night with three of my family members. We ordered the chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, shrimp curry and a bunch of appetizers and desserts. Everything tasted absolutely divine. I highly recommend the mango lassi too.

I'm taking one star away for the clumsy service. They at first brought out fish curry instead of shrimp curry. They forgot to bring our raita and poori until we reminded them well into our dinner. The server spilled my tea on the table and in the end, they ran our credit card for someone else's check. 

They were very polite and quick to remedy all of these problems, but it was a bit much. Perhaps the server was having a bad night? Nevertheless, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place in MSN for Indian food... all dishes ordered were perfect, especailly lamb.."}
{"text":"Excellent new Indian Restaurant!  Great vegetarian food and delicious lamb. This restaurant is a welcome addition to Monona. They also have lunch buffets every day. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went here on Christmas Eve and had a delicious meal... We got the sampler vegetable appetizer and one of the sampler entrees so got to try a bit of everything. Officially my favorite Indian place. Staff was great and steered us in the right direction for the dessert... The pistachio ice cream was amazing! My companion decided not to go with the recommendation and got this rice/milk thing... Needless to say he kept trying to eat mine! Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"From all the Indian restaurants I have ever been to I could tell right away this one it's one step above the other ones, you can taste that \"special touch\" in every dish, like when you are in love and you put your whole heart and soul into your cooking so that your prince would love you even more than he already has, like that :)  Warning....your hubby could ask to meet the cook!  However, in my case mine knows who the owner of his stomach is ;) jajajajaja. 

Back to the food, I particularly loved the saag paneer, what a luscious sauceeee, the chicken memos (they are like fried dumplings) with such a delicious flavor I couldn't stop eating them! The owner even suggested a red chutney to go along with it and they matched perfectly! also a dish with mixed lentils, very comforting, The naan bread was very nice, pipping hot with brushed butter on top, interesting homemade ice cream flavors too! . Every little thing was fresh, well prepared and with yummy flavors and the staff is very attentive. I really want to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Madison and I am happy to report very vegan friendly!  I was ecstatic to discover our favorite Indian chef had opened a new place in Monona!!  The lunch buffet is my favorite.  Very reasonable prices...and best of all, served with lots of love!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a later lunch on a Saturday. It was busy but didn't feel overly full, the wait staff was on top of clearing plates, filling waters, and keeping the buffet well stocked.

There were lots of choices on the buffet, I loved the build your own section also included directions and a picture of the final food. The Sambar was amazing! The ice cream was a treat too.

A co-worker from India recommended this place and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"The rice. Oh! The rice, I tell you! I happily sing its praises. 
I have been there several times since last and it has only gotten better.  Now, my husband and I usually get pick up so I can't speak to other aspects of the restaurant itself,  but it is now my favorite Indian restaurant in the Madison area. 
Do yourself a favor and try a dosa and one of their specials.  They are delicious."}
{"text":"Swad is fantastic! The food is delicious and the owner and staff are incredibly gracious and welcoming. We're so happy to have finally found great Indian food here in the Madison area. Can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"Swad is my \"go to\" restaurant for Indian food and is probably in my top 10 favorite restaurants in Madison so far.  Everything I've tried has been delicious.  The staff is also very friendly and nice. Some of our favorite dishes so far have been the sag paneer, lamb vindaloo, chicken biryani, and the beef sag.  Can't wait to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff always greets us when we come in, the complementary chutneys are fantastic, the entrees are top-notch... and at the end of the meal, they always give us a hot washcloth. I feel pampered when we go there, and that's a great feeling when we go out to dinner. It's not fancy, but the atmosphere is pleasant and we've never had to wait (not sure what it's like at lunch time, though.)"}
{"text":"Amazing. Went for dinner on a Sunday night and the food was incredible. Everyone in our party loved what they ordered and couldn't stop eating even as we complained about how full we were. Got the garlic naan and the lamb mushroom dish- the meat was incredibly tender and flavorful. Every time I've gotten Indian food since coming here I've compared it to this meal and it is by far the best. Can't wait to come back for their lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"THE. BEST. INDIAN. FOOD. EVER!
PERIOD.

Great food, wonderful family atmosphere. Good was hot and delicious. The extensive menu had all the standards of a great Indian restaurant, as well as a number of innovative items, and South Asian classics that I haven't had since I lived in India. 

The vegetarian dinner for two was enough food for three people, with a take out container to spare.

We will be back innumerable times in the coming months. We plan in being regulars anytime we are in the Madison area. 

The family owners are incredibly sweet, and the service was impeccable. It felt as if you were being treated to dinner in someone's home rather than at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Eaten here a couple times and the food has been excellent.  Service can be a little slow, though very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Swad is a wonderful treat!  My husband and I went there opening night and was amazed by the menu.  Not only is the dining experience affordable, but the food was fantastic!  I had the Rogan Josh and the homemade mango ice cream, YUM!  I promise you will not be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Swad was a delightful surprise that a few friends of mine introduced me to. The ambiance is lacking, but the restaurant is clean. The staff is very attentive and quite friendly which made for a welcoming dining experience. 

We ordered several dishes, but I primary enjoyed the dal tarka. The lentil dish was amazing. From the well cooked rice to the lovely aromatic spices, the dal is a must have if you enjoy lentils. Heck, have it even if you don't eat lentils! 

The nan was quite good, but considering that I don't have much to compare it to I cannot accurately say. However, standing on its own the cheese nan was quite tasty. The lentil crisps and accompanying chutneys started out the meal just right! 

Overall, I would go back to swad any day and would even venture over to check out the lunch buffet. The only real place where I can dock them a star is the bathrooms. One must walk down the corridor to the kitchen which isn't kept as clean as it could. Additionally, they let the bus cars sit out in this hall way which is rather off putting to guests."}
{"text":"First off - so happy there's an Indian restaurant on Monona Drive now. 

Second, the owner is SUPER nice. He and the staff are so friendly every time we're in there. And he was telling us how they make it a point not to use food dyes like other places do in dishes like vindaloo, which tend to dyed red. Always a plus.

The food is delicious - veg curry, fish vindaloo, saag paneer all really tasty. I love the saffron/red color scheme, too, which is a little different than most Indian places."}
{"text":"Life-changing deliciousness! Sweet, friendly staff. Unique menu options to please both vegetarians and meat-eaters. Even the tea knocks my socks off!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is turning into a weekend tradition! Swad is hands down Monona's best spot - so glad you guys came to town!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've ever had.  My husband and I crave their chicken tikka masala.  We never seem to pass up the fish pakora either.  Delicious food and friendly customer service make Swad a very welcome addition to Monona!"}
{"text":"The most flavorful Chicken Makhani I've ever eaten!! 

Cute little strip mall haven - don't freak out with the menu available online - they DO serve booze and wine and Indian beers. Great selection. 

The menu is robust and offers both northern and southern Indian dishes - from the southern side they make an insane pancake type thing (gluten free! Woohoo!) I ordered one covered in cheese and holy cow I need more of those in my face. And in my belly. Immediately.  

I wish rating with a half a star was a thing -- the ONLY reason this was not a five was that bones were prevalent in many bites in the chicken makhani. Not a deal breaker but certainly distracting from the enjoyment of the dining. 

Got chicken pakora as an app- I love trying these everywhere - not a great amount served, compared to the other places I've visited - but the flavor was on point and I loved the crispness of them. 

Service was friendly and very punctual. There were about 5-6 tables of couples and a large table of about 8, being that this was a Sunday evening after 7:30pm I'd say this place has a great following even in the late hours on a Sunday. 

Get to SWAD. Immediately."}
{"text":"This is my favorite indian restaurant in the madison metro area. I haven't had a bad dish. The lunch buffet is amazing and a good deal. My go-to dinners include the Baingan Bhartha (eggplant), Sag Paneer, Lamb Rogan Josh, and Lamb Jalfrazie, all great. Tonight I had the Fish Curry for the first time and it was good as well. My husband usually gets the Mixed Grill and while it is A LOT of meet, it is all very good (I personally like the salmon). Our daughter likes the sesame chicken, which can be served mild and is a sweet chicken dish. The mango lassi and mango ice cream are delicious. The service is friendly. I always come away very happy and very full."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  Usually I like to explore when I'm visiting a new city, but I went here both days I was in town.  Lunch buffet was large, and to my surprise, almost completely new on my second visit.  Took three plates of food total and didn't leave a crumb on any of them!"}
{"text":"Lovely ppl, good ambience and very good food. We started with onion bhaji which was very delicious. Then we moved on to main course od goat curry and matar mushroom. Bith of our curry was mind blowing... its was perfectly spiced and very tender. Loved it"}
{"text":"We love the chicken marsalla with no chicken and big thing of rice the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner, reasonable prices, and so many vegetarian options! I'm going back to try the lunch buffet soon."}
{"text":"The staff is great and the food is delicious. I usually go for the Saturday buffet which is the best in town"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the lunch buffet and we were so, so happy. This was by far some of the best Indian food I've ever had, and such a selection! I tried to have a little bit of everything but there were so many different choices that I'll just have to go back again. We will be returning - soon and often."}
{"text":"Yelp took my order & charged my CC, but the restaurant doesn't use Yelp, nor do they deliver. Nice Job Yelp!"}
{"text":"The buffet was lovely! Immediately my favorite Indian restaurant in Madison. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was a nice sampling of Indian flavors.  Staff were friendly and kind.  Not a great name for a restaurant, but the food was tastier than other local Indian options we've tried.  Nan was freshly made, and hot off the grill."}
{"text":"By far, the best Indian food I've had the pleasure to eat!  Perfect, beautiful nan, delicious chutneys, carefully and lovingly spiced main dishes.  Excellent and attentive waitstaff.  The portions were large enough that we each had enough leftovers for lunch the next day.  Fantastic -- we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I went to Swad with some co-workers under duress (I don't generally like Indian food). To my surprise, every thing I tried was delicious! I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Very good. We are from California and weren't sure what to expect, additionally we just got back from a trip to India. It felt very authentic and the menu has a lot of variety. I will definitely come back next time in Madison!"}
{"text":"I ate here last week with my adult son- we both love Indian cuisine. While it was perfectly fine, I do not agree that it's the best Indian food in town. The samosa chat was delicious, but both our meals and the naan were exceptionally greasy. As in leave a pool of grease in the bottom of the basket greasy. Service was less attentive than hoped, although water was refilled regularly. At this price point, I didn't expect to have to box up my own food- maybe that's why they give you the great-smelling towels??"}
{"text":"Great food. We moved to Madison from bigger cities, and I couldn't find Indian food I liked until Swad opened. The food is delicious, the staff is attentive and kind, and the prices are reasonable. 

The only downside: We were there on a weekday night, and the lights were very bright and the interior felt a little sterile. So if you want a romantic evening, maybe get take-out, head home, and light some candles."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves some of the best Indian dishes I have had. The luncheon buffet is extensive and delicious. The price is very reasonable at $10. By far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Madison area!"}
{"text":"Swad is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  They have the best lunch buffet and the people there are so nice and FAST!  Support this business, they rock! :)"}
{"text":"Best goat biryani ever tasted after I came to u.s!! Excellent staff..makes me feel at home..buffet is economic for 10 dollars..definitely worth the money in weekends for u have better variety then..go for it..definitely not worth a miss when u r in madison!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Indian restaurant I've ever been to. I rarely use yelp but after such a horrendous visit, I had to. It was highly rated and maybe for non-Indians, this is great. I ordered the rajma, Chawal (rice), vegetarian Manchurian, and garlic naan. Let's start with the rajmah- this didn't have a typical rajma flavor- it's like they just mixed some Indian spices and were like- hey- here it is. Not sure who they were trying to fool. Then the manchurian- it was basically tomato sauce with manchurian and it was so salty I had to ask them to take it back and give me the daal tardka. The dal wasn't bad. The naan didn't even taste fresh- as if it had been sitting for quite some time and reheated but that too only on one side."}
{"text":"I've eaten at quite a few Indian Buffets in my days and I can wholeheartedly say none of them even come close to the quality and deliciousness of Swaad. The food is too notch; always flavorfully? fresh. The owner and his family and staff are amazingly friendly--- they always remember us and take care of us as if we ourselves were part of his family. What can I say? Don't waste your time and money  on Indian food anywhere else in the greater Dane county area."}
{"text":"Summary:
Not good food. Expensive for indian food in Madison. 

Likes:
Nice service, many options in the menu. 

Dislikes:
Gobi manchurian was too sweet and soggy. Paneer burji was very oily. Masala dosa was salt-less. Egg biriyani had too much salt. Expensive."}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in town! Lots of vegetarian options. The pistachio ice cream is amazing! The owner and staff are the sweetest and always remember a returning face. Very kind to children. The coconut chutney is the best I have ever had. A true gem to madison. Never had a bad dish."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Always a good buffet. Best homemade mango ice cream. Love going back there."}
{"text":"We've tried many different dishes and the food is always delicious. Great customer service whether dining in or carrying out. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. Just expanded to the next store front so much more room for seating and a larger buffet."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Madison! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place, but I wasn't happy with my first experience there. First, my Masala tea came out lukewarm. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Sag for my entree, and for spiciness I initially said, \"spicy\", but the waiter gave me a sideways look, so I clarified to \"a 7 out of 10\". Perhaps he didn't understand, because it came very mild, almost not spicy at all. There wasn't much meat in it, overall probably a small chicken breast worth, and what was there was dry and fairly bland. Given the 12.95 price, I expected a lot more. I also ordered cheese stuffed naan, which did not arrive with my entree. I think when I mentioned it they put in the order, because it came out several minutes later. This, too was pretty so-so: there was almost no cheese in it at all.

I'm willing to give this place another chance -- perhaps the buffet is much better -- but almost everything was disappointing this time."}
{"text":"Still great service and yummy food. Went in for dinner during a summer monsoon. Plenty of customers for a rainy night, indicative that its worth it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little place. We did the lunch buffet. The price was right and the food was very satisfactory. They bring fresh naan out to the table, even with the buffet!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We had lunch buffet and was great.. Attentive service and food was amazing as well"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in town. Saying that the menu is extensive would be an understatement... So much variety from so many regions of India. Everything we have had there (after about a dozen visits) is seriously tasty! There is something there for everyone, even those who say they don't like Indian (like my mother or my 10 year old--who will now devour an order of fish pakora in the blink of an eye). If you have the chance to go for the lunch buffet, you will not be disappointed. We often carry out, which is always fresh and fast--and they usually throw in a free \"surprise\" dessert. 

FYI--if you don't want something spicy, make sure to ask for it that way. Otherwise, the food can get pretty hot!"}
{"text":"We made our first visit last night to Swad, an unassuming but pleasant neighborhood restaurant located in a strip mall. Tried the lentil soup, samosas, pakora, biryani, and chicken tikka. Everything was good, service was fine. It's not the best Indian food I've had, but we enjoyed it and would return to try more."}
{"text":"This is one of best restaurants in Madison. I had dinner many times here and  they are consistent with their quality. Their service is amazingly quick. 

The Roti, Daal tarka were simply superb. The Lussy was fantastic. 
Loved eating here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Madison visiting a friend and were deciding on what to do for dinner. He was looking up restaurants and saw Swad was highly reviewed and recommended. When he suggested it I was hesitant at first because it had been awhile since we had good Indian food. I'm glad we went. 

When we arrived it was later on a Friday night so there was no wait, which was nice. We got our waters right away, but had to wait a little bit to place our order. We decided on the Non-vegetarian dinner for two which came with: Chicken 65, lamb curry, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, rice, Nan, and choice of dessert. 

Chicken 65- delicious pieces of fried chicken

Lamb curry- I would highly suggest if you like lamb, I'm not a huge lamb person so I only ate a little bit. 

Chicken Tikka Masala- This is my go to Indian dish so I have high expectations and they met them. We even ordered extra Nan so I could dip it in the sauce. 

Tandoori chicken- Flavorful, but a little dry for me it tasted delicious with the chicken tikka masala sauce. 

Nan- They serve it warm and it just really enhances the food. We also ordered the garlic Nan, which was worth it to finish the Tikka Masala sauce. 

This place is also on top of their water game, we never had to ask for refills on water and we're very thankful that we came to the restaurant. Hands down I will definitely be going again the next time I'm in the Madison area."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Indian food, and with Swad's great reviews I have been dying to go here for dinner. I must say that it did not disappoint. I ordered the chicken makhani and my husband ordered the lamb tikka masala. The chicken makhani was to die for. The nuts and dried fruit that were mixed into the sauce were fantastic. My husband also loved his lamb tikka masala. The garlic naan was straight up addicting, even though it had cilantro on it (I am one of those people who just can't do cilantro). I still devoured that stuff anyway. I also had a sweet lassi to drink that was a spectacular complement to the other dishes. I had been to Swad for their lunch buffet before and remembered enjoying it, it's great if you want to try a few different dishes at once, but the dinner menu was fantastic and I would highly recommend it if you have yet to try it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We had been for dinner before but not for their lunch buffet. The buffet is excellent and extensive. They had 2 soups, fresh salad, at least 12 different hot entrees including many chicken and vegetarian choices ,1 beef dish and grilled catfish. They had 6 dessert choices as well. All the food was delicious . The buffet is continually refreshed, no shortage of any dish. You also get warm nan with your meal.
The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated, staff are very attentive and friendly.
This is by far the very best Indian lunch buffet I have ever had. Give it a try!
 Cost is $10:95 a person with a huge selection of food choices."}
{"text":"I went with my wife and two friends for the first time to Swad (translates literally as delicious) in Monona for dinner. One of the other guests had been there before and had the lunch buffet and recommend it highly. In looking at the reviews on Yelp it received many four and five star recommendations. I'm a fan of Indian food and have gone to several of the Indian restaurants in Madison.

We were greeted promptly and seated in their spacious dining area. Even though it's Friday night they were few diners there. The decor was simple and rather nondescript. The service was attentive and the food was traditional and very good.  However, the overall experience was not as good as some of my favorite Indian food places in Madison.  At least the locals will have a pleasant Indian food experience in their own back yard."}
{"text":"Truely,some of best Indian food in Madison area. Very modest atmospheer, prompt service with great food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service is great and the food is fresh and well prepared.,"}
{"text":"I enjoy Indian/Pakistani food. I love the smells, the colors and varied textures. Curries run the gamut from spicy, to sexy to mellow. There is always something new to try and many times there is a surprise, a burst of flavor you didn't expect. 

I have been to SWAD five times and the food is consistently delicious. That has not been my experience with other Indian restaurants. I am often disappointed after the first try.

I love their saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, Chana masala, roti, and biryanis. The mango ice cream is the perfect way to end a meal.

Today I went to their lunch buffet. I was reluctant because I generally do not like to eat food sitting in a warming tray. The food was hot, fresh and delectable. I had chai tea which helped to chase my chills away. I would gladly go again.

Service is excellent and friendly. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Excellent food, with rich but not over saturated flavors. We will definitely try to come back to try it for lunch. Service was pretty haphazard the evening we visited, but the staff were apologetic--I think they were dealing with a crisis behind the scenes. If so, although the crisis was evident in the service, the food didn't suffer at all."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and had a great experience.  The service was exceptional and the food was fantastic.  I normally shy away from buffets, but this one was fresh and had a great selection. Swad is now one of my favorite restaurants in the Madison area."}
{"text":"We loved all of the different choices. The food tasted really good, And the atmosphere was comfortable. Very nice staff and it appeared as they had many regular customers. We will come back"}
{"text":"Seeing as I live in Monona and have been to Swad many times, this review seemed like a must. My boyfriend and I have been for the lunch buffet countless times and always enjoy it immensely. The quality of food is amazing for a buffet, which usually tends to taste like it's been sitting there for hours. Swad somehow keeps it looking and tasting fresh. With the buffet you also get a basket of fresh-baked naan which is a nice touch. Overall, amazing buffet experience every single time.

We have also gone a few times for dinner. While the food is still the same amazing quality as the buffet, I am typically left feeling a little bit underwhelmed because the dinner prices seem a little steep. I understand that having a server makes a difference in the overall experience, but it just seems silly to me to pay more money for less variety and less food.

So my suggestion is go for the buffet and don't mess around with dinner. As a side note, this is also a great place to come if you're feeling hungover."}
{"text":"As a first time visitor to Madison, this place was a great way to start exploring the restaurant scene. 5 stars for their food. Reasonably priced, perfect amount of oil, fresh taste, adequate amount of spice and decent serving portions. Staff is friendly and accommodative and genuinely cared about making sure we had a good experience. They give plenty of rice on the side so I would recommend sharing one naan between two people. I will be going back to try their daily lunch buffet !"}
{"text":"Not Bad First Experience And I Will Be back. Went back and had a similarly good experience.   Unlike some of the other posters... I didn't see anything really a spectacular and their location is unfortunate,  but the decor is nice and staff friendly and then food at least as good or better than other Indian I've had in Madison and possibly the best ethnic food option in monona."}
{"text":"We tried Swad for a late lunch on Sunday. For $12.50 a person, we had some very good food. There are two large rooms with lots of tables. We were seated promptly and our server took our drink order. The buffet takes up a couple of walls in one room. There were a couple of soups, makings for salad, and lots of dipping sauces. The samosas were some of the best I've had. The pakora was good. There was something similar to falafel but not as tasty. The chicken tika marsala was creamy, buttery and delicious. The biryani was good but included chunks of bone-in chicken of which I was not a fan. The tandori chicken was good and the tandori mixed grill was delicious including sausage, onions, peppers, and other chunks of meat. I enjoyed several other dishes including fish, more chicken, and some sort of dumpling. There was a pancake type dish which was very bland. There was probably another dozen dishes which I didn't have room on my plate for. Upon arriving back at our table we discovered a basket of fresh naan -- buttery and delicious. The servers were pretty good, (not great) about promptly refilling our beverages. For dessert I had rice pudding and gulab jamun both of which were delicious. This was definitely one of the best Indian Buffets we have tried in the Madison area."}
{"text":"This is the cheapest, best, tastiest, (insert positive adjective here) Indian/thai buffet in the greater Madison area. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the expense of their dinner menu. A really great place welcoming atmosphere and flavors that will rival any of the other Indian / Thai places in town. I don't know what more there is to say go there have it experience it love it. Highlights: mango ice cream, coconut soup, cheese/yogurt ball things I don't remember the name of, rice to die for."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Indian food.  Our kids took us there on Mother's Day.  I am an expert in on quality and service.  We had 10 in our party, 6 adults and 4 children.  We were promptly seated in a spacious area.  Our son ordered a selection of appetizers , bread and several dishes (two types of chicken, two veggie dishes and rice). The food came promptly and was served hot.  The kids had smoothies as a treat.  All the food was excellent and the service was very attentive.  I'm sorry I don't know the names of all the dishes, but I can assure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't think my belly has ever been happier. This is the first buffet I've been to where I've eaten everything on my plate, twice. 
I was particularly excited to see so many options. I was able to try many things I've never had before and loved every single thing. Complimentary naan was served warm, a slightly crispy bottom, a delicious seasoning, and a perfect scoop for the yummy Indian flavors on your plate. 
The best comfort food in the area. Your belly will be warm and happy after visiting. Definitely recommend the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Best Indian Food in Madison area!  Hands down. The Sunday lunch buffet goes on for miles!  I was overwhelmed how delicious everything was. And always warm naan!  Go hungry or on a fast for a week before going. Delish!"}
{"text":"The first time we ate at swad it was our second date and we were trying to impress each other with our adventurous pallets. We walked I. And there was only one other couple eating there. We got a little nervous that we had picked a dud but we decided to stick it out. Food came and it was amazing!
Fast forward a year (we are still dating), we are driving past Swad on a slightly hungover Sunday morning, so we decide to stop in for their buffet. It's slightly busier now, but fast/friendly service and delicious food have not changed. 
Now we are engaged and we come here fairly often, thank goodness they expanded because apparently word is out! Everything is delicious, prices are decent, and the owner knows us and greets us every single time we come in. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"THE. BEST. INDIAN. IN. TOWN. 

We know the owner from going to the Maharaja on the West side. I'm so happy he opened a restaurant near where we live now. It's so good. There are a ton of choices for everyone and the samosas are quite tasty. The staff are friendly and courteous. The lunch buffet price is outstanding and the items featured in the buffet are quite delicious."}
{"text":"Top notch service and food! Our server was an absolute delight! Will come here again when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this place for the first time tonight. We've been to pretty much every other indian restaurant in Madison and this was the last on the list to try.

We were pretty impressed with the quality of food. The Ghobi Manchurian was the highlight of the meal and was definitely the best Manchurian we have found in Madison so far. Paneer Mahkani was also really flavorful.

Service on the other hand was not the best. The gentleman who served us kept running off really quick before we could finish our sentences.

Also it was very pricey compared to a lot of the other Indian restaurants in the city. Although - I thought the quality of food made it all worth it. 

Overall - this place is an excellent choice if you are looking for good Indian food in Madison. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot of good things about Swad, so my husband and I decided to check it out on a recent Saturday night.  I'd never had Indian food before.  It turned out we made a great choice for my initial foray into this cuisine.  We seated right away.  Since I wasn't familiar with the food, I had several questions for the waiter.  He was able to give me lots of details and advice.  The food was spectacular and I was very happy with my choice of chicken tandoori.  My husband had a curry and was also very happy.  He's eaten Indian food at several other restaurants, so he was able to make a good comparison.  He had nothing but good comments.  We were both really impressed with the service.  Several times other servers stopped by our table to make sure everything was going OK and we didn't need anything.  I really felt like they were all working as a team.  I want to come back for the lunch buffet  so I can try more of their dishes.  I can't wait."}
{"text":"Had to check it out again a few weeks after my first experience.  Zowie, just as solid across the board.  This time my 12 year old came along, she loved it.  Again, don't expect spice in the buffet, it's tame.  But, order off the menu for dinner or take out and they can heat it up. What I'm really enjoying is the staff and the owner's attentiveness. They're not perfect, but when the waiter forgot my chai he was very apologetic, brought it right out, and didn't charge me."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food we've ever tried in Madison. I love the rice pudding here, It's sweet and creamy, with a lot of raisins. We also ordered a hot chicken curry which turned out to be extremely hot. If you have a low  or average tolerance for chili, just choose the mild or medium hot."}
{"text":"Buffet here is a must try! This was the first Indian restaurant i have been to which had so many varieties. Unfortunately I don't live in Madison, but if i did , i would come every week."}
{"text":"I ate at Swad the other night and was a little underwhelmed.

I tried their Chicken Tikka, and it was fine. I think it was around $13-14 for a pretty small portion. A friend ordered the Goat Curry, and for about the same price had even worse luck. His meal was chock full of goat bones and very little meat, making it a terrible value.

I've had better Indian food in Madison, and at a much more affordable price point. I'm really confused why dinner at Swad costs so much. The portions aren't even that big!
It's a nice, intimate space and the staff members were all very nice. But for my money, I'll stick with Maharaja or Taste of India."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food restaurants in Madison.  The buffet is great.  Can't get there for lunch?  Try a \"Dinner for two\" on the menu.  Enough food for four, or take some home.  We've tried a lot on the menu, and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food, extensive menu, courteous and efficient service. Convenient location too, close to highway. 
We had samosa, aloo tikki chat, biryani(lamb) paneer masala, daal tarka and tandoori mix grill. The last item was hands down the best one- great tasting chicken. Also the naan is very good!:)"}
{"text":"Friendly and  attentive staff. Quick service. Delicious food. 
Will be back to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"We have checked out quite a few Indian restaurants in town, and I continue to come back to SWAD. I would highly recommend their buffet to be able to sample a variety of their offerings. We have our favorites and love to order take out. You are able to choose your spice level and I tend to start mild on a dish the first time I order it and then decide how spicy I want to go - their dishes can vary widely in spicey-ness!"}
{"text":"Very less variety of food, price is on a little cheaper side though (1$). 

Gulab Jamun was terrible. 

Paneer was ok. Not a good selection of starters either."}
{"text":"So excited that this neighborhood has a fantastic Indian restaurant!  The food is great and the staff are so welcoming, even to kids.  Swad means tasty and it is!  I highly recommend the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the lunch buffet ($10.95 on weekends, $9.95 during the week) today.  All three of us adults enjoyed the selection and quality.  

My son is only two so he ate the food we brought for him, but even he couldn't help but eat up the nan bread and mango ice cream.

The owner was very friendly and came over to make sure we liked our food and our son was having a good time."}
{"text":"We had a really lovely meal at Swad; in fact, it was so exceptional that I was inspired to write my first Yelp review in a long time!

The menu is pretty typical, although they have some less-common northern Indian offerings (like momos, mmmm). We arrived starving and ordered appetizers. My 2-year-old, who loves Indian food more than anything, decided he couldn't wait for the food to cool and shoved part of a piping-hot momo in his mouth, resulting in a very high-pitched scream. I took him to the front of the restaurant to comfort him without disturbing the other patrons, and when we returned to the table, instead of giving me the side-eye, the Swad staff came over to make sure he was okay and even brought him a mango lassi to help him feel better. 

All the food we ordered (and we ordered a lot of food) was fresh and delicious. The garlic naan was especially tasty, but we found all of our dishes to be consistently a cut above other Indian restaurants in the madison area. The kind and attentive service, especially regarding my son, was the icing on the cake. We'll definitely be back, soon and frequently."}
{"text":"This place is great! awesome selection on the lunch buffet and it's all super tasty. Can't help but to over eat here usually because I want it all. Service is good and the price is even decent. This is one of my go to local Indian spots."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing special. I was glad they made my food as spicy as I'd asked.  Sometimes some restaurants don't believe me when I say SPICY!  Service was wonderful and the location is convenient for the area. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price, probably the best Indian buffet in Madison. Atmosphere is nothing special but it does not matter much. Not a place for any formal occasion but just a good solid lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty slow service. Food is also not great. Won't come again.

Better to go in Madison for Indian food."}
{"text":"Why is it that in Madison the Chinese food is so lousy and the Indian food so good? Swad does things very well. The real difference is that the people who work her really seem happy that you are there. They make eye contact with you and are friendly. Most of the other ones rarely speak to you or even look at you once you're seated for a buffet. I tried most of everything at the buffet and like all of it. They did have a couple of soups that I didn't like and the music choice that noon was annoying rock of some kind but all in all a great unpretentious place. Try it."}
{"text":"Tonight, I picked up carry-out for an evening of Indian food and NCAA basketball at home.  The chicken vindaloo was incredibly delicious and did not disappoint on the specification of \"extra spicy\".  My wife's regular selection of chicken tikka was exactly what she was hoping, and that squeeze of lemon helps to tie the whole dish together.  The garlic naan was a delicious compliment to the entire meal.  

I was greeted at the door with warm smiles and kind words.  On previous visits, we have stopped by for a sit-down dinner or to check out the lunch buffet on a weekend.  I have never had a negative experience at this establishment.  If you are apprehensive about this type of cuisine, Swad is the place to give it a try.  I recommend checking out the lunch buffet for the variety of choices."}
{"text":"We've been here many times and have always had delicious food and friendly service.  There are lots of dishes to choose from and we enjoy trying different things each time.  You really cannot go wrong here, it's one of the best restaurants in the Madison area."}
{"text":"The moment I walked in the door I knew it was gonna be good. The aromas are absolutely intoxicating. The food was excellent, pricing was good and the variety in the lunch buffet was outstanding. Lots of vegetarian options is a huge bonus. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Top. Notch.

I've been so pleasantly surprised by the ethnic diversity in regards to restaurants here in Madison, and I think I can safely say we have some serious contenders in the Indian cuisine scene. 

My husband and I just purchased a home on the eastside of town, so we are getting to know the local flavors and Swad was our option this weekend. We decided to order the vegetarian dinner for 2, and boy did it not disappoint. For 32 dollars we got samosa, naan, 3 vegetarian entrees, AND dessert all of which were absolutely delicious. The food had so much flavor and the portions were enough to make 2 meals with. The only, and I do mean only, let down was the rice dessert. Just seemed a little watery/flavorless to me, but literally that is my only \"complaint\" about the whole meal.

If you are searching for a flavorful meal in the Monona area, Swad is a great option!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. The food and service are outstanding.  I went with my friend Sudeep who picked our full meal which was a help to me. We had a full vegetarian meal. We had a great appetizer of fried vegetables. Then we had the assorted breads with our main course of eggplant. Add this to your not to be missed in Maddison. If you live in the area I would put it into my regular rotation. I wish I had taken pictures but I was to busy over eating. I was a very happy guest."}
{"text":"We  were visiting from Chicago and went here for the lunch buffet.  We have been to many Indian food buffets and this was by far the best buffet with the largest selection we've had.  They even had 6 different desserts.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  The food and service were phenomenonal."}
{"text":"Tried lunch buffet at this place during my Wisconsin visit. They had lot of options in their buffet, it was good."}
{"text":"Must try! I have tried all Indian restaurants in Madison, this one has the closest authentic Indian food taste... try Chicken Masala"}
{"text":"Amazing food and exceptional service! This place is incredible. I loved absolutely everything that I tried. You will not leave here disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit of an Indian food, but the food Swad was awesome.  The waitstaff was very friendly and it's quite a swanky little place, for being in a strip mall.  We had the vegetable pakora to start, then vindaloo (lamb) and baingan bharta.  Both were great.  The only disappointment was that they didn't have uppatham that day.  I look forward to going back when they do!"}
{"text":"Ambience is nice: modern and clean, although a bit dark for my taste. Service was outstanding. Friendly, polite, and attentive.  Food was amazing.  The Bagwan Bartha (eggplant ) was perfectly spiced, and the garlic Nana was the best I've had."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! We go with our two boys and order the dinner for two. Feeds the whole family and we have leftovers."}
{"text":"Tried Swad's lunch buffet yesterday and I was not disappointed! Best Indian food on the east side with a great variety of dishes. I also loved how fresh the naan was when they brought it to the table. I think their Indian dishes (chicken tikka masala, veggie korma, daal makhani) is better than their Indo-Chinese (sesame chicken) because the Indian dishes tasted more fresh. Wonderful and attentive service! Only reason I give it 4 stars is because some of the buffet food was cold at 12:30pm."}
{"text":"The best Indian in Madison hands down. I love the large selection of naan, the daal, chicken tikka masala, the lunch buffet, their specialty steamed chicken momos just to name a few. The h and the staff the friendliest in town, never forget a face. Swad I love you! Glad you are in my neighborhood, but I'd make the drive even if you weren't."}
{"text":"Large Indian buffet; many choices.

I appreciated the lettuce, cucumber and tomato offered on the buffet.

Half the buffet offerings were vegetarian and they were labelled with green labels. 

My favorite items were the potato dish and the noodles with vegetables.  The samosa was meh.

At least 6 different desserts.

Tables were spread apart nicely."}
{"text":"I went for the first time for dinner with a couple of friends and it was a great experience.  The place is in a strip mall but when inside you wouldn't know it as it was well tastefully done.  The staff were very attentive but not overbearing and answered our questions.  I was actually surprised at the amount of staff there as I counted over 5 wait staff.

Ok the food...I have been to both north and south India so I have a bit of a barometer.  We started with a couple of Samosas and the Onion Bjahi.  Both were good and the Samosa was really like I remember from India.  The Onion Bjahi was good and reminded me to haystack onion rings with a few extra spices.

For entrees we go the Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Curry, and Lamb Masala.  The Tandoori was well spiced.  It came out steaming which is a good sign.  The Chicken Curry was very good but the mild spicy level is truly mild so if you want any heat take it up to medium at least.  The lamb in the Lamb Masala was incredibly tender and my friend cannot wait to have it again.

The only complaint is that things did come out a slightly spread out but nothing that was very annoying.  We always had poppadom to munch on with really good Onion Chutney and Hari Chutney

I recommend going."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The food and the service never fail to disappoint, and make it my favorite every time. We recently got a catering order for a birthday party and everyone went back for seconds and thirds. And talk about amazing leftovers!The owner goes out of his way to be welcoming.  I couldn't recommend this place highly enough! It's like visiting family, except the food is way better!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is extremely clean! It is also nicely decorated. 

The food just blew us away it was so good. I got the Lamb Masala medium spicy. It was spot on. The lamb was very tender and the flavor was out of this world. You must order the naan bread. The naan arrived hot right out of the pan and was so nicely chewy.

The service here is top notch too. They actually care about their customers experience. At one point my significant other commented on how spicy the food was and our server immediately asked if it was too spicy. It was not at all, he just loves spicy food lol.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday for their lunch buffet, which is just $9.99. 

The staff is friendly, and the food tasty.  Highlights were their samosas with mango and mint chutney, their masala marinated and fried chicken pieces, and their breaded cauliflower.  I was also a fan of their chai tea and mango lassi.  

It's a relatively small buffet; there isn't as much variety as there is at some of the other Indian buffets around town, but the main staples are there.  If it weren't so far from where I lived, I'd probably come by more often."}
{"text":"Wife and I were looking for Indian takeout close to home, open until 10pm, reasonably priced.  This checked all the boxes.

We ended up getting the chicken dinner for two, which included Chicken 65, lamb curry, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, rice, nan and rice pudding.  Total was something like $45.

Both of the entrees and nan were excellent.  The appetizers were flavorful but a little dry and I wish I'd thought to ask for more sauce (they only gave us 3 small cups).  Also should have ordered extra nan.  Nan is so good.

I wanted to try samosas.  Next time I will probably order Chicken Tika Masala, Chicken Curry, Samosas, and Extra Nan.  But there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Very very good. Nothing about the food was bad. Ordered the dinner for 2 non-vegan. Medium spicyness was hot but not overwhelming. We had about 4 different waiters/waitresses all were very nice people. The place is right on Monona Dr. but i dont think ppl give it credit and try it out. Inside is simple, colorful and surprisingly roomy. An inviting place. Will have to go again no complaints. Food was out in less than 12 minsPrice was average but the Indian food was amazing here I was surprised."}
{"text":"Our family of 6 (3 generations) visited for the Sunday lunch buffet and we were immediately seated. The buffet selections were outstanding with a variety of spice levels to accommodate my 85 yr old \"picky\" parents and my \"bring-on-the-fire\" daughter and brother. The freshness and quality of the soups, vegetables, and various entries was excellent! The mango ice cream was a great finishing touch! The servers at our table were very attentive removing plates and refilling water glasses. I can see why this restaurant gets such good reviews. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The good variety of food at this buffet is delicious! The curries are yummy especially with the fresh flat bread they serve.  The different hot sauces are also fairly spicy. I also love the vegtarian options as well.  The only suggestion I would make is to get a bigger venue.  It can seem a bit crouded even when its not a full house."}
{"text":"We went here for the lunch time buffet.  The buffet tables are set up in the back of the dining area in such a way that the line queues up pretty quickly yet moves very slowly.  Some of the dishes are harder to reach in the back left corner.  The food itself is ok, the one stand out dish was the Manchurian cauliflower.  The staff demeanor is about the same as any of the other Indian restaurants around Madison, not particularly friendly, but not downright rude either.

I like the decor, dark red, black, and gold colors, and lots of wine bottles up behind the register.  The day we were there they were having technical difficulties with their debit machine and were asking everyone to pay by check or cash.  

I think they have potential, they just have a few things to work out."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian restaurant in Madison.  While there buffet is extensive, it can tend to the mild.  I prefer my Indian food hot, hot, hot.  So we often get takeout for dinner."}
{"text":"It's become our  go-to \"Indian food place\" recently.The food is great..much better (in both quality and amount) than any of the \"local\" Madison joints. It does take a bit longer to go there, but the food more than makes up for it.  Infact, some of the dishes are better than I would get back in India. The staff are friendly..the place nice and clean. 
Lamb dishes are a favorite. You can actually differentiate between the different curries..Carefully seasoned gravies and well cooked meat. 

Would definitely recommend it to anyone who's into or would like to try out good Indian fare."}
{"text":"Best Indian in town hands down. I've eaten at multiple Indian establishments within Dane county and none of them compare to Swad. Staff is amazing and their lunch buffet will make your mouth drooling for more. Great selection and i'm so happy that they've expanded. Tip for future patrons look to dine in at this amazing restaurant. Come early!!! Swad opens at 11:30 for their lunch buffet, we got there at 11:40 thinking it was early enough to beat the rush but boy were we wrong. Makes sense since they're so dam freaking good."}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet is stellar! The food you'll receive during the buffet isn't quite the same quality as what you could get if you ordered off the menu at another time, but it's worth every penny.

I believe the lunch buffet is around $10-12. Don't skip the mango ice cream or the chicken kebab with peppers and onions. Great flavor! The naan they serve is yummy too!

Servers may spill water all over the table while you're there, but who cares! Lol... in all seriousness, it's a good meal."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience. We ordered the vegetarian dinner for two. The timing of the courses was perfect, the food was delicious and the service was flawless. Not to mention for under $40 we received an appetizer, three entrees to share, naan and two desserts. I'm seriously embarrassed it took us this long to try it. Eat here, it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise! Went for the lunch buffet. Many options to choose from. A salad bar and a choice of many, many Indian dishes. Fresh Naan is brought to your table often & the homemade Chai tea is the BEST! Alex the proprietor is very friendly & professional. $ 10 Indian buffet that is very worth the price!"}
{"text":"Loved the dahl. More vegetarian entries would be nice. Everything quite tasty. Nice setting."}
{"text":"Been here twice in less than a month, both times for their weekend lunch buffet. Love it Love it Love it!!!!

I've had my fair share of buffets and it's rare to get food that's as hot, fresh and tasty as ala carte! And this place gives you just that. Both times left me satisfied and impressed and a sure sign of coming back again :)

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The naan alone gets 5+ stars, in fact I may return simply to feast on the garlic naan - I love the generous use of cilantro along with the garlic. It is the best naan I have yet to try around the Madison area!

The Swad dinner menu has so many lovely dinner options, it can be difficult to narrow down. When deciding on my level of spiciness for my Lamb Vindaloo, I went for medium and it was pretty dang hot. I'm normally have a taste for medium+ levels, though if you have a tame palate I would play it safe here.

Overall, the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. I called ahead to inquire about a Friday night reservation which was not required for a party of less than 5. However, the staff I spoke with still took my name saying they were looking forward to seeing us. It was a little gesture, but it showed a warmness that isn't always found in short phone interactions with restaurants. Great job all around, Swad!"}
{"text":"This small, quaint restaurant dishes out amazing Indian cuisine. You wouldn't think it would when you pull into the plaza off Monona Dr. Everything from the appetizers, Nan, specialties or the many options of curries, you will not be disappointed! Namaste"}
{"text":"The most DELICIOUS Indian food I've had since moving to Madison, I've eaten all over the place and this was so surprising and wonderful, everything was great! I did not have such high expectations when seeing it in passing, the outside doesn't look like much, we got it to go but next we will try the buffet! So glad to have something so close to me."}
{"text":"I love Indian food!  I especially looovvee a buffett. What do you mean I don't have to just choose one thing and then mooch off the others at my table? I can have it all?!

Swad is a place where your food dreams come true. They have everything so you can get your favorites, like tikka masala, and plenty of new things to try, try loads of briyani and korma and dahl. Delicious.

I actually would say this is the best Indian buffet in town. I've been here on 4 or 5 occasions and have always left way too full, you know the so full it's hard to breath and even stretchy pants feel restrictive, and very happy.

Protip: add a couple gulab jamun (the little donuts soaked in syrup) to some coconut soup. It will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was fantastic. I was impressed with the variety of dishes and flavors. I had previously been to an Indian buffet in downtown Chicago, and Swad was far better in selection and quality. Each dish has a distinct flavor, and there were so many dishes I couldn't try them all. The only foods that were not 100% great were foods like masala dosa (crepe filled with potatoes) that don't stay crisp when left out, but that is to be expected from a buffet. I recommend skipping the buffet naan for the fresh naan that gets brought to the table. My favorites were the chicken biryani and the chicken tikka masala. Service was great, prompt and polite. After the meal, we sat for a long time, and the servers didn't rush us at all. I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited Swad twice since moving near by--and it's very very good. We both love Indian food, and so far Swad has not disappointed. 

We began with an order of vegetable Samosas. They were very fresh, hot, and were very tasty. They had a good spice, but were not spicy. The first time we had them the tamarind sauce was good--it had a little body to it. More recently, it was a little watery.

We also ordered chicken tikka masala, mixed vegetable curry, and plain naan. Their tikka masala is a stand-by for us, and theirs is very good--huge hunks of white meat chicken, creamy sauce. The first time we ordered it we asked for it the be between mild and medium. More recently, we asked for it to be prepared in the same way, but it was a good bit more spicy. We asked for the  mixed vegetable curry to be medium. Both dishes ended up having the same amount of heat--which was a bit too much for me. Next time, I'll ask for mild. At the same time, they are both good dishes. There are tons of vegetables in the curry. Just thank god for the water!

This place is becoming  our to-go place when we want Indian."}
{"text":"I recently returned to Swad to give the lunch buffet another try. It wasn't bad last time, but there were some things that didn't sit totally right with me. On this more recent visit, my experience was much better. We arrived earlier in the serving window and the food was much fresher and well stocked. Service was more attentive, though there was a small hiccup of ordering drinks and not receiving them until tracking down a server 15 minutes later. 

Spice level was still on point (a couple notches up from the mild, spiceless buffet offerings of many restaurants), but the naan had a more flour-y flavor than most this time around. 

I'll happily return for the varied offerings and reasonable price point."}
{"text":"Stopped here for Lunch Buffet on a weekday on our way to Wisconsin dells. The restaurant was fairly crowded. This was one the largest selection of appetizers and Desserts that i have seen in an Indian Buffet. Place is pretty clean and big with two rooms.

                Gajar Halwa

I would definitely recommend people to try this out. Some of the dishes that did not suit my taste bud might suit yours.Its just a  lot of food options."}
{"text":"It was overall a quite nice experience. It was my first time trying Indian food and I loved it especially their desserts. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time... So glad it is local, the best I have had!! The chutney they give you is the perfect balance of sweet and spicy... This place is busy, another sign of great food. I travel for a living, and would not lead you astray!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was really good. I was looking for authentic Indian food and this ended up being just was I wanted. 
I will be trying many new items from here soon."}
{"text":"Excellent. Came for the buffet & enjoyed everything on the line. They offered many Chinese Indian dishes (like gobi manchurian), which are new to me at least, that were really great. Love it. 
Wish they were open on Mondays!!"}
{"text":"The service was lavish and deferential.  The entrees were wonderful, but the buffet kinda blew my socks off. Everything was new to me, but fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"The food is fine here.. I have had better Indian food in Madison though.. do not understand the super high rating"}
{"text":"The dinner I had was OUTSTANDING, flavor and presentation was great!  Friendly and great service.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Swad was an interesting place for trying new foods. I had Samosas for an app, and Chicken Tikka Sag for the main dish. The Chicken Tikka Sag has a smoky flavor that reminded me of burnt spinach, and I wasn't a huge fan of it. I tried my wife's Chicken Mango Curry and it was much better. It had a very distinct mango taste that was sweeter than most curries. The Samosas were amazing and very crispy! The service was quick and the staff were very polite. All in all a great experience!"}
{"text":"Some of the best indian food I've ever had. The dinner was fantastic, and the service was very nice. I will certainly be coming back for the buffet, for I have heard it is also very good."}
{"text":"What more can I say about Swad. Hard to believe, but it's even better than Swagat. Now it has become my favorite Indian restaurant in Madison. I tried the lunch buffet last week. There are a variety of choices, among which goat curry, chicken biryani, fried fish were all very tasty. The dessert there was also at a reasonable level. Moreover, the price is quite cheap. I cannot wait to go there for a second time!"}
{"text":"The worst place to have indian food in Madison area. Not hospitable., you get a frowning face when asked for the limited food variety. There was literally no one in the place and it was ghost town. My votes are for maharani, swagat, minerva and east side maharaja for indian food."}
{"text":"We were both quite pleased with this new restaurant in our neighborhood. I ordered the Fish Moly, a catfish cooked in a coconut based cream sauce. It was mild, and very tasty. My parter ordered the Chicken Tikka Uthappam, a flat gluten free pizza styled dish that came with both coconut and tomato chutnies and a delicious  Sambar, all for dipping. Excellent meals. The Nan was tender, the service and atmosphere great. We are happy to have a new favorite  restaurant."}
{"text":"The flavors were mild compared to traditional Indian cuisine, but I give 5 stars for service.  I had the lunch buffet: all food was freshly prepared.  Despite being packed, the owner took the time to check on how we were doing. Very happy."}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian restaurant in central Madison and Monona, also have the finest chicken momos (steamed dumplings) possibly in Madison.
Nice biriyani with East India touch (with nuts and fried onions), and great Korma and tikka masala. Have tried only 3-4 times and stick to my favorites here, and so far not disappointed even once"}
{"text":"A friend in and I stopped in here for dinner as a midway point during a bike ride around the lake. It was a fairly cold night for July, and raining. We looked for a place to lock up our bikes, but there was nothing available anywhere. Luckily, Swad had a table open directly at the front window, so we could watch our unlocked bikes leaned against the outside of it while we ate.

The first adjective that comes to mind to describe Swad is unpretentious. It's located in a semi-rundown strip mall; nothing to write home about. The interior is painted in warm shades of mustard and deep red, and the tables and small bar are dark wood. 

My companion is South Indian, and he recognized and chatted with the owner, who is also associated with Maharaja restaurant on Odana Rd. He didn't comment much on the food, just ate a lot of it, which I am assuming meant it met with his approval. 

Papadam and three chutneys were brought to the table immediately. Tomato onion, ginger cilantro, and tamarind. All were fairly standard. 

We both ordered vegetarian meals, I had Aloo Chole and he had Chole Masala. I ordered mine with medium heat and it was exactly that, with large chunks of potato in a well seasoned tomato based broth with tender chickpeas. Filling and satisfying. We shared an order of Swad Special Naan Bread, which was delicious. Kind of like a soft fluffy quesadilla filled with deliciously spiced mashed potatoes and peas with cheese. My friend did note that it was very good but very salty, which is true, but for me it was perfect. 

The lighting was dim and it was quiet, both very nice. Only a couple of other tables of diners were present. Our server was young and conscientious/bordering on nervous, but very pleasant. It took a long time to get our check after the meal, considering how busy they weren't. Didn't really matter, as we were taking our time and talking a lot. One thing to note though is that it was fa-fa-fa-freezing cold inside. The other diners who left at the same time were mentioning it as well. It was only 63 degrees outside, and the restaurant felt colder.

I wasn't blown away, but I would go again and try the buffet to get a better overall impression of their offerings. There is a full bar available, although we stuck with just water.

And I would dress warmly. :-)"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants I've had in Madison! The best dish had to be the dosa! Wow! And I got delivery but the food was still hot and tasty and I felt like, for the first time in a while, a delivery actually DELIVERED on the price I paid. I am still eating leftovers two days later! WOW!

Only issue: the samosa was a little too salty and the dips were not as flavorful as one might expect."}
{"text":"My true review of this place is 3.5/5.  Just an average Indian restaurant.

I ordered a shrimp pakora (and it looked like you could buy it in a frozen isle at a grocery store).  This was not truly a pakora and it was really disappointing to see.  DO NOT ORDER THIS.

But the vindiloo and naan was good."}
{"text":"Holy wow!  This place is super amazing...  My fiancé and I went here for date night last Friday and ordered the non-vegetarian option for two. For the price, you get a hearty meal. Ours included chicken tandoori, chicken masala, curry chicken, naan, chicken 65, and dessert. We had leftovers that tasted even better the next day. Be wary though...if you're used to \"medium\" spice elsewhere, they kick it up a notch here!  We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is our first trip to Swad. I chose this restaurant based on the favorable reviews. Since Yelpers are such awesome reviewers, I am rarely disappointed. This time is no exception, Swad has terrific service and amazing food.

We started with vegetable pakoras. They were very good, not as crispy as I usually enjoy at other places, but different does not mean worse in this case. They were excellent. Our server also brought a tasty, thin, crispy bread whose name I cannot remember, along with three chutneys that were terrific.

I ordered vegetable mango and Lori ordered chicken makhani. Both were a tad spicier than we expected. Both were amazingly good. 

We also ordered ginger nan with our meal, with a side of mango chutney. Did I mention that I like mango a lot? We did not finish our meals, after the pakoras and bread. We'll be having an awesome lunch tomorrow!

Lori wanted a bit of ice cream afterward to quiet the spiciness a bit. She thought the mango ice cream was great.

Yup, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. They have plenty of variety and I am absolutely in love with the fresh naan that is brought out for you when you arrive.

There is plenty of selection and I am surprised at the number of non-vegetarian dishes available. There is a rotating selection with a couple of mainstays but everything is delicious. 

I have only done the buffet here but take-out looks very scrumptious as well. Swad is a great addition to the Monona area."}
{"text":"They're adding on!!! Yay! Now there'll be more room at lunch during those beautiful buffets!! Today was packed wall to wall but people kept coming.  And no wonder..everything was fresh temperature  was appropriate today... Naan was on time and water glass never emptied. 
Thank you Alex
Namaste"}
{"text":"So much vegetarian you would never need to have any meat dish if you are looking for non-meat options. I eat the vegetarian just because it's so good. Very large selection."}
{"text":"Bad name, GREAT FOOD!!  just moved to the area. Love this place for takeout. Chicken tiki Marsala dish was the bomb. Order medium. Hot is really F'n HOT!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant tonight, I was very VERY impressed!! Their menu is huge but easy to navigate through. The atmosphere is lovely, each table had a lit candle and a single rose in a vase. The servers came around often refilling water, which is a MAJOR plus in my book!! The best part- we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering! I couldn't believe it! And it was soooooo good! Their Chicken Tikka Masala is the best I've ever tried! They have three ranges of \"spicy-ness\" which is awesome!! At the end of your meal, they bring warm towels (which I believe, based upon the scent, were soaked in rose water). Such a great experience!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant in the past and the food was great and with a excellent taste,i was a very good food to try,but today I decide to come back again and i order for to go and I do not complain with the taste because still good but when I was eating i found a pubic hair in the rice that was disgusting after Being eating so comfortable ,im really do not want to go back,i think they need to be more stric with the people that are cooking and with those people that are passing the food,in simple words supervising the hygenic in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Every Indian restaurant in Madison, at least as far as I know, has some kind of lunch buffet. Some of them are pretty basic, and others have a lot of variety. Swad gets points from me because they're definitely on the high end of the variety scale. 

I randomly ended up here on a business lunch. I hadn't been to an Indian buffet in a while, but I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of variety and quality of the food. I tried to limit myself to one plate but when everyone else in my group went up for seconds, I had my excuse. Definitely plenty of things to try. Only problem was then I went back to work and wanted to take a nap. 

Since then, I've had Indian buffets back on my radar as lunch options and the several others I've been to haven't quite measured up to Swad. I just make sure to have plenty of caffeine afterwards."}
{"text":"Introducing a six-year-old to Indian food can be challenging. We went with some pretty basic items; naan, chicken tiki masala, chicken biryani, and Lamb seekh kebab..... All done in the mildest spices we could order. It was all we could do to keep our son from eating the food hand over fist. It was a great success, and he has now listed Swad as his new favorite restaurant in the Monona area. The grownups enjoyed dinner as well, although we would have liked to have a little more spice. Didn't want to blow the little ones pants off the first time he had the food. Thank you SWAD excellent as always."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my experience at this Indian restaurant. The location in a strip plaza in the small commercial area along Monona Dr. north of Broadway was easy to find. The storefront was nice enough while the interior was also nicely done. It was pleasant and comfortable with decent capacity.

I was greeted and seated right away and my personable server attended to me quickly. I was actually rather impressed with the enthusiasm behind the service. The menu featured several Indian favorites. I started with tomato soup, which was better than average. I then decided to try the Chicken Tikka Saag, which is something I had not had in a long time. It was quite tasty. It was accompanied by rice and I also ordered ginger naan to go with it. I was quite happy with my meal. My only complaint might be the fact that I ordered a Masala Chai after dinner. It came out quickly and it was obvious at that point that it originated from a pre-mix. The taste reflected that. While not bad, it was very ordinary. I was disappointed that it was not traditionally prepared.

My total bill with tax, tip, food and drink was $31. I was not unhappy with the value this presented. I would definitely try this place again if the opportunity presented itself."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my 2 favorite restaurants in Madison, and Swad is the reason I like Indian food again.  I tried the buffet once, and was hooked!  Now I bring friends, and there is something for everyone.  They do not skimp on the buffet, and everything is fresh, full, and authentic.  I was surprised at my last visit to find a dish offered that had multiple steps, and required directions!  They go all the way on the buffet at Swad!  And try the green stuff in the dessert area.  They offer several desserts, but the green stuff is amazing.  I never have room, but I try to eat some before I leave.  Did I mention they also bring hot garlic naan to your table?  Seriously, bring an appetite!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Indian restaurant in Madison and Wisconsin!! We drive two hours to enjoy regularly!! Wonderful biryanis, tasty lamb and goat curries, kheer, rasam and coconut soup!! Love it all!! The lunch buffet also has great selection of very fresh food!! Everything is flavorful!!"}
{"text":"There is no better Indian food in Madison than Swad. My girlfriend and I love it here and last weekend we went with a group of our friends. We usually just share the chicken tikka masala and lamb biryan, both of which are extremely dope. But with a group of friends we were able to get a few other things, all of which were excellent.

The staff is always very nice and the atmosphere is wonderful for a nice meal."}
{"text":"I had an intense craving for Indian food, so my husband and I went to Swad for dinner. He's a vegetarian and ordered the Egg Masala Dosa--it was huge, and came with two dipping sauces and a small bowl of soup! It was very good, kind of like Indian comfort food (potatoes, egg, crepe). I ordered the Chicken Mughlai--the medium spice was perfect for me. There were several chunks of chicken breasts, and the sauce itself was perfectly spiced. We also ordered the garlic naan because you can't go wrong with that, can you? The service was good, and the restaurant itself is nicely decorated even though it's in a Monona strip mall. Most dinner entrees are $12-16, which seems pretty on par with other Indian restaurants in the area. On previous occasions we've had the buffet, and I thought that it was excellent."}
{"text":"My family loves Indian food. We have experience from Chicago to London and consider SWAD to be the best in the area. It compares well with the better places in Chicago. Try the lamb madras with a side of poori (puff fried bread)  and Raita (cucumber yogurt sauce). Lamb, chicken or beef shahi Korma is excellent. For vegetarians the eggplant dish Bhagwan bartha."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian place! I drive from Milwaukee just to eat here every chance I get. Love it! I also often get free dessert. They treat their customers nice."}
{"text":"Super authentic super spicy! I did use a separate delivery service which may have caused the delay in delivery however it was very good."}
{"text":"Always a five star dining experience. The lunch Buffett is a MUST TRY and an excellent value. There is so much variety! Everything is so fresh and delicious. The food here is truly a revelation. I wish I could eat every meal here. Exaggeration? Haha... Nope! 

And the people are great too. I hope this restaurant stays in Monona forever!!!
:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here and neither of us had ever had Indian food before. We thought this would be a good place to go because of their lunch buffet where we would be able to try multiple items. The place was busy and the fresh naan that was brought to our table was delicious. We however we not very excited about the food. We believe this had nothing to do with them and a lot to do with us just not liking the food. The ice cream they had was good too. I would be open to trying again but we would like to go with someone who has ate Indian food before."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Madison, by far. They have a fabulous and interesting selection of vegetarian entrees. The Paneer Makhani is to die for, and is the Baingan Bharta is also delicious.  I can't believe it took me so long to check this place out. It's divine!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Swad and the food was great! The lunch buffet was delicious and had several good options to pick from. The fresh naan they brought out with the meal was hot and fresh. Our sever was very nice and friendly. 

Im a big fan of Indian food and Swad is, so far, the best I've had in the area. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night. I should say that my experience with Indian food is as an American but one who has had Indian food in London (purportedly the best) and having lived nearly a decade off of Devon Ave in Chicago which is a West Bank neighborhood of halal, Indian and orthodox Jewish cultures. 

Anyway, I know and like Indian food. 

The food from Swad was some of the best I've ever had. The vindaloo sauce is delightfully hot but not overwhelming and not so much it overwhelms the flavor. My wife ordered lamb with a mild sauce of her own and we shared the naan. The garlic naan was a little disappointing-flavor wise and cooked oddly where some parts were burnt and others hadn't seemed to touch a hot surface. But, this is a minor annoyance in the grand scheme of things. 

Other reviews have pointed out the disappointment for cost to quantity ratio. That you are paying a lot for not a ton of food. I agree with those comments. Two dinners plus naan for delivery came to $50. That's a lot by any prior standard in my experience. But, it will not hinder us for ordering again-it was that good. 

Swad is great by any standard of Indian food and certainly the best in the Madison area easily outperforming Swagat."}
{"text":"I am expanding my dining horizons, so tried this Indian restaurant a month ago for the all-you-can-eat buffet.  I was impressed enough to come back (May 15, 2018) for another go round.  

The restaurant is in s strip mall, but only a snob would hold that against the establishment.  The place was clean, with some thought given to the decor.  The staff was friendly, and the service good.

Going through the buffet line, I filled up my plate with both meat and Vegetarian options.

The dishes I REALLY liked were: Chicken Tikka Marsala, Abo-Zuchinni, Dal Taka, Sambar, and Gulab Janum.  The other dishes were also good: Vegetable Noodle, Aloo Pork, Vegetable Briyani, and Gajar Malwa.  

I liked that two types of soup were offered; Coconut (sweet) and Rasam (with some heat).  

I was full by the end of the meal, so only sampled 2 desserts.  Both the Cream Caramel and Mango ice cream were delicious.  

The only fault I can give with the food is the basket of bread that was brought separately to the table to go along with the meal.  Skip this, as it was doughy and tasteless (and probably meant to fill you up so you eat less of the more expensive buffet food).

A last note.  At the end of the buffet line was a wok with a chicken dish.  I arrived at 2:00 PM and by that time all that was left in the wok were some vegetables (no chicken).  Getting there at the more traditional noon hour might mean you'll have to contend with a more crowded room and a line at the buffet table, but you'll have access to everything.

I will go back, as I love a good buffet or smorgasboard."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I had the chicken malai, nan, and pistachio ice cream. My friend had the mixed grill, garlic nan and mango ice cream. Portions were large, my water glass never went empty and everyone serving us was friendly. Can't wait to go back and try their lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food Buffet I have had! Very authentic flavors and the quality of the food feels really homemade and fresh!! The Gajar halwa had dry fruits and was very rich in texture which I have never seen anywhere!!! Must try!! Their food spread is also huge lots of variety! Remember to ask for fresh naan for the Curries and also do try their mango lassi! Love it!"}
{"text":"Indian buffets are where it's at. Swad is especially amazing. I was immediately overwhelmed by the number of options from which to choose. There's also the limitation of how much I can eat without hating myself too much.

I loved the Chicken Tikka Masala. I was also a fan of the crepe roll up thing... I'm not sure what it's called. The assortment of pakoras was good too. I highly recommend the mango ice cream.

The servers will bring out fresh naan, which tastes amazing. They're also really good about taking your plate and refilling your water."}
{"text":"I LOVED my experience at Swad! 

I was looking for something to different to try while in the area and this was exactly what I was looking for. You can find this restaurant off Monona drive in a small strip mall. Look close it isn't hard to miss! As soon as I walked in the front door I was overcome by the great smell of authentic food. The interior is decorated nicely with bright yellow walls. They have a bar area and tables depending on what you are looking for. 

The staff was extremely friendly and prompt with everything, continuously filling up water and checking in. They seems grateful for each and every one of their customers! My waiter was extremely helpful in offering suggestions based on what I was looking for. I started off with an Indian beer, Kingfisher. They offered a variety of bottled beers and wine. When I was ready to order I decided to go with the garlic nan and beef shahi korma curry. They specifically ask how spicy you want the food so it is cooked to your liking (I went with medium). When the food arrived it was fresh and smelled amazing. The curry was served with white rice which complimented it well. It had the perfect amount of spice! The bread was warm and tasted fantastic. The entire combination of all the items I ordered made for a great meal. When I finished the waiter brought a warm towel to my table, which was a cherry on top. 

I have nothing bad to say about Swad. I will definitely be returning when I am back in the area!"}
{"text":"Swad has an impressive array of dishes for their lunch buffet, easily one of the biggest collections I've seen in town.  I really liked that aspect and would like to come back to sample more from that fact alone.  It's definitely the most next to Swagat that I've seen in Madison and I've been to a handful of Indian restaurants in town.

Food was great, they have a nice selection of pakora, multiple kinds of samosas, and a tasty Mango Lassi.  Price was around $10-12 for the buffet and there were a decent amount of people there when we arrived which was right as they opened.  Overall the food didn't blow me away compared to some of the other spots I've been, but variety is key at the buffets and myself and my companions walked away pleased.

Service was friendly.  Atmosphere was a strip mall with a basic interior.  Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area as you're bound to hit a plate you haven't had before."}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet Review:

When we noticed five cars in the parking lot waiting for the doors to open for lunch, we knew we were in for a treat.  Simply amazing and a solid 5 star Indian Buffet.  One of the widest selections of foods we've ever seen.  Each one of their dishes were unique and well spiced.  Typically we can pick one or two things from buffets as our favorites, but we loved everything here.  From appetizers, to main courses, to dips, to desserts; you will enjoy them all.

On top of amazing food, the restaurant is immaculately cleaned, staffed with friendly/professional waiters, and the prices are extremely fair (Only $10.50 with tax per buffet).  They even bring fresh, hot Naan to each table."}
{"text":"Yay for Indian food in Monona! Lunch buffet highlights - the catfish and the sesame chicken. Hubby and brother joined me and I think each made three trips through the line. 
A variety of dishes, table served naan bread and mango ice cream... Of course buffet is the way to go. The space is new and clean, service quick and attentive, buffet diverse and fresh. We will return."}
{"text":"Went tonight for dinner. Oh wow was this good. Our favorite of the dishes we tried was the bhindi masala. And they make a mean salted lassi. We will for sure go back."}
{"text":"I lived in India the first 30 years of my life. So when I say this place has AWESOME Indian food I don't say it lightly. 

I first came in for a weekend brunch. It was amazing. They had close to 30 items in the buffet. It was so good that I came in again the next day. The weekday lunch buffet is a little cheaper but was also a little smaller since they don't give pani Puri (small fried dumpling like items that you fill with water) and pav bhaji (a type of bread and mixed veg gravy) on weekdays. 

Of the 30 items I would say there were about 3 or 4 that I felt didn't do justice to the original food. The remaining were all good. I visited dhaba and maharani on my trip to Madison and would say these guys win hands down. Dhaba would come in second and maharani a close third. 

There is an ala-carte menu too in case you are scared of over eating."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go dinner from here last week. The taste was great! Service was good. We ordered cut mirchi - which was okay, chicken Manchuria which my friend loved, kadai paneer which was yummm, veg biryani which was also good but I asked him to make it medium spicy and it peaked to super spicy for my spice levels (though being an Indian!) and chicken biryani which again my friend loved. 
A good place on the whole. It's a tad bit expensive but good for once in a while.

4 stars for the food.
3 for the price


And they gave us free gulab jamun (which tasted meh... But who cares it's free!)"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and the food and service was great. It is close to our new house so this will be our new Indian Restaurant. I am sure we will frequent it a lot. We are excited to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"My second visit to SWAD after a year I guess. My first experience was not good so I decided not to visit this place anymore but after a year I thought I should try one more time and see if anything has changed. (specific to Buffet) 

1. Nice and clean, a good place to dine in. 
2.Different varieties, more in Non-Veg.( have not tried any)
3. Humble staff.
4. Curries were tasteless. I tried Malai Kofta, Bhindi    Masala, both are my favorites but did not like it.
Did not like Samosa and noodles because they were not hot/warm enough to enjoy. Their Dal Makhani was okay but not the best. 
5. I would not recommend  their \" Gulab jamun', \" Gajar ka halwa\" for dessert. 
So, my overall experience was the same as before, not in the list of my favorites."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is the way to go. Lots of options, and only $10 each. 
The lamb was the best thing on the buffet. The chutneys are all quite good.  The ice cream with exotic spices is excellent. The mango ice cream is yummy too."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've ever had. My wife and I were staying in Madison for a day or two and were looking for a quick bite and we were blown away. The service, the decor, and the food were spot on. We ordered samosa, the Mughlai curry (chicken curry with mushrooms) with rice, an order of ginger naan, and a salad. To start, the waiter brought out three chutneys with some crunchy chip like things. Each chutney was amazing. A green minty one, a tomato-y one, and a black sauce. Then came the samosa which were crispy and piping hot. The curry chicken (with cream) was the star of the meal alongside the tasty ginger naan. It was so rich, delicious and thick. I'm so used to the water curries of Banglatown, that I forgot what a good curry SHOULD BE. 

If you are ever in Madison, go to Swad. Be amazed. Eat well. Go again. I will be back soon!

This restaurant appears to be run by Nepalis, so they do have some Nepali dishes too like Momos. We will come back and try those dishes as well."}
{"text":"Average Indian lunch buffet. We went on a Saturday , and there were fair number of choices, but many of them were not Vegetarian, or were not classic dishes and just seemed like something they threw together with the leftover ingredients they had from throughout the week. Dessert options weren't exceptionally tasty either, though not bad. Didn't seem like the flavors were that developed, and they used heavy-handed spice to make up for it (and we like spice)."}
