{"text":"I think this is one of the best Chinese astablishment in Arizona. I will be eating there until I find something better."}
{"text":"I love this place. It beats Li's and Panda Express hands down. They are always friendly, the food is always fresh, and if they haven't made something I love they whip it right up for me. They also have a fantastic Tofu Kung Pao that you can order ahead and pick up that is delicious! And the portion sizes for their combos are huge. Also the soup is an incredible deal and the Hot and Sour is always spot on!"}
{"text":"First time ordering online with yelp/ Red Dragon had the order correct and on time. The food was great!!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Chinese food I have had in a long time I would recommend this place to anyone very large portions for a very reasonable price I had the Kung pao shrimp at it was awesome   Also great customer service  very polite personally loved it and the food doesn't take 30min like some places"}
{"text":"This place used to be really good now it's overpriced and tastes very mediocre there's nothing that you can't get for cheaper that is a whole lot better right up the street I would suggest not going here unless you have a fat wallet and like a lot of breaded things I will never go here again. $30 for a lot of breaded chicken and porkin 2 egg rolls not cool good luck"}
{"text":"Really, really good hot and sour soup!  Friendliest cook and counter lady, like, ever! You can get a feast for three for $20. The vegetables are perfectly cooked. The rice noodles are also well done here.  The place is great for take-out but there is an ample seating area and tv. It is modern, light and airy and very clean!"}
{"text":"This place always has fresh food. They give genousous portions. Been coming here for 5 years and never been disappointed. They always have friendly staff as well. This is the go to place for sure, if you want authenticity otherwise,  go to panda."}
{"text":"If McDonald's made Chinese food it would taste like this. The price is higher than average, which just adds to the disappointment."}
{"text":"We read all the reviews before going to this place and we were leery of trying it. Being a native New Yorker I'm VERY picky about my Chinese food. I've lived in Arizona for almost 22 years and haven't found any really good Chinese yet. That said, we tried Red Dragon Express tonight and were pleasantly surprised. I think the key here is to NOT order off the buffet but to order items that are cooked fresh. The restaurant is a little \"hole in the wall take out joint\" similar to Panda Express at first glance. There are items on a buffet line that you can order, but honestly, most of them looked like they'd been sitting there for ages and it was a turn off. I stuck with a few items that I read were good in the reviews...terriyaki chicken wings, won ton soup, hot & sour soup, house chow mein and a one item combo of orange chicken. The one item combo had a LOT of food in it. They heap on the rice and noodles and it had a lot of orange chicken, so much so that my fiancee couldn't finish it and he'll be having it for dinner tomorrow night. He enjoyed both items. The orange chicken had just come out hot and fresh. The hot and sour soup was very spicy but good and tasty. The won ton soup was actually some of the best I've ever had in Arizona. They actually made it fresh and it had very large won tons and fresh carrots and broccoli in it. It was a little on the salty side, so if you're on a low sodium diet like I am, this might not be the best choice for you, but it really is delicious.  The house special \"chow mein\" is really \"lo mein\" by New York standards....the soft noodles with onions in them, plus added shrimp, beef and chicken. They give you a LOT and it's freshly made and very tasty. I have enough left over for another three meals.  The terriyaki chicken wings were good, but a little rubbery and overcooked. Better over cooked then under cooked though. The terriyaki sauce is very sweet and sticky and it's a very thin sauce, not thick and goopy, but I enjoyed it, although it was a little sweet for my tastes. So over all we really did like the food and will go back, but definitely order the food fresh and cooked to order. It's definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We eat here regularly for two reasons:  1. Flavor and quality of the food is consistently amazing.  2. Value for price.  Each container of food (combo plate with chow mein and 2 entrees) usually weighs a couple of pounds. NO JOKE. We usually get one plate to feed 3 people and there are always leftovers!  The staff here are always friendly and treat our 4 year old daughter like she is a special guest. I really appreciate when staff take the time to acknowledge children and make them feel special.  I would recommend this place over Panda Express all day everyday."}
{"text":"I Love this Place! I'm a picky motherfucker! And red dragon is the Shittttttttt.... Keep up the good work....."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Matter a fact, best Chinese food so far... It may look empty store, but the food is the bomb. Real chicken  and rice is yummy. Def gonna next time and next time"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I have being going there since they opened.  I love everthing on the menu.  I am on the HCG diet and I go in everyday and buy the barbecue chicken and the fresh veggies.  It has helped with my diet.  I don't have to cook and it works.  I love the taste of the BQ Chicken, it's grilled fresh and the veggies are always so fresh.  When I am on my normal eating pattern, I call in special orders, for example Wonton Soup with out salt.  The house fried rice is so good, they put big shrimp into the mix.  Oh, my nephews just loves the orange chicken.  But don't let me forget to tell you about the staff.  The cooks are so friendly and get right on your special order.  And the cashiers are very nice and helpful.  I recommond the Red Dragon Express to anyone.  I don't like Panda Express because their food just doesen't taste right."}
{"text":"Better than expected. Did not feel rushed or that the workers were rude. Only down is there's Spanish on the tv lol but I did enjoy watching it."}
{"text":"We are have been going there since they first opened. We like the food and the service is good. Better portions than Panda. Support local businesses."}
{"text":"Fast, average, cheap, but somewhat bland food.  Portion sizes are generous, but the food has very little taste. This area of town has little in the way of choices for Chinese food, so it is better than nothing.  But as other reviewers have mentioned, it is only slightly better than Panda Express."}
{"text":"Being a single man that lives alone, I'm always looking for good restaurant near me In Laveen, AZ.  I use my yelp app to look for locations near me. I came across this place. The majority ads were very negative, but I thought give them a chance. Unfortunately I should've paid attention to the other review. I will not say the food was disgusting, but it was not very good whatsoever. I ordered the house egg for young (sp) with an order of fried rice. That egg foo Young was soaking with the oil it was prepared with. The rice in the fried rice was burnt.   People, I would just say read the reviews first.   Blessings."}
{"text":"I tried this place yesterday since i was in the area and in the mood for Chinese. The girl behind the counter was very nice.. The Kung Pao chicken looked good but it was just meh when I tasted it, The hot and sour soup was ok but nothing special. This place is not bad but I doubt I will go here again and would not recommend it, Like someone else said i should have checked Yelp first before following impulse to try something new,"}
{"text":"This place is barely a step above Panda Express. Actually, it's worse I think. Unless you order something special the food is prepared ahead of time and sitting on a steam table. Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"A family favorite! Panda Express is not even close. Huge portion sizes. Orange Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Beef Broccoli all are amazing!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Eat24 and the food was ready when I got there, no waiting. The fried rice was the best! The sesame chicken was a little dry but still yummy. Very nice employees. Will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The Chow mien noodles were stuck together, the chips they give you with your soup tasted like straight oil, the won ton had no flavor, the broth is like water. I went once and will not return. Go to Li's bowl on 35th ave instead."}
{"text":"Yes I got to stop coming by here each and every time it's something different and new this place is a Haven secret Haven in the corner of an oasis.  Lunch specials dinner specials in the abundance of food that they provide to you for the cause is unbelievable you have to get out and try this place red dragon is awesome the service is great they do have a little limited area for you to sit but this is more of a carry-out Order ahead also is what you can do the menu is expensive just not based on what you see in the buffet line.   you have to give them a try as many times as possible go ahead and support them this is places you have to give them a try as many times as possible go ahead and support them."}
{"text":"I kept passing this place up, but finally decided to stop by. I'm so glad I did. The food was amazing!!! I ordered it here on Yelp, and within 15 mins the food was ready. The service is great, the proportions were huge, and the price can't be beat. I would have taken a pic of all the food we bought, but couldn't wait to dig in. I'll definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"If I could give 4.5 stars I would. The food is really good, they are always bringing out fresh food and swapping the trays every time I order and tossing the old one (which usually doesn't have too much left anyway). The rice noodles are more spicy then I'm used to, but they are still good. The atmosphere itself is what you would expect from a small fast food Chinese place, in a Plaza, next to a grocery store, but the food is better than expected. Our family has tried so many Chinese places, and I have a slight allergy to msg but love Chinese food so it's hard to find one I can eat and not get sick, but this one seems to do well with my body. I haven't gotten sick as of yet, and the lady in the front tells me they don't use mass amounts of msg like other places. When we first moved here, I called about 10 Chinese places and almost all told me they use a lot of msg in there food. :/ In conclusion, my advice is to definitely try this place. You might be as surprised as I was, and make it your new go-to Chinese spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some lunch with my son. We ordered Singapore noodle w/ shrimp. BBQ chicken and fried rice and the shrimp fried rice spicy. First- the wait was just too long. Non orders ahead of us, the cooks were like watching paint dry. Unacceptable when a spot is EMPTY. Second- none of the food we ordered impressed me at all. For what I ordered plus two can soda the order was damn near $30. Too expensive for a hood take out restaurant. Lastly- when you order something \"spicy\" you should get just that. Not the chili oil put in a container on the side. I didn't order \"spicy on thya side\". I ordered spicy shrimp fried rice five and spicy Singapore noodles\". This makes me so mad. Especially considering the food was so expensive. And no damn ice. Never again. I only come to part of town to go to the hair supply store. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. This place is most of all too expensive for food that's not worth it. Check out my pictures. See any shrimp"}
{"text":"Mmmmm orange chicken...I like this place...best chinese in Laveen...although it doesn't have much competition so that's not saying much...red dragon over li s bowl and panda any day in my opinion....price for amount of food you get is great..if you think you get small quantity here them I'm sorry...you may be a fat ass. :)  That all being said, it wouldent take much for another chinese resturant to come along and dethrone Red Dragon....because while it isent bad....its not amazing either."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for fast-food Chinese. They have good and cheap hot and sour soup that I always get. Get here when the food is fresh and it's awesome! Inexpensive prices and very friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"I was staying with my family who live in Laveen and they kept raving about this place, so I decided to give it a try. Now, I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't try any meat. Their veggies were so yummy, but the star of the show was the Singapore noodles!!! I'm searched high and low in my area and there isn't anything like it. They are so flavorful!! Red Dragon will be a must ea h and every time I'm in Laveen!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but hubby got Quart of house fried rice I ask for soy & duck sauce & they gave him 2 of each????? He wanted red sauce for his crab ragoons & they gave him about 1/2 a little cup. It was reasonable price but they charge enough to give you some sauce.. chinise take out without sauce is not chinise take out.  Won't be going back I can get all the sauce I want at the one by wal mart."}
{"text":"And the one star is only because there is no option for a half star. Our food was gross. It all had such an oily flavor to it. As of they just let it all sit in the oil and soak it all up. Our egg rolls were so greasy and way too crunchy from being over cooked and there was very little vegetables and chicken in them. Crab puffs were exactly the same and so was the shrimp tempura. My husband's beef and broccoli was drenched in too much sauce, sweet and sour sauce on his sweet and sour pork tasted like straight vinegar with sugar. We couldn't even finish our food it was so bad. Makes me angry as we spent over $30 for our food. What a waste of money and time. I called the restaurant to let them know and some young girl answered the phone. She had an attitude and told me \"well we haven't had any other complaints, maybe you are just too picky\". Are you serious little girl, what kind of customer service is that and why is she answering the phone if she had that attitude. I asked to leave a message for the Manager and for her name.? She then proceeded to tell me \"it is really busy right now, I can't stop to take a message you will have to just come in Monday when we open\" then she hung up on me. So not only was the food greasy, over fried/cooked but the customer service was even worse."}
{"text":"Good Chinese take out is hit or miss in the valley. When my squad hipped me to this place I took my time and casually checked it out. Let me tell you it was love at first bite. I'm here weekly and even got my kids to turn away from their Panda Express loving ways and follow a path to Red Dragon.  First of all, it's affordable. A family of five can't eat at McDonald's for $30 these days. For $35 my family is full, satisfied, with left overs... I get the house chow Mein and have dinner and lunch for a few days! The food is fresh, full of flavor, and delicious. Second of all, the food is consistent. Whether it's 20 minutes to close on a Wednesday, Noon Friday, 3:15pm on a Monday the food tastes the same every time.  Third, I can order online because I'm about 10 minutes out, pay with Apple Pay, scoop my food and high-tail it back to the crib, quickly. I'm not singing, I'm screaming the praises of THIS place!"}
{"text":"Webster's defines 'Dynamic' as a process or system that is always changing. Well if that's the case, this place is dynamic as all fuck.  Our office staff eats lunch here often, so it's not unusual for me to throw-in my order once or twice a month. Here's the weird part:  I always order the same thing, yet I've had it served up about 31 different ways.  These guys are the Baskin & Robbins of Chinese food!  Don't get me wrong - the food is good and tasty, it's just never the same.  If you don't mind getting Forrest Gump'd for lunch, this place is all you because I can pretty much guarantee you never know what you're gonna get here."}
{"text":"Was expecting better  We were looking for a quick bite to eat and decided to stop in at Red Dragon Express Chinese Restaurant. The staff at Little Dragon weren't very friendly (At least our server wasn't) however, it seemed to be a very popular spot with the locals.  On this visit we ordered  Chow Mein, Fried Rice,and, Orange Chicken.  We were disappointed with both entrée's. The seasoning level was non-existent and the chicken was dry and very overcooked. Next we tried the Chow Mein noodles and Fried Rice, once again very disappointed in the flavor. Our meals just weren't very good. The noodles were extremely greasy and the rice was mushy and flavorless.  I love Chinese food however, I would not recommend Dragon Express based on what we ordered. But since there is a big selection on the menu, maybe the other entrée's  are better tasting."}
{"text":"After a full day of running errands with my family in the scolding Arizona heat, we all were very hungry, didn't know what to eat but since we were in the area and passed by this restaurant a few times prior, we all wanted to see what Red Dragon Express had to offer. Shortly after arriving home, it was time to relax, turn on the television and chow down, right?! That would be the last time we would ever step foot there!!! Just recently moving from the Bay Area, anyone who knows anything about San Francisco knows that the Chinese food up there is bomb diggity!! This was one of the worse and lasts time that we will eat Chinese food from Red Dragon Express. My order was completely wrong, egg rolls were hard and stale, family barely ate their food, unappetizing, gross!!! We ended up ordering take out from Chipotle that evening. Don't say that I didn't WARN you...Eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I normally dislike fast food like this, and was worried that it would be like Panda express... which I dislike. Red dragon was actually delectable! I love their chicken and their noodles. I love this place for a fast easy meal.  I recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Please listen to the reviews. This place is terrible, I ordered the chicken with vegetables w a side of fries rice. The chicken is boiled to the point where it's rubbery and the vegetables definitely came out of a freezer. Not only that the rice was dry too. Smh Laveen, we can do better than this!"}
{"text":"Red Dragon Express   There name says it all they are express, BUT there food is GREAT! My favorite are there soups house noodle soup is amazing.  I like that they offer a \"Panda Express\" option and they offer a to go menu where they have Soups & Fried Rice . On my most recent visit I tried there Singapore Noodles very delicious and different option to a traditional lo Mein. I'm Glad there in Laveen."}
{"text":"Should have checked yelp before I stopped in.  The food looked edible enough from the outside.  I ordered a Kung Pao chicken from the rude staff.  Got it home, opened it up, and the smell was off and the chicken did not even look right.  I took one bite and had to immediately spit it back into the box, tasted almost rancid.  I am SURE I would have been sick had I actually consumed any of the food!!!!  Panda Express across the street seems like high end gourmet compared to this dump!  Avoid at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst chinese I've had in years. Sweet and sour had almost no sauce, and the kung pao chicken tasted like beef stew, not spicy at all. Not worth half what I paid."}
{"text":"overall, pretty darn good.  i was weary of going down the street to try this for the first time, given the hot & cold reviews on here, but i'm glad i went.  food was not too greasy (as panda express tends to be).   i had the sesame chicken and black pepper chicken which both were awsome! noodles were a bit heavy so get the cabbage if you're trying to eat healthier.  i will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has two stars. Red dragon blows panda out of the water.  This was my first time eating here, referal from a friend. I had the sesame chicken and kung pow chicken. Cooked very well and had great flavor.  Friendly staff that was actually oriental not kids from the neighborhood cooking. I will be back and will recommend."}
{"text":"Two words: Not poisonous. Some of the worst Chinese food my wife & I have ever tasted. We had hot & sour soup, won ton soup, and pork chop suey. All of which were bland and tasteless. The young lady and her daughter who served behind the counter were nice people but to their credit, they weren't doing the cooking. If you need Chinese food, find another place. B$"}
{"text":"Staff in this place are very RUDE and make you feel rushed! The food is NOT that great and they give you waay to much food on your plate."}
{"text":"My mom really likes this place. My friends like to eat there but not take food to go. I have only eaten here once and it was average."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant few times when I visit my friend in south mountain. They have pretty good food, even my son loves their orange chicken."}
{"text":"I love their rice, it's one of the best one I have tried. There prices are good too you get a lot of food for it."}
{"text":"Wow. Never experienced such a long wait time. Took over 20 minutes to get two simple combo meals. Counter staff said there was a barrage of special and large orders. The cooks were cooking and cooking but didn't see much food being brought to the hot bar. Just an off night, I guess."}
{"text":"Rice noodles is good! Its not dry!  Orange chicken also great!!!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and we wanted to try this place out being that it's the closest Chinese take out near us, staff was really nice and gave us good portion sizes but the flavor was bland, and the food was cold. The server mixed mine and my wife's entrees up and we had to swap it out once we got home. The Orange chicken was pretty bad and a lot of the entree trays were empty so it was hard to see what they had available. I wouldn't say that I won't be back, but it will probably be a while until I will give this place another try or I see another review stating a better experience."}
{"text":"Went there last Thursday for take out. Got 2 of the 2 entree meals. Was impressed because the lady serving the food packed the to go tray FULL...top and bottom. I was able to get food for my wife and I for under $15 which was all I had. Loved the food. Ate more than I should have...but was worth it! I got the sesame chicken and the bbq chicken! Wonderful! Wife got 2 servings of beef and broccoli. For us, its close, its GREAT, and it is budget friendly. I'm all about getting the most food for the minimal cost, and it has me wondering why I still pay $5+ for 1 burrito when you get a few pounds of food for about $7. Love the food! Thanks Red Dragon Express! You'll see us soon!"}
{"text":"Looooove the eggrolls!! Best in the valley!! House fried rice is bomb, noodles are kinda bland. Great prices tho! I rarely eat any of the food under the lamps so i cant comment there. Always friendly, fast and busy!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place has the worst Chinese food I have ever had in my life, no exaggeration. When first trying this place it was decent yet still below par, and now its been consistently getting worse. The food lacks flavor and complexity that you would find in asian food. I have tried to give this place numerous tries because it had potential at the beginning, but after the 4th time I give up!  My most recent stop, I found a ton of black specks all over my Singapore noodles which most likely resulted from the cook scratching the wok way too hard. These people can't cook! Unpleasant, waste of my money and time. This place is not a legit Chinese restaurant and so far from it!! You are better off getting panda express which is just across the street."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years great customer service and generous portions for good prices it's tasty but not omg slap your mother tasty. It will get you by all day on a lazy Sunday as one to go plate will last you all day. It's family owned so that's nice. They definitely have me and family as a regular here no complaints here."}
{"text":"Its OK, nothing special better than some other mom and pop places to eat. I would like to see more variety of food. I think Panda Express is a better quality, however if you want quick, nearby 51st Ave location, then I would prefer this based soley on location."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Red Dragon Express after driving by. First impressions: Nice inside, clean, reminds you of a Panda Express by the way it's set up and the staff was pleasant.   The food looked delicious but didn't have much flavor. The portions were HUGE. For a decent price I was more than full with some to take home. The portions were full of fresh stir fry veggies and tons of protein. If you want a quick decent meal check this place out.   The bathrooms were covered in graffiti but they were clean, it is Laveen...it's not the restaurants fault some customers don't respect property."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst chinese food experiences I've had. The chicken had a stange consistency to it and the noodles tasted like they had been sitting all day. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love shrimp so when I went to Red Dragon Express I ordered the shrimp lo mein. I was very hungry and they have large portions however when I got to actually eating the food my lo mein noodles tasted like clay but the shrimp was very tasty and my husband loved the chicken fried rice"}
{"text":"It was alright. If you need something quick and close it will do in a pinch. Agree with others that the lack of sauce is disappointing. Egg roll was like any other. Nothing too special. The steamed veggies were pretty fresh and crisp so that was a plus."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved into the neighborhood, not far from this restaurant.  The week we moved in, we took his parents to try this place in hopes of it being a new favorite Chinese food place.  It was a complete waste of money and a total disappointment.  The layout is similar to that of Panda Express, but the food is far from edible.  The portions ARE big, I'll give them that, but they have to make up for the lack of taste somewhere.  We all felt sick after eating there and we'll never go back."}
{"text":"I normally give places 2 chances before they are written off.  This time, one was all it took.  If a year from now they hang a new \"Under new ownership\" sign out front, I might give it a second try, but not before then.    They are trying to be Panda Express and they are failing miserably.  Really really miserably.  Overpriced for what you get, and what you get isn't good at all.  And while I'm not saying everyone will feel this way, we both felt a bit icky about 20 minutes later.    Really want some fast Asian in the area?  Try the Panda Express down the road."}
{"text":"It started from a crave for some Chinese food, so I went to \"Red Dragon\" (because it reminded me of Rush Hour) it was delicious! I think the hot & sour soup could get better, but overall it was yummy! But don't take my word from it, go try it out!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this place, less than a minute down the street from home! Because I'm not a big panda express fan, but I love Chinese food. Sadly, I was disappointed.   The orange chicken was very stringy and tasteless. The sweet and sour sauce was runny and mostly sour. The wontons were the only decent thing we ate there.   If you want good, cheap chinese avoid this place and try Li's Bowl on 35th ave."}
