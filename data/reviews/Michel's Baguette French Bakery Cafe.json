{"text":"Ugh, I can't help myself; I keep coming back for more. The pastries are just too good to resist. Hands down, the best I've had! Especially the butter croissants: Flaky, buttery and always fresh. The friendly staff and clean environment helps as well... They've got a loyal customer in me."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years and it never fails to meet my expectations.  Getting a chocolate croissant and coffee here is my morning ritual.  Great service!"}
{"text":"The Yorkdale location is better than this location at Fairview Mall. This location is slow and they also stopped serving German Chocolate Cake coffee (i.e. what is there to live for?)"}
{"text":"Love the chocolate almond croissant! It was nice, warm and flaky. Delicious. My go-to place when I'm in the area... Great place to grab a coffee and pastry before shopping.  Staff is helpful and friendly too. Service was quick."}
{"text":"Amazing croissants, great coffee, and friendly staff. My new morning spot anytime I'm in the area.  Try the chocolate croissant, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'll be quick...  -Omelet w/ham 4/10  tasted microwaved, not many choices for toppings, couldn't substitute the bun with something else  -Chicken Noodle Soup 7/10  Average, tasted out of a can  -Turkey Bacon Wrap 2/10 Horrible, if I wasn't as hungry as I was I would of givien it 0/10. Tasted like it was made last week, with way too much lettuce!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I come by a several times a week before and after work. I'll grab a coffee with a pastry or have a grilled sandwich with their soup or salad, or sometimes a slice of cake to go.  I like that their food is always fresh, you can definitely taste the quality of ingredients.  I recently tried their new croissantwich and it is amazing.  It has eggs, bacon, sautéed onions, arugula and mango chutney. They customize your breakfast croissants any way you like.   I also love their sweet pastries, as mentioned many times in the reviews here, the chocolate almond is a must have."}
{"text":"Found this gem while doing some major damage shopping, nice bakery away from the crazy food court. The blueberry cheese danish was really tasty paired with a latte is perfection. Service was attentive and quick. Liked the ambiance of the bakery."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This cafe is amazing. This is close to where we live and we visit them at least 2-3 times a month. They have very nice soups and salads. It's self-service restaurant, great for lunch and it's always full. Their cakes, desserts, pastries, croissants everything is first rate. My favorites are Wicked Thai chicken soup, Grilled Cajun chicken sandwich and all of their cake slices.  In the evenings sometimes they have buy 1 get 1 on croissants, bread which is great because they don't keep anything for the next day. You always get freshly baked goods. I wish they had some sort of loyalty program. :)"}
{"text":"The only place where I can find blueberry cheese danishes in the area! The only other vendor I get them from is C'est Si Bon Patisserie, but they don't include cheese in their danishes sadly.   So literally every time I'm here, it is a must to pick up some danishes. A pack of 6 is $16+ I forget the change.   The staff are always friendly, attentive, nice, and helpful! They always are in a positive mood =) this assures me coming back for their business every time. I hope they know that people like me appreciate them being around and baking their goods fresh, every day!"}
{"text":"My family and myself have been coming to this spot for years till we moved but we revived the tradition of late and the food is still awesome at this location.  Coffees, Pastries, Breads, Sandwiches are always fresh and delicious. They revamped the dining area and now there is way more room to accommodate more customers also it is not as cramped as before. The staff is very friendly and helpful especially to their older/elder customers that frequent here.   Always will be a long time patron of this particular Baguette."}
{"text":"The almond croissant I purchased here was the best croissant I have ever had; it was also the best pastry I have ever had. It was as though I had stepped into a bakery in Paris straight from the streets of Toronto. Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, highly recommend the plain cheese danish."}
{"text":"I just had this power pretzel and I want to tell you how great it tasted! It had a soft flakey pastry, similar to a croissant and had toppings on it. (spinich or kale?, cherry tomatoes, caramelized onions, cheese, and a strip of bacon.)  The lady at the front warmed it up for me. It was delicious. I really enjoyed it. Definitely a great snack for breakfast or anytime."}
{"text":"What!!!!   That coffee is fantastic!    The baked goods at this location are amazing. Butter croissants that you can tell are made with real butter, not that gross vegetable shortening.  My danish was delicious and I blew my diet for second and thirds.   I was in early in the morning and watch the staff, who were all very particular about cleanliness and hand washing.  Unlike other mall spots, this place serves real food for real good prices.     5 stars all day!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh foods and pastries matched with their impeccable service.  Great \"go-to\" spot."}
{"text":"Oh Michele's baguette.  Just thinking of their spinach and feta croissants make my mouth water, they are that good. Also love their German chocolate cake coffee - OMG.  This place is perfect for me for a \"once in a while\" treat. The one star deduction comes from the pricey-ness - my medium coffee and croissant were $6.15 after tax.  They have a very nice space at this location, lots of seating and natural light. The staff are also very kind, especially to their regulars.  All in all a nice place to grab a coffee and a treat!"}
{"text":"Amazing ambience. Amazing cakes from la rocha. Great place to meet a client or a friend."}
{"text":"The croissants are the best...THE BEST. Chocolate is good but almond is amazing. I've also ordered breakfast sandwiches here too which were pretty good as well.   Haven't tried the other items on the menu but I will eventually and ill update my review"}
{"text":"Food and pastries are always fresh and tasty. The staff are super friendly and helpful.  If you visit this place, you have to try their chocolate almond croissant and almond croissants.  I highly recommend trying their soups as well."}
{"text":"Mushroom Soup + Brie & Pear Panini combo FTW!  Hits the spot in a very good way.  Lots of seating. Easily accessible within the mall & from the exterior. Healthy options... especially compared to Cinnabun across the hall."}
{"text":"Stayed in New York for a week.  And multiple mornings I went to this Café and grabbed myself a soup and garlic croissant.  Simply delicious.  Try the garlic croissant, so unique and sweet!  A happy customer from Toronto!"}
{"text":"Food was decent and staff were nice. Unfortunately the manager was repulsive. We ordered two meals for the adults and then had our own food for our 1 year old (bread, fruit, yogurt, milk) and the man told us we were not allowed outside food. Seriously?  Absolute jack@$$"}
{"text":"Let's just say I eat this stuff like it's crack. It's so addicting. I've been eating this strawberry cheese danish every single day for the last 3 weeks. And occasionally with their hot chocolate with whipped cream.   When I mentioned that the sugar twist wasn't up to par with a different location's, I was offered another chance to try it again. When I reached the store, it was their last one of the day (which I usually don't see quite often at this location) but I understood why. Although it was already 6pm, the sugar twist was still fairly soft and fluffy. I was satisfied.  The texture of the danish is soft but crispy and the cheese with the fresh strawberries... oh my lord! The price is obviously $1-$1.50 more expensive then Tims but you get what you pay for! Tims danish taste like artificial flavours because it IS artificial... (hence the price) but it is what it is!   The Italian wedding soup has a very nice flavour and portions are good. The soup is Just a little thick for my liking though. I like soup that's a little more watery. Personal preference though."}
{"text":"The best breakfast ever, fresh breakfast, fresh fruits, the dessert was amazing, this area made my day, I went there for breakfast in the morning around 8am, the staff were nice and friendly, great costumer service, nice attitude, delicious food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My favourite thing to get here is their original bagel (sesame) toasted with butter and topped with their chicken salad (it's sooo good!), lettuce, extra onions, mayonnaise, tomatoes, cucumber, and cheese. Pickles and orange slices on the side. Not on the cheap side, very expensive but that's also cause it's in a mall. $9 around there for the bagel but it's the best chicken salad I've had."}
{"text":"Pros: Items are well made and fresh  Cons: A little on the pricey side  If you've ever been to a Michel's Baguette location before, you know what to expect.  Well made pastries and other items made well and fresh.  This location upholds the tradition.    In the past, I used to go to the Michel's whenever I was at Yorkdale.  However, going to Yorkdale nowadays is just not worth it if you ask me.  It was nice to see this location pop up at Fairview mall.  It's not as big as the one at Yorkdale, but it's definitely much quieter and more enjoyable because of that if you ask me.  I can sit back, relax and have a nice conversation with someone here without much noise interfering with that.    Michel's has a variety of freshly baked goods available right at the front.  If you move further in, there's a counter that makes fresh breakfast items and sandwiches/wraps as well.  I've been here twice for breakfast so for now I can only comment on the pastries and breakfast items.  The croissants here are pretty good,  Crispy on the outside, buttery good on the inside.  I've gotten the bagelwich breakfast sandwich every time and I love it here.  They're always made fresh to order.  I like how after you order, you just pick a seat and they bring everything to you after it's done.  They also clear the table for you.  You just leave everything on the table and they take care of it for you.  Service here is very good.  I've not had a bad experience whatsoever yet.    My bagelwich and a large milk will set you back about $8.  It's not horrible, but it could be better as well.  Expect to pay a little premium when you come into a place like this.  Like I said, it's not overboard and in most cases worth the little extra.  All in all, I really like this place.  Anytime I'm at Fairview, most likely I will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"I truly had no idea that there were so many Michel's Baguettes in Toronto, I just learned that upon searching this place to review. Interesting.   Anyways, I am reviewing this as a sandwich shop/cafe. This is not a full French bakery as the name implies. If you show up expecting a bakery, you might be disappointed.   Think of this as the fancier version of a Tim Horton's lunch. They serve your basic sandwiches, a variety of salads, and a good selection of soups. You go through, cafeteria style, pay for your food and seat yourself. The bread is very fresh, as well as the salads. In my experience, the soups were kind of watery and not so appealing.   They have a really good special, not sure if its all day or just lunch - but pick a small sandwich, a drink, and garden salad or soup for $6. Not bad. They will probably let you sub for a fancier salad for an extra dollar or two.   If I am shopping at Fairview Mall, I will come here to eat instead of the food court. Healthier, more food for your dollar, and a much quieter, friendlier atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat at Fairview because it's decent value, the food is fresh, and it's usually nice and quiet. Also - it's just beside the parking lot but accessible from inside the mall (unlike Spring Rolls). Bonus.   Menu selection is limited to soup, sandwiches, salads, and desserts (possibly also breakfast), but everything I've ever ordered here has been good. I love the tomato bisque soup! This place isn't fancy, but it's a wonderful alternative to the din of the food court."}
{"text":"Wonderful option when looking for coffees and sweets.   Sandwiches here also....but who needs that when you can get Butterscotch Almond cookies and Chocolate Almond Croissants!   Yummy"}
{"text":"Can't complain you walk in and it smells delicious. I always do take out and the client service is always amazing. I like that you're able to sit down and enjoy a meal or pick up or take to go. One of my go to things to get would be the ham and cheese croissant! Delicious every time!!!   Originally I would come because my mom really loves their cherry cheese danish so I would always pick some up for her whenever I'm in the area. So close to work. THIS is why I can't lose weight"}
{"text":"The pastries are yummy here, the only thing is that it's a bit pricey. I really like their Danishes, my husband and I get one every time we go to Fairview mall.   Haven't tried their other food yet but things always look yummy and smells delicious. My favourite is their blueberry Danish and cheese Danish. Hubby likes the apple Danish, they have all different kinds!"}
{"text":"Probably wouldn't stop here again. Customer service was terrible. Had one girl roll her eyes at my order in separate bags, then I wanted to change an order and it was a pain to them to have to accommodate it. Awful service but the desserts were first rate."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty ordinary. Soup & sandwiches. It's their pastries that really shine. I'm not too fond of soups & sandwiches so I didn't find too much in here that was appetizing. I did get the brownie for dessert though & it was a good size. Hubby & I had to share. It was delicious. Their seating area is nice & large. They also have a bathroom on the far wall. Good if you have kids with you."}
{"text":"Michel's has been around for years. A consistent bakery with gourmet sandwiches and above quality pastries. The butter croissants are now a lot flakier, and you can tell because it has a higher butter content. The grilled cajun chicken is a staple gourmet sandwich, and so is the hazelnut coffee. Classic go-to pastries are the blueberry cheese danish and sugar twist"}
{"text":"The pastries are the best I have ever had. Those almond croissants are so delicious...!  A bit pricey for my budget for pastries, but worth it."}
{"text":"This Michel's has been here forever. I used to come here just to wait for pick ups because it's at Don Mills station but it's always nice for coffee or a quick bite. Prices are always reasonably priced and the seating is spacious. They've got wifi and plugs too so it's a sweet place to get work done.   Food and coffee are all reasonable although I see the positive reviews exist for pastries as well. I've yet to try the rest of them but confirm that the croissants are tasty!"}
{"text":"Stopped by 3 months ago when i visited Toronto.  The restaurant is clean and tidy. I spent the whole afternoon with my friend chilling, it is cozy! There were so many pastries to choose from and the staff was nice! They recommended me some of their bestsellers. I remembered one of their staff named Rose, she was so nice with a lovely smile on her face for the whole day and her service was excellent.  I finally chose The Mediterranean chicken sandwich, chocolate almond croissant and blueberry cheese Danish together with a bowl of the wicked Thai chicken soup. They were so fresh and i love the croissant a lot as it was flaky, crisp and taste buttery but not feeling greasy at all!! I was also feeling prefect to have a hot Thai soup in such a cold weather.  I could hardly find any cafe in HK with such a wide variety of good pastries and excellent service. Will definitely come again if i have a chance and 4will also recommend to my friends living in there."}
