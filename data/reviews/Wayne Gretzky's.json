{"text":"Ein Must-Visit für jeden Tourist  nicht nur Eishockeyfans.
Gretzky ist eine Legände in Kanada  und das kann ein Restaurant natürlich nur schwer toppen. Aber es ist eine sehr solide Sache. Viel wichtiger ist auch das kulturelle Erlebnis, den Spirit Kanadas am Beispiel eine Ausnahmepersönlichkeit zu erleben. Gretzky ist eben nicht nur ein Hockeyspieler oder ein Restaurant: Gretzky ist Kanada und damit sinnbild für das zweitgrößte Land unserer Erde."}

{"text":"Brutal.

One of the worst bar / restaurant burgers Ive ever had. 
Sweet potato fries were good, but they charged for chipotle dip... (lol?)

The beer tasted sour. It also had flakes of something floating in it. I'm guessing they didn't clean their taps or something. It was gross."}
{"text":"Overall, this was a good restaurant experience, but you'll want to go here for the memorabilia and service more than the actual food.

=== THE GOOD ===
- Tons of Gretzky and general hockey memorabilia. There are enough jerseys, hockey sticks, pucks, etc. to outfit several teams.

- The service was very helpful and friendly.

- The prices are reasonable for being a \"big name\" restaurant in the middle of downtown Toronto.

- It was super easy to get a seat on a non-game Thursday night.

=== THE BAD ===
- The food was marginal. I ordered \"The 'Great One' Burger\" and for it being a \"Wayne Gretzky Classic\", it underwhelmed a bit.

- With the NHL season on ice at the time we went, the atmosphere was pretty mundane. I can only imagine the atmosphere is MUCH better with games going."}
{"text":"Last Saturday we came here at 5 pm for some wine and food. We had such a rude, unpleasant, unhelpful staff member called Mahalia. From the moment we got in she had an attidude, it seemed she hated her job. I asked what wine they had she said Pinot Grigio and I asked oh what other types and I got a reply of did you hear that the only wine we have. We asked her to check about the nachos being gluten free and she huffed and made a face. This continued for the whole two hours we were there so we decided to get our bill as we could not deal with her anymore. Most my friends didnt want to leave a tip but we agreed 10%. Upon paying out bill a guy came over and asked were we having a party and she roared at him and told him to go away as we were finishing paying. We all gave 10% , even though she didnt even deserve $1 as she ruined our afternoon. After we paid she told us we tipped too low and its customery to give 15%, then went and told all the other staff who all stared at us and were pointing. We have never experienced anything so rude. Mahalia should not be working in customer service nor in this nice rooftop fun summer bar."}
{"text":"With regards to Oasis
Food is mediocre, I had an average burger. 
The service is inattentive. We went in for a quick snack around 5 on a Thursday. It took an hour to get our food and then the bill never came 1.5 hours later despite trying multiple times to flag down our server.  The dining area gets very crowded with a spillover of bar patrons as the bar has limited seating options. This results in an overall crowded rooftop with bar patrons sitting all over the waterfall like a bunch of pigeons and hovering over the diners, you can imagine this is a pretty gross atmosphere. Several folks asked if they could have our table after us. Sorry but you should probably ask the hostess because I'm pretty sure that's not how seating works. 
Anyways, a note to management, keep your bar patrons outside in the line until you have capacity unless you really want to annoy all of your patrons with a jammed rooftop and service that is nowhere to be seen."}
{"text":"Worst poutine ever. Some of the most bland food I've ever had. I thought out was impossible to mess up pub food, but Wayne Gretzky's proved me wrong. The only thing that made up for the overpriced, low quality food was the attentive service."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend the food here.  Had the fixed menu on a Saturday night before a Second City show.  Mediocre soup, terrible pasta (terrible) [how can you fool up pasta that badly?], and the chocolate puck was a big miss.  

When was the last time Wayne ate here?"}
{"text":"Giving 3 stars instead of 2 because hey, it's Gretz, and 3 starts is a classic hockey term. That notwithstanding, the food was average. Been hearing for years that I \"had\" to try their famous burger, so I did, and it was nothing special. Not greatness, and the service required hailing down like a taxi, but it's an otherwise nice place to go watch the game or hang out with sporty friends."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with a few notes:  I am biased...I am a big hockey fan, a tourist in Toronto, and was on my way to the Hockey Hall of Fame. That said...

...What a perfect experience I had.  Great service.  Good Food.  More Gretzky Memorobilia than at the HHOF!

Our waiter was fast, attentive, knew the food well.  Our food and drinks were brought quickly and refilled as needed.  The Beer on Draught is frosty cold and the food was tasty.  The canuck pizza is an interested rush of flavor, with maple barbecue, canadian back bacon, corn, and peppers, while the mediterranean was full of flavor, if a bit dry.

But the real draw here is the decor.  The place is decked out with various artifacts from 99's career, including sticks, jersey's, pucks, skates, etc.  There's the stick from his first goal, longest streak, assist records and more.  The table's are even designed like rinks which outline record breaking plays.

Its a bit of a walk from the HHOF, but will make a great complementary meal for the hockey fan on the way."}
{"text":"I eat at Gretzky's often and the food and customer service are always amazing. Their new patio is gorgeous."}
{"text":"Food was nothing to write home about - I had pizza & beer. It's that kind of place really, close to the \"action\" as it were, and convenient with large tables & fine service.  Bonus if you spot Walter G. hanging at the bar."}
{"text":"Das Wayne Gretzky's ist wirklich ein Muss für jeden Torontobesucher. Das Essen ist gut, leistbar und schnell und so nebenbei kann man sich über den wohl besten NHL Spieler und einen der großen kanadischen Idole informieren.
In der Bar gibt es diverse Fernseher damit man die Spiele auch live verfolgen kann. Es gibt eine Rege Auswahl an Bier, für Stimmung ist gesorgt.
Das Lokal ist auch von Kanadiern sehr beliebt, deswegen empfehle ich einen Platz im Restaurant zu reservien. Wir gehen dort immer hin bevor wir uns ein Spiel des Eiskhockeyteams anschauen um ein bisschen in Stimmung zu kommen!"}
{"text":"Das Wayne Gretzky's im Entertainment District gelegen, ist eine Sportsbar / Restaurent die dem berühmten Eishockeyspieler Wayne Gretzky gehört oder gewidmet ist. Hier werden, in schönem Ambiente, viele originale Stücke aus der Sammlung des Stars gezeigt. Die verschiedenen Trikots, Schläger, und andere Erinnerungsstücke aus der Welt des Sports sind hier an den Wänden und überall sonst im Restaurant zu bewundern. Das Essen im Restaurent ist lecker und die Auswahl ist groß. Das Personal ist freundlich, extrem hilfsbereit und, wie in Canada üblich, sehr bemüht. Ich hatte bisher, bei meinen ca 8 Besuchen, noch keinen Grund zu beschwerden und war vom Essen immer begeistert. Im Bar-Bereich kann man am Abend in ungezwungener Atmosphere sein Bier geniessen und Sportprogramme anschauen oder Billard spielen. Ich gebe, wegen der gelungen Ausstattung, der guten Atmosphäre, dem Service und des guten Essens 5 Sterne."}
{"text":"Earlier in the day I had purchased tickets to Second City and noticed this place on the corner. I am not familar with Toronto so I kept this place in mind as a convenient place to grab dinner before the show. 

Having not found another resturaunt, I ended up here, which I have come to regret. Toronto offers hundreds of delicious cuisines from an array of cultures and I chose a noisy, sports bar. 

A sports bar is a great convenience and offers a familiarity to travelers who are just looking for a decent burger and beer. Whatever convenience Wayne Gretsky's Bar and Grill offers, is sadly outweighed by its flavorless food. I ordered the chicken parmesan club and my mom ordered the Great One Burger. I had the displeasure of sampling both, as my chicken was undercooked. Not being able to stomach a new chicken sandwich I opted to substitute for a burger. The bun was cold and there was mayo all on the bottom of the bun making it impossible to eat like a normal burger. 

One star for our waitress who was very kind and forgiving for the undercooked food, another star for the free wifi.  

In short, find another resturaunt. I wish I had."}
{"text":"They call themselves a hockey bar but the two times I went I never got to watch the hockey game that was on. It's either basketball or UFC (who watches this???) while the NHL western conference final runs on a few TVs without sound."}
{"text":"Wow, this good personality oh, very good!!!!!!!http://www.pcbatteries.ca/"}
{"text":"By far the best meal that we had during our recent vacation in Toronto. Try the Lumberjack Chicken sandwich...it is the bomb!!! Their burgers are really tasty too. I especially like how they burn the numbers 99 in the buns! I would definitely go back if we ever are in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Get ready for Wayne Gretzky overload, as there is a lot of Wayne Gretzky related memorabilia at Wayne Gretzky's Restaurant.  I'm a huge fan of ice hockey, so I was looking forward to checking out the restaurant, which gets busy, especially on a game day.  As for the food, I found it was a bit on the pricey side for the quality and quantity of the food offered (a lot of bar type foods)."}
{"text":"I love this place. It hits me right where it hurts soooo goooood. Nothing like some good 'ol pub grub with sports on the tv. The staff are attractive and attentive with no attitude. Everybody is just having a great time its awesome. The food hit the spot and was delivered fast. We stayed for drinks and i don't really know what time we left but i think they were closing. I will keep coming back herenever gets old."}
{"text":"Wing ranking: prepared , breaded. As the rule goes breaded wings can't rank more than a 6.  These were huge!!! So they get a six. Drop the breading to get serious. Still, the  kids liked them. The menu is quite vast, enjoy something else."}
{"text":"7 of us had the misfortune of going here after a jays game. We have been here several times before and usually had a good experience but after tonight, I don't think we will ever come back. 

We sat in the back lounge across from the bar. I do understand when it is busy It may take a little longer time to get your order. Service was incredibly slow. We waited nearly 40 mins to get our first round of drinks. One of the girls in our group went to ask the server if she could still bring our order in which she rudely replied \"your drinks  take time\" 
Lol bit*h it doesn't take 40 mins to get a pitcher and 2 mixed drinks ready no matter how busy you are. 

Anyways the food was good but the service was incredibly poor. Near the end we asked if we could have are bills seperate. This seemed to piss off our waitress as she rolled her eyes and muttered somethibg under her breath as she stormed away. It than took another 30 minutes to get us our bill. 

At this point we were all pissed and virtually left a 0 tip on a 200 dollar bill. If this waitress would have just kept her mouth shut and not shown negative body language and maybe apologized for being slow we would have gladly left a standard 15 percent tip. The lesson here is that we will always tip, even on below average service. But we will never tip someone who is rude to us.  

We will never return."}
{"text":"This a review of the rooftop:  There are a lot  so I'll keep this short. It's a great location and atmosphere, service is dismal however: bartenders are almost snobby and don't seem happy to be there. Also like someone else mentioned it needs to be cleaned. Bar rail is not too expensive but don't bother with their mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Has a waiter named Hersch who seems that he was bothered to help us and was not very friendly at all. The food there is OK nothing special. This was my first time here. There probably won't be a second."}
{"text":"I usually don't complain about restaurants, yet this one has gotten me to complain. I went to Wayne Gretzky's while I was in Toronto with my family for a soccer game. As soon as we entered the restaurant, we were seated, but drink service was extremely slow. It was twenty minutes before a waiter even LOOKED our way. And when we finally got our drinks, we had been there for already an hour. The waiter was very friendly, but she was also very slow in taking our order. I ordered a grilled cheese because nothing else looked that great, and someone else in my party ordered a burger, plain. It took an hour to get our food and when it arrived, I was extremely disappointed. The grilled cheese had puddles of grease all around it, making it look and feel disgusting. When I took a bite, I felt like I was just drinking oil. The person who ordered the burger was also disgusted. The burger was dry as a bone and it was burnt. It was black and could be used as a hockey puck. The bread was stale and it tasted like a wet rag. I would NEVER go back, I don't recommend this place. It was a lot of money for bad food, don't waste your money and time."}
{"text":"Memoribelia was great but all the good stuff is hidden in the back by the bathrooms. Expensive, not great food, unfriendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Estive ha alguns anos atras e o lugar e realmente fashion. Muita gente bonita e o ambiente e muito agradavel. Vale a pena uma visita com os amigos e desfrutar de momentos agradaveis."}
{"text":"FOOD, SERVICE, EVERYTHING SUCKS!!! This place was beyond terrible. The service was complete crap. Took an hour to deliver the food. We gave her our order for food and we weren't done talking but she just left. Had to wait for her to come deliver the food to ask for drinks. She completely forgot our food to the point when it came, it was cold and dry. The cheese on the nacho was so dry that the entire plate of nachos was stuck together and cold. She never came to refill our waters or ask if we wanted another beer. When we ask for the bill, she just dropped it and left. I have never seen a waitress/waiter not ask if you need the machine. She has the machine in her hand and left. Waited another 20 minutes to finally get someone else's attention to get the machine. Never coming back! Me and my friends got a stomachache the next day too!"}
{"text":"hmm - wayne is the man of course and its very hard to hate on him but the steak sucked.  sorry.

otherwise, i guess its a good place to watch hockey/drink Steam Whistle."}
{"text":"Read an amazing review about the chicken and waffles and boy were they right! The chicken was hot and crisp and moist it was draped by a delicious light tasting gravy and perched upon a lightly sweetened waffle. The two huge pieces of Chicken were too much for even me to eat, so I will look forward to the leftovers for lunch!

The staff is attentive, chatty and friendly as can be. I'm glad I took the chance to sit up close at the bar and experience this establishment!"}
{"text":"Lots of sports memorabilia if you're into that, and a very convenient location if you're catching a Jays game or doing any of the touristy stuff around the area. If you go on a regular Friday (i.e., no special events happening) then you can get a decent-tasting burger for $5. My personal favorite is the perogies though--mmm. Not your typical sports-bar food, but they are really good! 

It's a fun stop for the hockey-lovers in your life."}
{"text":"Four stars because the rooftop patio is truly an \"Oasis\". Fun place to go before a game or just a Saturday afternoon.  Food pretty standard. Service friendly and fun but inconsistent."}
{"text":"Every time my friends convince me to come back to Gretzky's I remember how much I hate it. Here are just a few reasons:
- absolutely no good beers to choose from
- the shitty beers they have are ridiculously overpriced ( with tax/tip it's $10 for a plastic cup that's not even a full pint)
- the service is usually terrible (one waitress thought we were crazy for wanting our own tabs - a standard at most other bars)
- the food is crap and overpriced

I would give it one star, but the rooftop patio is excellent. I wish a decent bar/restaurant would take over so I could actually enjoy it."}
{"text":"ein Geschichtsträchtiger Ort dem dem Eishockey und der Person Gretzkys gewidmet ist.
nettes Personal und gutes Essen"}
{"text":"horrible in every way ,overpriced drinks and food is below average, service slow, never again,"}
{"text":"Exceptional service and food.  Started with bruschetta which was fast and delicious.  I had the buffalo cauli wrap with chicken and my husband had the great one burger.  Probably the best wrap I've had in my life and the burger was cooked to perfection.  Loved the atmosphere and will definitely return next time we come for a game!"}
{"text":"Perfect sports bar in Toronto and the new menu is amazing. Staff are always friendly, memorabilia is from the greatest of all time, and great location downtown. Always enjoy stopping in for a quick pint or grabbing a pregame meal."}
{"text":"Came here after a hockey outing at MLG with a large group. Servers were nice dispite the rush of people we had come in all at once since they refused to allow our group to make reservations a month ago, but this was a must try stop for everyone. 

I had the moroccan Chick pea cakes and they were delishous but a bit overpriced and needed some additional flavoring. The 8 dollars for a side of sweet potato fries were rediculous, and they definitely didnt live up to that price tag. 

overall it wasnt a bad meal, just way overpriced. if it were 18 for the cakes and the fries, it would have been ok, maybe up to a 4 star."}
{"text":"When I visited Gretzkys 2 years ago I raved to everyone about how the 'Great One burger' was the best burger in Toronto. As I was back in my spiritual hometown this month I thought I'd treat myself to a tasty burger. Sadly the 'Great One burger' has now turned into the 'nothing special burger'.

I have no real complaints about the food. The fries were decent, as was the burger. It just lacked that pop that was there on my first visit. The patty was fatty and greasy and wasn't particularly great, and the toppings weren't much to shout home about.

Overall the bar is a good hangout. It's very quiet during the day. There's a good selection of beers. It's not too pricey. There's plenty of TVs around playing TSN and SNO. The staff are friendly. There's plenty of Gretzky memorabilia around to look at, and the rooftop patio is great on sunny days."}
{"text":"My dad and I enjoyed a wonderful burger at this restaurant. The service was wonderful, and I found the hockey-themed decor quite fitting to the history of the restaurant. The proximity to major sports venues was a very welcome feature. Some menu items were quite interesting and not native to a sports bar, but all in all, it was a great experience and I recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We asked for two pints of Steamwhistle Pilsner. They were served in small plastic cups. When we questioned the size of the cup the server assured us that it was a pint measure. Needless to say we brought one of the cups home and measured it. A pint is two cups and the plastic cup holds one and a third cup. As it is $14.30 for two small measures this is a total rip off."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and veggies..the steak was cooked perfectly but the one waitress was horrible..I asked for butter took her 30 mins and I ended up getting a bus boy to get me some before she eventually came back. When someone asks for butter you would presume its because they want it with their meal. The mashed potatoes were old and cold as were the veggies. I saw the manager and asked him to come over . He immediately offered to replace the whole meal ..I had already eaten half of my steak so I just asked for the potatoes n veggies to be replaced, and he bought us a round of drinks . that's how a manager is supposed to act!"}
{"text":"I went here for the Oasis patio, and have to admit that it was amazing.  Even on a Tuesday evening, the patio was full.  

But the service and food were a disaster.  We ordered the calamari, ribs, flat bread and nachos.
The calamari was rubbery and very small in quantity so not a good appetizer to share.  The flat bread was stale and the hummus dip was crusted over so obviously not very fresh.  The ribs were good, but also very small portion and not good to share.  The nachos were standard.  The waitress was rude and not at all attentive.  

All this being said, the patio redeems the place, if I was just rating the patio atmosphere, I'd give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Looks like a good place. But do not expect fast service. It is incredibly slow. Our server barely asked if we wanted food. I cannot recommend this place to anyone, walk a bit further and you will find much better places."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio. Great place for drinks but food was mediocre."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE at all costs. It's not worth the time, energy, or money. You'll leave hungry, insulted and disappointed (and broke). This does not represent what Toronto is capable of. There is a much better restaurant literally next door (and down the street, and all around pretty much!).

Visited Gretzky's on Sunday July 27th for a dinner and we all left disappointed, angry and hungry (and broke).

*service was the worst I've ever seen (rude, neglectful server literally ignored orders - didn't bring a coffee refill we requested and didn't bring a juice refill we requested at another time - it wasn't loud or crowded)
*we eventually went to another server who eventually brought a coffee, but no cream/milk so we searched for another server and asked him but HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT CREAM WAS!!!!!
*server refused to make simple substitutions - one guest is allergic to tomatoes so she requested pasta/pizza with a cream sauce instead of tomato sauce and the server refused (I've never encountered this at any other restaurant before). We requested a few other dishes with even smaller substitutions and she flat out refused them all with a rude attitude and no suggestions) 
*when that guest ordered an appetizer as a meal because she couldn't find anything on the menu she can eat, the server didn't warn her that it's a TINY portion that wouldn't satisfy a child, which is disgustingly the same price as an entree
*we waited an hour for our food. An hour. AN HOUR with just water (because she refused to bring our drink refills). I should mention that it was visibly not crowded in the restaurant at any time throughout our visit.
*the dishes we all got (pasta, a few kinds of pizza, burgers) didn't taste good. How do you screw all that up? But they're all priced at over $16 each..I wouldn't even pay $2 for it. 
*when the hungry/disappointed guest respectfully asked to speak with the manager, she then got the dish we originally requested (pizza with no tomato sauce) with no problem at all, but the manager was quite rude when she came over to talk. The rest of the guests at the table were surprised because we finally realized how the service in general is allowed to be that bad. When the manager is also rude, there is no hope for the place. 

Here's hoping they get shut down soon! Gretzky would be disgusted."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto from Chicago for my birthday. We were sat Friday 7/11 (my birthday) and, being huge hockey fans, my friend and I were expecting an excellent dinner. I left pretty upset to say the least.

I had a vodka & 7 which was decently poured. Most of the food we got was extremely unsatisfactory. The only thing that I would ever consider eating again were the hot wings. They were pretty big and really tasty.

The service is what killed me. We had FOUR different servers. Honestly when we were tipping we did not know who would get it or how it would be split. It wasn't even busy and my friend and I had stacked 2 empty drinks, an empty bowl if poutine, an empty plate of wings, and 2 empty appetizer plates at the side of our table.

These servers are lucky we even tipped. I have been a server before and didn't want to make them tip out for a table that didn't tip. So we have them 10% which honestly was pretty generous.

Planning on heading to Toronto again, love the city, but definitely will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Fun hockey themed place. A little pricey and food was just ok. Our server was really nice and it was not too busy when we came. We had the veggie nachos and liked them. My hubby had cider beer which he liked and my Gretzky mixed drink was ok."}
{"text":"Went there at 1:30pm on a Friday. Waited a bit to get seated, when we got seated was told that our server will be there shortly. We waited about 10 mins for someone. Ordered our drinks, needed more time to look over the menu, waited even longer for someone to take our order. I ordered the chicken Brie panini with recommended cream of chicken soup, my boyfriend ordered the chicken tacos. Our food comes and I was not given the cream of chicken, so I stated it was wrong, then I'm given the correct soup which I really should have kept the wrong soup. Cream of chicken it was not, it was more like a ton of left over chicken bits swimming in watered down cream sauce. I complained about it and I'm pretty sure the waiter was gonna say but u already had some of it. Ya I went to try it, it was just as gross as it looked. I kept it anyways. The chicken Brie panini was just as disappointing, it was tasteless and the chicken was dry. My boyfriends chicken tacos were tiny and tasteless and dry as well. The only upside was the drinks, the bananarama was delicious. This is only a good spot for drinks, but only if u don't mind waiting a long time for your drinks."}
{"text":"....the person answering the phone was EXTREMELY bitchy! For no reason! and would not allow me to make a reservation even though we were spending a ton of money and had a lot of people....

the service was pretty good. and the food was pretty good. Has a cool atmosphere ....but its even more awesome upstairs on their patio."}
{"text":"Für Sportfans ein absolutes Muss. Ganz nebenbei haben wir auch gut gegessen. Also: empfehlenswert. Vor allem für Fleischesser mit Hang zu XXL. War übrigens ein Tipp von unserem Driver Mitch, der einfach alles weiß."}
{"text":"Wayne Gretzky is obviously one of Canada's Greatest Native Son's. He was voted by the panel of experts at The Hockey News as the Greatest Hockey player to ever lace up skates in the NHL. So some folks may wonder if his restaurant could ever possibly live up to his reputation as an athlete. For me, it actually does! Downtown drinker's love their outdoor patio's, and Gretzky's rooftop \"Oasis\" patio bar is a great hangout, but the restaurant itself is my favorite part of the place. It's jam-packed with terrific memorabilia from Wayne's amazing career. Every time I'm there I spot something that I didn't see before. Contrary to what some kooks on here are saying, I find the food at Gretzky's to be delicious. I took my older cousin there for dinner about 8 years ago, and we ordered a Gretzky Pizza. Now this particular cousin has travelled all over North America, and eaten in restaurants from Vancouver, B.C. to Miami, Florida. He told the waitress that it was the best Pizza he's ever had! Then we ordered a second one. For appetizers, Grandma Gretzky's Perogies are another must-try dish! My Girlfriend took me to Gretzky's for birthday's past, where I received the complimentary \"Puck-shaped #99 Cake.\"  You can see it in the photo's above. If all that weren't enough...Dig this!
One time years ago, I walked into Gretzky's on a quiet rainy weeknight. (Not many ppl inside at that time.) I ordered something to eat from the bar. Shortly after, the bartender informed me he was mistaken, but the kitchen had just closed. To make up for it, he served me a few drinks on the house!  I don't remember another restaurant anywhere giving me that kind of great service! I've always found the staff at Gretzky's to be the most naturally friendly people you're likely to meet at a Toronto restaurant. What more can I say? Visit this Hockey Legends restaurant and score a good time!"}
{"text":"It's really a \"3\" because it's not bad, but if you're going to put Grettzky's name on it, it's below expectations.  The good part is it's location, decor, layout, and TVs.  I didn't see the renown deck.  However being an out-of-towner, and wanting to watch the NHL semi-finals on a Monday, this worked.  Had no problem with the service.  The food is beyond forgettable.  The calamari was soggy.  Fortunately the the spiced breading they put on it could make a shoe taste good.  I'm not Canadian, but the poutine is Canadians should be embarrassed to serve at a restaurant that bares the name of the most famous Canadian ever.  The fries tasted like they were out of a bag and the gravy out of a can.  And in a time where everyone is doing amazing things with  burgers, \"The Great One\" burger is quite boring and tasteless.  Was it unbearable, no.  We still ate everything, but in the era of great endorsed restaurants like Ditkas and Shula's, this place doesn't come close.  Come here for the sports and drinks, but pass on the food."}
{"text":"The inside decor is nice. Very warm for a bar. This place is pretty big when u walk in they have glass cases with hockey trophies and other hockey items. To the right is table service. Which is good for kids, but if you walk straight it's the bar area. It wasn't busy but steady. There was no permanent bartender. Wow that blew my mind. The waitress did everything-take orders, make drinks, bring out food, cash you out. On to the food.......
I ordered the famous wings and poutine. The wings were good highly recommend them. Poutine not so much. The fries weren't crispy enough & the gravy was too salty. They have daily specials. Last night was $6 drinks & apps. Needless to say she over charged me because she didn't know Poutine was on special. Except for that I thought service was good. Would I return? Probably not. Food was just as expensive as eating at a hotel."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say is it was a cool looking restaurant. The servers are very friendly. 

I had to return the prime rib burger because all I could taste was the blue cheese. It was terrible. The pesto did not match the burger and tasted off. The food is definitely not great. The beers were crazy priced too."}
{"text":"This place could do with a good cleaning.  It was gross to find gum stuck under the table (which is not unexpected in an environment which appears to be over-run by midget hockey players.)  Food quality was on par with a very bad diner.  I'm not sure the team sitting next to us was wearing totally clean hockey jerseys because I kept getting a whiff of eau de locker room.  If you have a need to come here, stick to beer and appetizers."}
{"text":"Still new to the city, my wife and I ventured down last night in the hopes of finding other Canuck fans to enjoy the big playoff game with. We did find some like minded fans, but we were greatly disappointed with the experience. The staff was pretty good, but the look and feel of the room was lame. From uncomfortable seating to poor TV sight-lines, and terrible acoustics, it feels like state of the art sports bar, circa 1995 - which is precisely what it is. The world of sports bars has changed significantly, but at Gretzky's, time seems to have stood still. What's worse is the quality of the food. It was reminiscent of something you might eat in an airport or on a ferry...I am not exaggerating here... really. I found myself feeling like this establishment must have a degrading influence on Wayne's brand - it made me feel sad. We left after the 1st period. Note that I had previously enjoyed a couple of beers on the rooftop patio, and that experience was quite alright, if rather touristy."}
{"text":"Service was really good .
We had a nice evening . It gets busy quickly and can be rather loud.
The burger was really good .
The steak frit was pretty tough .
Really enjoyed the perogies as an appitizer.
Will come back . It's a bit pricey for bar food but if you are a hockey fan it's worth a visit ."}
{"text":"Went for the World juniors game over the holidays with medium expectations of a fun crowd to enjoy the game and pub style food.
Unfortunately the place was 1/4 full and maybe now I know why...$29 for a dozen wings?  Finding a charge for $2 for hot sauce on the side of a medium order of wings? 
On a total bill of $170+, I would expect some discretion here = customer service fail.
Service was prompt and friendly so no issue there.  
Half decent beer menu - not just the big brewers."}
{"text":"Nothing special really. Its decor doesnt really suit that of a sports bar what with wooden chairs/booths and tables.

The food is overpriced and liquor overiced. Your sandwiches will be oversliced and your salads overdiced. The entire experience is overrated. 

Wont be visiting again after my third time."}
{"text":"When first arriving at 6:45 I went to the washroom and there was cocaine all over the top of the toilet paper roll & scraps of weed on the back of the toilet. I mentioned it to the staff. An hour later I go back to washroom and the drugs are still there. 
It was not a surprise that the food was subpar but I brought my British friend to this specific bar because it was advertised that it would be screening the final Tragically Hip concert and I couldn't think of anything more Canadian than being at Wayne Gretzky's bar watching the Hip concert. It was fun until half way through the concert when approximately 15 20-something year olds walked in the bar & demanded the IFC fight be put on. The staff shockingly put half the tvs onto the fight. When the patrons complained one of the waitresses condescendingly stated that the bar paid for the fight and they would be switching off the concert for the fight. Many of us complained and thankfully some of the Tvs stayed on the concert. The UFC fans got loud, obnoxious & disrespectful to the 85% of us who came for the concert. My waitress was encouraging the UFC fans disrespectful behaviour and was very rude to the patrons who were there to see the concert. At the end of the concert we were settling up our tabs and due to the rudeness and poor service a few tables didn't tip the rude waitress. She had the nerve to demand an explanation why we didn't tip her & when we explained why, she stormed off & preceded to tell another waitress what bitches we were. 
I will never come back to this bar & I believe Wayne would be disgusted by his staff's treatment of the Hip fans. This night could have been unforgettable (in a historic wonderful way) but the staff at Wayne's allowed a few rowdies to ruin it for the rest of us."}
{"text":"Wayne Gretzkys is a safe bet if you need to be seated quickly - there are always plenty of empty tables when I visit during lunch hours. 

The service is pretty good, but some servers are slow to bring back beverages and food. The meatloaf is one of my favorites as well as the Gretzky burger which has a nice finishing touch of the charred \"99\" on the burger bun. I probably shouldn't eat so many fries, but the fries here are served in a tiny container... 

Their rooftop patio is so much more popular than the actual restaurant - the ambience up there is way more upbeat. The restaurant on the other hand, I find dark and unappealing. Some renovation work needs to be done and I'd prefer more lighting. 

Overall, this place has A-OK service and food, but would I recommend them to others? Most likely not."}
{"text":"Like most visitors to Toronto the HHOF is on the list and then you just have to try here.  Was here for lunch during the week day and it was not busy.

Service was attentive.
Food was nothing to write home about.
Prices - a little pricey IMO - seems like you're playing for the name - you are."}
{"text":"Visited a few days ago and got FOOD POISONING from oasis patio food :s I could barely get out of bed.. I would seriously question the cleanliness.. I will not go back"}
{"text":"Come for the patio. Stay because the service is slow. 
We were here at Oasis. I will never buy the excuse \"Please excuse the wait, we're just a little busy right now.\" Which was what we were told when our drinks were taking awhile. You're a restaurant. You're in the business of being busy! You should live for those times - and be ready for them. So there was that. 
And then there was the being out of oysters on the first night of $1.50 Oyster night. I'm Again, not cool. Poor planning it seems. Don't run out of a featured item. 
I've worked in the restaurant business long enough to know both of these situations were avoidable. 
This was my first visit and I think I satisfied my curiosity."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago with some friends. The interiors are very hockey themes, no big surprise but it was clean. The washroom were not so clean! A typical sports bar to hang out with friends or watch a game or two. It was nothing spectacular but not horrible either.

We ordered the fried chicken, burger, and pizza, all typical sports food. The fried chicken was a bit undercooked and underseasoned. The burger was typical, plain, and boring. However, the pizza wasn't so bad and could have been better if it wasn't overpowered with garlic. 

I might come back here again, but I'm not digging the sports bars scene anymore. I would rather go to Real Sports, but this isn't that bad either!"}
{"text":"I was excepting to walk into a \"hockey in your face\" place but it's not like that. We went for lunch on a Wednesday and sat in the bar. On the way to the bathroom you'll see a lot of hockey memorabilia, I didn't walk through the main dining area but it looked like there were some things on the walls but not like I expected (I was anticipating an ESPN Zone type atmosphere)The most disappointing thing was the food and wine. The wine I ordered had a poo smell... Maybe they dont store the bottles properly. I got the chicken sandwich (doesn't come with fries and its over $10!) and I'm pretty sure the chicken was cooked earlier in the day because it didn't taste freshly cooked and had a rubber/gelatin texture. We also ordered the  perogies which were okay, only flavor was the bacon and onions on top. I wanted to get my brother in law a shirt but decided against it since I wasn't thrilled with the place."}
{"text":"Food was Wonderful!  Atmosphere was wonderful!  Server gave us no attention! We had an excellent time.  The server took our order and that was it.  Very odd."}
{"text":"Lovely service, yummy food, great cocktails! I was with a large-ish party but they accomodated everyone very well and food and drinks came quickly. Well priced plus we were seeing a show at Second City next door so they told us when to head off because the show was starting. Also I realised later if left my scarf behind and when I rang, quite late too (after midnight) I spoke to the manager. A cheerful fellow named Andrew, he was so helpful and attentive and he found my scarf so I got it back and I bought him a bag of chocolate to say thanks. He totally deserved it! Great service all round!"}
{"text":"Best place to go right before a game!! Love the decor, ambiance, lots of tv screens to get you pumped up and really good food, too!!  Another big plus is that you're always seated quickly as there is lots of seating, whether in the front or back.  I've been with just one person or big groups and have always had a good time.

One more quick point, I have a lot of friends visiting me from overseas in the summertime. I usually take them here before going to a Jays game.  It's a great way to give them some insight into our hockey culture and Wayne Gretzky before taking them to the iconic a Sky Dome (Rogers centre, gggrrrrr).

And if you want a great place to go after the game? Oasis just above Gretzky's -- total gem."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best, the food is only passably edible if you catch them on the right day. There's no such thing as consistency, and the management is laughable. If you enjoy a dated and already over-used hockey theme, and a restaurant that's only managed to remain standing because of it's name, then come on down to Wayne Gretzky's. 

Drinks are completely watered down and the bartending is a joke. As a bartender with 7 years under her belt, I would love to know why when I ordered the Gretzky over ice that the glass was 95% ice with no hint of alcohol whatsoever.

If you enjoy having keys dangled in front of your face, then you'll most definitely enjoy the uninspired menu, chock-full of items that are in no way unique and can be found at EVERY OTHER restaurant in the city. If you enjoy the same battered and tossed wings that are dry to the bone and slathered in sauce and can be enjoyed at any Kelsey's, Montana's, or any other low-end steak house that specifies in people who cant tell the difference anyway, then come on down to Wayne Gretzky's.

I've given this place many chances over the years, and no matter how many changes in management it has, it really still stays the same. Whoever is running this place clearly doesn't care, or just does the bare minimum. Changing the menu or the drinks every few months isn't the only way to bring customers in. Not when no work is being put in on their staff or the consistency of their food. 

Speaking on the staff, they are uninspired, and clearly being treated poorly. On two separate occasions at this location I've witnessed management barking at staff behind the scenes, then coming back to a table and smiling and laughing with customers; behaviour I find both disgusting and repugnant. Your staff should be treated with upmost respect, regardless of what the situation may be. To see a manager blatantly degrade a staff member for a mistake on a bill, then go to that table laughing and smiling as if he's college buddies with them, almost resulted in me walking out before I even placed an order, and had I not been there for a business meeting, I would have.

I'm officially finished settling for this restaurant just because of the area it's in, which is how I'm assuming they get 99% of their business. 

Come here if you enjoy average food that isn't burnt. If you enjoy eating at Swiss Chalet for your family dinners, then this is a good choice for you if you're looking to shake things up."}
{"text":"Wayne Gretzky's isn't too far from my house, so it has been my go-to Sport's Bar for any NCAA Football games. (Go BLUE!) 
They are super accommodating about changing the TV and making sure at least one of their bar TVs is playing your game. We have been able to show up at game time for some of my fave teams with a large group and still all get a seat and a beer in hand pre-show. 
However, if the game goes on too long and you need to eat... well I got nothing for you. Food is all mediocre. 
Drinks- both beer selection and the ceasar's are amazing. Other mixed drinks, I'm not going to recommend. Wine- well, he owns his own winery, and it's not too bad. 
Wayne and his friends and family occasionally host radio shows here and you might catch a glimpse of The Great One."}
{"text":"Server forgot order. Had to wait while the rest of our party was eating. Once we got our order of wings they were raw. Our party's nachos were cold upon arrival. Food was not tasty. Overall a bad experience. Does not live up to the great ones name."}
{"text":"If you like a good , no wait a great tasting hamburger, get the breakaway burger. It is reasonably price with choice of sides."}
{"text":"Went to Gretzkys the other night, was pretty disappointed in general. Food was mediocre at best, pretty basic given the price. You're pretty much paying for the novelty of Wayne Gretzkys bar/restaurant namesake. There are plenty of other much better options in the area!"}
{"text":"A few colleagues and I stopped in for drinks and a quick bite before a Leafs game.  The place is loaded with very cool memorabilia from Wayne's childhood all the way up through his retirement.  But from a food/drink standpoint, it's more gimmick than good.  We ordered a couple different types of wings, a pizza, and a club sandwich.  All were just average, but the $12 price tag on 7 wings was a bit ridiculous.  Especially when the wings were smaller than what you'd typically find at Buffalo Wild Wings for less than half the price.  The beer choices on the patio upstairs were pathetic, but a bit better downstairs.  The service was pretty good, but that was really the only redeeming quality.  Next time I'm heading to the ACC, I'll stop somewhere else."}
{"text":"In need of a place for a late lunch and to waste an hour or so before the Jays game, we decided to check out ol' Wayne's establishment.

I have to say the sports atmosphere is fun, I really like how it's decorated and how the bathrooms play sports/recaps etc... The service was also good and speedy, as I bet they have to be during any popular sports event because it gets BUSY!

I had an IPA while making my food decisions, I think it was called \"bone shaker\" which was tasty and right up my alley for a hop party in your mouth, however we were super disappointed with the food... I decided to go with the pork tacos and the man got a steak. 

The tacos were horrid, the flavour was... I don't' know how to describe it but it was just a mix of terrible and the taco was 70% coleslaw that was saturated in watery mayo. I had to ask for hot sauce and when they brought 3 different kinds over, I used ALL three to try and mask the bad flavours... it didn't really help, however I ate them without complaint because other than me not liking them there wasn't really anything wrong. 

I heard the steak was \"the worst\" he's had in a long time and was just bland. 
So, I'd say... go for the beers! (And perhaps wings? You can't eff up wings.)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Never coming back. It wasn't busy. I was ignored because I was by myself."}
{"text":"Halloween was fun with $5 tall boyz and the place looks nice to watch a Leaf game but the menu is every where and doesn't look complete.  Pierogies? Really? 

Nachos were huge (oh ya you won't find it on the actual menu) the wings were good but tinker with your menu, make some change and play with the prices. No one wanys $19 nachos no matter how big they are."}
{"text":"Ladies...looking for a man? They are all here. But they're watching sports. 

p.s. The skate blades as door handles were pretty cool."}
{"text":"Really busy place before a game but the staff were prompt, friendly and worked together to get orders out. Burgers were good. We did have a very simple order but our waitress. Who by the way Kelly D was just awesome. She checked on us so many times and was always serving with a smile. 
And 'nuff said to be in the Hall of the Great One.  Took me years to forgive you Wayne in ruining the Leafs in Game 6 back in '93 (high stick on Gilmore with no call) and went in to score the winner to force Game 7.  But after Gold at the Olympics all was good. And I love the memorabilia in the place. Just AWESOME."}
{"text":"Great location downtown. Walking distance to convention center, Air Canada center, Blue Jays. If your a hockey fan and appreciate the \"Great One\" as you should, you need to view all the Gretzky memorabilia inside. Menu choices are different than you would expect. Food quality is good for a sports type bar/restaurant offering different choices. Burgers, Korean BBQ pizza, etc were very good. Reasonable prices considering location."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars

Stopped by on a Wednesday after work. The place was fairly busy but not certainly not full (even with a Jay's gaming starting within an hour). A friend and I sat in the Bar area in the back of the restaurant. 

Service was incredibly poor for the first half of the evening. We could barely get anyone's attention for a beer (and food). The servers never stopped by, you had to chase them down every time. I normally would have left but was with a friend from out of town who wanted to try Gretzky's.

A few hours later, the place completely emptied out and the service improved. No kudos for average service when the restaurant is empty.

Beer selection was better than I expected with Blanche du Chambly, Mad Tom IPA, a rotating Grandville Island tap, Okanagon Pale Ale and various Mill street selections.

I tried their signature 99 burger and really liked it. To my surprise, the burger was cooked perfectly, still juicy and medium to medium-well in the middle. It was served on a homemade bun with #99 branded on the top. The burger was served with cheese, bacon, lettuce tomatoes and pickles. Better than most of the burgers I recently tried (including dedicated burger restaurants).

Lot's of Gretzky memorabilia if your into that. A walk down memory lane as you trek to the washrooms.

Although I enjoyed my burger and Blanche du Chambly, the poor service was a complete turn off. Waiting 15-20 minutes for my first drink was just unacceptable. Doubt I will return..... especially with Bar Hop around the corner!

{"text":"This was one of the places that I was really looking forward to during my first trip to Toronto, but it ended up being the 'lowlight' of the trip.  We walk in and are not sure where to go, so we go to the bar side.  They have lots of TV's with sports programming on - which is worth a star, but the loud club music did not exactly mesh.  We end up asking to be moved where it is not so loud and are put in an empty small room that is still playing loud music, just not as loud. So, onto the food - It was terrible.  Nachos look awesome, but ended up being a big plate of  difficult to chew chips with a thin layer of cheddar cheese melted on them.  No Cuervo, so I received an overpriced cheap well tequila.  Of course, all of this took forever to get to us. We might have ordered something other than the appetizer but the waitress NEVER came back after dropping the nachos off.  We could have so easily dined and dashed here.  The icing on the cake was the traumatic experience in their bathroom which no one was attending to, obviously.  I came out crying, literally, after gagging, trying not to vomit.  There is absolutely no reason why I would ever go to this restaurant ever again. It makes me sad that Wayne Gretzky has his name attached to this place. I expect something more from the Great One."}
{"text":"The Oasis rooftop bar at Gretzky's has a great atmosphere -- I like how it's hemmed in by so many buildings, giving it a real downtown feel -- but otherwise it's nothing spectacular. If you're from out of town and visiting the city for Jay's game, this could be a good experience, but if you live in the GTA, I wouldn't bother.

The beer was reasonably priced (they have specials), but the food is expensive and service was slow. The seating is also a bit cramped."}
{"text":"Shitty service wait forever for drink to arrive and waitress to show back hope food is good if I get it before morning must elaborate waitress was pissed off we wanted to order food and ice water.  Martini  was terrible and not worth twelve bucks.  Wayne would be ashamed."}
{"text":"Came here after the ballgame last night for drinks and possibly appetizers. I will say it was very busy, but we were able to get seats at the bar. Unfortunately the service was friendly, but really really slow, we only stayed for 1 drink and left. We would have stayed longer and ordered food but it was pointless as it would have taken to long for them to take our order. Loved the decor though."}
{"text":"Cool memorabilia, otherwise wouldn't recommend. Indifferent food, indifferent service, 5 different bar stools were missing at least one pad, always tilting. Cauliflower app had way too much breading, table was semi clean. Would not return."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant yesterday for brunch with a friend and the food was terrible. I had the breakfast burrito and my friend had the poutine. The food was not good quality, and you could definitely tell it came out of the freezer. I'm not really sure what I was expecting out of this restaurant. The name is so grand and he's such an idol you'd figure this guy would know what a good poutine is. His name is known in all Canadian households and to be honest I was quite disappointed. I would be embarrassed to serve the fries he did. Even McDonald's has better fries. I told my friend about our experience and she told me she used to work there and that the food was indeed terrible and they would get food sent back on a regular basis. Which doesn't surprise me at all. All in all I give it 2 stars as the service was alright and the theme was truly Canadian and at least he had a poutine on the menu. I, however, am no longer excited about trying out his wine or scotch after this experience."}
{"text":"Was here about two weeks ago for a blue jays game that went into super extra innings. I enjoyed sitting at the bar and hearing the banter of all the fans who had been cut off from beer service at Rogers Centre in the 7th inning and had come to Wayne Gretzkys for beer. I didn't have any food (I probably should have) but the service was good as was the atmopshere."}
{"text":"I just don't dig this place.  There are so many better sports bars.  It is cool seeing all of the Gretzky memorabilia, but that was the high point.  Not really sure I will ever be back.  There are so many better places in Toronto.

Beer is over priced, food is beyond blah.  Staff is not overly friendly, so why would I ever go back?"}
{"text":"We stopped by there after a night out at Second City. Wanted to just grab a bite to eat before we headed home.

Got in around 12:45am, so they only had the late night menu out and we got the medium wings. They were a bit pricey, at $14, and had about 7 pieces.

But, I have to say - these were among the best wings I have ever had! The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and spicy, and the amount of meat on the wings were generous. It did cost on the higher end for wings, but they rank up there with my all time favorite wings. The next time I'm back, I'll try something else on the menu as well. A couple of the guys at the table got the burger (which was $1 more) so that's next on my list to try! I would have given this a 4.5 stars, but I removed the .5 star due to the cost - it is pricey.

Overall, I would recommend this location to a friend for a late night meal after a night out."}
{"text":"When the Jays are 0-3 in the ALCS there's nothing else left to do but drink the despair away. 

Gretzky's is your average sports bar, with a rowdy game night crowd, ample seating, and plenty of sports memorabilia lining the walls. Plenty of TVs as well to watch the games. They have a dining and bar area; good for groups. It's a fairly standard bar in the proximity of the dome."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar and decent food as well.

We had a quick lunch here before heading  to Niagara falls and the food was surprisingly good!

We got chicken wings, perogies and chicken tacos. The wings were mutant sized and were almost size of drumsticks! I wasn't complaining!!LOL. The perogies had an amazing flavor to them, mostly because they were cooked in duck fat!! The chicken taco's are okay but could use a bit more flavor. Overall, has a lot of TV's and would be a great place to watch a game and get some grub!"}
{"text":"In town for pleasure from a few hours away. Stopped in here after visiting the aquarium and cn tower. The food was very good. We got the perogies. . Poutine .. and kids mac and cheese.. all of It was very good and very yummy.. a bit expensive but not too bad!"}
{"text":"2.5 - okay food, nothing special.  Lots of apps - risotto balls, buff chicken dumplings, wings, shrimp tacos, cheesy bread"}
{"text":"Surper bon et aussi un bon service, le Hamburger et la Pizza et je donne une note de 9.9/10."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. We decided to give this restaurant a visit since it's always been a winner in the past. Unfortunately it has gone downhill. We shared an appetizer which was a trio of dips with nacho chips and pita bread. The bread was not grilled and stale. The dips were bland. 
I ordered a kale salad with cranberries and a lemon dressing. I opted to add salmon to the salad. The lemon taste was non existent and the salmon was drenched in a goop of miso or  teriyaki.
My husband ordered Granma' s meatloaf which I believe is an original menu item. It was always good in the past but not this time. They use to have the best garlic mash but not anymore.  My husband was very disappointed in the taste and said it was not how he remembered it.
We ordered dessert thinking that will at least be good. Nope, it wasn't to be. Pumpkin cheesecake with a tasteless pumpkin puree.
We were considering taking our boys here since they would love to see some of the hockey memorabilia. Think we will give it a pass. Sad to see this guaranteed good meal restaurant go down.  Needs a reno from tattered booth seats to scratches on wood bathroom stall. I guess Wayne is more invested in his winery and not this restaurant anymore. Perhaps he should visit and either revamp or take his name off the place.
The stars are for the polite server and prompt service.  Although the place was pretty empty since it wasn't game night."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriends for brunch. Totally over priced drinks but the food was good. The atmosphere is great, but not my kind of brunch spots with the high priced drinks."}
{"text":"This place is an overpriced tourist trap. If it wasn't for the name, and for the fact that I felt some kind of obligation to go here since I was in Canada, I would have walked right past. The food here was absolutely terrible -- flavorless, gross, and not worth the price tag. If you feel the need to go here, then go ahead, but don't expect a good meal or anything that is out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Third trip to Toronto for a youth hockey tournament in three years and finally able to get to get the team into Gretzky's. Better than average service, great memorabilia, great to meet The Great One's dad Walter but the food left something to be desired. 

Seemed like all of the burgers were cooked to well done (so very dry) and my app rib-let's we're as hard as, well, hockey pucks. The salad was good. As one of our players said, a burger should be pink inside and juicy."}
{"text":"What a great opportunity to be a 'Great One'. 
The staff are friendly but not overly. 
If you want to watch sports and have a good beer selection with a mediocre burger, this spot is for you. Average to say the  least.  The burger is tasty, small and nondescript.  The fries are doughy and a plate full of shorties. Where did they get such small potatoes?
If it wasn't for running into Walter Gretzky one evening as he was heading out I would not have come back. 
Try Oasis upstairs as the roof top patio and head on."}
{"text":"Dissapointing. Went there for game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals. The TV where our table was cut off the score line at the top of the screen and they didn't know how to fix it. How could that be the case in a sports bar?! The TV right next to the tables game speed was ahead of the rest of the restaurants. How could that be allowed!! And lastly I ordered a poutine which was highlighted on the menu. It was such lousy. Surprised these simple standards couldn't be met in a place with the great one's name on it"}
{"text":"Before going to a Jays game post-work my friends and I decided to check out Oasis, the rooftop patio/bar.  We got what we came for - drinks, a quick bite and some time to have a pre-grame chat.

PROS:
-location, it is close to Rogers Centre, so there were a lot of people there with their game faces on
-I had the Strawberry Basil Lemonade, I liked it enough that I ordered another
-We ordered the nachos and they were solid.  Lots of toppings, lots of cheese, crispy but not burnt together
-Our server was pleasant and attentive, despite what most reviews have been saying
-Love the waterfall on the patio!

CONS:
-I really couldn't care less for the crowd.  A mix of young people, some post-work, some pre-game, some doing shots, some just chatting.  It was a really confusing place
-The wicker couches/chairs are in some serious need of re-stuffing
-The view is mostly condos, nothing spectacular

It is a touristy place so I really think people need to judge it accordingly.  It isn't like Wayne is trying to sell you some high end dining affair.  The patio is fit with Corona brand palm trees -- see it for what it is and make fair judgements."}
{"text":"Themed/celebrity-backed restaurants are a dying breed. I used to think Hard Rock Cafe was literally the coolest thing in the world. Many others did too as a shirt from there was a fashion statement back in the early 90's. Emerging from era were a bunch of other restaurants where a celebrity endorsement and some framed paraphernalia were enough reason to decide where you wanted to choose to eat - maybe even make a destination of it. You could even look at it as a humanitarian cause since you knew you were making your favourite celebrity richer by your patronage. 

I have little doubt Wayne Gretzky's emerged from that era too. Listen: I LOVE the Great One, and I lived in Alberta in the 80's, but I don't draw a natural association between him and a good meal. I essentially found my way into the doors of this restaurant for the simple fact that our show at Second City started in a half hour and we were starving. Side note: any food you order at Second City comes from here.

The menu is very much paint-by-numbers safe bar food with staples some somewhat current trends (i.e. fish tacos) but done in a very safe (i.e. generic) way.

To cut to the chase: my wife and I ordered the fish tacos and an order of hot wings. The wings did the job and the tacos even surpassed my expectation - bearing in mind that my expectations were fairly low.

Very good service, and they fully ensured our order was rushed so that we could make the show on time. Prices are okay too.

Bottom line: it's a simple sports bar, and you're doing okay for what it is. Unlike Wayne however, this is place is a bit of distance from being  'a great one'."}
{"text":"Went for dinner after a Jays game and of course, it was busy with a 50\" wait time.  We were asked if we would be interested in patio dining as an alternative and we went for it.  Entrance is off the side alley, up the flights of stairs to the rooftop patio.  The view and ambiance is quite a surprising treat; can imagine how much more enjoyable it would be in the daytime.  It was a chillier September night and space heaters are sprinkled throughout.  We found the food was 'just average,' given all the fanfare that comes with a name like Gretzky's.  Had ordered fish tacos but only after 15-20 mins. were we informed that they had in fact run out and if shrimp tacos would be accepted instead...sure.  Food was just mediocre.  Shrimp tacos were just a few pieces on a bed of coleslaw tucked in tortillas.  Steak sandwich entree came without steak knife and waiter seemed a bit annoyed when we had to request for one.  Overall, nothing here more than downtown TO ambiance...which you can really get anywhere else in the area.  Forgettable."}
{"text":"I'm a big Gretzky fan. I followed Wayne's career as he was traded from Edmonton to LA, to St Louis and New York. Its a no brainer I would like his restaurant.  every time I make a trip to Toronto, I try to have a meal here. It never disappoints. the food is always great. the staff has always been professional, friendly and helpful. This place is so much more than the delicious food. so much memorabilia surrounds the restaurant. 
The city of Toronto offers a lot of options when it comes to great food, if you're a hockey fan, this place is a must."}
{"text":"For Mother's Day 2018 my son had purchased tickets to take me to a show at Second City.  As he was checking out the purchase online he was asked if he wanted to add on dinner at Wayne Gretzky's to which he responded yes.  It consisted of two courses (appetizer and main) which I am not certain of the price as it was a gift from my son but he implied it was not cheap - I am guessing almost $40 per person.  

The experience here was a disappointment from start to finish.  The hostess stood behind the stand looking very unhappy and my son had to approach her to find out if he should be speaking to her to obtain a table as she was not acknowledging anyone that walked in.  Once we made it to our table we decided to forget about the first impression and assume it was not going to represent the entire evening.  We were wrong.  

Our server (Vic I believe) came along and was very friendly.  We ordered 3 Caesars which were fantastic - the best part of the night!  They were like a meal in a glass.  For appetizers I ordered the soup and my son ordered the guacamole and his friend ordered the perogies.  Our meals were to be Tortelini for me and burgers for my son and his friend (we had a choice of several appetizers and main courses as per the prepaid arrangement).  

Shortly after ordering, three burgers arrived at our table by someone other than our server.  I explained that these were not ours as we hadn't been served our appetizers yet and we didn't order three burgers.  Our server came over and stated that there had been a mix-up in the kitchen and that our appetizers would be right up and he'd be sure they made us new burgers.  This surprised me as I hadn't ordered a burger so I told him that and he checked the computer and confirmed I was correct.  Next the appetizers arrived.  My soup was Ok and my son's friend said his perogies were fine.  My son's guacamole was unseasoned and appeared to simply be creamed avocado.  We had barely began our appetizers when our food arrived.  It was set down beside our appetizers.  My son and his friend were quite certain that these were the same plates that had been brought out originally as the fries and the burgers were cold.  My son's burger was broken and half of it had fallen out of the bun onto the plate.

Our server had explained to us that it was very busy due the Jay's game but by the time our meals arrived the restaurant was fairly empty.  We felt extremely rushed and couldn't understand why.  

Our server did buy my Caesar which was nice but didn't make up for the overall feeling of disappointment and being cheated.  I have no complaints against him as I feel he was doing the best he could under the circumstances. That being said, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and I am quite shocked that Wayne Gretzky would have his name attached to such a poorly run establishment."}
{"text":"The best place to watch playoff hockey. The volume is just right, the fans are incredible (they actually pay attention to the game), there's lots of space for friends and family, good food and the best service I've had at a bar downtown. The staff were very accommodating and came by our table frequently. We also got free shirts. I highly recommend the sweet chilly edamame, the burger, and the steak with lobster mash potatoes. The cocktails were a bit on the strong side for me but that's okay, I'm glad I was getting my money's worth."}
{"text":"This place is a run-down tourist trap... in fact, our out-of-town host was quite embarrassed bringing us here for a business dinner. Apparently this was quite the place back in the day. I would equate it with sports bar meets Applebees. A hockey memorabilia explosion! The food was far below average and way overpriced. Service was average. Meh!"}
{"text":"It's exactly what you'd expect. Sports bar food with a sports bar theme. The waitstaff was nice. There was however a bucket catching water dripping from the ceiling near the ladies bathroom with was surprising for what seemed to otherwise be a pretty decent place.  If you like Hockey and you're in the area it's probably worth the trip."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fun and lively, the decor was fun and  the service was quick. My drink was tasty (it seems like the menu has changed since I was there, but if I missed it and the bananarama it is one of the tastiest drinks I've ever had). Overall, not the most memorable or interesting place, but I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food, but we came for drinks before heading into Second City which is right next door. Good bar area for watching a game and the DJ was right on with the music selection and had the impeccable timing fading it in and out between periods."}
{"text":"This place was better than I thought it was going to be.
Lots of hockey memorabilia and good TV's to watch any sporting event.

On this Saturday, they broadcast a Hockey-centric radio show, and had a couple of former players as guests.
Their small nachos with chili, was ENORMOUS, and very good.  Friendly bartenders.  Prices could be a little better, but in this area, they have a captive audience who is willing to pay.  One point off for restricting the tease of wireless, for \"Employees only\".    
\"We don't give out the password any more\"  ???   what's up with that?"}
{"text":"The \"Great One's\" restaurant is merely alright.  Loaded with plenty of Gretzky memorabilia, this is a good place to get a cold Canadian beer (Steamwhistle, Rickard's and Alexander Keith's are all on tap) and a dependable burger or pulled pork sandwich.  The dinner entrees are not quite as good, although the meatloaf is not bad.  If you're not super hungry, Grandma's Pirogis are a good choice.

The rooftop bar (called the Oasis) is a really nice place to hangout."}
{"text":"Wayne Gretzky's was a huge disappointment. I was here for the New Years Eve set menu and while I normally give a lot of leeway for busy special events, my experience here still managed to be exceptionally poor. 

Things originally started off well. We were seated right away and the server quickly took our drink orders. They also arrived quickly. I like my martinis with extra olives and was pleased that they had garnished mine with plenty.

However it was all downhill from there. My friend accidentally spilled my water glass and instead of dealing with it discretely, our server made a joke that he wasn't going to refill my glass. Turns out it wasn't a joke. He also never brought us dry cloth napkins which had been used to dry the table. 

First course comes and my friend was brought the wrong thing and my butternut squash soup wasn't anything special either, very bland and lukewarm. As for the main course, my risotto was incredibly over salted. You know what would have helped with that?? Not forbidding me from having water. Finally the dessert was also mediocre, more of a thick pudding than a true creme brûlée. It was completely lacked a harder top layer.

The final icing on the cake was when we were finishing up and wanted to have a coffee. Nope, he brought us the bill without asking if we were done and ran off before we had a chance to.

Needless to say, even if I lived in Toronto I don't think I'd be returning thanks to the poor service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"As a tourist, enjoyed going to watch sports. Menu was overwhelming to look at but food quality was decent. Sat at the bar and had very attentive service. Lots of tvs, but if looking to watch anything besides hockey, I'd aim somewhere else. Convenient to hotel, moderately priced, enjoyable!"}
{"text":"After walking around for what felt like forever, hubby & I decided to grab drinks at the bar.  I'm certain that the restaurant & the roof deck are worth checking out, but that was just not what we felt up to doing.  The bartender was extremely friendly -- offering up advice about the Canadian brews.  He convinced hubby to try a Moosehead (or Moose Juice as he called it) -- not my kind of beer, but still had that crisp Canadian beer taste to it.

The bar was a comfortable atmosphere & pretty quiet for a Sunday night on a long weekend... but the service was personal & they had the Pats pregame on one of their big screen tvs (def. a plus!)."}
{"text":"Great place to have dinner and drinks before and after a game.  The food was really good and so was the service.  Also all of the memorabilia was amazing."}
{"text":"I've been here once many years ago and again when trying to find a restaurant where they had seats for the NBA finals, the food here is very mediocre. Screens are not the best. I wouldn't come back unless the Jack Astors around the corner is packed. If you come, I recommend their burgers/fries, basic but not bad."}
{"text":"Meh... The service was great! You're definitely paying for the experience because our bill did not reflect the quality of the food. You Chili's quality with steakhouse prices. The poutine with pork that my husband ordered was, however, pretty amazing!  My brother in laws burger, average. My potato dumplings...meh."}
{"text":"It's a bar with Wayne's name on it. Nice showcase and sports memorabilia. Food was good, skirts are too short. I will have my burgers elsewhere. My opinion."}
{"text":"Food was good....  Typical jack Astor's chain style food and scenery. . Service was a little slow and lack luster....  Basically had to stare someone down for a refill...  Wasnt served or even offered water for that matter... More attentive and observant servers would be nice.  But hey. It's Toronto...  What do you expect"}
{"text":"This is really convenient to the theater district in Toronto and we went there because we are tourists and it said Wayne Gretzky's on the door. Food was OK, nothing special you typical offering of north american food, burgers, fries, blah blah. Comfort food station for sure, so if that is all you need and you don't want surprises or have to think on the menu. This is your place."}
{"text":"TBH, you are only here because you are a hockey fan.  The menu is boring and the execution is uninspired.  I added a skewer or grilled shrimp to a salad, the shrimp arrived cold.  We went on a slow Thursday night.  Service was average,   However, the space was well designed."}
{"text":"I would probably not come here again if I found myself in Toronto, but it's one of those things for tourists to do once and move on.  If there's a live broadcast going on there, like the night we went, that's kind of cool. 

We came in here to watch the Bruins game Friday night.  It served its purpose: we drank ourselves silly and spent way too much money.  The food was edible.  My buddy got the meatloaf and was burping it up all night - always tasty, right?  I got the burger branded with the \"99\" and it didn't repeat on me as much.  

As I said, visit it once to say you've been there because everyone back home has already asked me, \" did you go to Gretzkys?\""}
{"text":"A Gretzky themed Applebees.  Greasy food with cool memorabilia but not much else.  Place seemed a bit messy and dirty.  Beer selection could have been better.  French fries were very good."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant when I was 8 and remember the \"99\" grilled onto my burger bun. Back then it made me so happy.  I returned tonight, some 20 years later and had a fantastic dining experience yet again.

The restaurant is your typical sports bar except with the addition of various pieces of Wayne Gretzky's memorabilia and trophies. In the restrooms he narrates parts of his history to you.

On this occasion I started the meal of sharing cheesy garlic focaccia which was absolutely delicious. I was torn whether or not to follow up with the burger I remember so fondly from childhood or to go for the meatloaf. I went meatloaf and I was not disappointed. It came with garlic mashed potatoes, assorted veg and a red wine gravy. I would definitely eat it again, the meatloaf melted in my mouth and vegetables were wonderfully cooked.

For desert I order the mixed berry tartlet; the shortbread base crumbled like it should and the ice cream was superb. 

Add to this very nice and attentive wait staff and all in all it was a very pleasant experience. I'd even go as far as to say it was a \"Great One\"."}
{"text":"Here for work, stopped because it was down the street from my hotel and seemed worthwhile.

Sat at the bar myself and was greeted pleasantly and promptly. Ordered a draft beer. 

I looked over the menu looking for something eye-poppingly different...nothing really. This is a sports bar after all.

I settled on the wings and the burger. I ended up getting the honey-garlic wings based on the recommendation of my bartender and the \"great one burger\" with a salad instead of fries.

The wings were surprisingly good...crispy and glazed awesomely. Definitely left my hands sticky but they provided the large wet-naps which took care of that.

I couldn't finish the burger after the wings, so I cut it in half. WAY over seasoned and way too salty for a burger. Unimpressed.

A bit about the ambiance: very loud and couldn't have a decent conversation with the bartender without us yelling back and forth over a 2 foot bar.

Total bill with 2 draft beers and a 20% tip with the above = $55. Seems a bit much to me for what I got as it was certainly not a first-class burger as the namesake of the restaurant would let you believe. 

Summed up: Legendary hockey player with a forgettable restaurant."}
{"text":"100% a tourist trap.  

This place is busy before baseball games or other events at the Rogers's center.  However the food is sub-par and the atmosphere is out of the dark ages of the 90's.  

It's a popular spot for hockey fans to take pictures out front, but I don't think this restaurant is relevant anymore. It's time for a complete refresh or a complete tear down!"}
{"text":"Came here twice as it was right beside the hotel I was staying at downtown. They have a cool rooftop patio with a DJ when the weather is nice.  The rooftop menu is limited to three options so I was kind of worried the food might not be that great up there.  I ordered the burger and I was pleasantly surprised. The second time i got a pizza which was very good as well.  Service was quick and drinks were yummy."}
{"text":"This place really is a sh*thole. Bad service, bad food, overpriced...is that the trifecta for a restaurant?

It's a shame that Wayne Gretzky didn't care nearly as much about his investments as he did his career. Maybe he could have something to be proud of post-hockey (coaching and politics definitely didn't work)

Expect a room full of either tourists or townies, naive to the multitude of better pre-Jays game options that surround them."}
{"text":"Worst meal of the year.   Went for holiday lunch.  Soup was over salty.  Drinks were weak.  The crab meat wrap was cold and soggy.  Came with some veggie chips which we all left untouched.  Other diners' burgers were no better.  We all left hungry.  Was excited to visit restaurant since i am a huge fan but left very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is just a review of the rooftop patio, aka Oasis.

We managed to beat the rush on a Friday afternoon a few weeks back to secure a nice couch-style seated area. Within what seemed about 5-10 minutes after 5pm the patio was reaching capacity, so the early bird certainly gets the worm in this place. 

Service was pretty good, as they had both servers coming to the tables as well as the ability to head to the bar to order a drink direct. We even sampled some of the food that seemed appropriate for sharing with a group. The nachos were pretty good, and we did a plate of skewers including chicken, beef, and shrimp options. No complaints on either front.

The one limitation to this patio is although it is a rooftop patio, there isn't much of a view. They have very tall fencing around the sides so you kind of feel a bit disconnected from your surroundings aside from looking at the side of the Holiday Inn building on King St. Luckily the place gets busy enough that you can leave your viewing needs for people watching, as the place does bring an interesting mix of people both young and old.

I'd give it another go, although I'm not sure I'd wait in the huge line that was queuing as I left the place around 6:30pm."}
{"text":"Great patio and bar for drinks with lots of screens for the sports fan.

The food is standard bar food and the prices don't match the quality. In addition, the options are pretty bare and $5 seems to be the add-on price for any ingredient. For example, $5 was the price of a tablespoon contain of ranch sauce. I think I could've bought a whole bottle from the Shopper's Drug mart up the street for cheaper.

They also advertise a $5 menu. A bunch from my table wanted the Friday $5 burger. Our waiter was quick to point out that in the fine print, \"special events excluded\". Apparently, the Blue Jays game on TV was considered a \"special event\" so that makes 162 exclusions right there. Very misleading.

Our group decided to pay for the nachos and beers and move along to Chinatown to get a better meal. We were glad that we did.

Greatest hockey player ever but the opposite when it comes to his restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has mentioned this but The Oasis - Gretzky's rooftop patio - is probably the best place to have a beer in the whole city. 

Beautiful waterfalls, super comfy seating and a view like no other, this is the place to be when the warmer weather hits. A bucket of coronas and I could be here until the sun comes up. 

I've never eaten in the restaurant, but The Oasis is one of those hidden gems you wouldn't know about unless you lived here. 

There is nothing quite as relaxing as sitting on the top of the city on a hot summer day, sipping a beer and letting all your cares just slip away. This place truly is an oasis!"}
{"text":"I decided to go to a place where I can lounge around with a bunch of friends for my birthday so I chose Oasis bar because it looked like a beautiful rooftop patio and very relaxing and fun, boy was I wrong. Upon arriving we had to wait in quite a large line, something I wasn't expecting to do for a bar, but that was alright, so we got to the front of the line and we are a group of six (5 girls, 1 guy) and this tall black male bouncer lets 4 of us in and proceeds to leave 2 girls from our group outside. I asked him why he can't just let the two other girls in because they are with our group and he said he only lets in 4 of a time (something which he failed to mention for the 10 minutes we were standing outside directly beside him) my other friend made a comment about how she's never seen a bouncer break up a group before and asked if he was making this rule up and he absolutely exploded on her threatening to kick her out and tell her to go party somewhere else because he's been having a \"bad day\" and then changed his tantrum to \"I was having a great day until you girls came by\", all we did is question why he couldn't let the other two girls in....my friend basically had to then beg him not to kick us out and apologized to him 10 times until he said fine but only because its her birthday...I honestly would have left right then and there after that embarrassing screaming tantrum he just through at us because that was disrespectful, unfortunately I had friends already upstairs who were meeting us there for my birthday. At that point my whole mood had changed and that bouncer had completely killed my buzz I wasn't in a good mood at all after that. Sorry but if your a bouncer be prepared to deal with a little bit of sass from tipsy girls, its in the job description and if you can't don't have a tantrum threatening to kick everybody out just because you can because you looked like a fool and a 13 year old boy stomping your feet and physically getting into a girls face like that, seriously? thats the most unprofessional and inappropriate thing i've ever seen at a club and I know most bouncers are douche bags but that was the worst and absolutely unnecessary, especially because he let my other two friends in after less than 5 minutes. like really? 

Upon getting inside we went upstairs and the entire patio looks nothing like it does in any of the pictures because they must have renovated. The patio looks quite similar to my grandmothers backyard with a bunch of flowered pots and such everywhere. I wasn't too impressed with it plus there was a bunch of open space allowing for lots of room and no need to make people wait 20 minutes outside the door. 

I didn't eat any food here this time around just had some drinks but I have eaten in this restaurant before and the food is mediocre, nothing special about it at all. Overall this places is filled with power tripping bouncers that have tantrums, the place its self is alright and the crowd is okay too but if you are looking for a place to mingle with other people I wouldn't recommend coming here because people are generally in large groups and talking and hanging out among their groups. I tried to make the best out of my birthday and I did but I would never return to this place again and I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"As expected, this place is very touristy.  Food is average and overpriced which goes along with the touristy motif.  Lots of Gretzky memorabilia which is fun to look at.  Fun place to come once but probably not worth a second trip."}
{"text":"OK place, \"Great One\" burger was OK but kind of plain and seemed overcooked. Asked for poutine instead of fries, got fries instead. When I mentioned it they brought out some poutine which was pretty good. They had a couple of local beers on draft but nothing great. Nice to visit once to say \"I've been there\" but not much else."}
{"text":"It's a huge tourist trap, but we were tourists and are huge hockey fans so of course we had to go to the Great One's restaurant!

It reminded me of a hockey themed Applebee's. The food was pretty basic- burgers, sandwiches, appetizers such as nachos and mozzarella sticks. They had a nice selection of beers and other alcoholic beverages. And the hockey memorabilia was amazing! They have a small gift shop area but everything is very expensive. I did buy a souvenir shotglass and would have liked to have gotten a tshirt as well but they were $35!! So just a shotglass for me.

The location is great. It is right next to the Second City's venue and there is a door in between the two buildings so you can cut right through from the restaurant and vice versa. It's close to the Rogers Centre and the CN Tower. A perfect location for such a place.

I'm glad we went just because of the restaurant's namesake. The food's nothing special but it was still an enjoyable evening out."}
{"text":"Had a meal here last night with my family during their final evening here in Toronto before heading back home.

My 6-year old nephew LOVED this place...but he's a 6-year old boy, that's to be expected.

Our server was great, the decor was nice, the food was meh.  My brother-in-law has eaten here a few times before and he decided to not have a main but order a series of appetizers for his meal instead. Obviously, he's much smarter than the rest of us.  The mains were average at best.

I'm giving it 3-stars because it's great for families and it's not terribly expensive.  

Let's be clear on one thing...this restaurant is for families - families of tourists...it is what it is. 

Of note, if you're looking for a great spot for drinks, sans kids, try their rooftop patio, Oasis, because it rocks."}
{"text":"Stopped by Gretzky's for a late night bite since it was across the street from my hotel. We happened to go on a night when the Jets played the Buffalo Bills. Normally I'm a giants fan but when I'm out of town I'll root for the local team - that wasn't really appreciated at Gretzky's. The food was average and the bartenders seemed annoyed when we requested another round of drinks. Most likely won't be back unless all the other great places in the area are closed or packed."}
{"text":"If you're going here to see some Gretzky memorabilia, you'll see it.  If you're see to watch sports, you'll see that.  If you're here for great tasting food or reasonable prices, you will be disappointed.

In other words, it is what it is - a tourist spot designed to prey on your love of The Great One and to separate you from as many dollars and/or looneys as possible. The atmosphere is cold and stark. The wait staff is instructed to move you out as quickly as possible. The beer selection is mediocre at best.  You probably won't see any reason to return after one visit.

Of note, there used to be a bubble hockey game in the corner, but they took that out, probably to squeeze in an extra table or two."}
{"text":"So, I'm probably biased because I accidentally came in here during an NHL game, but I loved eating at Wayne Gretzky's! The atmosphere just bled Canada + hockey. As a typical American, I had never had poutine before, and wow, was I missing out! I also had the Grandma's Meatloaf, and I highly recommend it as well. The service was wonderfully polite in the way only Canadian service could be. Be sure to give this place a try if you're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Our first night in Toronto and we arrived late so at around 9pm we were looking for a place to eat. And this place was just around the corner from our hotel. We ordered burgers, salad and poutine. Everything was made fresh to order, service was pleasant and efficient and lots of beers on tap. For a celebrity restaurant it was a good joint."}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is \"Yum!\" The poutine, shrimp linguine, and chocolate '99' puck for dessert were absolutely amazing. Also, we stumbled into the restaurant right before a local hockey game - which turned out to be one of the most fun experiences we had in Toronto! Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good I ordered the wings which we great my fellow diners ordered nachos which were huge. The waitress that we had seemed super irritated with us from the moment we walked in. It was midnight on a Saturday but come on lady this your job. When one of my nacho ladies asked for extra sour cream the waitress returned and slammed down a giant bowl of sour cream. I'm not kidding this would have been an entire 8oz of cream. It was extremely rude the way she just threw it on our table not to mention incredibly wasteful, that cream could have lasted us ladies a table of 4 a week. It satisfied our hunger but head over to Wahlburgers instead the service made us feel like we were not welcome."}
{"text":"Not the type of restaurant I typically go to but my son wanted to try it before the Leafs game.  The place was actually nicer than I expected and the food was decent.  I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and a small caesar.  Both were good.  Cesar was authentic.  My son had the BBQ chicken pizza (god knows why but hey, he's 11).  I had a slice and it was fair.  The crust was a bit tough an a little burned around the edge.  The chicken was dry.  Sauce, cheese and grilled corn were a bit better.  The service was slow and a indifferent.  I am giving it three stars because it was actually better than the tourist trap I expected...believe it or not."}
{"text":"Went to Wayne Gretsky's with a group of family before the Blue Jays game. It was not busy at all, yet the service was terrible and the food was cold. Everything was of poor to mediocre quality. The edamame beans have a terrible sweet sauce on them. The wings were soggy, not crispy. The poutine was lukewarm. The pizzas were terrible. The burgers, breakfast sandwiches and accompanying fries and tater tots were cold. The service was brutally slow. We could not find the server when needed. For example, to pay the bill , which took forever. The server did not tell the bartender that we had settled up for our drinks, and after leaving, the bartender chased our group along the sidewalk outside and accused us of leaving without paying! Absolutely the worst service from start to finish. Will never return! It's a shame the Wayne Gretzky has his name associated with this place."}
{"text":"Well When I First Saw The Place From Outside I Notice There is a Big Ass #99 Out The Front Door Which is Pretty Amazing but looks kind of Small as well but once I Got inside it Feel Like \"Hockey Heaven\" lol lol but All Around Great Place to Watch Sports as well and The Food is Pretty Good as well and Plenty of Big Screen Tvs as we......  Pixs Coming Soon 


Overall rate 7.5 out of 10"}
{"text":"Food to the rescue! Our group of Legendary four were in serious need of food after climbing the stairs of the CN Tower and with Gretzky's close by we figured it was the best option.
Though its your typical pub, it also has a finer dining area for those who want to keep it low key.  The atmosphere is very Pro-Gretzky lol..with his sports memorbilia and pictures hanging throughout the restaurant.
The only drawback is the service as it was slow...and when you're hungry time seems to be an essences :'(
On Thursdays their $6 dollar special on selected appetizers and drinks was an easy sell to our group.
Amongst the list of things we had ordered, their fried pickles, Bruschetta and nachos was awesome. 
However their buffalo dumplings (which looked like samosas) looked quite disgusting Lol.

Overall. This place is okay, the bar food and prices are reasonable but their finer dining options for food isnt worth paying for...just head over to King west for better options."}
{"text":"The downstairs is a pretty standard pub-type restaurant and the food is on par with typical pub food.  The upstairs Oasis bar is worth a visit.

If going to Second City, there are a lot of nice restaurants in the area.  Though, if  you're going for a night out in the summer, the Oasis is one of the coolest vibes (and rooftop patios) in the city.  When I went, the crowd was mixed ages, mostly 20 and 30 somethings, and they were all well dressed.

The patio seating was varied and we ended up in a lounge type area (U-shaped soft white pillow bench seating) in the back corner, with a server getting us drinks.  I'm not sure if this area is normally reserved, but we ended up taking it over.

Overall, the decor was pretty awesome, reminiscent of a tropical beach bar, and the music was upbeat.  I'd return here if I wanted to show people a great place to party in Toronto."}
{"text":"Had been to Wayne Gretzky's some 20 years ago when I was last in Toronto with my wife. I honestly can't recall if it was always in this location. But it didn't look like I had remembered it. Anyways...kinda reluctantly brought my boys here on a late Thursday night after visiting the Tower and nearby Aquarium- as my oldest son plays hockey. Place was only 30-40% filled. Leafs game was on the tube and most of the patrons were at the bar watching. We were seated right away and our waitress took our drink order. Drinks came out reasonably quick- yet food took sometime to get to our table. Food wasn't bad; wasn't great- nothing too memorable. What WAS frustrating is they were out of two of my first choices for an entree. Did settle for the fish tacos- which were quite good. Ordered the #99 pretzel- which my son seemed to enjoy. My other son ordered the Great One burger which looked rather uninspiring. Have to say the best part of our visit was checking out the extensive showcase of The Great Ones memorabilia. Don't know if we would visit again."}
{"text":"Well I came here one evening with a few friends who were from outta town . 
I must say I was pleasantly surprised.
The food was decent and drink prices were alright .if your around the corner it's definitely worth giving a try and catching a game ."}
{"text":"WOW CHRIS P!!. I read your Oh Boy! review and quite liked it. But i scrolled down just slightly and saw your review for Gretzky's.
 Are you joking me?

How dare you give it 5 stars. You make Yelp look irrelevant.
Its the opposite of what Toronto needs for a good bar.
Every time I have been to Gretzky's the service is very poor, not in efficiency, but in attitude.
The prices are more expensive than many good quality restaurants, and for what? A burger grilled with 99 on top that tastes like a literal hockey puck, and served by someone who really doesn't give a shit!

I really do feel there is still a huge market opportunity for some great sports bars in Toronto, considering we are supposed to be a great sports city. If and when the time comes where a sports bar opens downtown that is not cheesy, with bad food, ridiculous prices and lousy servers/bartenders, then Chris P maybe you'll re-evaluate your 5 STAR review for Gretzky's, maybe i'll buy you a pint too, and kat.

p.s.  I have decided to change Gretzky's from 1 star to 2 stars based on their summer rooftop patio, which is cool and a great spot to bring people for a beer or two."}
{"text":"Great service but soooooo predictable.  If you are after a few screens and a beer, enjoy but otherwise go explore."}
{"text":"Brutal, brutal, brutal service.  You will be literally standing at the counter, waiting to pay for your 7 dollar pint of domestic garbage and the bartenders will just completely ignore you because they're busy with whatever customers have already been tipping them all night.

1/5 stars for the service, food, and drink.  Bumped it to 2/5 because their rooftop patio is pretty decent.

Cover charge for UFC night is lame as well."}
{"text":"Came here with my Dad a couple of years ago for lunch.  Stopped in on the way to the HHOF and then a Leafs game.  Had the Mediterranean Shrimp Linguini and it was tasty, though I wish I would have tried something a bit more \"bar food-y.\"

Was definitely cool to watch Scott Laughlin on NHL XM just a few feet away!"}
{"text":"When it's named after the owner, you'd expect it to be a really great one.  Wayne's is a decent enough place, and with the legacy of the name, you have some fairly large expectations.  It's nice enough, but though it's not \"Phoenix Coyotes\" Gretzky, it sure isn't \"Edmonton Oilers\" Gretzky either.

It finds itself in the heart of the downtown theatre district with Second City (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-second-city-mainstage-theatre-toronto) found right behind it.  The menu is pretty much what you'd expect from a restaurant owned by a hockey great.  It's narrow enough, but a bit expensive for what you get.  As well, there are some naming conventions that you have to deal with like the \"Great One Burger\" (you knew that had to be in there at some point) and the \"Gretzky's Famous Meatloaf\" (Seriously?  You're saying THAT's how he made a name for himself?  Huh.).

The one thing this place does have going for it is the patio.  Found atop the restaurant, Gretzky's calls its patio the \"Oasis\", which it truly is, giving one of the most interesting views of any patio found in the city.  I'd suggest going for the patio and use the relaxing time up top to think of things that made Gretzky the Great One that didn't include meatloaf."}
{"text":"Had a nice evening here this weekend, catching the hockey game and sharing some appetizers. The pierogies and buffalo wontons were standouts and the beer was cold. A bit pricy but it was good food."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the fact The Great One endorses this place, I wouldn't have given this place a second thought. It's a generic sports bar. Ok, I lied, there's this waitress/bartender that i thought was super cute. but that's THE ONLY reason I came back.

You've got tons of TV's around you. On a typical january weekend, you'll have yourself split between the Raptors, Leafs, NFL Playoffs and whatever other Canadian hockey team is playing at that time. It's good thing, trust me.

Their food is nothing special. You've got the usual pub fare and some comfort foods with Gretzky's endorsement like \"Grandma Gretzky's Perogi's.\" It's a plate of baked or lightly fried perogis topped like a loaded baked potato. (sour cream, choices and sprinkled with bacon) I didn't like it.

Their meat loaf was nothing special either. you're here for beer and hockey, stick to that."}
{"text":"Very underrated food. I love coming here for a quick bite and to watch my sports. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. They also do a very good brunch. I give it 5 stars because Wayne deserves it #99"}
{"text":"I probably would have never come here on my own, but my company was doing it's summer event lunch here after we watched a show at Second City.

I don't know what I can say that others have already said about this place. We came in for a buffet lunch and they served Southern food.. ribs, collard greens, biscuits, chicken fried steak.. but everything was COLD. Even the food they were bringing out to replenish was cold. There was no gravy for the chicken fried steak. And does it seem a bit odd to you that a place like Gretzky's would serve Southern food? They should have just stuck to things a pub would be good at, like sliders and chicken wings. 

The servers were pretty good though, quick and attentive and they actually came back to check on us and take away our plates. 

I didn't even find the memorabilia to be cool, and I'm a huge hockey fan (albeit,  not a huge Gretzky fan).. but still.

I didn't get a chance to look at the regular menu, but it's okay. I definitely wouldn't come back. There are better choices downtown for sure."}
{"text":"What an odd place.  Visiting Toronto for work I met up with a great old friend here for some food and beers, lots of beers.  Came because it was close to the hotel, I wanted to watch a NCAA college football game, and I'm in Toronto, Canada and the place is named after Wayne Gretzky.  I also learned it isn't spelled \"Gretzsky\".  Tons of the \"Great One\" memorabilia on display.  Staff was hit or miss, I actually liked the bald guy behind the bar best, he was on the spot on our orders and refreshing my 7 beers, always right when I needed another Molson Canadian.  The rest of the staff seems to be there mainly for aesthetic purposes, lots of makeup, lot's of um, enhancements, I guess is the best word for it.  

I don't know if I would return, there was a Maple Leafs game my night so the place was pretty crowded with Toronto and Boston fans, and they were doing some sort of live radio show from the bar itself.  I haven't followed hockey in years so I was kind of lost by this.  After the game started the place actually cleared out as fans left for the game.  They were nice enough to put my game on one of the TVs behind the bar amidst all of the hockey games.  A bit on the expensive side, but much nicer inside than it looks from the street.  It was a block from my hotel so that was nice as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Wayne Gretzky's to catch the Bruins vs. Blackhawks game on their roof deck.  I was actually quite impressed with their roof deck.  The bar on the roof is much larger than I imagined and had a large water fountain in the center of the deck with comfy outdoor couches and high top tables surrounding it.  As soon as we sat down, our server gave us menus and took our drink order.  The drinks were what you would expect at a sports bar, made to get you drunk rather than for you to admire your cocktail.  Beer was also on the pricer side.  It was a fun place to enjoy the hockey game, however.  We quickly understood why Wayne Gretzky's is so popular."}
{"text":"Had a 4:30 dinner reservation for 6 on Saturday 11/12/2016. Arrived at 4:15 and were seated immediately. Service was friendly and attentive. Good local beer & wine selection. I enjoyed the sirloin steak, and everybody in our party was happy with their meal, especially the poutine, which was a rare treat for us, being from the US.  My 4 year old son loved the fact that \"99\" was branded on his cheeseburger bun. The most interesting Gretzky memorabilia is in the hallway by the restrooms."}
{"text":"This place is so bad in group bookings. I've emailed them twice (once before their renovations and once after) and NO ONE EVER GETS BACK TO YOU. And I even send a follow up email. I had two party (one was for 50 and the other was for 100) and no one responds back? This is ridiculous. I'm sure the neighbouring restaurants/bars appreciated our business of 10K plus those two nights. Something is seriously wrong with management or something."}
{"text":"Of the average places I think of to go for a chain restaurant experience that may or may not have a theme or TV at the bar playing sports, this is a bit below those.

If you just want to see some Wayne Gretsky stuff, enter the restaurant from Second City. There is a lot of it outside the washrooms in the hallway.

If you want to eat a large portion of salty meatloaf that tastes like it came from the freezer at Costco, or a Caesar salad with a bit of brown lettuce, this is good for that as well.

There are places that are \"good\" average because they have something you really wanted like good wings, cold beer, or the best TVs. This is a \"bad\" average place with mediocre food and no real standout qualities that would make you want to come back.

Wayne Gretsky could do much better than this."}
{"text":"This was a horrible place to eat, I came there on Sunday 28th with a friend of mine after the jays game and it took us a while to get seated, once we got seated 15 minutes past and the waitress finally came over to take give us our menu and not to long after that we ordered. Fast forward to ONE HOUR AND A HALF LATER WE STILL haven't gotten our burgers. All we orderd were burgers with a side salad. We finally called the manager over and asked what the hold up was and she blamed the jays game- which is a terrible excuse cause the place wasn't even that busy and my friend said last time she was here it was the same terrible service and there was no jays game. So our burgers finally came out after 2 hours. 2 HOURS! My friend and I were almost ready to walk out at that point, and after we gobbled our food since we were so hungry, we immediately felt sick. My friend ended up getting food poisoning, while I was  more luckier and just had severe stomach pains. Anyway , I would not suggest this place to anyone unless u want long wait times and cold medicore food that makes you sick."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food was pretty good and being surrounded by all the memorabilia was great!!"}
{"text":"Wayne Gretzky's is a pretty great sports bar.  Good, local, Canadian craft beer on tap (pitchers available).  Good, reasonably priced bar food.  15 or so large Samsung flatscreens strategically placed, playing the big sporting event in HD.  Lots of Gretzky paraphenalia on display."}
{"text":"Went in a Sunday night.  Place was DEAD but the wait staff was incredible.  Seems to be that way everywhere in Toronto though compared to the states.  I was expecting a Planet Hollywood-esque place but it's a little classier.  Moderately priced. I had the southern style poutine as my entree and was impressed.  Turned out to be my best meal the while trip!"}
{"text":"Absolutely unbelievable experience! Memorabilia everywhere! Great food, amazing staff! Lots of staff and great attitudes aswell! Sports playing on all of the screens which there are alot of BTW!! Had a great time!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We were here for the Mayweather fight and Andrew the bar manager made sure that the experience was exceptional.
Zeke made sure that the entire bar was a well oiled machine. If you're in Toronto you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is cause our waitress was super nice and attentive. Food was terrible I had the fish and chips, fish was basically just a sponge filled with oil horrible texture and dripping with oil fries no better. My friend got a cheeseburger way over cooked and completely flavorless"}
{"text":"Went to the rooftop for a friend's birthday. The server was very rude and thus no one tipped her(she threw the receipt on the table when she found out we didn't tip). Traded seats with another group of guys because we didn't fit and there didn't seem to be a problem.. until they told us that we had to leave because the spot was reserved for someone else. My friend tried telling our new (&better) server that the webpage said that they didn't take reservations but the server said that we had to leave within 10 minutes (they didn't even bother to accommodate us). The security guard came and asked aggressively if there was a problem. We all felt disgusted and super disrespected. I felt bad for my friend because it was indeed her birthday. We all decided to leave and never go back there again. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"The bar probably could have been a lot of fun for the hockey enthusiast, so maybe they should just turn the whole place into just that, but to call it a Restaurant brings higher expectations that were not met.  We found the restaurant in a tour book that specified \"kid friendly\" and even did a sweep of the restaurant to make sure that it really was kid friendly joint (we understant that not every place is ready for our toddlers!) and found that it was loud enough, there were other children and a kids menu... great!  Then, we were seated by an unfriendly hostess that seemed annoyed by our request for a high chair and even more annoyed that we were shocked that they had ONE high chair in the whole place that was being used.  We stayed, not wanting to be \"that family\" and we didnt really have another dining option since it cost a ridiculous $15 to park our car six blocks away.  We opted for a booster for my son and began perusing the menu while waiting for drinks.  The service was okay, not too great (lots of time spent without beverages) and not too friendly, but not unfriendly either.  Everyone that worked there just acted as though they had slightly more important things to do.  The menu options were decent, but the prices were a little out of control... $7.99 for a kids mac n cheese?!?! Our kids shared their meal and my husband and I opted to share the meatloaf and an order of focacia bread, which was ridiculously priced for what we got.  The bread was something you should have gotten free while waiting, it was a little hard and was THREE two inch thick slices with a little olive oil and balsamic for dipping, for $4.99.  The meatloaf (a recipe of Gretzky's mothers) was good and we got two huge slices of it, so it was definitely a shareable meal but it was still high priced for what it was. The other adult in our party got the fish and chips after asking the server if there was a similar \"soup and salad\" combo as listed in the lunch menu, he responded (while looking at his other tables and not at us) that there were some good salads to choose from.  Duh, we are looking at the salad section of the menu. At the end of the meal, we were out $70 (not including parking) for bread, meatloaf, fish and chips, mac n cheese and two sodas.  I understand that you pay for ambiance, but this was a bit out of control, especially since the ambiance was only a bunch of Wayne Gretztky's hockey stuff."}
{"text":"It's just OK here.  Typical commercial joint with some pricier entrees, sandwiches, soups and salads.

Nothing mind blowing here... move along.

Had the burger.  My wife at the chicken & brie sandwich.

Meh.  Do it if you are in a time crunch and on your way to the Jays game.  Otherwise... don't even bother.

The great one's restaurant is not so great."}
{"text":"Awful. Menu is all over the place. Food is mediocre at best and the SERVICE is terrible. BEWARE 15% tip is added to your bill without telling you! Overpriced menu. This place has no idea what they are doing. Gretz needs to stick to hockey. Stay away."}
{"text":"Summer's finally here and that means one thing -- rooftop patios! It's hard to imagine a nicer way to end the day than sipping cocktails under the stars while enjoying a nice view of the city. I found out about Oasis from a friend. It's not a place that you would find unless you were looking for it and on a weeknight it's busy, but not too crowded. There is a separate entrance to \"Oasis\" just off Mercer St. (to the right of the Second City doors). It feels like a secret local hangout even though it's right in the middle of the most touristy neighbourhood. You have to walk up several flights of stairs to the rooftop. There you'll be met with a urban oasis -- cushy couches to lounge on, heating lamps (if it gets chilly, as this place is open May-October), strings of lights hanging above, even a \"waterfall\". 

The menu currently on offer is bare-bones (cheeseburger, cajun turkey burger, salad, pizza) and the drinks menu is also pretty small (about 5 or 6 kinds of wine by the glass, a few martinis, caesars). However, they are introducing a special summer menu next week. Starting next week, there will also be nightly specials (e.g. martini monday's). I had the cheeseburger ($14), which was good. Nothing special, but I can't complain -- you don't really come here with high expectations for food. It came with a simple side salad of spring mix and balsamic vinaigrette (or you could choose tortilla chips and salsa). I also had the \"Beach Bum\" ($9) martini which had some kind of fruity vodka, pineapple juice, and lime. It was nice and refreshing. 

Music was a random selection of top 40 and some old stuff, like Weezer's Blue Album. Relaxed summer music. Smoking IS allowed (and a lot of people were smoking when I came), so if you are like me and not super-thrilled about second-hand smoke, pick your table carefully."}
{"text":"Average or
Below all the way around AND I wanted to like it. The menu lacks creativity and flavor! The drinks - don't waste your money they are watered down and below average. If you get the old fashion it will 10x exceed your sugar quota for the week you couldn't even taste the rye. The service was okay but when you talked about the drinks and how you want them \"your way\" that didn't go over too well. If you are there for the hockey memorabilia and average food and drinks then this is your place. I wouldn't  go back."}
{"text":"Came here for some appetizers and they had good wings! Got honey garlic and hot and honey and it was so good. Service was good although it was slow at times just because our server had so many tables to deal with. Food came pretty quick and it's a decent price."}
{"text":"I have a huge pet peeve and Gretzky's just struck the nerve. I asked to swap out my fries with a wedge salad and was told no, I could swap out for a Cassar or regular salad. I even said I'd pay an extra couple of dollars. No, the kitchen won't do it. I said...but the wedge is cheaper than the Caesar. No dice.

It's lettuce with blue cheese dressing instead of Caesar. I'll never understand why restaurants draw arbitrary lines over such stupid things...the pet peeve.

Instead of a happy customer, they have an annoyed one that won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I generally do not have very high expectations of celebrity restaurants (unless the owner is a celebrity chef, of course).  The outside of the building is cleverly decorated with a giant revolving table hockey player above the front door, and of course the hockey theme is carried throughout the interior as well.  The first thing you see when you walk in the door (after you've stepped past the beggar hanging out on the front steps), is the gift shop, selling T-shirts and hats and whatnot that let you tell everyone at what restaurant you've eaten.

The bar area is large, and befitting a sports-themed restaurant is filled with television monitors.   In July, there's no live hockey to watch, but at least it wasn't all poker and golf.  The Canadian beer selection on tap is impressive with something for just about every beer taste out there.  The food, on the other hand, was uninspired and boring.  The menu selections would be best described as \"non-threatening\" to the most timid palates.  What little inventiveness there is on the menu is kind of bizarre and unfocused - $19 will buy you macaroni and cheese with \"creole\" chicken mixed in.  

The prices are a little high, but the service was pretty good.  The restaurant would be more enjoyable with a large group or as a sports bar-only outing."}
{"text":"This one was a waste. Just walk over to Jack Astor's or Earls or Moxies for something resembling FLAVOUR or SERVICE.
First, how could it be a sports bar if anything you eat here is so greasy that you will never be able to move let alone participate in any sports? Well never mind, the hamburger was greasy and flavourless. Fact. It was as bad as the Wahlburger, but at least was cheaper believe it or not.
Service was nothing special bad or good. However, come on show you care a little - just a little politeness.
The washrooms were a mess and completely need an overhaul my goodness. Earl's or Cactus Club would never let that stand. I felt most Chinatown washrooms had cleaner facilities.
There is a 99 on the sidewalk and jerseys and photos so pop in, take a look and leave!

Wayne might have been a good hockey player, but after that it is all a mess. This visit made me recall how he failed as a coach, as an owner and in his politics and now this."}
{"text":"Great sports restaurant/ bar for all hockey/ Gretzky fans. Fine selection of food and drink. Friendly,accommodating,attentive staff.  The Great One Burger  is A tradition for me. Definitely recommend. Salads are good too."}
{"text":"Cool place & I enjoyed the sausage bolognese it tasted great! Led Zeppelin's on the radio & hockey is on the tv I am back in Toronto"}
{"text":"Only had drinks here but was a really cool place. Hung out at the rooftop \"Oasis\" bar which was a really cool space. Set up like your buddy's deck at his house. Lots of big chairs to sit in and watch the game. A few tables for conversing. Bar. Just has a better view than your buddy's house. The drink selection was pretty sparse, but it was the first weekend open and the bar wasn't fully stocked yet. 

The rest of the place was pretty cool. Tons of memorabilia of the second greatest hockey player of all time.... (hey, I'm from Pittsburgh, what do you expect). 

Looking forward to checking out again to try the food the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"This sports bar is average.    The food is average.  The service is good.  The prices are a bit higher then average.  The noise inside is a bit louder then average.  I think you get my average review by now. Toronto has so many above average places I would keep looking for something better.  He shoots....  he misses!"}
{"text":"Food: Breakaway Burger was excellent. I was impressed, as the bun and meat altogether with topping was great. Fries, on the other hand, were average, not as crisp but a helpful portion. 


As a college student, the prices were a bit high, but the meal met its value. Pitcher of Coors was $22 and I had three beers that complemented the burger quite well. We were seated immediately at 5 PM on a Saturday. I would suggest going here."}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about this place. I didn't find it to be much better than any other kind of sports bar. 

I ordered a steak with vegetable and baked potato side. 

Didn't find the food to be that spectacular to be honest. Just something that got the job done. 

I did find the service to be great with attentive servers, despite the length of time it took for the food to come out. 

The ambiance was nice, clean,  and a decent size. 

I didn't get to go out to the rooftop but I'm sure it's a nice addition to this place. 

Other than that, i don't really see me returning."}
{"text":"Came here because we were tourist and huge ranger fans. Came on Canada day and wasn't too busy. Service is a little lacking but its a sports bar so that is expected. Bigger inside than what it appears from the outside. The wings are tabled shared was the best part of the meal. The jerk wings are spicy and really good but the buffalo wing with blue cheese crumbles wing was ok. I tried the Gretzky's famous 99 burger, my girlfriend ordered and for some stupid reason they only served it medium well. Seriously.. why not medium rare like a good burger should be or very least medium. Had a bite and tasted rubbery and chewy. I had the turkey burger with salsa and guacamole which wasn't anything special. Lacked flavor so I had to smother it in mustard. Had a side of chicken soup instead of my fries which tasting like store bought chicken stock, couple dices of minced chicken and very few vegetables. Very disappointing. I think the drinks were the worst part. We all had cocktails and did not want a second because we couldn't taste any alcohol in our drinks... Glad I came for the gift shop, the small display of Gretzky's info and career but wouldn't come back and would not recommend this place unless your a huge #99 fanatic like us."}
{"text":"This place really cares about its customers! Came here for brunch after a night of drinking and I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of salad. When I got my food, I began eating my salad and after about 5 minutes, the waitress came with my plate of food. Turns out I didn't really pay attention to the fact that I had a burger on my plate, instead of the chicken and waffle sandwich. The waitress apologized profusely and I'm not one to fuss at all about a mistake like that. I said it's completely okay and that mistakes can happen. I really didn't mind and I didn't even notice. Anyways, after enjoying my meal and going to pay for the bill, the waitress told me that the manager said it was free of charge. 

Normally, I would speak up and say something if I were given the wrong meal. But this time I really didn't mind (perhaps after the night of drinking) and didn't make any comments. I said it was completely okay. I would only expect the manager to cover the meal, had I spoken up. But I didn't and was ready to pay for my meal and they covered it. This definitely shows that this place cares!"}
{"text":"Wayne Gretzky's is a Toronto institution, no doubt. With tons of memorabilia and cool stuff around. The washroom features narrations from Wayne's sporting past. We had an amazing waitress named Alex who was a huge help. Professional, funny and cool. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT ORDER THE NACHOS. They pre-hose them down with sour cream to the point where they are inedible to anyone who likes nachos made up of less than 96% sour cream. 
All in all a good time, super Canadian, and Alex is the best waitress in the city."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The drinks at the bar are half the size of s normal pour. The hostesses are idiots and can't even control a crowd so the people in the bar aren't frozen by clients standing in line to come in with all doors open. The poutine is subpar and the burgers are worse than McDonalds. The T-shirt's for sale are the highlight. Really not worth a visit other than to the gift shop. Major major disappointment."}
{"text":"Fun for what it is. Salmon was good, salad was good, friend had meatloaf, not very good. Great TV set up for games. Loved 99!"}
{"text":"I love the great one he is a great guy so I was excited to go and taste the food, Its a typical sports bar like you see everywhere in every town. The service was fantastic but the food is nothing to brag about ... I wasn't overly hungry so I had the tomato goat cheese flatbread....... I mean the 3 inches of diced tomatoes with non existent cheese, My bro had the great one burger was good..... but nothing to go back home and tell your friends about it, my sin had the mac and cheese which he said it was good. There is lots of much better restaurants in Toronto , I will not go back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"During my trip to Toronto, this was number 2 on my list, after the Hockey Hall of Fame.  Showed up for dinner and the place was packed.  The food was just OK, as the service.  Not inexpensive, either.  Kind of dissapointing:  I love WG and expected any place with his name on it to be awesome, like Chelios' place in Detroit, or Seau's in San Diego.  This was basically just a TGIFridays with some Gretzy memorabilia"}
{"text":"The margherita pizza and coconut blended drink were delicious.  Our waiter was very helpful and checked in on us frequently.  The prices seemed reasonable, I felt I got a lot of food for the money.  I'm not a hockey fan but the memorabilia display in the back of the restaurant was nice."}
{"text":"I'd stay away.  Unfortunately the greatness that is #99 does not make its way to his kitchen. 


Chicken wings were slightly raw and fries were so so. 

Management dealt with it but did not take it seriously unfortunately."}
{"text":"We had half an hour to kill before our new years party next door at Mascot Brewery so we decided to come here for a quick bite and drinks. As we walked in, the girl said you have to be out by 10 because they were closing down. Totally understandable but that was pretty blunt, I'm sure there was a nicer way to say it.

Anyways, we were starving so we got seated, ordered our drinks, perogies and sweet potatoe fries. Pergoies was good with the sour cream and bacon. Nothing to special about it, just steamed dumplings and the sweet potato fries were O kay. No sauce on the side? 

Waitress came with our bill and we got the hint, paid and left. Don't think we'll be coming back here at all."}
{"text":"Bad food. UGH! At least I had really low expectations, so I wasn't really surprised when the food hit the table.

My dad was in town. Being from Brantford (hometown of the Great One) he just had to check out Wayne Gretzky's.

Overall:

Staff/service - 3.5 star - friendly, helpful polite waiter. Food took a bit longer than necessary to come out but nothing outrageous.

Decor - 3.5-4 star. More upscale than you would imagine, it's nicer than a mere sports bar. Absolutely massive interior.

Rooftop patio - 5 star, hello, it's beautiful! 

Food - 1-2 star. Yuck. Do NOT have the pizzas. They used a pre-made frozen crust of some sort. It was like cardboard. Thick too. Totally gross. We tried the South-Western pizza and they actually squirted some sort of cheese whiz looking crap all over the top. Disgusting. The crab cakes were kind of decent, but they ruined them by placing them on some kind of disgusting huge pile of mayo/tartar sauce and I had to scrape it off with a spoon. Overall, no love whatsoever put into the food and it was too expensive considering nothing was made from scratch.

But yeah....the rooftop patio is worth a trip. Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow. A saddening low point to an amazing visit in Toronto. 7 pm on a weds night, six people in the bar and music blaring so loud the hostess had to actual yell to communicate with us. We asked if there was a quieter area and we were taken to the back. Ordered nachos and drinks. The food and drinks were returned pretty quick. No silverware was brought. Once they brought the food and first round they left us there never to return. We had to go find someone to get and pay the bill. And hands down the worst nachos I've ever had. Chips and a bit of cheese melted on here and there. 

THE BATHROOMS:  not just the men's. The women's as well. Trash cans overflowing. Floors soaked and just a total mess. Didn't want to touch anything. They say check the bathroom to see how good a place is. This said it all. There was a Blue Jays game that day and they probably got slammed but this was several hours after the game ended. 

The only reason I gave WG two stars instead of one is the hostess. Super cool, super helpful. 

IN A NUTSHELL: If you are a big Wayne Gretzky fan go in, grab a beer and check out the wall of memorabilia. Then eat somewhere else. If you charge $40 for a steak you shouldn't need a canoe to get thru the bathroom. 

I can only imagine that Wayne has no idea. At least I hope he doesn't."}
{"text":"Great service! The waitress was super sweet to my little guy. Beer was delicious, as well as the poutine. Hey also had a golf ball giveaway with a beer! We also loved that the waitress showed us where the museum area was in the back. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"For Oasis: Patio is stucked between condos and skycrapers; Better if you have a friend in one of the condos, so you can chat with him from the patio. Food was poor and service was slow. Setting of the patio could be nice, whether it was cleaner. All cushions are dirty, with suspicious marks... how could have this patio been listed as a top 10 in Toronto? becasue of the fountain, surely, that is original. Go on the roof to see it, then go down in the Gretzky's to eat (menu is larger there and food better)."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I don't remember exactly what I had, but we went for dinner. The portions were large and the beer was good. The walls are covered with Wayne Gretzky memorabilia. Even when you go to the washroom, there are interviews with Gretzky playing. Pretty awesome. Anyway, you'll also notice that Gretz has his own wine. It's actually really expensive so I'd look to get it elsewhere. Anyway, it's close to the CBC, so if you were there for The Hour, you can head over for a bite to eat afterwards."}
{"text":"It is Gretzky's that starts it off right. It is nice inside. The servers were friendly and attentive.

The wings were excellent and the nachos plentiful."}
{"text":"Wayne Gretzky's Restaurant, the one and only, has typical pub food.  What makes this place stand out is all the authentic Gretzky memorabilia that is displayed along the walls near the bathroom.  Check it out when you go.

Although the restobar is on Blue Jays Way, it isn't super close to the Rogers Centre."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this bar except the name.

I ordered a beer and poutine.  My girlfriend got 2 martinis.  She the Candy Apple martini, which was really sweet with not much alcohol.  And The Great One Cosmo, which was stronger, and better.  Both were 7.99 each.

The poutine was like New York Fries with gravy, it was alright.  Can't comment on any other food because that's all we ordered.  

Overall, I don't see why anyone should come here when there are so many other sports bars out there.

{"text":"I've been here a number of times and love this place.  The place is obviously owned by the greatest hockey player of all time, Wayne Gretzky.  If you are a fan of the game of hockey, this is a must do while in Toronto.  Even if you are not into hockey, they still offer up some good food and have a cool rooftop bar.  I have tried many of the menu items and although nothing is overwhelmingly amazing, everything is good and I have not had a bad meal here yet.  Some of my favorite menu items are the perogies, wings, ribs, meatloaf, and the penne diablo.  They also offer a chocolate cake for desert that is quite the spectacle.  It's called the triple chocolate colossus cake and it's a ten layer slice of chocolate cake.  10 layers!  It's about a foot high.  Made for sharing obviously.  Last time I was there, four of us could eat only about half of it after our meal.  I must say that it was a bit dry the two times I have ordered it though.  Not sure if I caught them on off days or what.  If it were moist, it would have been very good, but dry.. not so great.

There is a lot of great hockey and Gretzky memorabilia around the place to look at.  A mini museum really, dedicated to Wayne and the game he loves.

The main floor here is separated into a dining room and a bar area.  The bar area is very cool and has a  small sitting lounge off to the side.  They also have a rooftop with lot's of seating and a bar as well.  I like to have dinner downstairs and then go up and spend some time on the roof.

I have been here a few times before and after Blue Jays games and the place has been packed with Jays fans since the stadium is just a few blocks away.  If you are a hockey fan, the hockey hall of fame is about a 10 - 15 minute walk from here.  The Second City Comedy Club is also located in the same building as Gretzky's.

Overall, a great place to check out if you are downtown!"}
{"text":"The food is decent for a sports bar. I had the mushroom burger, my son's hamburger with cheese was good also. It's better than walburger which is also in the neighbourhood and not as expensive. Lots of room in the seating area and aaa e had good service when we went but it was not during routine dinner rush hour"}
{"text":"I was really impressed here.  It was classier than your regular sports pub and has a restaurant, bar, and lounge all spaced nicely into one neat package.  The food was fantastic, I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and veggies.  Of course the beer was great as I was here for a Big Rock event, so you can't frown at free Traditional Ale and prizes.  The staff were also fantastic!

If you've never been here you can expect to pay $20-25 for an entree and the menu is vast enough that any type of group you're with can find something they'll enjoy.

Despite the angry looks I got from Leafs fans as I walked out of the bar with my Flames jersey on, (Flames won 5-2) I had a great time!"}
{"text":"Oasis Rooftop Patio is okay for groups or friends who want to catch up. If you're looking for a party or to meet new people, go elsewhere.

WAHHHH! I dislike this place. It's the second time I've been here and honestly, it has such a pretentious atmosphere. It's ALL seating, which is fine, but it has more of a restaurant ambience than a bar or lounge. There's no dance floor and there's no standing/mingling culture. So the chances of you mingling and meeting new people is almost out of the question. Both times that I've been, the crowd was VERY yuppy and very boring (no offence if you love this place)... My best friend is an untamed lioness so I think her big personality and high-volume-voice got a few looks from uptight losers, which shouldn't be the case on a Saturday night out! She did get hit on by an eager beaver Blackberry employee...Highlight of my night.

The place is okay. There's a fountain that people like taking pictures in front of. But to be honest, the fountain at Woodbine Mall is more impressive. There's also a plastic palm tree. I guess it's cool? The suicidal looks on all the servers' faces was somewhat entertaining, except when you realized you had to tip them.

We ended up leaving after a few drinks and accidentally stumbling into The Underground Garage Urban Saloon, which I will be giving like 10 million stars!"}
{"text":"Two mindblowing things about Gretzky's: their flawless summer rooftop patio and their chicken wings. Visit the bar on a Monday night for all you can eat ($10!) wings the size of KFC drumsticks in almost 10 different flavours. Out of this world.

However-- as with most places in the heart of the entertainment district, Gretzky's is overpriced & often over-crowded. The service is hit or miss; efficient but rude. Great place to drink and watch the game, though-- and aside from St. Louis or Gabby's, there isn't much competition in the area."}
{"text":"The food was nothing to write home about.  The burger had a 99 \"branded\" into the bun.  The atmosphere was cool though, especially during the 2004 Stanley Cup quarterfinals and the Leafs and Sens playing that night.  The bar half was packed and insanely loud.  For that moment I wish I were a Leafs fan, as it's hard to find that many hockey fans here (the US) that will pack into a bar and have that much enthusiasm.

I would probably go back if I were watching a game, not for the food."}
{"text":"I've been here before. There really is nothing special about this place. The service is average. The food is average. I had a burger. It isn't something that I just have to have again. I hear that Wayne goes there sometimes. Now that would be memorable. Overall, it is a nice sports bar that happens to be Wayne's World!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and food was horrible. My sons wings were burnt. He had to peel off the skin just to try and get to the meat. I had a wrap and it had no taste. Not once were we offered refills. Waited 15 mins before they came to ask if we were done. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The portobello burger I had was okay as were the fries. They have a few selections of beer on tap and the noise level is quite loud. My advice would be for Gretzky to \"stick\" to his hockey fame or give this place a genuine refresh on all food services."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch before leaving Toronto! It is an amazing place to check out.  There are a lot of hockey memorabilia around the restaurant...even on the way to the restroom.  The vibe is pretty awesome, you can watch any type of game here.  I tried ordering a burger but apparently you can only order daily specials at the bar.  I was a little disappointed to hear that.  Generally you can order any specials in any sections of the restaurant other than happy hour.  Anyways I got a breakaway burger and a rocket salad.  Both of these were great choices and delectable.  I wish the burger had a size but it did not.  This place gets a three because of price point.  The rocket salad was $3 but the burger was $13 and it didn't even have a side. I feel like this place has higher prices because of the name.  I would suggest management to evaluate the price and see if lowering the price will bring in more customers."}
{"text":"Ok service, average-below average food. Wings were not very good at all, an order of medium wings came out with BBQ sauce (is this Canadian medium wing sauce?). Poutine was the best thing I had there, tho the gravy tasted like it came out of a box. The great one should recheck his menu, the food was average at best."}
{"text":"In fairness, I'd much rather watch a game at a friends house than a bar and watching a game is the  raison d'etre of the establishment.  We all ended up here because our group was too large for other venues nearby, I can't say I'd ever go otherwise.

That said, the self-aggrandizing  of Gretzky is just too much.  While I go pee, a man in a deep voice recounts the reasons Gretzky is the greatest human to ever walk the earth.  Really?   Is it not enough that the restaurant he owns has bears his name and is covered in things he has worn?  It has the feel of shrine or a cult... I suppose this is the point but it is way too much for me.  My heroes are Gandhi,  Mandela or Keynes and yet if they were alive and opened a restaurant similarly conceived I'd write the same review.  Make it a homage to hockey, not to yourself.

All that out of the way, the food was OK.  The nachos are impossibly huge and well garnished and the fish taco appetizer was alright.  Can't say that I'll be back"}
{"text":"Being a big hockey fan as well as a Wayne Gretzky fan, I had to stop at his restaurant.  I was very impressed to say the least.  It seems like a great place to watch some hockey or any other sporting event.  I was very happy with the service and the food as well.  I ordered the flat bread bruschetta for appetizer, the Great One Burger for my entree, and the Stone Mill Chocolate Chip Cookie for dessert.  All were very delicious.  Definitely stop here for a nice meal and a fun experience."}
{"text":"Loved watching the man play. Quite enjoy eating at the restaurant. If you are in Toronto I would highly recommend this as a staple for any sports bar fan. 

The food was great we had the meatloaf and full rack of ribs. Huge portions for a reasonable prices. Also a decent selection of beer."}
{"text":"The Only reason this gets even 1 star rating is because there isn't an option for ZERO STARS!!!  We came here for our friends birthday and spent over 1000$ and got the WORST SERVICE EVER!!! our server Julia K was rude and didn't even care to ask us once throughout our
Stay there. Everytime we needed sometime we had to wait 20 min to flag her down and then another 20 to actually get our order and it wasn't busy. We asked to get a good menu but we were told we have to wait until the table next to us finishes because there is only one menu! Really??? We had to get out of there because refused to spend another dollar there and the ONLY reason our \"Server\" got a tip was because my friends are all servers/ bartenders. Overall our experience there was horrible and it sucks because it really is a nice place. They need to train their staff!!!"}
{"text":"Awful.  Will never go back.  My salad was soggy and over-dressed, where my chicken wrap sandwich was the complete opposite - dry and the mayo was forgotten.  My friend's margarita pizza looked like it was cooked the day before and reheated under a heat lamp.   Don't waste you're money."}
{"text":"If you love hockey, this is the place to be..... A great alternative to watching games live.... The crowd will surely get you going!! 

The food is alright, but you're really there for the excitement and booze anyways.... 

See you there!!!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty good.  My server was very friendly and pretty hot.  Food was very meh, just like almost all the other Yelp reviewers have said of this restaurant.

Skin On French Fries: C+
The \"skin on french fries\" are pretty typical, boring, mushy.  They are neither good nor bad.  Totally empty calories.  I'd really rather eat nothing than these fries.  The ketchup at this place sucks -- too sweet.

Chicken Wings: B
Totally typical wings.  You get a choice of \"hot\" or \"mild\".  Their hot wings are pretty darn mild.  I wish they had more hot sauce.

Ribs: C+
How can you ruin ribs?  Dry cut, not spiced well, too much goopy BBQ sauce, not well marbled, cooked too much.  Cut of meat totally uninteresting.

Roasted Chicken: C+
Simply Dreadful.  Way, way, way overcooked.  Not seasoned well."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner before our Second City show and chose this place out of pure convenience and although helper reviews aren't that positive we were strapped for time.  I have to say we had a GREAT experience here!! We sat in bar area and our waiter was knowledgeable and efficient.  We were a large party and I'm sure tough to deal with as in a rush and he took it in stride.  Food was excellent.  We ordered a mix of various appetizers and took advantage of the $5 burger special.  Highlights were the Buffalo Cauliflower (very good and highly recommend) as well as Nachos, Wings, and Sweet Chili Edname.  Pleasantly surprised and our waiter ensured we were on time for our show."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner after spending time at the Hockey Hall of Fame.  Nice relaxing place, good service and good food.  I got the parogies which were awesome! Everyone had a good meal and a good time.  We would go again."}
