{"text":"This is like a trip in a meal! New Latin American flavours I've never had before! Authentic as can be! Great empanadas! They sell out pretty quickly so make sure you call ahead...chicken and beef are full of so much flavour!"}
{"text":"Awesome Colombian style empanadas (corn flour and deep fried) that are heavily stuffed with meat filling. They're quite popular and the first time I went (4pm), they were already sold out!"}
{"text":"Small casual restaurant with mainly Latin American regulars...all Latin American drinks and tv shows playing in the background. The food was to die for. Get the empanadas for sure...best I've ever had. Go no fuss good authentic meal you won't find anything like this in Mississauga...we were the only non-Spanish people in the restaurant..."}
