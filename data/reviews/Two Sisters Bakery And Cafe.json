{"text":"Randomly stopped in here and with a variety of options, I wasn't sure which one to try! I chose the Apple Crunch. There are real apple pieces in the middle. 

She has fruit tarts and coffee available. 

She's a custom cake designer. 

They're polite and helpful."}

I tried a caramel iced coffee.  It was easily as good as the big names and less expensive, although it was a little smaller.  I had said \"extra cream\" but I think they thought I meant whipped cream.  Still, I loved it.

I tried a German chocolate cake sample.  Amazing.  Moist and great flavor.

My friend bought some baked goods, everything looked great.  I'm excited to try the Vietnamese banana bread!

The owners were very friendly and charming.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a new small family bakery. I love the fruit tarts and turnovers. Phuong's custom cakes are beautiful and she uses real buttercream which is not super sweet. Friendly staff and long hours. Can't wait to go back!"}
