{"text":"Hands down the best filipino restaurant in town. My family and a few friends went on a wekend trip to Las Vegas and craved for filipino food at one point. We heard this place was good so we decided to try it and it definitely did not disappoint. The cebuchon is to-die-for and all their desserts are a must have. will definitely come back for more to try try out the other scrumptious items on the menu."}
{"text":"Did this place hit the spot? Definitely not. Left lunch so dissatisfied :-(    Lechon lunch plate - tired pieces of pork ...probably  from the day before. Very small portion compared to most.  Sisig - waaaaaay to greasy.  Felt like I just chugged a small bottle of crisco and even more left on the sizzle plate. ..ugh  Mungo - watery...eh  Desserts on counter near register had mold spots growing in it...wth?   Many other places to go to get a more satisfying meal."}
{"text":"If there is a rating below Zero for this restaurant , thats what I would rate. Our friend who resides in Las Vegas is retiring and so we planned to give him a retirement party and one of this venue was to have lunch on arrival date April 2.,2016. Since they are residents of Vegas we let them choose the place to eat and they suggested this place because its new and the tried the food and was ok and to patronize filipino Resto.They spoke with Rose and they advised Rose that there will be around 20 of us mostly from California and the were assured by this woman Rose that there will be no problem.When we got there some of our friends were already eating and we noticed there is a divider between the restaurant and us and so we thought that was nice for the restaurant owner or manager to give us privacy .. as were eating some our friends noticed that the food outside at the buffet was different and better from our food and so we asked if we could get food from the buffet and we were told no. the food they served us was a tray of spring rolls , a tray of some meat with sauce, greassy pancit and cold and tough lechon kawali... I only ate 3 pcs f spring roll and a piece of kawali cause it was too hard and tough. No soup or salad and the dessert was  ginatan sago.When we got the bill itwas almost $900 ..Whaat!!! to make the long story short we wer told that the room was private and the food for $600 for 21 ppl plus th drinks and $120 tip..The manager was not around and the lady who was in charge kept on calling Rose. We disputed the price because 1) we asked for buffet only which we told $11.99 per peson on weekend (2)we did not asked for a private room . we were asking for the manager who never showed up . we didnt want to embarrased our host and our retiring friend who was very upset already so we just paid the bill . the ladywas told by this Rose to waived the Tip.. We ended up paying $521.06(for the food and room rental)what a hack and robbery .so they ended up charging us $25 per person..the only good with this visit was the server they assigned to us was bubbly and sweet and very attentive so we gave her tip.. We are from California and visit LV always.. and by the way there was no contract signed . ts ok Karma is coming for this Restaurant.."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, the cebuchon is delicious plus to add the the good food are the friendly staff and the owner very accommodating"}
{"text":"We never expected our bill will turn out that big! $700+for 21 people. We were so happy at first but some  of our group were complaining why our food selection was different from outside of the room we were in, about 3 weeks ago, 3 of our classmates went to this restaurant and inquired how much would it cost per head for the lunch buffet. they we told $10.99/person and according to them they were promised to have privacy for our group. so were happy , we got there, saturday 1200, still happy seeing our friends and exchanging pleasantries until we asked for our check and cant believe what we saw. $700+ for that kind of food and place for 21 people? The lady in charge said because we got the package for $599 for 50 people plus $200 for the room giving us privacy. nobody had seen this contract, it was a verbal contract between the 3 of our Las Vegas friends and a  lady named Rose in the restaurant, who happened to be not there that day of our event. That food and place is not worth for what they have charged us. We won't pay that bill so they came down to $521.06 because were descent people, we agreed to pay the room for $200 and $10.99/ per head for the food but the lady said since its a weekend its $11.09/head, drinks $22.50. This was not even made clear to us regarding the drinks. Anyways, this is very bad and poor management. We will never go back to this place ever again.This is a warning for those who intend to make such reservation like us, be very clear with them, otherwise you will get big surprises! What we had paid is not worth it, we could just have gone to Aling Lorraine's Restaurant . we were there 2 years ago and we had a great time, so many choices. we like to try this new place but we were so disgusted."}
{"text":"Just went there today..  Ordered food to go and they said 15 min I waited.. It's 30 min passed I went to the counter  ask for my order and they said wait come to find out its sitting there I don't know how long . Bad service and the food it's not even good no taste   First time  and last epic fail"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and have never been disappointed.  Our favorites are the pork inasal, bulalo, and pork BBQ sticks.  Customer service is always excellent! Nice and clean, family friendly environment.  Everyone is so polite and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Been craving for bisayan food.. And im so glad i give it a try at the Cebu Inasal. Tried Bam-i baby, Cebuchon, Inasal na manok.. Man this place got it right ... It almost makes me cry how they make it so perfect for my taste..everybody satisfied and for sure this place got us from the heart... Highly recommended bisayanssssss....good food"}
{"text":"It was Easter and decided on Filipino food in our neighborhood.  We had a party of 6 and they automatically charged 18% gratuity.  We ate the buffet $10.99 pp which was mostly pork dishes; Pork sinigang, pork sisig, Lechon, dinuguan, pork and opo vegetable, pork caldereta.  They had Kare Kare 2 hrs earlier when we passed by but the lady said they weren't making anymore.  My husband really wanted it so he ordered the a la carte menu.  Kids ordered the halo halo and found a hair in it! We brought this to the attention of our server and another lady came out and asked, \"do you want me to bring another one?\" We said absolutely not, and did not offer a refund right away.  We all lost our appetite at this point.  She asked to see the hair and we had a look of disgust and asked why, and she said so she can find out who's it was!  We gave her the napkin and she left.  Later we went to get fruit and noticed they had a full tray of Kare Kare in the buffet area.  Wow we just finished ordering the Kare Kare for $12.99 and they did not offer a refund.  I as a Filipina thought the food was okay, Kare Kare was probably the best dish.  Service was ok, not deserving the automatic 18% for sure.  My husband said we won't be coming back ever again."}
{"text":"Very Excellent place to eat big Plus Big Screen for football. Favorite was/is the Eggplant with egg."}
{"text":"The food definitely doesn't taste traditional, the sinigang tastes like straight up fat, like the meat wasn't washed thoroughly and is very watered down.  The Kare Kare tasted cheap. Overall, I wasn't satisfied.  It's my first and last time coming here.  Good luck. Lol."}
{"text":"Recently discovered and I must say the overall ambiance is great. Very friendly staff and management/owner is very nice and accommodating. Food is great and prices are reasonable! Halo-halo is big and delicious and the presentation impressive :p. I will recommend to all!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious with nice presentation, and the restaurant was spacious and clean. Buko pandan was my fav! The customer service of each individual is the most genuine, polite and welcoming I have experienced. Left with a satisfied tummy and a smile on my face! Looking forward to coming back here for my birthday this year, and will definitely be telling my friends about Cebu Inasal!"}
{"text":"Place was clean.  Service? Not a great way to keep their customer. They really need to work on customer service skills. Common sense-if you want your customer to come back.. Give excellent service!  Don't just say \"thank you po\" when they leave, do something to impress your customer during their visit!   Price- was ok.. Don't mind paying for as long as it taste good. But $1.25 for a scoop of rice lmao..   Food-let's just say, it was OK!   I can't say I won't recommend this place but most likely I'm not coming back for this place."}
{"text":"Make long story short I got robbed here.   Paid $10 on chicken inasal. Came out with \"4 drumsticks\" FROZEN, over cooked, dry, chicken marinated with ketchup?? it was disgusting and unpalatable.   Please do not order the chicken inasal. (Scam)"}
{"text":"This is it! We finally found it! We were HUNGRY and they fed us well. The stuff were very attentive and friendly.  The service and food are phenomenal!! Perfecto!!! We will definitely coming back to vegas and CEBU INASAL is on our top list to visit and eat. (;  We had so much fun, we did karaoke too!! This is it!"}
{"text":"Awesome Filipino food with large portions! This is a must have to experience a different style of Filipino food. So good!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at several Filipino restaurants and this is the only one that is an actual restaurant which cooks to order the others have food sitting buffet style in pans over steam. The seating area is very nice and the staff is very friendly. The food did come out at different times but I didn't mind because my wife and I order different things and share. It works for us. The overall taste according to my wife who is Filipino was good. I did enjoy what I ate and would go back. The prices were good. I normally spend more money for less food at other places.  Check them out if your in the south west."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite Filipino restaurant here in Las Vegas! The food was amazing & delicious, the place is very clean, customer service is excellent and the owners are so warm & accommodating. Now I know where to go every time I visit from San Diego. I will definitely keep coming back & recommend this place to my family & friends. For the best Filipino cuisine, Cebu Inasal is the place to be!  You're the best, hands down"}
{"text":"I had the breakfast-all-day (beef) dish Tapsilog  The meat was tender, marinated, and the extra 'vinegar' sauce was great. It was approx. $8.   Also tried the BBQ Pork Kabob... too fatty...   Flan (dessert) is cheap... but it's also small  Their are some KEY Filipino dishes missing from the menu in my opinion, like the 'beef stew' type dish... which I've seen at almost ALL Filipino places. I also didn't see much of a fish selection... Maybe the other restaurants I've eaten at are \"Manila\" restaurants while this one is a \"Cebu\" restaurant"}
{"text":"Another Filipino place to chow down, the place is tidy, service is nothing to brag about & finally the food is adequate and nothing exemplary!  The pork Sisig is underwhelming & over crispy and  too greasy!  The Bangus Sisig is better if not lacking flavor . The Bami pancit is a little bland and no distinct flavor either! The Kare- Kare lacks peanut taste and noticeable curds of cornstarch !"}
{"text":"Good food, don't know how it compares to the rest of its kind, since I'm new here. We had pork sinigang w/sili, gabi,tomato & onion, Lechon kawali,  tortang talong, fried bulaklak. Dessert was a little better: halo-halo, buko pandan & my fav. turon w/ube ice cream."}
{"text":"Good Filipino (Cebu provincial cuisine) comfort food stunted by poor service from the wait staff. Last time I checked, water was a free refill, but my wife and I didn't get offered refills. Also, I had to get up and find another server to request dessert. (I wanted to skip dessert altogether, but my seven-year old was craving halo-halo.)  To be fair, there was a large 30-cover party occurring the next several tables over, so I guess it was OK to ignore the other patrons in the restaurant. NOT!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! We stopped by for dinner on a Friday and were so glad we did! We ordered a ton of food because we couldn't decided on just a few things. The waitress even asked if it was someone's birthday when we were done ordering. The lechon is the best I've ever had.. crispy skin with tender pork. And the pancit palabok was delicious! We also ordered beef kaldereta, pinakbet, pork sisig, and lumpia. They must have upped the quality on the sisig because I read the review below before I ordered it about it not having enough flavor.. that was definitely not the case. It was delicious and a perfect blend of crispy pieces with tender pieces. Service was top notch as well. I want to go back when our family is in town and take advantage of the karaoke machine I saw sitting there. We will definitely be back and order less food next time.. We still have leftovers 3 days later."}
{"text":"3 stars for effort, but def not the best Filipino I've had here in Vegas. Sisig was lacking flavor (had to add soy sauce and vinegar) and it was kind of cold. It came out on an iron skillet and wasn't sizzling like other places. Their pancit was delicious and full of meat and their lumpia was good as well. Other than that, that's really all I can say about this place."}
{"text":"First of all,I would like to thank Cebu Inasal for giving me food poisoning.  My wife and I came here once before a couple of months ago for lunch.  Food was OK, but nothing memorable  About 10-minutes after leaving, both of us started to become quite sleepy and nauseated.  Signs that they use MSG in their food.  Fast forward to this past Wednesday night.  .We decided to eat dinner here since they are now offering $8.99 buffet.  We were in the area, wanted Filipino food and figured that we would try them once more.    While the service was very good, I cannot say the same for the food.  Some choices were OK, most were not.  After only eating 2-plates, I had had enough.  On the drive home, both my wife and I felt very uneasy.  You can literally taste the MSG that they use.  If they cooks feel they need to pack it in the food and not let the flavor of the food shine through, maybe it's time to change your recipes.    I have stayed in the province where they don't have strict sanitary regulations like the USA and never once have i gotten sick.  There are a lot of better choices than Cebu Inasal.  If you want to eat MSG laden food and get sick, this is the spot for you.  If you want authentic Filipino food that tastes better and you want to stay healthy, keep driving on by to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Hopefully just one bad experience. I ordered the sinigang na shrimp and other food to go. Got  home and the shrimp taste like freezer burns.Come on Cebu Inasal give more quality to the foods you serve even though their not the popular ones and don't ever serve second rate food because your guests won't be back. Simply say your out of that item, Quality check always! I will give you guys another chance. cya!"}
{"text":"I can't believe they charge extra for rice when we ordered 6 entree dishes/2 of each...Most restaurants serve rice at no charge.  I gave 2 stars because the food wasn't bad at all although it was pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Two things brought me to this place: First. that two of the people that opened the place came from Panda Express. I was curious on how they would apply what they have learned at Panda. Second, I am about to visit Cebu in two weeks. I would like to have a glimpse of the menu. We arrived at 1:45PM at Cebu Inasal. Their were two female food servers and a male server. The male server approached us, seated us down then gave us the menu. Few minutes later, he took our beverage and food orders. People who came in after us were served their beverages first. Our server was still busy taking other orders from other customers. It was difficult to find the servers coz they enter the kitchen, will be gone for a few minutes, then they come out chewing. I guess, they're working on their lunch break. We ordered the Family 1. The meal was served before the sauces. So we were staring at the foods, getting cold, while waiting for the sauces. Their was no anticipation on the part of the server. The pancit and egg roll were good. The Lechon was too fatty. Grease was dripping as I picked a piece up from the serving plate. The chicken was dry and it was lean as if it came from the ditness center next door. We always had to get the attention of the servers. My kids were so disappointed that they did not even want to try any of the dessert. I asked for the check but It was already past 10 minutes and the check wasn't even handed to us. My kids went to the car while I waited for the check the second time around. My server has just take an order from the table next to us so I asked him for the third time. He walked to their register and talked to the other two servers. I overheard that my check was missing and someone must have already paid for it. I just estimated my bill and left a few dollars extra on top of it then walked out of the place disgusted."}
{"text":"Had lunch here over the weekend, Sunday. Food was tasty, service was efficient, place was clean. I just didn't like that they didn't have vinegar handy."}
{"text":"Awesome place loved the food & the waiter was very nice & accommodating. I had the sisig lechon kawali, Shanghai lumpia & turon it all tasted good. My husband loved the chicken adobo."}
{"text":"Pretty good filipino food and you dont have to wait 45mins for your food. Was craving for lechon and this place has it! The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy and tasty. Chicken inasal was very good too that my 5yo almost finished the whole meal. Service was very friendly and knowledgeable. We will be back."}
{"text":"Once again, disappointed.  Fourth visit today. First was fantastic. Second was off--same dishes but different flavoring and doneness. Third visit was so-so. Today, I can't say it even deserves a \"meh\". One thing they do right and are very consistent with--inconsistency. Their signature dish, the cebuchon, is hit or miss. Pinakbet is never the same. Overcooked today--vegetables were mush and the shrimp, stiff and hard. Coke served in a can was consistently...well, coke. So yay? And since I live about 12 miles away, this will have to be the last. There are so many great restaurants on this side to dine at while running errands here. I really did want to give you a 5-star yelp."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, depending on how you are having it whether a la carte or buffet. Ordering a la carte is best because the food is piping hot, fresh and just tastes better overall. The buffet tends to be messy, and the food doesn't taste as fresh (obviously). Also, the buffet area gets crowded so it makes the area seem even more messy and kind of gross. Price point is fine and comparable to DT's, but wth the price, I think drinks should be bottomless. Service can improve to be a lot more professional, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Sucks!  Subpar food lacking flavor.  Not even served hot.  How can you serve dishes like dinaguan and not include RICE?!?!?  OVER priced and service was horrible.   Even by asian standards and you know you don't go to asian restaurants for service.  Melody was nice but not attentive."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch. The food is alright, in a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 6. If you are craving some tapsilog and such, its a place to go. The serving is kind of small, specially with the desert which a small coned cup of ice cream is $4.( you can buy a half gallon of ice cream for that amount already). The service is slow though...It took 30 minutes or so until the food got to our table. I saw some people that eventually left the place due to the time they waited."}
{"text":"I ate here with my bestfriend and her bf.. Chicken Inasal was bomb!!! love it!!! Sause is awesome!!! Coming back here soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is strictly based on service. So I called two days before to get an order (Lechon) ready at 4 o'clock for pick up. Last time I was there I waited 30mins for pick up when they said they would have it ready when I was on the Phone when I arrived. When I arrived, they didn't seem busy at all and they were taking orders so I waiting for a bit then they greeted me. I told them my name and they were trying to figure where my name was in their system and whether or not I paid already. I told them I called and didn't pay yet. Then they told me that they'll be a wait for the food. I expected it to be short, since I called in before but I waited for 45 mins. Although the food is good, service wise, they are slow for what I expected."}
{"text":"We had my mom's 60th birthday celebration here last night & it turned out to be nothing less than perfect. Although we had only about 35 people in our party, the room they accommodated us in will easily fit 50. The set up of the food was buffet style, the food tasted amazing, & you could tell that the food was freshly prepared. They took great care of us & couldn't be more pleased with their service. If you're looking for a great place to throw a small party, this would be it!"}
{"text":"Had to give it a try since it's in the neighborhood but I have to say we probably won't be back anytime soon.  I would order the BBQ sticks to go as that was tasty.  My husband got the tapsilog which was okay but the portion you get is bigger at DT's down the street so why not go there plus they have a bigger menu selection.  The main reason I am not a fan is because while I was going to order noodles, the waitress asked if I wanted lechon which is what there specialty is so gave that a try instead, cause who doesn't love lechon! I'd have to say worst lechon I have ever had!  It was served on a banana leaf with rice which a nice touch but it was so oily that my rice was soaked in too much oil.  I couldn't even eat the skin. Normally it's crispy even hard but still good, but theirs was way too hard and rubbery/chewy.  I know they are new and starting out, so maybe will get better in the future."}
{"text":"Had to try the new filipino restaurant in the neighborhood. After reading the reviews (though not many) I was a bit reluctant bit I have to say I was quite surprised and pleased.  The food was very good. The sinigang was different from the typical sinigang I have had at home and in restaurants but a good different, a very good different. The portions are large and adequately priced.   The service was super friendly and inviting. I had read a couple reviews about the horrible service but I did not encounter that at all.  Its going to be a toss up between Cebu and DTs now since they are both next to my house.   But that sinigang...I will remember yummmmm!!"}
{"text":"I am not Filipino, but I am very familiar with Filipino foods and Filipino restaurants. The place looks really nice and our server was great. Unfortunately it goes down hill after that.   Of course we had to try the lechon baboy Cebu style because my Asawa is from Cebu. They have a regular order that comes with rice for $10.99 or you can order a 1lb of lechon for $15.99 without rice. We decided to order the regular order with rice and Caldereta. The waitress told us the Caldereta doesn't come with rice. Anu ba yan! Bakit walang kanin! That was what I really wanted to say. Everybody knows you can't have Ulam without rice. Oh, and the cost for the Caldereta without rice was $10.99 and the portion was small. As for the lechon it was tasty but maybe 6 oz of pork belly.   I will give it a couple of months before we come back and see if they make some changes. The only Filipino place that is more expensive is Max's. If your prices are going to be expensive than at least make the portions big enough to share."}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR THE LECHON ONLY- My mother in law bought lechon from here for Christmas Eve. She wasn't sure what she was getting for $115 but was told it would be a whole pig minus the head/legs. Well, when we picked it up it came in a tiny box and when we looked inside (along with another customer that was just waiting and curious) we were all like \"what is this?!\"  it looked like piglet's body from Winnie the Pooh. We got it home and started cutting it up and to everyone's surprise it was stuffed... Like rolled up with lemon grass? inside...the way they do in Cebu, from what I heard. My husband and other guests said it was the best lechon they've ever had. I subtracted one star for their customer service... Didn't even crack a smile or say hi as we stood there waiting to pick up the lechon. It wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Overall the food was good and place looks great and clean.  We ordered Sisig Bangus and it was awesome!!!  Oxtail soup was too salty.  Monggo beans was okay.  The service was terrible.  Started good getting our order quick but it went downhill after that. We had to flagged them every time we need something.  Not a single time the server even check on us or ask us if we are okay.  This is my third time eating here and it went from great, good, to bad."}
{"text":"Here now. We ordered a tapsilog, bangsilog and tortang talong. Tapa wasn't good. Can't go wrong with fried fish and eggs. The fried rice seemed like white steamed rice topped with fried garlic and peanuts (ewwww). Plus it was soggy rice. But why I gave this place 1 star, and not at least 2? My tortang talong came out like 25 minutes after our silog meals came out. We were already so full. It was also flavorless. Never coming back again. Sticking to Tina's Filipino Cuisine for Southwest Filipino food."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this place 3x times now.  Three's a charm!  Spacious place.  Great servers!  Pleasant and polite!  Contrary to other reviews, we didn't wait too long for the food.  There were right portions and we even shared with each other.   On our second time there, we tried the family tray #2 which consisted of Kare-Kare, Crispy Pata, Lumpia, Pancit Bami and steamed rice.  Everything tasted sooooo good!  Super-busog kaming lahat.  In addition to Inasal na manok, we have tried the Inasal na pusit which was so cleaned and cooked to perfection!  The Halo-Halo special sweetened and satisfied our mouths!  Cebu Inasal is highly recommended by this family!"}
{"text":"It's nice to see a filipino restaurant on the southwest side of town. Staff was friendly, and service was quick, but my friend and I happen to go on a Thursday evening where it was slow."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that they charge these outrageous prices for food that is so subpar. When I hear \"inasal\", the expectation is that it will taste just as good as it does back in the Philippines or maybe even better. This doesn't even come close. I feel terrible for giving this place just one star, but even good service doesn't make up for food that doesn't taste good. The chicken had no flavor whatsoever.   My husband (not Filipino) said it wasn't good and my family (all Filipino) said it wasn't good. I would be willing to try again, but for them to charge $10 for this food is highway robbery and I'm not getting robbed twice! You can get way more food and way better tasting food at Island Flavor for $10.   The customer service was great, but I would not go back."}
{"text":"So the family was really excited for this place to open and we really wanted this place to be our next \"go to Filipino restaurant\" Unfortunately, it will not be a usual spot for us. We ordered the lumpia Shanghai, dinuguan, chicharron bulak, pork bbq on a stick and pancit Bam-i.  The bbq on a stick and pancit were both delicious. However when we placed our order for the lumpia , we asked how many pieces in an order. We were told twelve. When my mom picked up the order, they showed her what we had ordered, she counted 9. Their excuse was it's because the pieces were cut big. My mom, didn't bother to say anything. But excuse me, if the lumpia was cut into the twelve pieces, they would have been only one bite lumpias. Regardless, that should have not been an excuse. Next up, the chicharron bulaklak, we asked for it to be extra crispy. What we got was crumbs, maybe 5 small pieces of soggy chicharron soaked up will oil.  The dinuguan, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. With the amount we paid for the amount of food that we received, we could have gotten a lot more and better quality at another Filipino restaurant that we frequent."}
{"text":"Had some Filipino breakfast, meats were marinated perfectly, eggs were also fried up just to the point that reminded me of how my grandmother did em with crispy edges and sunny side up center. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Never again. Food did not taste fresh and was oily. Best thing we had was rice. The food came out in odd intervals. We all got bubble guts too from Lechon, pancit, eggplant, calamari, sisig and lumpia. Better stick with DT's.."}
{"text":"Menu was limited. Their sauces were watered down. Their prices are a bit expensive compared to DT's. Sorry but we can't help but compare since they are not too far from each other. The chicken Inasal portion is small for that price. Kinda like eating jollibee chicken that are small compared to a KFC.  Their lechon is not that good either. Probably was not that fresh when it was served coz it's not crunchy"}
{"text":"Worst service...  dont know how to take order.  Rude waiter.. never gonna go back to this place."}
{"text":"DT's look out, you may have some competition. Keep in mind now there's only 2 Filipino resturants in the southwest location. I will revisit Cebu Inasal, and after enough tries, I'll update both of my reviews here and at DT's. Due to the lack of other Filipino resturants in this area, i'd probably give Cebu Inasal 4.5 stars if I could.  The Inasal Chicken BBQ (inasal na monak) is delicious!!! I'm going to try the pork one next time. It's an herbal type bbq flavor.  The BBQ pork on a stick was delicious, this one a tiny bit sweeter than the Inasal chicken above.  The kare kare could of used more peanut flavor, but i'm not sure if traditionally it's less peanut-y.  The Buko Pandan was decent, it was my first time trying this dessert.  While I was eating, a bunch of the staff came in and out of the kitchen. It definitely looked like all Filipinos. I am not Filipino myself, so I can't tell you if this food is traditional or not, but it was delicious!  Out of 5 rating Friendly staff = 5 Flavor = 4 Decor/music/tv = 3.5 Cleaniness = 4"}
{"text":"This place has awesome filipino food but they seriously need more workers to accommodate the crowd. It's ridiculous to wait for 30 minutes just to order after being seated and another 30 minutes just to get your check!"}
{"text":"Nice big place and very clean. Lots of room for big groups. Believe it is family owned. Everyone had a smile on their face and was very friendly and talkative. Food seemed pretty authentic and flavorful. My wife is Filipino and she had no complaints. Prices were very reasonable as well. Would definitely recommend and come here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Has great food, their Dinuguan is wonderful. We use to love to go to Red Ribbon for our's, but since they don't serve it anymore this is the next best place for it. Their Lumpiang Shanghai (lumpia) is great, they are small but great to share. Calamari is AMAZING! I don't eat Calamari, but every once in a while I like to expand my taste buds, and I was glad I did. Great for a quick date, or a family lunch/dinner. Highly recommend to try. One thing I wasn't crazy about was the Inasal Na Manok (chicken on a stick), it was a little sweet for me, but the rest of the family liked it."}
{"text":"The customer service was very good but the food was below average. Although we didn't know what's inasal so we didn't order that. We tried lechon, lumpia, pancit, chopsuey, and Kare Kare (only decent one) all others is just not good."}
{"text":"Good food, but served small portions. Main dishes doesn't come with rice, one cup of rice is $1.25 and garlic fried rice is $1.50 a cup. Unlike the other Filipino restaurant, rice came with your main dish. Fresh Lumpia is very small and vegetable in the fresh Lumpia is not fresh. Service is better than the first time I've dine there."}
{"text":"Lunch special with Lechon and pancit was very good. Portion size was small compared to other Filipino restaurants."}
{"text":"It's a nice little dine in by the West side. However, even with the nice presentation of the meals, they will need to properly cook their meat. I ordered the chicken inasal and the meal came out in less than 6 minutes. Some may appreciate the speed, but this just shows that it was already cooked. It was not reheated, it was served room temperature and the chicken meat was tough to eat. I gave up trying to cut through the meat and chew, it seemed as if it's been sitting there for a while."}
{"text":"I though this was the best place for philipino authentic food. I am picky because I am philipino  and other places in town did not compare."}
{"text":"#1. There were (4) of us eating here. My Dad's food was brought out first. The second dish was brought out about 15 minutes later followed by the rest of the food coming out of the kitchen about 20-25 minutes from the initial time they served my Dad. Ridiculous! No body ate at the same time....I can't imagine what it'd be like with a big party!   #2. I did like the Lumpia Shanghai and thought I'd order a party tray and pick up. I ordered on 2/17 in the morning and requested pick up at 12pm  on 2/18 the day of my  potluck @ work. I called and informed them I was on my way. The lady said \"Okay\". Then I get a call back...It was a lady speaking Tagalog! Um, excuse me, but how do you even know I'm Filipino?!? Anyway, I told her I don't speak Tagalog and she basically just said that they didn't have enough lumpia for my order, that they used it the night before!!!!! WTF!!!  I drove about 25 minutes from my work, almost 5 minutes from reaching the restaurant....and they decide to tell me RIGHT BEFORE MY ARRIVAL!!!!!! Not only did I not have anything to bring for the Potluck...but EVERYONE was expecting the lumpia...so disappointing!!!!! Plus the gas and time I wasted!!!!!  TASTE: Eh....I did like the Lumpia Shanghai.....but it's not worth going there just for one item & I'm not willing to spend more money to find out about the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"their cebuchon is so delicious and very crunchy! i've been craving for lechon for so long. cravings satisfied!"}
{"text":"I've been here quiet sometime already. Stopped myself from reviewing the first time but now, I know is the right and exact time. Giving this 2 star for some facts. Needs improvement.   Serving of the food? Waiting time? This is one of WORST! So if you are THAT hungry, prepare yourself to wait for at least 20-30mins on ur food as soon as u ordered. So I may say be ready.  Customer service here is a plus which gives you the feeling of Home at least. (Look for Marilou. The superb server.) There is one thing I am so bothered about was the servers always and kept saying \"pasensya na po\" (sorry) even for simple things which I do understand sometime yet not necessary.   Hostess accommodation upon entering? Negative rate. As per sign says, wait for the hostess to be seated yet no one actually will be there to direct u to your seat. (So, it's like seat where ever you please)   One factor: check your bags if all food is there so it won't be a waste of gas coming all the way south."}
{"text":":::First Generation Filipino perspective::: Price::::  over priced for the portion they give. The Lechon and Sisig were $12 each. It feeds one person. The waiter said it feeds 2-3 people. I did not think it could feed 3 people. Maybe 2 people if they don't each much. Or I could be fatty. I'm around 5'4, 130lbs. I don't eat much and I thought this was ridiculous. Waiter Service: Great, I was greeted at the door. Help was given when asked or every 8 minutes. The manager was friendly too. Everyone gave a friendly welcome. It's most likely because they just opened, but check it out for yourself. They speak Tagalog Food Quality::::  The food can taste very good or just lame depending on what you get. -My choice: Lumpia, Sisig Bangus, Lechon Kawali. The Lechon Kawali was 60% meat and 40% fats. The portion was bad enough, then they try to make it look like a lot was worse. -Lumpia just tasted bland, the sauce was sour. I highly recommend a sweet and sour sauce if they want to improve. Sisig Bangusand Lechon Kawali tasted great. I don't recommend the lumpia. Recommendation::::  I would not come back, unless the price drops for what they are worth without cutting the portions (from $12 to $8 for either Lechon Kawali or Sisig Bangus). This is why a lot of Filipino's cook at home, because they can cook it better and get a cheaper price. Sure, you are paying for labor, but the price is still too much in comparison to other Filipino places like Fiesta Filipina."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. We order from here probably 3 times a month and I've never had bad food from them. My wife brought her coworkers here and now they're all hooked on the sinigang na baboy!"}
{"text":"I have been to so many filipino restaurants and this place is by far the best one in Vegas. It's a little ways from where I live, but I will definitely eat here again.  The portions are huge. The have ala carte and also full meal dishes. When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted with that warm filipino hospitality. Our waiter, Oriens, was very nice and we didn't have to wait long for our  food."}
{"text":"Very clean Filipino restaurant in the south west part of Las Vegas. We ordered the Roasted Pork (Lechon Belly) and was worth it. The price was $16 per pound bout average price. I'll come back to try their other food in their menu."}
{"text":"The meat of the chicken inasal was dry and overcooked. We also ordered oxtail soup which was lacking in flavor and had teeny tiny pieces of meat on it. The bangus sisig was decent and I liked it coz it wasn't too greasy. Service was good and everybody was nice and attentive but the food was a disappointment :("}
{"text":"Good food! This place isn't the best in town but it does the job when I am in the mood for Filipino food."}
{"text":"My 2nd time to visit Cebu inasal and the staff never fail to give the best customer service. The chicken inasal was cooked perfectly and taste so good. I love their halo-halo that I ordered for dessert. Perfect place for your family and friends."}
{"text":"Great food to satisfy my filipino crave but not a great place to enjoy it.   Like many reviews,  customer service is lacking. ..BIG TIME.  Ordered 4 dishes. 3 dishes came out and server asked me what it was I ordered.   It was apparent she forgot to put in my order so I told her.   10, 15, 20 minutes pass and my 4th dish still doesn't come.   Hubby had to go to the counter and ask because our server kept disappearing.   Finally found her and she looked puzzled and asked again what it was we ordered.   WTH?  So he told her.  10 minutes later she comes to our table to ask again what we ordered. ..WTF?  10 minutes pass again. .. by this time i couldn't wait so my husband canceled the order and asked for the check. .. she comes back with the order saying too late to cancel cuz its already cooked.  WTH?  WTF?  I already lost my appetite picking on the other 3 dishes.  Ended up taking it to go.   BTW, she also kept forgetting our coffee so we had to take that to go too.  OMG....really?????  My advice. ..you'll be happier ordering to go.   Not worth any type of tip.    Food: 4 Stars Service:  negative"}
{"text":"Always super friendly and prompt service from staff. Restaurant is nice and has nice and relaxed ambiance. They have ala carte menu and buffet. Very reasonable pricing. Food is 3.5 to 4 stars for me. I like this restaurant (lots of seating) and it's in my neighborhood too. You can also order for pickup."}
{"text":"Great service, clean restaurant and Hands down the best Lechon and palabok in vegas! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Its alright place, the cashier is kinda loud, server are really slow. I ordered the inasal na chicken and it has alright taste nothing exciting. Then my friend ordered tapsilog its ight too. The eggroll kinda taste like its burned. The desert leche flan is sooo small."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times already so far so good. No complains about food I just hope they add: Bistek Tagalog into their menu..   other than that I love to eat the Breakfast menu here.. All day served with Free Coffee ;)"}
{"text":"Good filipino food. I recommend the sisig bangus and the Lechon manok from what I ate today and those are my now usuall suspects in filipino dining. The place itself is pretty nice, new and Clean: wooden floors, nice seating, big screen TVs and another room for karaoke set to open when they receive their liquor license. The server whom might also be an owner, always makes us feel welcome. Nothing extraordinary, but if you've got the craving, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Great place for filipino food! Service is great & employees are nice. Many different Filipino dishes to choose from. I recommend trying the bangus sisig, lechon, & chicharon bulaklak. Great for the heart & soul! Lol.... They also have karaoke if you feel like singing too."}
{"text":"Let me start with the lechon Manok. You're better  of buying the 5.99 rotisserie at  Albertson's  or Costco. This chicken is dry as a popcorn fart! And whoa! Are we on a bbq sauce drought in this restaurant? A whole chicken ( does not even look like a whole chicken) and they gave us a teaspoon of sauce! The mongo is so soggy creamy looking more like a gravy for a biscuit. ( that's a scary thought) Thank goodness the bam-I is somewhat tolerable. I gave it 2 star 1 star for the water and 1 for the servers smile. Recommendation? No go! Sorry inasal :)"}
{"text":"I had a fever.  And the only prescription was more Lechon. Luckily,  Cebu fixed me right up. I got some food to go and it was exactly what I needed. The Lechon Kawali was nice and crispy and I really enjoyed the sauces that came with it.  The staff was friendly and got me my order in a timely manner. Since Cebu is on my way home from work,  I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 4 stars just because in my opinion they're the best tasting Filipino Restaurant that I've ever tried here in LV. (2nd Salo-Salo, 3rd DT, 4th Max's). Service is awesome too. The only couple of things that are keeping them from getting the 5 stars from me are #1, the price is a little stiff for the portion they serve. #2, I know that they want to serve their food fresh from the kitchen, but damn! I don't want to wait for 30 to 40 minutes for the food, and they don't serve all the orders at the same time. I could've finish my meal before my parents' orders came out from the kitchen. Just saying... I've been there twice and everything I've tried so far taste really good."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last week on recommendation of a friend, but sadly, we were very disappointed with the food.  The staff is very friendly and respectful, but it took them forever just take our order.  We asked for water, and the water tastes like bad tap water straight from an unfiltered faucet.  We ordered the lumpia Shanghai, Pinakbet, and pork sisig.   None of our dishes came with rice, so we had to order that separately.  The Pinakbet was probably the dish that tasted remotely decent.  The lumpia was not cooked thoroughly enough...the skin was not crispy and still white and rubbery, and the filling was a little rare.  The worst was the pork sisig.  The flavor was not bad, but it was so oily...like a big bowl of the thick grease they use on cars.  My husband, who usually will eat food no matter what because he doesn't like to waste, was so disgusted.  We both felt sick afterwards...like our arteries were clogged up!!!  Will not return ever."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the fact the they use the words \"Cebu Inasal.\" First, they are serving more of the traditional Filipino food than what Cebu is known for. So they really need to drop Cebu from their name cause they are capitalizing on the idea but when you go there it's just another Filipino restaurant (that's not as good). Oh, and none of them even speak Cebuano. It's like going to a Japanese restaurant and everyone speaks Spanish. Okay, maybe not that bad but because I'm Bisaya, that's how I felt. Second, they seem to fail on the idea of inasal. Their chicken inasal is horrible. They also need to lower their prices. They are not that good to be charging those high numbers. On the positive note, I did enjoy their lechon. Not the best but better than most places. It was the right tenderness and saltiness to it. Skin needed to be more crispy though."}
{"text":"Clean and spacious place.  Try their Sisig Bangus. Really good.  Everything else I've had has been fresh and tasty.  I've been here 3-4 times for lunch, and each time their service has been great.  Can't say how busy it gets for dinner though.  My parents really like it.  And I trust their judgement on Filipino food more than my own!"}
{"text":"Service was fast but the kitchen was so slow. It took a full hour to get my plate of Pancit. Parties of four were seated and served food many times before my one dish came out."}
{"text":"Came here 10/5/15 for late lunch early dinner... Around 4ish. I was craving Filipino food so bad! I decided to come to this place because it's nearby to where I live. The inside of this restaurant is very clean and nice! Especially compared to a lot of other Filipino restaurants I've been to (others are mainly cheap/decent looking) kinda similar to how maxs look like.   I ordered the kare Kare, fried bangus, and some garlic rice. The Kare Kare was very peanut buttery which is what the boyfriend & I like very much! The broth was thick and not watered down. It had that very beautiful caramel color not that ugly brown/gray color that some Kare Kare have. It had lots of flavor without the bagoong. I felt like it didn't really need it! That says a lot because a lot of Kare Kare needs that bagoong for the flavor. Kare Kare 10/10  The fried bangus was alright. They gave the soy sauce sauce for it. I was expecting more of a marinated fried bangus like the traditional bangus. It didn't have much flavor unless you dipped it in the sauce. Bangus 7/10 Garlic rice was nothing to really rave about. But just ordinary rice with some cooked garlic chips on top. I wish it had more of a garlic flavor to it. Garlic rice 7/10. The food took no longer than 10minutes to come it. So that was great.  I see a lot of reviews on how they lack customer service but I had a good experience eating here my very first time. I think it's because it was a Sunday and they didn't have much customers. I'm definitely going to come again! I can't wait to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"chicken inasal was so dry. to think it is their \"signature\" dish! tortang talong was pretty much just eggplant. no meat or egg. I'm so disappointed! the waitress was too hyper. i almost told her to take a chill pill. lol!  I liked the sinigang na baboy though."}
{"text":"i am giving this restaurant a 3 becuse the waitreeesss were nice but the letchon honaay it didnt satisfy my craving of letchon it was dry and they give to us cold i thank God  i was hangova cuz if i wasnt i wud go to their kitchen and heat that shit up .."}
