{"text":"Chicken sandwiches here are huge and delicious. One of few places to sell rice balls. Everything is decently priced and it's a friendly/cozy environment. Love going here for lunch."}
{"text":"Italian sandwiches here are delicious, generously sized and very reasonably priced. Have tried the eggplant parmesean and chicken are both are very good! Everything is homemade."}
{"text":"Veal was ok. Marinara is average. Extra star for politeness and general \"nice\" feel from lady behind the counter."}
{"text":"Nice little sandwich shop with friendly owners. The food is all home made style and at a decent price. The current owners are new, and have built onto the menu a little, offering cold sandwiches and what not, as well as the original fair of hot veal, chicken, a meatball sandwiches, rice balls, lasagna, etc. I would argue that, with the new owners, the food has gotten even a little bit better. I live just down the road, and whenever I go I'm not disappointed. Very tasty, very satisfying!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!  No prefabs here!  Went in for a quick lunch, never been in before.  Had chicken on a bun.  The chicken was hand breaded in store and the sauce tasted homemade.  Sweet peppers, hot peppers and mushrooms for toppings.    There was a delicious looking pizza by the slice.  Rice Balls were sold out.  Everything looked homemade and the aroma was fantastic.  Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade hot table full of so many tasteful goodies.   The pasta and meatball combos are great as are the salad and sandwich and soup and sandwich combos!  The veal sandwich is large and generous serving with melt in your mouth veal.Hands down the rice balls here are the best."}
