{"text":"Been here several times, and everything I've had is very good. The gyros are up there with the best I've had. Hummus and falafel are pretty good, though I've had better. The spanakopita, stuffed grape leaves, and chicken/lamb dishes are all delicious. I assume their baklava is made in-house, but their other desserts, I suspect are brought in.  The place is cozy and nicely decorated. Generally much nicer than you'd expect for Sun Prairie.

Service has been hit or miss. If you get one of the owners, the service will be fantastic. But some of the other staff are not very good - bored and apathetic like a Denny's server at 2am, though still \"trying\" in a basic sense. This is where the \"Sun Prairie\" creeps into the picture. Not horrible, just shrug-worthy. Still, wouldn't stop me from going back."}
{"text":"Randomly decided to grab dinner with the husband on Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised! We expected a teeny little place, but there was plenty of space for a group or just a couple, not to mention their outdoor seating. The decor was adorable and the menu was more varied than we expected! The zucchini fritters were an awesome appetizer and the white sangria was very refreshing. We were both blown away by their gyros! I also tried their pastitsio and mousaka, husband tried their kabobs. All was great. It's officially on our list for a dinner spot! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Left a review under my name as well. Just thinking about that Gyro and wanting to give you another five stars! Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Prepare  to be underwhelmed-by the food and the service. I can buy better hummus at the grocery store, and everything  else was just lacking  in much  flavor.  Service was completely absent. Didn't  check to see how food was, get water refills, and was generally  ignored.  I love Greek food but am not eager  to come back."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time yesterday evening and enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  The gyros, spanikopita, falafel, warmed pita bread and humus were all very good. Our excellent waitress suggested the white sangria which we also enjoyed."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Our family likes to come here once a year or so when we get that hankering for some good Greek food."}
{"text":"One simple explanation... Great food in small town environment restaurant. This was some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in the area and the relaxed personality of the restaurant made a great impromptu dinner."}
{"text":"The worst greek food I've ever had. Spanakopita was a soggy, sloppy mess along with the vegetables served on the side. The service was sluggish and rude."}
{"text":"Amazing gyros! They serve you an awesome amount of meat and the perfect amount of sauce. The onion slices aren't cut too thick and everything all together just tastes amazing. This is my #1 spot for gyros! 

Every time I've been to this place they've never seem too busy. The service is quick and efficient. I'll be sure to come back!"}
{"text":"I think the only thing I agree with from a previous reviewer was that \"the staff was nice\".  I loved the food and the atmosphere here.  

I had a gyro as part of some combo, and found it to be a good size.  Every time I've gone to Atlantis Taverna I've left satisfied, or overstuffed from their portions.  I've gone there with large parties of people and everyone has enjoyed their food and never noticed any issues with hearing people talk.  It's a good family-run restaurant, with excellent greek choices beyond the basic gyro, (including some vegetarian choices) and is definitely worth the drive out to SP."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and Nice place. Drink with Ouzo and strawberry was great. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Each time here I left happy!

Great food, great service, great choices.  This is a can't miss choice"}
{"text":"this was literally the best gyro I have ever had.  right here in sun prairie, wisconsin. the falafel appetizer was delicious and obviously fresh. they have a good thing going here.... we're already planning our next trip back. yum! not to mention, the awesome price point. :)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice since moving to the area. Both times I was pleasantly surprised with the service and food! My husband raves about how it is very similar to being in Greece."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal there.  I've also never seen it packed, which is too bad.  They don't skimp on the gyros, which is good.  Order extra pita bread if you get a gyro.  You'll want it."}
{"text":"Can't recommend this place enough - delicious food, friendly service, charming decor. Best gyros in the area. Spicy lamb wrap is amazing - everything is just excellent."}
{"text":"Been here twice-the gyros are good-had a friend from Greece who told me 
 In Greece gyros are 75 percent lamb & 25 percent beef, in America it's the opposite.
If you are ordering for two, don't consider one with extra meat-you will be disappointed. It's too much meat, not enough pita bread.
They are are also very stingy with the tomatoes & onions
Pricey, not a good value.
Staff is indifferent at best. Not a great experience overall, but I will be back, because we love gyros."}
{"text":"Great place with nice atmosphere and wonderful service.

The gyro meat is the most tender lamb/beef mix I have ever had and my wife and I LOVE gyros. Their tzatziki sauce is very good as well. We particularly enjoy the hummus and 3 dip plate appetizer.

I wouldn't recommend the Pastisio (Greek lasagna) or Moussaka. The flavors of the dishes just don't seem to come together."}
{"text":"Had dinner recently with a group of friends at Atlantis Taverna on Main Street in Sun Prairie.

I quite enjoyed my meal. We had several orders of saganak (flaming greek cheese. Opa!) as an appetizer. I had pastitsio (which is like greek lasagne) and a bowl of avgolemono soup (egg and lemon cream with chicken and rice in it. Sounds bizarre but is very good when made correctly, and Atlantis does a good job). I enjoyed coffee and baklava and a Point Root beer for desert. 

I will definately be going back."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times now and it's wonderful. Authentic Greek food that's perfect every time. The waiter is very professional; seems like he's been doing it his whole life. Highly recommend this place. 

We usually get kabob combos or whatever they have on special. The pork kabobs are great, as well as the red pepper tzatziki."}
{"text":"Considering where this is...Sun Prairie, it's a three stars on speed and friendliness.  The food is fair at best.  The salad was fresh but small.  The gyros with 'extra' meat was the same size as the other gyros.  Fries were Sysco.   The sauce was unique and good, not traditional but good.  The meat was not cooked properly, so not hot and crispy, just grey and warm like the pita."}
{"text":"Small place on Main St in Sun Prairie. If they're aiming for a cozy, homey environment serving tasty, satisfying food they are nailing it. My dad got the Greek lasagne and was raving about it.. I had a bite and it was delicious with aromas of cinnamon and cloves. My husband got the gyros platter with falafel and also loved every bite of his meal. My mom and I each had the Moroccan chicken platter, which was an open faced pita with liberally seasoned chicken and veggies. It came with sides of falafel, hummus, tzaziki, and a small Greek salad. The only thing that didn't impress me was the hummus, it could have used more flavor in my opinion. Everything else was delicious - the pita was so soft, perfectly chewy and fresh. My 2 year old son polished off an entire basket of their fries, so that must say something! I highly recommend this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable pricing. Service could have been slightly more attentive, but was not poor."}
{"text":"Great food in a nice setting. I have visited them many times and the food and service is always consistent. A great place to take date! Plenty of parking lot space in back. They are located on main street in down town sun prairie."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The food is amazing, portions are pretty large, and everything is affordable. I'm so happy we live close!"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food! Best Gyros in the area! I have eaten here many times, and every time the food seems to get better! The wait staff is very friendly, and helpful (When explaining the menu)."}
{"text":"My mom wanted to stop here for lunch on a Saturday because my dad won't try \"exotic foods\". 

First off, the place is absolutely adorable. Love the atmosphere! We got here and browsed the menu, and there is something for everyone here! (She will be back with my dad.) It is not just Greek food.

We both ordered the lunch combo -- Salad and skewer. The cute little greek salads came out first. They were fresh, light and the perfect portion. When we were finished, our waitress brought us our second plate. This plate was a small portion of rice with a 4 oz piece of chicken laid over it. Super tasty! Lastly, I ate the warm pita bread, cut into bite size slivers. Loved this , so good! Yummy bread!!

Staff was inviting and friendly. No pressure to leave when we were done eating. We hung out for a while and had a good chat.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up a to-go gyro dinner for four. It was fantastic! The meat was juicy and had great flavor and the pitas were soft and warm. Cucumber sauce was tasty as well. Gladly recommend this place to anyone searching for a great gyro at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Stopped in per recommendations from Yelp for business dinner. LIZ served us and what a gracious soul she was. The food was absolutely wonderful.  Had the lamb kabobs and my other guests were very happy also as everything was awesome. They tried the moussaka and pastitsio and it was to die for. Don't forget the baklava!!

I highly recommend and your in for a treat if you get Liz for a server. I felt like part of their family before I left."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely fantastic. Really delicious falafel, dolmades, hummus, pita, you name it. My favorite is the Mediterranean Lamb Stew and the Greek Combo. The environment and ambiance is cute--very 'Greek cafe' style. However--service is really hit or miss. The owner (I believe) also waits tables and is very curt and cold. Tonight we sat and were barely acknowledged. No refills on water or soda and the bill was basically tossed on the table without a word. As great as the food is, I'm not sure we will be back soon due to this kind of treatment. Very odd."}
{"text":"Have been here over 10 times in the past three years.  Food is good - especially the dips and tzatziki sauce.  Pitas are fresh and always served warm.  Good wine list, featuring some interesting Greek wines.  (I love Retsina, and they offer a good pour.)  Service has been very good to excellent.  They get 5 stars from me because of the value - prices are reasonable and portions pleasantly big, not outrageous.  If you like good food, this is a solid choice that has never disappointed.  (Just wish they regularly made taramosalata.   I can understand it is an acquired taste and apparently not for everybody.  Maybe if they gave samples next time they make a batch they can create more fans.  When they have it, it is always excellent.  If you like fish, this roe whipped with lemon and olive oil typically, is light and smooth and offers a slightly salty, nicely \"fishy\" flavor that will make you think of the ocean."}
{"text":"8/25/13 Taking some local advice we stopped in to the Atlantis Taverna to continue our anniversary celebrations.  We took in their outdoor balcony.  The grape leaves were tasty (served cold as indicated per the menu).  The salad was nice.  The 3 meat entree was good.  Bell's Two Hearted Ale went perfectly with everything.  I think it's better than Plaka Taverna, but try both for yourself.  I thought they used far less salt."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was very nice.  I had the Veggie Combo, which is 3 Falafel patties, hummus, spinach triangle, cheese triangle, cube of feta, dolmades, tomato slices, olives, pita and yogurt cucumber sauce. The food took a while, but was worth it. The place is brightly colored, murals and all painted by owner, as I was told. Great place to eat and all in heart of downtown,."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in SP!  The salads are amazing, hummus very good.  Enjoy the owners !"}
{"text":"This is a very quaint place - the walls are full of colorful murals.  The waiting staff is wonderful and attentive.  Even when ordering take-out, they offer you a soda or water as you wait.  The dishes I've tried (a taste of Taverna) and their gyros are fantastic.  Definitely a stop worth while."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try something a bit different. It was ok but I probably won't make the drive out there again. Service and ambience was great during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"We've been in a couple times now, and I'm a pretty big fan.  They have the best tasting Gyros in the area that I've been able to find since Parthenon's 'prime' days!  Also, I think they have my favorite french fries, ever.  Super crunchy on the outside (and they taste seasoned..not too salty, but just perfectly seasoned!) and soft on the inside.  The wait staff is always very friendly and every time I go in there I'm just shocked at how dead it is!  The efficiency of the service has either been great, or 'eh'...otherwise I would give them a full 5 stars.  We will continue to return whenever I'm craving a Gyros!"}
{"text":"What a great find! If you like good Greek food at very reasonable prices this is the place for you. I was in the area on business and whenever I travel I pull out the trusty yelp app and look for something good and wasn't disappointed at all. I started with a glass of french pinot...normally it's $6.50 a glass and it's a decent wine for that price, however double bonus. It was Tuesday night and wine is half price! I'll take 2!
I had the Greek combination platter with a Greek side salad and wow what a lot of good food. It included gyro meat, pita slices, the spinach pie, a couple of dolmades, yum! All for 11 bucks. They have a nice little deck in the back to eat outside! The server was very freindly and accomodating. Couldn't ask for more. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. 2 glasses of malbec, sprecher rootbeer, flaming cheese, and two entrees. 48$. Steal! The entrees were mousaka (so?) and lamb wrap,with onion rings. I loved the clove spices in the braised meat with my mousaka which was also complimented by green beans (vegetable of the day) and rice. Lamb wrap was so tasty too and the fresh dill and mint in the yogurt dipping sauce should be served by the pint because I literally would drink it if it were thinner. Maybe next time I'll order some to go and eat it at home with a spoon. We were pressed on time so service was fast and efficient which was another bonus and 6 stars are war ended instead of the 5 for my most recent visit."}
{"text":"Just no. If you're looking for authentic Greek food, try anywhere else. The food is barely palatable as is, but you could find better Greek cuisine in the frozen meal section of Whole Foods. 

The spanakopita was soggy and the side veggies were bland and overcooked. 
The owners are absolutely psychotic. It's run by a couple and at one point the husband started screaming at the waitresses and the wife, who was replacing a light, dropped a bulb and went into hysterics; sobbing on the floor. Stay far, far away."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant in SP.  GREAT selection on menu.  Wonderful wine selection.  Incredibly accommodating for any and all requests.  Servers are terrific.  Never a negative experience.  Patio in back is lovely during good weather."}
{"text":"I always get the gyros and they are great.  Nice and quiet place to be.  The owner is always there, which says he cares about his business a lot."}
{"text":"The staff was lovely, and although the paintwork is garish and the seats are uncomfortable, it was a surprisingly cozy restaurant.  Nice selection of specialty sodas which is fun.  I had the chicken wrap with fries and it was delicious.  The chicken was moist and the sauce was wonderful.  The fries were to die for.  I got the specialty custard pastry for desert and it was delightful.  Downtown Sun Prairie is small, but nice and there were some cute shops I would like to visit when I have more time."}
{"text":"I would say this is one of the best restaurants in Sun Prairie. Gyros, spanakopita, and dolmadas are all good. The outside patio is adorable in the summer; they grow herbs on the deck and the fragrance adds to the experience."}
{"text":"Wow! Just finished another meal at Atlantis Taverna and it was spectacular. I had the Greek salad and gyro combination and my wife had the Tilapia, rice, and vegetable kabobs. Both of them were perfectly prepared and delicious. The gyros here are the best  I've had in the Madison area.  If you love Greek food put this on your list."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good Greek food you won't be disappointed.  The portions are decent but I thought a little bit overpriced.  I like the fact that it's not a chain restaurant and has a nice vibe inside.  The food was good, but it wasn't overly out of this world.  So we lost a star to price and a star to complexity of food.  If I had more time I would likely go back and explore the menu more.  I was also bummed that they are not open for lunch except on Saturdays..."}
{"text":"We usually get the family carryout and it has always been very good.  My wife enjoys the Greek salad and the gyro meat is always tender."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! They had a surprisingly large menu but I had a traditional gyro with fries and it was best gyro I have had in a while. I gave 4 stars because the service was a bit slow. We planned to get a \"quick bite\" before a movie thinking that gyros are usually quick. It was pretty busy that night so I am somewhat understanding but we waited about 25 minutes for a simple gyro plate from the time we ordered it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Incredible food, so authentic, everything cooked with fresh ingredients on site.  Super friendly staff that feel like family.  Nice drink selections. 
Really nice atmosphere to dine in.  Love this place to death."}
{"text":"What a great find! If you like good Greek food at very reasonable prices this is the place for you.  My husband and I both got gyros with fries and a drink.  Total for the bill with a tip was $30 and worth every penny.  I can't wait till go back...."}
{"text":"First time visit yesterday.  I stopped in thinking I'd get carry out, but decided to eat in by myself to avoid the hassle.  Unfortunately, the hostess said, \"only one?!\" in a judgmental way which turned me off, but wait service made up for it.  Why do some hostesses still make solo diners feel like pariahs in this era?

Anyhoo, the food was great!  The saganaki was good, but not the best I've had.  They serve it with beer bread, which I didn't care for at all; so I asked for pita.  For the entree, I ordered the spanakopita and falafel combo.  Holy moly, seriously good!  Good thing I was solo because the garlic woulda killed any dinner companion, but it was all soooo good!  I would have preferred the spanakopita with a bit more feta, but some feta on the side solved that, and the falafel....  Truly as good as I've had in Greece and the Middle East.  The hummus and tzatziki sauce were excellent!  Could have eaten a platter of their soft, fluffy pitas (but probably not homemade like nearly everything on their menu) with just the tatzicki and hummus alone.  Had so much food left over, and added a delicious Greek custard pastry to go - made for an outstanding lunch today!  Would love it if they'd throw me a few kalamata olives on my plate next time!

On top of it, my waitress was charming and attentive.

I'll be back, and you should too.  Try some Greek wine while you're at it, and say \"OPA!\""}
{"text":"Cute place in downtown Sun Prairie. Tuesdays are half off wine night, which makes it a no-brainer. We come here 3 to 4 times a year, and typically like what we order."}
{"text":"Decided to go here again, cuz humans believe in second chances.  

This time we went around 2pm, and we sat in a booth instead of the wicker chairs.  It was much more comfortable and cozy.  At that time of the day we were the only customers, so the problematic acoustics reverberating the sound of one thousand voices was absent.  

I had the butternut squash pie, that came with a side salad and a pita with dill dipping sauce.  It was delish.  My dining companion on this day was the minor, who decided to have a cheeseburger.  Said cheeseburger got a thumbs up.  

Now I shall delight you all with what we had next.  We decided to be really bad and share a slice of the Golden Harvest Carrot Cake.  

When I took the very first bite I immediately noticed that time seemed to slow down.  My faced warmed and my eyes watered up with tears of extreme joy, all the world looked liked I was viewing it through a slow drip of molasses.  I couldn't really say much, but I definitely let out some moans that very well could have been misconstrued by the staff.  

When I came to, I was mashing my my fork against an empty plate, as was the minor.  I also noticed some crumbs laying around the plate on the table, to which I suddenly said with great urgency \"get the crumbs!  Get the crumbs!\"  So minor and I threw caution to the wind and vacuumed up the remaining crumbs of carrot cake off the table like dirty little monkeys.  

After that we sat there and giggled and marveled at the awesomeness of the carrot cake.  We would've smoked cigarettes but they don't allow smoking inside."}
{"text":"Great Greek food at a good price.
I'm glad they are close enough to allow repeat visits.
Matter of fact if it were not for Atlantis Taverna I don't think I would have found this section of Sun Prairie. Weird but true, I never went down Main St farther than Salvatores Tomato Pies before this visit to Atlantis Taverna.
Good Eats."}
{"text":"I'm 40 and I almost said OMG out loud when I tasted their gyro meat and falafel sampler. Froma friend, the wife and I got a side of the red pepper Tadzhiki, oh yeah that's so good. I really want to go back soon, we drove from Verona for this place, best Greek food I've ever had. I now dream of Greek genie's with falafel sammy's with red pepper Tadzhiik, oh yeah! And they have the best ouzo and lemonade cocktail ever!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pita great salads.  Friendly staff.  Service was a bit slow.  I would go for 5 stars if they would pick up their service."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! The spinach pie was awesome as well as the Atlantis salad and Veggie combo. Yum!!! A real gem!"}
{"text":"Just had gyros and fries from Atlantis Taverna-superb! Picked them up at 4 pm to be reheated and eaten at 7:30 pm. They were still perfect!
Special shout out about the French fries-nice and crispy brown, not like those pale greasy fries you get at fast food places.
Last week got gyros at Pizza Pit-terrible!
Make the trip to Atlantis Taverna-well worth it!"}
{"text":"The service is fantastic!  Kristin always remembers our Favorite menu items.  Food is very tasty & atmosphere is very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've not had a single thing here that I haven't loved. Nothing to even dream up complaining about. The only reason it's not five stars, is it doesn't have some of my favorite and, admittedly, more fancy lamb dishes. Will definitely continue to go back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Sun Prairie dinner spot.  The Greek Salad is so yummy and my husband loves the kabobs!  I usually order the falafel with hummus and salad.  We always leave so satisfied and the good news is they will do take out too!  Call and order and pick up in a short time.  I also really like the bar menu, as they offer some specialty cocktails that are great.  It is an added bonus when I can find mouth watering food with a good drink menu!  I love supporting this local family owned business and can't wait to be back!!"}
{"text":"The lunch was nothing to rave about. Our waitress was very crass and disinterested. We ordered chicken gyros and the vegetarian platter. My food tasted like it had been frozen and then fried, which was not very pleasant. I gave the two stars because the chicken gyros were tasty."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place got any sort I good reviews. We started with the calamari, which there's no way this stuff was not frozen, dumped out of a bag. It was honestly the worst calamari I've ever had, rubbery and it looked like mini onion rings.  We had the Greek platter which was not impressive at all.  I don't know if it's because we are basically in no-wheresville USA, but if you think this place is worthy of a five-star review, you need to make your way to a major city (see: population over $500,000) sometime in your life, and find some Greek folks to help you navigate a menu."}
{"text":"I appreciate having a Greek restaurant in the area and other than a few Milwaukee places have not actually been to many non fast casual Greek restaurants unfortunately as I like most of the things I have tried.
And everything I have tried here has been quite good however they could stand to be a bit more generous with the portions on some of the dishes."}
{"text":"I would give this more like 3.5 stars, but since you can't do half... good food, cute place, no complaints."}
{"text":"We LOVE Atlantis.  

My husband and I have been dining at Atlantis since at least 2007.  I lived in Chicago most of my life, and the food at Atlantis is as good as the best restaurants in Greektown.  (But we haven't eaten at Plaka in Madison, which is \"closely related\" to Atlantis.)  

I'm a vegetarian and Atlantis offers a ton of great veggie choices - not always an option when you're outside of Madison proper.  The hummus, Spanikopita and Squash pie are all amazing.  My husband loves the olive stuffed meatballs.  The prices are incredibly reasonable, and the orange cake is a fabulous way to end your meal.  

Atlantis has a reward program too, so if you dine there with any regularity you can save some on your meals over time.  They also do special small plate events every so often, which give you a great chance to try a lot of different dishes."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong if you're looking for Mediterranean food. Beth and her staff are excellent. We usually order for takeout it's always hot and ready and delicious every time. I highly recommend this restaurant in Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"I gotta update this review. 

I love this place, I really do. Their food is great. Service is passable (but they're a little tight with soda refills). 

But they are constantly changing their hours. They used to be open for lunch on the weekends. Now they're not. They close on weird days. I've walked up thinking they'd be open, adn they're not. They run the place like it's a hobby or an intrusion rather than trying to run it like a proper restaurant. It gets annoying.

With a new Greek place opening soon in Westport, there's a good chance I might not go back to Atlantis."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place is my family's not-so-guilty pleasure. Whether it's date night or take-out, this place nails it! Authentic dishes and American dishes so something for everyone! And plenty of vegetarian and vegan dishes. Large portions, good prices...perfect!"}
{"text":"Simply Awesome.  I first went there when they opened in Sun Prairie.  I loved it, but I didn't think they would last simply because almost nothing does.  A few years later they are here and going strong.  I have had just about everything on the menu and I have never once been disappointed.  Especially with the dolmades.  I'm a sucker for dolmades.

If you want a light atmosphere in a cozy restaurant and the finest Greek food in Southern Wisconsin, go to Atlantis Taverna.  We go every couple of weeks, and when a kitchen experiment fails, it's off to Atlantis for some food.

Do yourself a favor and stop in, try a sampler plate or a gyro, or the spanikopita. Anything.  Your tastebuds will love you for it."}
{"text":"I have nothing but nice things to say about Atlantis Taverna. Not only are their gyros some of the best I've had (I've had a lot of gyros in my day), the service is great as well. Our first experience was dining in, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. Our waitress was helpful with helping us make our decisions, and everything was delivered promptly. We've yet to venture away from gyros (they're that good!), but everything that was brought out to other tables looked delicious as well. Most of our experience now is through takeout, and the food has always been ready and warm, somehow quicker than I can call in an order, put shoes on, and get there. Bravo."}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  The salads are huge and delicious.  Gyros and souvlaki are great too."}
{"text":"Again, one of those good Mediterranean places you will want to go back to.
We've ordered here twice and both times we got it to-go. Their service has been fast both times. Another place where I loved the Tzatziki sauce - thicker than most places but tastes very good.
What we ordered:
Spinach pie - 4.5
Really good. Both times a hit!

Chicken Souvlaki - 3.5
3 for the chicken kebab.
3.5 for the green beans and tomato.
(With the tomatoes I got the taste like they were canned tomatoes)
5 for the Tzatziki sauce.

Veggie Combo - 4
4 for the herby crunchy flavored falafel.
3.5 for the hummus. Thicker than most places but good taste.
4 for the spinach, and cheese triangles though I liked the spinach better.
3.5 for the dolmades this time because the leaves were a bit tough to chew.
5 for the Tzatziki.
5 for the tomatoes, feta and olives!

Overall we'll give it a 3.5 because the chicken could have tasted better and the green beans and tomato didn't taste fresh (though they had some good flavor)

Service - 4
Both times order was fast and friendly

Price - for the portions served I think reasonable $$"}
{"text":"This little spot in dowtown Sun Prairie is simply delicious.  Falafel and hummus were spot on.  We were the only folks in this place at 1 pm for lunch and I was totally surprised.   The food and service was GREAT.  Definitely a return trip next time we are in the area.  Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food. Prices are moderate for the local Greek biz in the neighborhood."}
