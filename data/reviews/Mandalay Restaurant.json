{"text":"Came by on a friday lunch with my gf. Was greeted by a young female server who was friendly. Got a few recommendation from the server.

Started off with the Calamari: Panko bread with chili lime oil. This was nice light tasting app, only wished there was more pieces. Decoration of the dish is very simple as well with lettuce and a lemon on the side.

Mains: I got the Grilled salmon with tarragon butter and vegetables. The salmon did not taste like it was grilled, but nevertheless, it was very well cooked. I could say this is one of the 'better' salmon I have had. The vegetables were all nice too, not overcooked, and was just enough to fill my ABS! 

My partner got the Kangaroo Loin with a gravy sauce base with veggies as well. I tried it and it tasted a bit rough for me, but my partner enjoyed it so.

All this for $56 before tips. And we received a $15 gift card for next time if we decide to dine again, which we probably will.

We were informed that we are a rare young couple dining in that atmosphere, b/c they have usually an older crowd.

The decor is green carpet with a booth setting seat which could use an upgrade, but the table cloth was nice and the setting was simple: 2 fork, one side plate and a knife.

This place is a bit hidden, but its right beside the Ontario Health Card place."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a pleasant surprise. It looked like nothing from the outside -- the open sign was turned off and all the curtains were closed. But upon entering, I was taken into a cute, quaint and cozy atmosphere, with dim candle light and a small sitting space. 

It was a lot busier than I thought it would be, quite an odd location for a place like this. However, the food and wine was delicious. We had the chicken penne and the mango chicken. Very yummy and  I look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Never trust an Asian restaurant rating when all the reviews are written by non Asians! 

Didn't realized this was a Asian restaurant until I drove up and saw it in my yelp listing. All the pictures of the food were not Asian food. But what the heck, the reviews sounded so good when I was starving and reading the reviews while finishing off my exercise at the Goodlife across the street.

The place was difficult to find but no points lost there. Place was quiet and cozy, points added! We had the wonton cheese balls and naan pizza! Great! I was expecting quite a bit when I ordered the pork tenderloin but the portions were really small. However the flavour was lacking and the vegetables were just steamed and tasteless. To my surprise my friend order Pai Thai! The flavour was blend and weak, I make Pai Thais for my girlfriend and this is not passable even compare to my worst one.

The starters were good but everything was overpriced. Never again! 

Only go for Chinese Food restaurants highly rated by Chinese Yelpers!

{"text":"SAD SAD SAD! Really missing this place. Some places are never forgotten. Thanks for the great food and the nice quiet dinners I got to share with my partner here. Nothing else like it in Scarborough."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Mandalay on occasion, and it's always such a nice, cozy dining experience. This is an upper-class restaurant defined by the quality/presentation of the dishes and the service, but the prices are so modest! We've had a $250 dinner at the Toronto Hunt Club, and I have to say that Mandalay was significantly better...!

And, if you get the Entertainment Book, there's always a free-entree voucher for Mandalay, which we always enjoy using!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for more than 20 years and have never been let down. A few years ago they added some intriguing new dishes and we've always loved the Burmese curries.  Can't go wrong here. Don't be fooled by the exterior. The food and service inside is excellent!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where the exterior of the restaurant might deter you from entering, but don't make that mistake. Inside, you'll find a cozy restaurant with an excellent menu, and a well-earned reputation for great food. I haven't come here in a long time, but I used to frequent the restaurant when I lived closer. I always ordered the caesar salad (their dressing is house-made, and delicious) to start, and the salmon carbonara (which used to be on the menu, but disappeared... they still made it on request, though); I've tried other dishes, but I always come back to this one. The service is always pleasant."}
{"text":"I had the veal parmigiana and it was amazing!! I had the three course meal, it was all good. This place definitely surprised me! Definitely hidden away. Definitely a bit small. The seating is a bit crowded but the atmosphere is nice!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service and excellent food.  Had the salmon and it was to die for - properly cooked and full of flavor.  Yummy"}
