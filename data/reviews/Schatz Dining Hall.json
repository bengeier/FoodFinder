{"text":"The food is nothing special here, and they not infrequently run out of stuff--cereal and orange juice especially.
However, it's not *bad* by any means. It's an all-you-can-eat buffet, so you can get a lot of food.
I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here for other meals, but their breakfasts are decent, and they're open early (I eat there at about 7:45), which is convenient for those 8:30/9:00 classes. (one note about breakfasts: it may be cheaper to use DineX than a block, depending on your meal plan.)"}
{"text":"They have amazing food. There is also a crepe place in the university center that's mind blowing!!"}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced buffet, with low food quality. The brunches are ok after a late night... waffle machines, on-demand omelets, cereal, and donuts/sweets. Everything is very heavy and unhealthy, though. Be prepared to gain the freshman 15 very quickly if you eat here a lot. They try to rotate dinner foods, but everything starts to taste the same after a while. They clearly reuse foods from one day to the next which is pretty sketch. The servers tend to be pretty nice, though, which is surprising considering the messiness of the student patrons. I think I may've eaten dinner here once after no longer being on the mandatory meal plan, and that's totally ok with me."}
{"text":"On an errand at the CMU student center, I decided perhaps a quick convenient lunch in the Schatz dining hall.  I took a look in and memories quickly returned to answer the question: \"Why has it been so long.\"  I suppose this is better than hospital food, nevertheless I was able to just say,  in the word of Marcel Marceau, No!  Off to Craig Street for something better to write about."}
{"text":"People don't go to Carnegie Mellon because the food is good.  

I had a meeting at the beginning of the semester here, and the food was just kind of edible.  We came in for the breakfast buffet, and the place was pretty empty at 8:30 AM.  The made to order omelettes were OK but took forever.  I waited 20 minutes with one person in front of me, which is kind of absurd.  The bagels were low grade store quality, and the juices were all high-sugar choices.  The fruit didn't look so good either.  I'm really glad that I'm a graduate student who doesn't have to eat on campus.

I don't really know what the price is, but unless someone else is paying, I would skip the dining hall.  The dining hall has plenty of seating, which is nice, though."}
{"text":"10/10 this is a must come to when in town. The employee named Jamal is always so kind and very knowledgeable with the food there. My friend has extreme allergies to certain foods and they always seem to know which ones contain what type of ingredients. The ambiance is romantic, and I come here with my boyfriend all the time - we love it!"}
{"text":"Schatz is my goto place to eat for weekend lunches, and it's due to their diverse options, and decent quality food. 

The cool part about the weekend Schatz is that they serve brunch, which means that you get the full breakfast and lunch experience. That means you can get a cheese-stuffed ham and bacon omelette along with your pork tenderloin and eat ice cream afterwards. Honestly, the amount of splurging you can do at Schatz is incredible, which is why I love it so much. 

For breakfast, besides the aforementioned omelette, you can serve yourself eggs, tatter tots, curly fries, bacon, sausages, pancakes, waffles, cereal, and bagels. There is milk and juice to go along with your breakfast if you please.

For lunch, the food changes every week (thanks), but usually features some grain dish, meat dish, and veggies. It is also buffet style, so you can grab as much you can if you find something you really like. 

The dessert is also really impressive here. You have small desserts everywhere, from cupcakes to cake and other small sweets. However, the attention has to mostly go to the ice cream, where there are six flavors offered, including vanilla, peanut butter, and birthday cake."}
{"text":"Okayish place in CMU. The food here is best during admissions seasons. 

It isnt all that bad though, and you do get to eat a lot."}
{"text":"Healthy, diverse, cheap, friendly, fulfilling, nice staff, generous... no adjectives can be enough to describe this joint, better than anything on CMU's campus."}
{"text":"I'm talking about the dinner buffet here, never tried breakfast or lunch. The food is healthy, but the choice is limited. The location is great (on campus), generally a good place to have a big treat after exams or whenever you want to engorge. Also, each Wednesday it has special dishes. The price is fine (about $10). The suggestion is to provide more kinds of food."}
