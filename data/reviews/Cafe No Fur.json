{"text":"My first time at cafe no fur after wanting to try it for awhile. To my surprise they had some stuff on the menu I was super excited to try like the cheese sticks and the cookie and cream shake, but sadly they were out of both! :( I initially went so I could try the popcorn chicken because I saw it online and it looked really good, but I was a little disappointed. It also came with fries which had way too much seasoning on them. Good flavor just too much. One of my friends did like them tho, so that could just be my tastebuds. My friend got the egg rolls, which I didn't try because they looked too greasy, and the monster tots. The tots were a take on in n outs \"animal style fries\". I did like that the tator tots were still crispy with all the toppings it had. Our other friend got the nachos which were very salty as well but the cheese was good. Another friend got the burger and he seemed to like it. The shakes were good. The strawberry one was my favorite. The service was great. The food didn't come out all together, but came out one by one which is fine. The place looks like it's still under construction and kind of bare with wires hanging from the wall and a ladder randomly out as well. The one bathroom was hard to find and at the end of a dark hallway. I think this place has a lot of potential and can be really successful, but they have some improvements to make. I did like that the server was in a bikini and thought that was a nice touch. Overall I will go and give this place another shot. Hopefully I can try the cheese sticks one day!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times I've little hole in the wall. Their Thai tea is on point and the monster tots taste like an in and out burger. They have also done some remodeling to the place which in my opinion looks better and more trendy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The setting is very aesthetic. It's very welcoming. The girl servers are really kind and gives great customer service. The food here is all vegan. NO MEAT . And the boba drinks are great. I would totally recommend for all the people that's doesn't eat meat and love boba to here and check it out. This place really chill and your able to eat and watch tv/sports on tv. And they play great music here also. 10/10 I would recommend"}
{"text":"Came in here the other day because i use to love milk teaze. This place is waaayyyyy better. You can tell the waitresses are treated better, the food has gotten better, and their drinks as well!! i recently lost a lot of respect for milk teaze after hearing about their management but hearing that this place was a new and improved version with an all vegan menu i was absolutely sold!!! The cafe looks way more cute now and everything was absolutely fantastic. Must try the nachos!!!"}
{"text":"I had the macaroons and chocolate chip ice cream with mochi on top, it was delicious and all vegan!  So yummy!  The servers are beautiful and give great and friendly service."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Such great vegan comfort food! This place just opened so they are still getting some of the decor and interior set up but overall excellent food."}
{"text":"I'm excited to see what happens with this new concept. I'm personally not vegan but I do try and support new businesses that promote cruelty-free options for food and drink. They are off to a great start and I look forward to seeing what type of events they have planned.  Currently enjoying a coconut milk based Hokkaido tea and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Great variety of vegan food. Their boba drinks are great as well. Customer service is on point. Definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Yhessa and Jocelyn gave us such great service even though we came in late. I'm not vegan and neither is my friend but we wanted to check it out. I got coffee ice cream which is made with almond milk I believe. My friend got a coffee ice cream milkshake. They were both delicious and creamy just like regular ice cream. Definitely coming back again!!"}
{"text":"This was the most amazing restaurant that I never been. I have never tried a vegan burger and fries like this before, the environment was great and the service was excellent. Should try out their burger, it was extremely delicious and the special sauce that they made for the fries"}
{"text":"Don't really understand how this place has such great reviews. Sitting here right now and I've been waiting 30 minutes for an order of 3 wings. Multiple people have gotten their food before me that came in after me. Not impressed. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Got here a little before 8p on a Wednesday night and wasn't busy at all. YAAAY!!!  Sat down, the server brought us over a stapled paper menu with black & white pictures of the items and the item's name. Ok. It's a new place so I get it. My gf & I decided to split the Philly cheesesteak, fries & Passionfruit Iced Tea. The drink came about 5 mins later & was really good, but the \"Philly Cheesesteak\"we ordered took over 20 mins and came out looking more like a burger than a Philly. The co-owner served it and apologized for the wait.   Overall the food was pretty good whatever it was they served us, but we won't be coming back until this place is fully established. Maybe in like 6 months or so"}
{"text":"This place was okay. The French fries were over seasoned, the chicken looked like it was the bottom of the bag, and the chips were salty. All of the shakes and the smoothies were delicious along with the brownie sundae. I had the strawberry ice cream because they were out of cookies and cream. The egg rolls were greasy, but tasted good and my friend had the beyond burger enjoyed it. They have some board games for you to play while you wait for your food and good music, although it was a little loud. It looks like they are a little under construction still inside. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Our waitress was nice, but the food came out one by one, which i didn't like."}
{"text":"After the previous place (Milk Teaze) closed I told the previous owners it would be tough for me to find another decent boba place to drink boba. Few months later I found out that Cafe No Fur was coming to the same location in Chinatown, and I was excited to hear about hotties in bikini's as servers.   Surprisingly I didn't expect them to serve all vegan products (I'm not Vegan myself), but the boba drinks and desserts turned out to be authentic, fresh and vibrant, regardless of being hesitant to try new things. I haven't tried the food yet, but I plan to do so in the near future.  The owner did a fantastic job to present herself, along with the other staff just as you're about to enter the building. She happens to be one of the successful youngest owners (FYI she's a model btw) I've met, who took a chance to open a Vegan cafe, while coming up with clever ideas.   Cafe No Fur is definitely a recreational place to hangout because they're very open minded about many things, such as taking pictures with the hotties, playing board games (they'll have them soon), surfing the web, and a place to relieve stress.   Sometimes they will host special events (they had a car show during the grand opening), except I haven't been able to attend for various reasons.  I will definitely be coming back more often just because I've been stress free from many past predicaments I've encountered. I would strongly recommend for any guests to attend Cafe No Fur to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere, while having the best customer service.   I have nothing negative to say about this place, other than to say thank you to the entire staff for making my night a pleasant one!"}
{"text":"The servers are very friendly and super cute! The uniforms are classier than the previous establishment. The food is all vegan and yummy! I'm personally not vegan but it's all very appealing. I recommend the egg rolls, the beyond burger, and fries."}
{"text":"First time coming here, only for boba though. We also tried a strawberry funnel cake and it was delicious, especially for being vegan!  But it was a chill, little hidden spot that was a fun environment. The staff is very friendly and the boba there was the best I've had to be honest. I've been deciding whether to try going vegan or not, and if I ever do.. this would be the spot I'd go! Lol. Definitely gonna go back for more Taro Boba!"}
{"text":"I came in for their soft opening. I think the place has great potential! Their drinks, egg rolls, burgers, and fries are really good! If you're looking for something filling, definitely get the beyond burger! It tastes just like a normal beef burger! If you're not too hungry, then definitely try the egg rolls! They're the perfect snack/appetizer. I'm definitely excited to see what other items they decide to add to the menu"}
