{"text":"I come for the ALL U CAN EAT Crab Legs...Only Saturday night...burgers are great too! Get here early with your comfy pants to enjoy every bit of crab you can literally eat. I enjoy the lake scene and sitting on the patio. Oh and the strawberry shortcake is enough for 4 people, seriously!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and had the all you can eat fish fry. It was perfect. The fish was light and flaky and NOT greasy. The fries were the best fries I've had in a long time. Crispy, tasty and not greasy. The views and weather were perfect. We had a nice relaxing time. I recommend if you want to get out of the City."}
{"text":"First off, this review is strictly for the boat rental service which has been on multiple occasions a complete and utter unpleasant experience.  You would think such a job would lead the individuals working there to be pleasant and helpful.  Couldn't be further from the truth.  They are clearly miserable and  always have the worse possible attitudes, any questions are met with hostility and disgust, they seem to try to encourage you not to rent a boat which leads me to believe the whole operation must be a front for some other type of enterprise because they can't be looking to turn much of a profit with the incompetent attitudes they posess.  As a hiring manager I wouldn't give them a mop job.  The marina on that beautiful lake should be ashamed those clowns are even a part of the experience."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the restaurant here many times. A fun, quick get away from town. Decent food at fair prices!"}
{"text":"Saguaro Lake is a bit small, so you can't really let 'er rip here. But with soaring rocky cliffs and the occasional eagle overhead, it is beautiful. Plus it has two other nice features. 

First off, it is surrounded like loads of 4-wheeling trails. Whether you're looking to tear up the sandy washes or climb rocky hills, it's there.

Also, there is a boat-in only campground - Bagley Flat. It contains maybe 10 sites, and several of them are on the water. The scenery can't be beat. But be aware, we encountered LOTS of skunks there and many non-stinging bees. We didn't get stinky or stung, but we did have to mind our manners while we were there.

I would not hesitate to return though. Maybe I would pick a different campsite."}
{"text":"First time here at SAGUARO LAKE. So we checked their website of what to expect.

+ Arrive early. Parking is scarce. Line forms quickly to gain access
+ Fee paid to enter. At time of visit, card only.
+ Facilities throughout it says. But we only counted 2 outhouses.
+ Older and could use some updates
+ Long line to launch and dock your water crafts
+ Found small beaches to lounge
+ Attendants/Rangers were cordial... some were helpful.
+ Lake water ... some plastic debris/trash, oil with water from speed boats, jet skis, and the like.
+ No Wake Zones ... some boaters ignored the posted signs.
+ Convenient location for us.
+ Congested by 9:30AM

If we return, we will arrive and launch EARLIER to enjoy the lake."}
{"text":"Beautiful area! Here are a few of my observations: 
- the lake is clean and is surrounded by beautiful Arizona mountains 
- the parking lot is small. Parking is free if you are just stopping by to eat at the restaurant and / or you are planning on taking the steam boat tour. Paid parking for the rest (campers, boaters, picnickers, etc) 
- there are multiple water activities available here (just plan ahead)
- beach side is small 
- the restaurant on site has gorgeous views of the mountains and lake but the food and the place can definitely use some upgrades 
- small souvenir shop floating on the water for those who like to buy a little something when they visit  
- there are also hiking trails and about 20 min away, there are horseback riding trails as well (paid tours available)

Saguaro lake is a nice outdoor area and it is only about 40 min away from Tempe!"}
{"text":"For over 14 years my husband and I have gone to Lake Powell with a fun bunch for a week or more at a time . We have lots of traditions , competitions and silliness. one of our favorite traditions over the years has been the Annual Fish Fry . This serves as a time to start the banter, planning and summer for our little band of water skiers. This year was no exception. 
Once again the Saguaro Fish Fry served it's purpose .The wives began conspiring with lists of food , plans to relax and hanging out. The husbands talked cars, boats, engines and years gone by . Oh and everybody ate fish ..lots of fish , 

Saguaro Lake Marina is picturesque , relaxing and makes you feel ready to go wake-boarding .The food is solid and simple. The waitresses are good sports and know how to be nice to the mature crowd as well as families and bikers. It's a great place for out of towners or killing time with the relatives."}
{"text":"First time here and employees  just treat you like shit, this place is nice and beautiful, but pple who run this place that's a def story. Renting a boat  better have alot of money & the guy who helping you is no help at all, treat you like shit. \"If you don't like your job get another job.\" Don't ruin it for the guests \"paying customers\""}
{"text":"Beautiful scenery but the damper in coming to this lake is that you apparently need a vehicle pass to park there and don't know this until you approach the entrance. We were happy to pay the fee EXCEPT you have to drive like 17-20 mins back to the Chevron gas station to purchase the pass and come back. What type of sense does that even make? Also, no where on the website is it mentioned that vehicle passes are required and need to be purchased at another location. 

I find it absolutely absurd that people reach their destination ONLY to be told sorry, you need to drive back a couple of miles to pay for a pass. Why you can't purchase right then and there baffles me? 

We ended up having lunch at the Lakeshore restaurant and keeping our vehicle there and walking into the lake/marina. Unlike what I suspect others to have, we didn't have like lawn chairs or coolers and stuff so it wasn't that big of a deal but it was very upsetting to find out you can't even pay to park at the location once you arrive!

Shame on the lake for not being upfront and fully disclosing all the details on the website. I also find it strange that no one disclosed the parking pass (I actually asked the waitress who told me $8) It's like some sort of secret parking society LOL! Outside of that, beautiful day spent at the lake. I have no desire to come back to this lake again tho."}
{"text":"This marina is rather run down now, and it was not a great build to begin with.  The dock planks are all loose and splintery (don't walk barefoot!).  The dock fingers are flimsy and wobbly, to the point of being dangerous at the ends.  There are no cleats (!!) anywhere, just these weird metal loops you have to pull ropes through.

They don't sell ice at the marina store.  How weird, huh?  You have to walk up the hill to the restaurant to get a little 7 pound bag of partially defrosted and refrozen ice.  The service was friendly, but with a lot of rules.  They'd smile while telling you that you can't do this or that.

I have to say the guys at the haul-out were VERY friendly and helpful, and did a great job hauling out my big cruiser for me.

The restaurant is your basic pub style fare, nothing to complain about and nothing to really talk about.

Beautiful lake, but I wouldn't choose this marina again."}
{"text":"This lake is a hidden lil gem... well, I'm sure it's well-known to people who have lived in the Phoenix area for a long time but we stumbled across it yesterday while driving around, taking pictures of cacti.  (yeah - i know)

It's so cute and quaint.  Not a big lake or major water sports destination but, it has a lil restaurant and a marina... and yesterday it was a nice destination and provided some great photos.  

I'll return this summer!. :)

See ya there!"}
{"text":"We have rented here many times. Yes, they can get crazy busy some times so be patient.
Someone from a few years ago mentioned the planks were splintering. They have all been replaced with Trex (man made) planking.
You do not need a Tonto Pass if you are renting a boat. Everyone else entering the lake area needs one and you have to buy in town in advance. 
We just got back from a nice half day pontoon with the family. Not too crowded during the week and the water was perfect. Boat ran fine, no problems. Relaxing day."}
{"text":"great place near town, good restaurant, great views, friendly people."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Scottsdale on vacation and went to the marina to rent a boat at 4pm. on June 21st 2014. The attendants, an older woman and a younger man, were rude, never once said hello. I asked if we cound rent a boat for a couple of hours; there brochure says 8am til 6pm. The lady ( and I use the word loosely) never once looked at me or my wife and said they close at 5 and that everyone is already returning their renatals. The man said thet we wont even get to be out their for hour since it takes 15 minutes to process the paperwork. They clearly had no interest in our business. They, likely they wanted to rush home and to hell with the customer. We felt totally unwelcomed. We felt like we were in the twilight zone.  Forget this lake and visit Canyon Lake marina!"}
{"text":"Expansive marina with fun floating docks to walk on. Lots of perimeter parking. There is a restaurant and and a boat ride to partake of.  There is overflow parking with a massive metal staircase to exercise on."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and love it. Most favorite time is during the winter and it is an excellent place to have your boat repaired as well at PRECISSION MARINE. Jim, one of the mechanics is the mechanics for the rich and famous, no kidding! PRECISSION fits the name for this repair facility for your boat."}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful area.  It's worth the trip to drive up to the lake because of the beautiful scenery.  The restaurant sits over the water with more beautiful views.  We parked in the lot without the Tonto Pass and ate in the restaurant.  The breakfast was good, prices okay considering the location and service okay.

We would definitely return.  There's lots to do in the area.  Several places on the way up rent kayaks, boats and horses.

There's also a \"riverboat\" boat willing to take you on a scheduled ride around the lake.  This place is definitely a gem."}
{"text":"Reviews we saw were complaints for Canyon Lake. Saguaro Lake was really good!! Only complaint was that the fuel indicator did not work."}
{"text":"This is a gorgeous spot.  There is no charge to get to the marina like Lake Pleasant, and the views are fantastic.  The slips seem roomy, and the boat launch area is large and graded nicely.
I love it here!
Bonus:  There's a restaurant with great food, lovely views, and affordable prices!"}
