{"text":"Our experience at this restaurant was horrible.  The waitress hadn't even looked at the menu and had no knowledge of any of the menu items.  We also asked about a food allergy and never got an answer.  Service overall was slow and the food was sub par by most indian standards."}
{"text":"Beautiful, colorful restaurant with a perfect lunch buffet! The food is delicious especially the chili chicken and garlic naan. We were greeted with a smile and Namaste. The staff are very friendly and attentive. Found a new favorite!!"}
{"text":"This food was fabulous. We just ate here for the first time and used a groupon. We have eaten at many Indian restaurants in town and consider ourselves knowledgeable, especially about vegetarian dishes, Nasha was a wonderful surprise. We tried both kinds of dal, each delicious and different. The cauliflower dish was delicate and flavored with coconut and tomatoes. The baigan barta (egglant dish) was creamy and gingery. The breads (naan, etc.) were light and fluffy and not greasy. What a find. The service was friendly and the chef came to our table to answer our questions about the food while ordering. A+"}
{"text":"I consider myself a connoisseur of Indian food coming from two of the best places India for incredible cuisine (Goa and Kerala) this place does indeed rise to the occasion. The lounge can prove to be a visual great and may be awkwardly uncomfortable in the beginning. Take off your shoes and relax a bit and this place turns into quite the exotic resto!"}
{"text":"They were the best, but hey closed :(

Dominic Sakkar, if you have another restaurant in Chandler, our family would love to visit.

The food was so good. The people were great, I just wish they were still there."}
{"text":"Absolutely Pathetic!! If you've got money, please give it to me because the place totally sucks."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have tasted in Az. Thankfully it only borrows the name from a previous restaurant at the same location and that's that. The food is absolutely decadent. Finally the quest for food from back home has ended. Tried the lunch buffet. All the menu items were lightly spicy( how I like it) and filled with flavors . People looking for true Indian flavors,please try the food here. The staff are very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had a really awful experience here, the food was tasteless and the person taking the order was really rude. Please avoid this place if you had a bad week because it will just make it worse for you!"}
