{"text":"The staff are always nice and happy to accommodate when I want to swap something out. Salads are always filling, the edgar allen poe is my favorite, me and my husband come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I came here about 2 weeks ago to try a salad after recently starting a new diet. There are so many options for whatever you need! I was avoiding a high card diet, and my salad maker guided me through all the steps to help me out. Their staff was very knowledgable about all the ingredients and helped me make an awesome salad. Mad (haha) props to Tayler for her help! PS try the Cobb, with olive oil and lemon juice as the dressing, extra mad spice. Amazing!  Only con was how LOUD it is in there! It wasn't even too busy and all the noise echoed without being able to hear over the salad guard thing."}
{"text":"This place is great when I'm trying to eat healthy. Ingredients are always fresh and they let you customize any way you want. I usually get out of there for $9 which is pretty good."}
{"text":"I am giving this a five star review for the category of fast health food. Mad greens is a great alternative to chop shop and some of your more expensive vegetarians places.   They have a wonderful menu full of many salad options and also have a limited wraps menu. You can substitute most meats out in a salad, for example tofu instead of chicken and they always ask you how much dressing you want. Their hummus and soup is also quite good and I have also enjoyed their juice selection.   If you are looking for a quick and healthy meal I would suggest this place! I always leave feeling satisfied and like I didn't eat very fatty carb filled food."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and helpful and the salads are amazing. A special thank you for the patience of one staff member. He let me try several different dressings before completing my beautiful salad. Sorry for not taking note of your name, but thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I always go here for our go to salad place especially once I get out of work at 8 pm. As always the food is awesome and they always make it the way you like it! However, every time I come in here in the evening, they always give it to me in a to go bowl because they said they stopped doing dishes. Not only that but at 8:30 pm they started putting up chairs and closing down. How unprofessional! If you don't want to be there past 9 then you should close at 8 in my opinion. It does not make the environment very enjoyable and it feels like you are being rushed."}
{"text":"The salads are amazing!  My favorite is the create your own salad.  The soups and hummus are excellent.  The staff is also amazingly friendly and helpful. This is a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The people who work there tend to be pretty nice and the food is usually good. BUT... Last time, I happened to get a really rank piece of chicken in my salad that made my life flash before my eyes. It tasted like gingivitis, no exaggeration... Not a pleasant experience. It made me question the freshness of their food a little. Ever since that, I have been a little reluctant to return. Their fresh juices are great, though, and perhaps my favorite thing about Mad Greens. The place has potential, for sure."}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice first time I had the cobb salad second time I have the Mark Twain salad ,the salad dressings just have absolutely no flavor whatsoever although their service is excellent and their produce is fresh it's a little pricey probably won't be going back there again"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out for lunch.  I had the Siam I Am salad with rotisserie chicken, everything else as listed on the menu, and within a few hours was experiencing projectile vomiting and incredibly severe stomach pains.  I think the more appropriate name for this company is \"Friggin' Pist Off Greens\".  Once was enough for an overpriced salad to begin with.  It's now the next morning and the only thing still on my menu is pepto bismol.  They really should do everyone a favor and include a free complimentary side of pepto because you're going to need it.  With so many other restaurants around, my advice is to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not wonderful. It's essentially a salad version of chipotle. The salads are good, but nothing special. Also, I feel like the price was kind of steep for the quality. If I were going to spend $12 on a salad I would probably just go to a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Man, I am a huge fan - having never heard of them before their well-publicized 'free salad day' (still going on today, BTW), and being able to first try them out at a Yelp event.  The staff are super duper pumped, friendly and helpful, and the restaurant is bright and cheery.  I'm a mostly-vegetarian kinda gal, but I love even their citrus-grilled chicken (so much so, that I'm trying in vain to recreate it at home!).  You may make your own salad with up to 4 additional ingredients (not enough IMO, if you choose 'minor' ingredients like green onions and nuts/seeds) or go with one of their standard creations.  But even with the standards, which come in regular and large sizes, you may make minor substitutions with I believe no extra charge.  This is a great addition to Tempe Marketplace, located across from Chipotle and next to Noodles and Co (which I also didn't know had moved in - 2 great Colorado-based chains side-by-side).  Thanks again MAD Greens, I will be back - on my own dime this time!!!"}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying I've not visited the restaurant, but have used them for catering a dozen times. I especially appreciate the healthier options they offer. The salads are creative with unique toppings and dressings. I typically stick with a Cobb salad, an assorted sandwich tray, and fruit bowl. They label the items, too, which helps when trying to decide on which sandwich to choose. The toothpick corresponds to the type of sandwich. Everything is fresh and colorful, light and not heavy. And, delivery has always been spot-on and never late."}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious! I've had the Mad Caesar, Health Nut, and the Hummus Trio Plate. All of it is AHMAZING! I always get the tofu and medium dressing for my salads. You can also substitute and add whatever you like. They also offer fresh juices, I highly suggest the Mint Cooler over ice. Definitely a nice place to eat out but healthy too! Lots of options for any kind of diet."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place when I need something quick and healthy. It has a nice selection of seating and delicious food. Great spot for a pre-movie lunch. My only negative comment is their prices. They're a bit expensive and you can't add anything extra without the price increasing. However, their selection of \"natural\" sodas and awesome tea is great!"}
{"text":"I went in to use my free salad coupon. I got a Ty Cobb with a different dressing, since I'm doing a Whole30 and cannot eat gluten, dairy, or sugar. It was a pretty good salad, not great-- the lettuce definitely could have been fresher. I would NEVER pay upwards of $9 for it, which is the actual retail price.  Side note: it's absurd how many of the MAD Greens dressings contain sugar and/or gluten. There's no need for either of those things in salad dressing, so... why? Kind of defeats the purpose of a \"healthy\" lunch spot.  The employees were pretty unenthusiastic and seemed disinterested. I do appreciate that my coupon was accepted and honored without fuss. However, I just don't see a need to return to MAD Greens when I can go across to Chipotle, where the ingredients are better, the staff is nicer, and the food is cheaper.  Thanks for the free salad, though."}
{"text":"I tried the \"Mad Caesar\" and loved it. I got the regular size and still had a bunch to take home afterwards. They asked me if I wanted two containers of dressing to take home and didn't charge which was a nice plus.   Highly recommend if you need a new salad place in the area especially since most of the restaurants are more fast food type places at Tempe Marketplace near the theaters.   #lfthx #madgreens #madgreensTempeMarketplace"}
{"text":"Went to go eat lunch at Tempe marketplace and found this new place! I thought it was just going to be salads and that was it... But it had Panini's, wraps, salads, and juices. The atmosphere is industrial and clean.  I had their signature BLT wrap with added blue cheese and it was so good! If you get the chance and are in Tempe marketplace you need to eat here!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I absolutely regret ordering here because service was terrible. I felt so intimidated by the girl \"helping\" me, as I was asking questions about sizes and different menu items. Did not feel welcome and would not recommend."}
{"text":"If I could have given this place a 0 I would have, the food is mediocre but what makes it terrible is the customer service. My boyfriend ordered his Ty Cobb with extra chicken and steak and the person on the phone explained it would be an extra $3-4 which was fine. We got home with the food and there was barely any chicken and barely any steak at all, what's the point in paying a lot extra when you don't even receive it? So we called the manager and told him what the problem was and all the manager, Mike, could say was \"I'm sorry you feel that way\". Really? That's the response we get? Sorry but for the price we paid for the food and the quality we received we could get something far better and give out business to people who actually deserve it."}
{"text":"The customer service was amazing!! Their manager was so kind and made sure that we didn't leave unhappy. Super amazing people work at this place!!"}
{"text":"I heard about mad greens a long time ago but never really came here because it didn't seem like they had a ton of vegan options. Stopped by Tempe Marketplace for dinner and saw their menu, the Buddha bowl sounded good so finally decided to try the food. Definitely should have started eating here sooner. They give you a good portion with lots of healthy ingredients for a decent price. Got the buddha bowl with tofu and pumpkin seeds and the sauce it comes with is vegan (don't remember what it's called). So good, I've been craving another one all week! I have a feeling most of their other dishes can be subbed with tofu and other ingredients to be made vegan. Didn't ask but I will once I get tired of the buddha bowl, if that ever happens. Doubt it."}
{"text":"Salads are great customer service is not.  There were three people on the line and not a one of them acknowledge my existence. Once the cashier was begrudgingly ringing up someone else did she ask for my name.  I was handed my salad with little more than a grunt. Fake smiles and niceness are the least that should come with any consumer Exchange exchange."}
{"text":"It's great to have healthy alternatives to the regular fast food places. Got the Bonnie Parker. It has a nice Smokey heat that's not over bearing and great combination of sweet and salty. Greens are fresh too!"}
{"text":"It was fast service and so delicious. Their soda is super good too. The workers were very friendly. Would go back again"}
{"text":"As of now it's a 3.5 for me, but because of the good intentions behind the restaurant, I'm rating it a 4.  The motto is \"Eat Better,\" and that's something everyone needs to do.  Unfortunately, we Americans are a little used to how delicious unhealthy food tastes, so I think this food is going to take a little getting used to.    My wife and I both got the Annie Oakley Paninis, which come with Chicken, Avocado, Bacon, and Cheese.  They were good, but you could taste how healthy they were ... it's really so weird to say that, but we were expecting the flavors to pop a bit more ... again, because we're used to unhealthy, super delicious food.  We'll likely give Mad Greens another shot, and honestly I hope this is part of a larger trend of restaurants getting healthier.  As we become used to healthy food as a society, the taste I'm sure will improve, and in the meantime, the price isn't bad and the staff is great, so it's well worth your time.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If I'm craving a salad then Mad Greens is the first place that comes to mind! I've been to the location at Tempe Marketplace a few times now and have had nothing but good experiences. While their salads are a bit on the expensive side, I don't mind paying the cost because compared to other places, the salad ingredients they use seem more fresh and crisp.  My go-to is the Cobb salad. It's made up of multiple different ingredients; the egg & chicken make it filling, the bacon gives it crunch, and the mad spice avocado makes it slightly spicy! Since I'm not a fan of blue cheese dressing, I get it with ranch instead. I sometimes substitute bacon for an equally crunch ingredient, croutons, and that tastes really good too. If you're a fan of extra kick in your salads then definitely ask them to mix yours up with some additional mad spice at the end!  The staff is always friendly and they make sure to ask at the beginning if you want to make any substitutions. They also carry Maine Root soda which to me is more delicious than traditional Coke & Pepsi drinks. I'll definitely be back and recommend this place to others. Can't wait for them to open up a location in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Healthy, fresh, made to order, and fast.  This is a Great place for lunch or a light dinner."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited about this concept. It reminded me of Pluto's in Palo Alto, which is fantastic.  Sadly, I had the most bland salad ever. I had balsamic vinaigrette dressing, but I tasted no balsamic. I'm not sure how that's even possible. So overall this place is a disappointment. I wouldn't return. On to the next place."}
{"text":"Sooooo disappointed! My first time trying this place and it was so bad.  97% of my \"big Cobb salad\" was iceberg lettuce.  The other 3% they gave me 3-4 cubes of avocado, 2 tomatoes, bits of egg and bacon here and there and grilled chicken.  To top it off, I LOVE LOVE LOVE spicy foods.  However, this \"salad\" was rendered completely inedible because whoever was in charge of adding the spice put so much on it that it could not possibly be consumed.  There was so much it was clumping everywhere in the bowl. One mouthful and the rest of my lunch was doomed.  I used the app to order and it is ridiculous.  You can select the cobb, but you pretty much have to pretend you are building your own salad because unless you manually select a protein, it will not be added to the salad.  How many people don't figure that out before they exit with their take out?  I really wanted to like this place but for $10, I would be much happier building my own from the salad bar at Sprouts or something.  Save your money."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Mighty Aphrodite, but it's seasonal so this time I got one of their new grain bowls with bacon and sriracha and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place all together. The employees were extremely friendly and the food is awesome! I orders the Edgar Allen Poe and it's awesome! Super fresh and wonderful ingredients. They also support local farms which is a big plus! Not only did I take home a free salad and awesome ice tea but I also got a bag full of fresh organic locally grown tomatoes which I plan to use in tonight's dinner. It was definitely worth the wait in line :) mad greens I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"Accurate Yelp. Food was great and ladies behind counter working were super friendly.  Had the hummus trio and doc Holliday, and don Quixote. I would seriously order them all again....but have to decide if I want to experiment with the other menu items."}
{"text":"Excellent salad & soup.  We got the \"Bonnie Parker\" salad and a soup.  The prices are fair and the quantity was huge.  The ingredients are fresh. The place is clean & conveniently located near the Harkins theater. The gal who served us was very nice and professional.  I did not see any name tags so I cannot mention a name. It would be nice if they offered wines but for a quick salad you cannot go wrong here.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This is an update from my first review back in July.  I have gone now 3 more times and I think it may be my last :(  They just are not consistent, especially if I go on  weekend.  This last time I ordered a salad based on the ingredients such as figs, I ordered it, they started to make it, and it wasnt until we got to the toppings part that they told me they dont have figs!!! Well had I known that when I ordered I would have changed my order, my point is, is that the staff should know what they do and dont have so when someone orders they can make a decision on what they want.  They also dont really listen when I asked for the dressing on the side, the girl was so busy worrying about the line of people that she just threw the dressing ON my salad!  I said, I wanted it on the side!  I took it anyway.  Ordered another salad that was supposed to have chicken on it, they forgot to add the chicken!  These are some of the things that will make me not go back."}
{"text":"Oh look at the giant salad bar behind the glass. Yes, it looks fresh, but at this growing chain, its all about the money and not the customer. You want a crouton (normal part of most salads), it will cost 75 cents, how bout some sunflower seeds...yep 75 cents too.     They should turn the salad bar towards the customers and let us have a go at it... aka whole foods style. Its an easy concept to digest. Most all salads are about $9- $13 and they all basically contain 4 ingredients plus a chicken if you pick correctly. Even if you make your own salad, its 4 choices. Really? The salad bar contains like 50 things, so unless your aiming for that $15 salad, take your 4 choices and like it people.       Also, my salad had the lettuce core tossed in....probably will get a charge for 75 cents on my card in the future. Greek salad was rather dull, but at least the large size was a big serving. I don't see any four item salad bars in any neighborhood, so will take my business to places where i can truly get what i want and not get nickle and dimed as usual by some corporate lettuce freaks."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Went in for lunch and the place seemed decent so thought we would give it a try. The girl making my salad was so difficult to hear I had to keep asking her to repeat herself and she was rolling her eyes. The restaurant was so loud -music and employees chatting behind the bar. Got the salads and they were absolutely awful. Didn't think anyone (especially a salad restaurant) could mess up a salad. Old lettuce drenched in awful tasting dressing (even though we asked for light dressing). Got charged extra for shrimp...there were three in my salad. We didn't finish our food-left hungry and with a headache. How this place has positive reviews is beyond me :("}
{"text":"So, we are on a date night and love to try new places. It's right after Thanksgiving, so we thought we'd give Mad Greens a try and get in some healthy food. I ordered the \"Mad Mollie\". I thought wow, grilled chicken, grilled portobello mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and molasses in the dressing, I can't go wrong! Well, it looked beautiful, but it was completely flavorless. I couldn't believe it was even possible with those glorious ingredients, but sure enough, it had no taste whatsoever. I finally got a package of salt to sprinkle over it. My husband ordered the Annie Oakley Panini. It was equally bland. It's shocking that you could even make a bland panini! I gave them two stars because the staff were absolutely lovely people. If I rated just the food, I'd have to give it no stars."}
{"text":"It's alright. You can find better salads at Sprouts. I've been here twice and the salads don't have a lot of flavor and the meat tastes frozen. Its a little pricey but if you need something healthy and you're in a pinch, it's OK. Definitely my go-to salad spot."}
{"text":"Bland and pricey. This location is very nice with a new/updates interior. It's usually not very busy despite being in Tempe Marketplace and I think I know why.   I ordered the Poe which has mixed greens, pears, apples, walnuts and I substituted out the blue cheese for mango. It also has a Port Vinaigrette. Overall it didn't taste like much as only the apples and pears gave it flavor. For $10+ you can probably buy ingredients to make a similar salad at home for a week.   The service was average. There was new employees that were still getting use to things."}
{"text":"Wow. Yummy yummy. I have never been to mad greens before and man what I have been missing! I got the southwest bowl. I can't stop eating it. The store was pretty busy and the two on staff keep smiles on there faces and were so informative. Wonderful Sunday. #lfthx #madgreens #madgreenstempemarketplace"}
{"text":"Most of the times I've gone here I've gotten the runs!  The other times, well the employees are friendly and helpful and the salad tastes good, but the runs, man, ain't nothing makes up for that.  I really don't have anything else to say but this app keeps demanding I type more, so I did."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The menu has something for everybody. Unfortunately there is no customer service skills from this staff. For such a bright and delicious place I wish that there could be more personable experience when dining here."}
{"text":"Nice and clean! Awesome teas! Great low calorie salads that taste great, definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Awesome doesn't even begin to describe this delicious and healthy experience. 'Fast Food' turns 'Fast Healthy Food'. Grab a salad of your desire, get drink (watch the sugar peeps), flip up your laptop or iPad - wifi is available and free - and work away or just chill and watch the buzz outside. Ladies & gents, avoid the empty fast carbs in the eateries (I know they're yummy, fat, sugar, salt always is) left and right just a few times more often and you'll feel the difference immediatly and see the difference soon. Enjoy ;-)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Mad Greens! Super yummy, with lots of healthy options (with non-meat options, which I appreciate as well). Very clean, quick service, and fresh ingredients.   I ordered the Siam I Am with their special mad seasoning to top it off. Crunchy veggies, quinoa, and a sweet ginger soy dressing to counter the savory. Definitely a great option if you are vegetarian/vegan, but also delicious across the spectrum of dietary preferences. Also, the food is so fresh, that it keeps really nicely if you want to save some for the next day. So good!"}
{"text":"Really yummy salad, friendly staff and great atmosphere! This was my first time visiting #MADgreens and I will be back, healthy,delicious food at a great price and in a great location. #lfthx"}
{"text":"Best fresh salad I have had since relocating to Phoenix! This place will easily become one of my favorites, yes the price is little high but quality is best! I can not wait to try the rest of the menu one by one!"}
{"text":"Was craving a salad and my friend thankfully took me to MAD Greens. After browsing the menu, I was tempted to order the ever so basic \"Cobb Salad,\" but when my friend explained to me how her favorite was the \"Edgar Allan Poe,\" it was hard to choose anything else.  The EAP comes with baby greens, apples, pears, walnuts, bleau cheese, and grilled steak. Port wine vinaigrette tops it off, giving it a creamy yet tarte flavor. I got myself the large salad and ended up substituting the pears for avocado. All in all, I loved the salad. It was delicious and a wonderful blend of ingrediants. Often times at CYO salad restaurants like MAD Greens, it's a rare occasion finding steak so that was a pleasant and delicious surprise!  With tax, my meal came out to be roughly $13. Although this may seem on the pricier side at first glance, the same salad would easily cost $20 at a sit down restaurant so I have no complaints. Furthermore, my tummy was satisfied for a large portion of the day as it kept me filled.  Quick, fresh, easy, and most importantly, delicious. I'll definitely be back to MAD Greens if I'm ever in the Tempe area again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mad Greens! Their portions are huge and taste so crisp and fresh. Look out for Emily! She's so kind and outgoing. She was so patient as my friend and I struggled to choose from all the different options. Also, the sodas are AMAZING. They don't carry the usually Coke and Pepsi, they have delicious natural choices, my favorite being the blueberry soda! 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband for the first time today. Even though they are newly open, service was great. We both had salads and the hummus trio. Everything was fresh and delicious. I'm looking forward to going back and trying something new. Yum!"}
{"text":"Seriously best Chicken Cesar salad I have ever had in my life.  Great portions and everything was fresh af!  Make this joint into a drive thru and put more locations about, I would definitely dig this on the go, but their current location is very nice, and if you eat in they give you real bowls and forks, which makes it feel a little bit more classy.  I finished my large bowl completely, and left feeling great.  Nice to treat yourself to something   healthy AND Tasty that isn't greasy garbage and not dealing with that upset stomach afterwords."}
{"text":"If you're looking for nutrition packed fast food, this is your spot.  This restaurant offers a menu with a wide variety of salads, wraps, and sandwiches.  They have several recommendations, but also allow for substitutions or modifications.  I loved that they allow their guests to choose the amount of dressing on their chosen salad (light, medium, or heavy).  The restaurant set up is clean and ordering is easy to navigate.  Leaving this restaurant I felt satisfied and light, not craving more or feeling overly stuffed.  I would definitely recommend this as a guilt-free fast food option."}
{"text":"Finally a chipotle for salads! If you wish that subway had fresh foods meet mad greens.   I love that they give you suggestions on what combinations of falorsngo well but if you want to build your own, they are down for that too.   The soup is great The wraps are great Their soda fountain is fresh and pure cane sugar.  Recommend for vegetarians  and vegans as well"}
{"text":"I should give 5 stars because the employee was VERY customer service oriented and put up with my bad attitude, but the concept is dull. Salad. If you add anything extra it's .75$ per item which can add up quick if you simply want cheese, croutons and cucumbers. Anyway, not my favorite place. I will seek a salad bar from Whole Foods before I return here. Thanks again for the great customer service and smiles."}
{"text":"One of my first picks when i need something fresh and healthy! Both caesar salads are delicious! The gals behind the counter at the Tempe location are always super friendly."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for the first time, thought we would check it out after a movie.  Ordered Mona Lisa Penni and one of the wraps along with the Aphrodite salad to go.  Noticed one customer complained they waited 20 min for there Penni.  Mean while we watched them make several orders with no gloves.  Our Penni to go had no side salad however the people that ordered in received one with their meal. Also the food was bland and portion size was definitely not worth the price.  Now after reading this I realize that they forgot our sauces as well.  All in all bad customer service as everyone was new and seemed confused about the menu and the food was overpriced and not very good.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a healthy and fresh salad! I've been a few times and the employees were helpful in explaining salad sizing and how it works! The Don Quixote salad has been my favorite so far!   The tea is also delicious! There are a few different options and I liked that they had the caffeine content displayed on the container. It was night time and I appreciated being warned about that as I probably would have chosen the most caffeinated flavor.   Service was fast and the facility was clean. I will be making this a regular stop for dinner even if I'm not going to the mall to shop."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! My first time, a free salad and drink! Local farms utilized and friendly people! DEFINITELY going to be a regular!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Lots of great salads and dressings.  The one gripe that I have is the protein portions are a bit small and if you add extra protein, the price gets to be a bit steep."}
{"text":"I have been to MAD Greens twice. On opening day I had a chance to try any salad I wanted and I chose the TY Cobb. This salad is absolutely amazing. I also love that you can really customize your salad. So if you don't want certain things on your salad you can opt them out or add different items.  The serving size is huge. I had so many leftovers that I didn't know what to do with them. Definitely get a drink because their tea selection and drink selection is wonderful.  I love the ingredients they use because they make them fresh on site. Also most of the produce they use are from local farmers which helps boost our local economy.  I would have given this place five stars but was disappointed with my panini that I received on my second trip. The flavors weren't that great and reminded me that I should stick with the salads from now on out. Also the prices are a little high but it's mainly due to the ingredients they use. So if you don't have much money to spend, you might want to skip this place.  Other than that if you love healthy eating, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"The great thing about coming here is that there are wholesome options among the other temptations. There is a wide variety of options for vegetarians and omnivores alike. I usually dont come here however because it does tend to be a bit pricy. However if you do the food is good,  the portions are generous and there soda is delicious"}
{"text":"This is our first time here and we went for the build your own salad with a cup of chicken tortilla soup on the side! Everything is delicious and the Maine Root Beer soda is amazing!  There was a little mixup at the register with a new worker but someone came out to help and we ended up with a discount on top of the $10 salad coupons we already had so that was a nice bonus!  Sitting at the bar seating facing outdoors so nice to be able to see out but still be inside where its cool!  The large salad is huge and I went with spinach, southwest chicken, some veggies n croutons and traditional ranch dressing. My husband did the same except went with the horseradish ranch and both are delicious!  We had a really hard time using Google maps to find the place once we parked so just know its where most of the restaurants are right across from Chipotle! =)"}
{"text":"The menu looks good, but when I ordered and went to pay they told me the panini I wanted was out, and I only had one panini option. And I quote, \"so you wanna change up ya order or what?\" Didn't even give me the option of the Mona Lisa panini without whatever item they were out of to complete it."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Mad Greens since it first opened locally so I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! I ordered a southwest bowl (newer menu item) which was basically a hybrid salad/quinoa bowl. It was filled with lots of grains and veggies and topped with chicken. I felt like the bowl was so well balanced, corn for a little sweet, avocado for creaminess, tomato for pops of juicy flavor. The dressing was the stand out though! The bowl had a little kick without being too hot and super filling. I paired it with a Mexican Coke which was the perfect balance to my meal. I ate it so fast I didn't even get a chance to take a pic! I will definitely be back for another bowl here soon."}
{"text":"I FOUND A BANDAID IN MY SALAD... My friend and I were eating lunch here at the the Tempe Marketplace location and halfway through my salad, I found a bandaid in my food. The staff apologized and gave us both refunds, but needless to say I will never be eating here again."}
{"text":"This place is fast and the salads are good! There aren't a lot of healthy Choices at Tempe market place so this would be your best option. After a long day of shopping something easy and fast works out in my favor, so I will be back! The prices are a bit pricey but you do get enough food out of it. There are two different sizes in salads and a dollar difference so going with the bigger size makes more sense. I'll be sure to do that next time."}
{"text":"You don't have to be vegan to enjoy a good salad. The problem is, it's hard to find a salad that makes you want to go back for more. And most of the salads you will find are bland and flavorless. Mad Greens, at the east end of Tempe Marketplace, will blow that notion right out of your mind.  Mad Greens has a bright and airy atmosphere and was very busy this past Friday, when me and a co-worker visited for lunch. That's saying something because this location has a lot of competition in the vicinity. There are at least seven other restaurants within steps of Mad Greens. This explains why the parking is so horrible here (and why I deducted one star).  The menu is clever and simple. Right away you can see they offer a bunch of creatively named salads and also paninis and wraps. I chose the \"Mad Molly Brown\". It is made with spinach, tomatoes, mozzarella, grilled onions, green onion and southwest grilled chicken. I added the Mad seasoning which balanced the sweet dressing that it was tossed in. Quite simply, this was one of the best tasting salads I've ever had!  Salad prices range from about $7.50 to just over $10. Mine with a beverage was $10 and change. I think it's a fair price for a delicious salad that blows the rest out of the water they're sitting in. Plus, you can get a filling meal for about what you'd spend at other restaurants... Without the guilt."}
{"text":"Great place for a fully customizable salad or healthy juices.  They also have paninis, soup, Hummus,  wraps and a kids menu, but I have not tried them yet.  The two salads I have tried are the Sam I Am and the Crazy Ivan with slight tweaks.  The one downfall is it's pricey otherwise  they'd get that coveted 5th star."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots.  Place is always clean.  Great choices for salads.  I either get a build your own with chicken or the Siam I am.  A small is enough for me.  They also have the best ice...it's the trainers ice instead of cubes...little thing but it makes a difference to me."}
{"text":"Love this place! They need to come to Temecula/Murrieta  Ca!  Got the Edgar Allan Poe and my wife got the Thai Cobb. Both were amazing! Definitely found a good healthy spot to offset the gut busting food my family makes during the holidays."}
{"text":"As others have said, the price is a hair high for what it is, but it's great to have another fast food option for veggie-heavy lunches"}
{"text":"Anytime I need something healthy and quick this is my go to place. Their mad Caesar is my absolute favorite salad. I wish they didn't change their grilled chicken to the citrus, but I always substitute. I would recommend ordering online as dinner time gets quite busy. Everyone knows me by name and is sooooo very kind."}
{"text":"Wow so disappointed today. They have been so consistent for months and today I ordered   a wrap and it was all wrap and no filling bummer!!!"}
{"text":"I'm eating my southwest bowl and I get partially through it and there's a huge long black hair, and I have blonde hair. Ruined my appetite to say the least, contacted the store and they took down my number because no manager is on duty, hope they make this right. I get accidents happen but it's extremely gross."}
{"text":"MAD Greens always has a great selection of salads. The more traditional salads (Caesar, cobb) are available, but they also have different creations, including seasonal salad. Their order set-up is quick and similar to that of Paradise where you go to the counter, choose your salad, they mix it in front of you, and you leave the line with your salad. Pricing is in the middle range.  This location specifically has a trendy interior, located inside Tempe Marketplace. The employees are always nice and very quick. They do a good job keeping this place clean every time we come in. They have a glass roll up door that provides nice exposure to the outside world."}
{"text":"Mad greens is delicious. I love the five. I love how many varieties of healthy food items you can get. Not to mention their drinks are made of all natural ingredients. You get soda made with real sugar or really tasty teas."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at this place.  Not only was the food great but Katie provided an exceptional customer experience. What a great employee! This was my first time here since I'm visiting for business from Birmingham Alabama, but I will come back one more time before I go home."}
{"text":"Very good if you're into big, customized salads. They don't quite have the quality that would make this a five-star establishment however.   I may be spoiled on the east coast with sweetgreen but I'm more used to multiple organic ingredients, lots of vegan pre-made options, and more than two local purveyors of produce.   That said they do a good job and you get a big, filling meal with their large salad size. When ordering online some of the customization is limited; however, if you go on person it's easy to get multiple proteins or extra goodies. The prices are super reasonable maybe even too inexpensive as I wouldn't mind spending a couple extra bucks for some higher level greens.   They do a lot of spicy options and their hot mix is fun.  The staff is very personable and laid back. They seem to have a lot of soups and wrap options. I'd like it a bit more if vegan choices were more clearly labeled but that's only annoying me.   The restaurant itself is clean and bright and located in a fun mall environment if that's possible. This is very much convenience oriented so think chipotle + saladworks in terms of dining experience."}
{"text":"Bollywood Wrap! I mean, if you love curry as much as I do... which is a whole lot. They have a curry mayo that I asked her to go heavy on... the veggies were crisp and delicious. Granted I felt it could use maybe a grape or two, that is my own fault because they may have had some I could have requested be added. I was in a bit of a hurry and didn't see what delicious freshness I could have added. I ordered it as it was and enjoyed it nevertheless. I will absolutely go back to try some of their salads which they have a great number of. There are a few options for wraps and paninis but not like the options for salads. They make their own dressings and seem to get local veggies where and when they can. I would like to see more MAD greens around the valley so I can frequent them more often for lunch. Price was decent for what I go and mmmm, I love that curry mayo!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to get healthy food. I'm not keen into super healthy but they have bacon to somehow make the transition easier! They have salads and wraps too! I got my double spicy bacon bowl!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for soggy, yellow and rotten lettuce with very little protein, you have come to the right place. The good news is that you can pay $10 for it too!  Im finally fed up with this place. I try to eat healthy but I am tired of getting ripped off. The lettuce is almost always gross and they are very stingy with the chicken.  No thank you! See my attached photo if you want to know what their $10 salad looks like."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My 7 yr old said the Athena salad was the best salad he's ever had!  Fast and friendly service as always."}
{"text":"Excellent salad selection, clean and nice setting, nice concept.  I went here for lunch for the first time today, and I'm pretty satisfied with what I found. If I'm looking for a good, healthy lunch, this is a great option. The location at Tempe Marketplace is nice, right among several other restaurants. The line moves pretty quickly, so we didn't have to wait long to order and get our food. There is good seating--I especially like that there's a big, communal table in addition to some booths and elevated seating--and plenty of light.  As for the food, it's definitely good. There is a selection of paninis, wraps, and juices in addition to the salads, but it's really the salads that dominate the menu. There is a wide variety of pre-designed salads (almost all of which sounded appetizing), and there's also the option of making one's own salad from the available ingredients. There are a ton of options!  Despite initially being interested in the Siam I Am, I ended up ordering the Crazy Ivan (and substituted spinach and kale for the default mixed greens). It came with grilled chicken, pumpkin seeds, roasted beets, and croutons (which I switched out for toasted sliced almonds). I really appreciated that they ask how much dressing you want on your salad: light, medium, or heavy. I don't like my salads swimming in dressing, so it's nice that they think about this and make a part of the ordering process. The salad was delicious! I ordered the \"big\" size, and it left me feeling just right. It looked enormous when I took it to my table, but it ended up being a really good amount for me. I went with a couple of friends, and they both really enjoyed the salads they got as well: one created her own salad, and it looked fantastic.  I'll definitely be back when I'm in the mood for salad. I'm happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was an off day or what but a very uncomfortable first experience here. Walking in we were greeted very nicely by the gentleman taking orders (we just got pita and hummus) and then told to go to the cash register to pay. Standing at the register seemed to be the manager who spent her time talking to the departing shift. When she finally came around she assured us someone would be around to help. Stood there for a bit and some of the kitchen staff came over and told us to sit and the food would be out shortly. Then we were told we needed to pay by the guy who took our order but he didn't know who was on register. There were plenty of employees standing around in the empty store, and two registers.  Took awhile to finally pay and get our food. Food was good (hence the 3 stars) but for as little interaction as we should of had already, we had a significant waiting around time. Not planning on returning."}
{"text":"Went to Mad Greens with a coworker over our lunch break today, the Da Vinci salad was delicious but the service was awful! I dont know of the employees havent received proper training or what but everyone behind the counter seemed very flustered and confused. Not only was it slow but one employee in particular was extremely rude. Would be a great spot for lunch if it wasn't for the staff."}
{"text":"I had the Albert E's BLT and it was de-lis-cious!  The Bacon was crispy, the chicken plentiful, greens fresh and crunchy and tomatoes just added to the flavor. This is actually the 3rd thing I've ordered from Mad greens and everything has been good. Everything. Even got the detox drink, don't get me wrong it taste like a detox but afterwards I felt great.  Wow"}
{"text":"Stopped in for date night and something healthy to eat before our movie. There are couple things that could have been better. First, it would have been great to be acknowledged when we walked in. The music was too loud. And the Tomato soup was flavorless. There didn't seem to be enough servers until it got super busy which was, after we came in.   The good things. The bowels were nice, tasty and fresh. They were both good. We each tasted everything. The soup was a great temperature, ready to eat right away. The bowels were delicious and the rice was warm.  It was a good meal overall."}
{"text":"In addition to receiving obvious sass for not knowing the correct name of a smoothie (\"cooler\"), paying more than $7 for a small, and waiting almost 15 minutes although the building was empty, the drink we received tasted like a bunch of grass shaken up in a cup of water (gross). Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the Apple Greenie and received the Green Detox I ordered the Mad Caesar and received the Athena or TY Cobb (can't tell) I'd have to call this one a disappointment today.  AAAAND now I'm hungry, but stuck at work, sooo yah! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Mad greens is sooo tasty!! Very fresh ingredients and so many options across the board. I have only tried the salads, but they have never failed. Maybe I'll venture out and try a wrap next time! I went with the Pancho Villa and added tomatoes, red onion, cotija cheese. It comes with the cilantro lime dressing, sooo amazing. I paired it with a prickly pear lemonade and have half of the salad for tomorrow. The grilled citrus chicken is soooo amazing. I need to try the steak. This location was busy but quick, friendly, and got everything 100% on point!!!! Must give his place a try. You can share the large portion!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great option to have in the mall, especially right next to Nektar. Healthy options are somewhat rare around campus, so I'm happy to make this one of my regular stops.   They have a wide selection of salad combinations and the staff will make sure you are still good with each thing going in it to make sure you aren't allergic or prefer something else.   It was a nice vibe without being too busy, a perfect lunch spot. They also have their own like of sodas which are a nice healthy alternative, along with a good selection of teas and bottled juices.   Overall a great place to grab a salad and drink for lunch, probably the healthiest option in the Tempe marketplace food court."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to MAD Greens where I had a late lunch with a friend. We were greeted when we entered the restaurant and having never ate here before the staff answered our questions about how to order. Our food was made quickly in front of us. We were even offered samples of the salad dressing. What I liked about eating in the restaurant is that our food was served in real bowls and utensils rather than paper/plastic products. I ordered the Greek salad and my friend ordered the Southwest bowl. We both enjoyed our meals and thought the regular sized serving was ample and sufficient."}
{"text":"This was my first time at MAD Greens. Overall the food was a disappointment. I got the Don Quixote Salad with tofu instead of chicken. I got medium dressing (mistake, should have gone light or on the side) and the house root beer. The root beer was great and the employees were friendly, but the salad was not very good. The ginger pieces overwhelmed the other flavors. Everything got mushy quickly."}
{"text":"I love that this place opens from 7-9am for juicing. They have great salads but a little overpriced and need more options to put in them. Not bad if you are craving a salad and the dressings are great!"}
{"text":"Was starving after lots of walking and shopping. Ordered a large specialty salad(first one on menu sunami I think is what is was called).  At first I thought the large salad would be too much food but it was so amazing I ate it all. I washed it down with pomegranate lime green tea with medium caffeine.  Everything was delicious and I'm definitely coming back to this place! I was so hungry I forgot to take pics!  That's a first for me lol"}
{"text":"If you want a healthy refreshing quick lunch, stop here! My friend and I split two paninis- The Mona Lisa and the Annie Oakley. Both delicious, but I left not full."}
{"text":"My advice is to stay away from the salads here.  I ordered some special strawberry salad.  They are out of cucumbers.  Okay it's my favorite but I picked tomatos instead.  Well the inside of them where green and they tasted sour.  The strawberries also sour.  The lettuce was frozen.   The citrus chicken was good and the almonds.  But really it's one of the worst salads I have ever had.  When you call yourself mad greens.  I expect the greens to be fresh.  Be sure your refrigeration doesn't freeze the produce.  and if you have a special because strawberries are in season then be sure they are fresh and don't taste sour."}
{"text":"My office ordered for lunch today. I wasn't impressed. I got the small Ty Cobb salad.  First off, the online ordering sucks. Any items that are described on the menu should be automatically checked in the on line system. The person that did our ordering didn't know that she needed to check a protein for my salad. It's described as coming with southwest chicken on the menu.   My red onions were discs. Not rings, discs. And old. I don't know how you cover someone's salad with those, or how they even make it into the acceptable pile. Besides the bad slicing, they were limp and sliced about 5 days ago. I also got several extremely soft, almost rotten tomato pieces that were way past their prime. A couple were slices from a big tomato, and a couple were grape tomatoes that had been cut in half. All of them were goopy, slimy and disgusting. One of the grape tomatoes was like a giant red booger. I picked it out of my salad and flicked it off my finger into the garbage can. The lettuce was meh. Mostly ok but a few old pieces, turning brown.  For a $10 salad, the toppings were very skimpy. Maybe 1/4 of an egg, two dime size pieces of avocado. Very small salad dressing, pretty good but not the highest quality. No blue cheese chunks in it.  Check out my reviews. I don't trash places. This was just genuinely bad."}
{"text":"My last review of Mad Greens was a poor one but I got a chance to try them again. This time I went for a customized bowl. I was extremely pleased. I really liked the tofu from last time but they didn't have it today. I was hesitant to go for chicken but the cubed ones have substance than the shredded. The dish wasn't low carb with the pasta but a girl has to treat herself sometimes. I was able to go half pasta and half kale. The toppings were southwestern chicken, tomatoes, artichoke, kalamata olives, goat cheese and creamy yogurt dressing. Absolutly delicious. #redemption"}
{"text":"I really enjoy mad greens especially in Tempe market place. I like they it's a healthy but quick option! I usually grab lunch here and never have to wait too long to grab a bite to eat! I love the wraps and the ice tea is amazing!"}
{"text":"Mad Greens just opened in the Valley, and I think it will do great! It offers very well made and a wide variety of salads and wraps in a moderately-fast food set up with a counter much like Chipotle's set up. You get to watch your salad be made and, of course, have input into how much of what goes into it. They hand shred the parmesan cheese which is a big plus! They also have Maine root gourmet soda. The lemonade tasted fresh, and the root beer was one if the best I've had. I think Mad Greens will do great!"}
{"text":"Mad Greens was delicious! The service was fast and the food was fresh. The hummus is so good as well. I love that they have so many options and different varieties of salads and dressings. You can customize any salad to be exactly what you want. My kids also enjoyed the soup. I would definitely visit again and recommend it."}
{"text":"I was recommended to this place by a friend. I loved it. Great fresh organic ingredients and large portions. Perfect for when you want a filling lunch without feeling you need a nap afterwards. Highly recommend for a quick casual lunch."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out the Tempe Marketplace location of Mad Greens after eating at the Mad Greens in North Scottsdale for the Elite Yelp event.  I had my eye on the Don Quixote with the Mad Spice. This lovely salad was filled with corn, mango, spice-dipped avocado, and seasoned shrimp. All the ingredients were very fresh and the dressing went well with the greens and the mix-ins. The only slight negative was that the shrimp was slightly overcooked. It still was quite tasty though!  Service was good but it was hard to hear my salad maker because of all the reverberating voices and general loud atmosphere in the restaurant. Although I came at a fairly busy time I had no problem finding a seat.   I'll definitely come here again to try more salads, soups, and sandwiches."}
{"text":"My first MAD Greens experience was a couple of weekends ago when I met friends for lunch at Tempe Marketplace. It's essentially a Chipotle but for salads! They have several \"pre-built\" salad options or you can create your own. All of the ingredients looked fresh and there is a fairly endless combination of options to choose from. They also have a large selection of dressings to choose from.  This place is now on my list of healthy options while eating out!"}
{"text":"Yay! So happy to see Mad Greens has made its way to Arizona. I became a fan when I lived in Boulder.   Love the salads, of course (the regular size is more than enough food, only go for the bigger one if you are REALLY hungry!) and the hummus was a nice surprise. The one hummus that I wasn't a huge fan of was the beet; it didn't have a lot of flavor, which was disappointing.   The only downside is that it is a little pricey, which makes it more of a \"once in awhile\" place."}
{"text":"MAD Greens fails to be everything Cafe Zupas is. The salad portions are tiny with very little protein. The sandwiches are uninspired and flat on flavor. The hummus is OK, but everything is overpriced.   The delicious soda fountain with pure-cane sugar soft drinks is the only saving grace, but it's not enough to compensate for a blah lunch."}
{"text":"SO good. I got the Southwest Bowl and it was everything i love in a bowl. The blueberry soda was also delicious. Would come back."}
{"text":"This place was packed at lunchtime (always a good sign). I did a half sandwich and a half salad and both were delivered fast and very fresh. I don't usually drink soda but you can't go wrong with splurging on Maine Root Beer!  Not the place to go if you are looking for good conversation, but if in a rush for lunch and don't mind the noise it is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Tried the BBQ chicken bowl that's on special right now. Loved the amount of spice/heat and flavor!  It was my first time there and the staff was so patient and helpful guiding me through the ordering process! Can't wait to try other items!"}
{"text":"My favorite salad place!  They will prepare any salad for you made to order or just choose from their menu and modify.  The dressings are incredible and seasonings are just right. Everything is fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I think the set up, and background is amazing! Who doesn't love to buy locally grown things. The service was very slow and my wrap was very dry. I asked for a dressing and it was running out so she only put a drop on and stopped. I'll give this place another try but I hope it's a little better next time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a co worker and had multiple orders for others back at the office. Called in all the orders individually and the process for ordering and pick up was seamless. Very polite and easygoing. They went thru all the bags prior to our departure and it appeared all was in order. Back at the office however we discovered they had forgotten the dipping sauces for the panini's. Frustrating but not that big of a deal. Then the few who ordered salads were a bit surprised at the small portion size considering the more then moderate price would indicate. I had a hummus trio (see pictures) and quinoa super salad. All of it delicious however the hummus portions were on the small side. My boss ordered a wrap and it was small as well. No bigger then a microwave burro really. Suffice it to say that they have really good food but the prices are kinda high for the portion sizes (at least for to go orders) ..... Will we go back? Maybe. They did have really good fresh juices however at $6.50 for what is fairly small compared to other juice places ... Maybe not lol. If you do go however .... Make sure you grab one of the complimentary caramel candy by the register. Simply amazing!!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients!!  But the service was soooooooooo slow... not sure if understaffed but you figure that three employees should have been better able to serve us, we waited over 15 minutes to place our order.  We figured that for the same price we could have gone to a sit down restaurant with table service."}
{"text":"I had the big Athena salad and it was fresh and delicious. My kids loved the kids box and the amazing variety of things for them to snack on.   We would go back again."}
{"text":"Awesome! The Pancho Villa was amazing, and I got the Doc Holliday to take with me to work. I wish they used Uber Eats or Postmates though, cause I don't live particularly close to any of the locations. I'll be back, plenty of times though, regardless. One of everything, thank you"}
{"text":"It's free Salad Day!!! I've been waiting for its opening for a while. I had the Crazy Ivan salad. The taste is really good. They have a lot of options and it was hard to decide. They have a creat your own salad but not a pre-designed vegetarian option. So it's not the most convenient for vegetarians to just order something quick off the menu. The price is at a higher end but it is definitely not cheap to eat healthy food in general."}
{"text":"Omg this place is soo good. Wish it was closer but will travel to try all the different salads and wraps. Love the root soda. The don quixote salad was the bomb, try with the spicy yogurt instead good flavor."}
{"text":"I ordered the Don Quixote and got an herbal tea.  The salad was delicious and am in love with their tea (it had mint in it!!).  The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The prices are very reasonable, the portions are generous and everything is made fresh in front of you. I got the Poe and it was delicious! They also have a super cute soda fountain with unique options. I got the pink drink, prickly pear lemonade and it was amazing. Go here and get yourself something delicious :)"}
{"text":"This is not my first time here, and I am definitely a fan. It is not a place that I would come every day, although I think I could find something different on the menu each day for quite a while.   Usually, I get the regular size salads, but the large is nice if you want to share or if you're really hungry.   The ingredients are fresh and always tasty. My opinion is that most of the dressings have a very subtle flavor, so you may want to have them put it on heavy if you are someone who likes a \"dressing-forward\" salad. Sometimes, I want the dressing to be the star -- like when I don't have a lot of interesting things to put into the salad, but I usually like to have the salad's ingredients shine on their own with the dressing supporting them. In this way, MAD greens does exactly what I like.  I've had a few different salads and my favorite one so far has been the Siam I Am. This is a hearty salad with chicken, carrots, green onions, spinach, kale, quinoa, edamame and peanuts, all with a ginger soy dressing. Understand that I am not a \"kale person,\" so I don't eat this just because it has kale in it  :)  The salad is honestly very tasty and I look forward to my next one. Although, I think the Ty Cobb is next on my list.   They have a nice variety of cold teas in addition to their cane sugar-based sodas: white, block, green, and herbal."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The hummus is some of the best I have had. Avocado Jalapeno hummus is crazy tasty. Cuban Panini and E Poe Salad are outstanding! Fast seating, everything taste very fresh. Employees are ultra friendly. Causal fast food. Many dietary needs are met here."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite salad place. I love their salad combos, especially that there are seasonal salads with special ingredients. My current favorite is the Bonnie Parker. I love the apples, Gouda, and pecans. I've never had a salad I didn't like here. Other favorites include the Don Quixote and the Crazy Ivan. The staff here is efficient and friendly. This is my go to spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Finding vegan options can be hard but at MAD Greens it's made simple. Pretty much everything on the menu can be made Vegan. The ingredients are fresh and everything is made right there on the spot. It could be a little pricey depending on what you order and how hungry you are. The grain bowls are super filling so if you're on the hungrier side, I'd recommend those."}
{"text":"Food was okay, a little pricey for what it is. Got a rice bowl, but not too many vegetables in it. Just a lot of rice!"}
{"text":"Love your salads but please please get gluten free tortillas for the wraps ."}
{"text":"Completely delicious. It's nice to have some healthy food options and this place fits the bill. Their produce is super fresh too and they grow their own tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid salad joint with pretty decent prices! This was my second time here, and I got the Crazy Ivan salad and added on the side option of dried tomato hummus with pita. They ask if you want everything on it, and if you want light/medium/heavy dressing, so there's a slight degree of customization. My coworker ordered the Bonnie Parker salad and went wild over the apples in it. I would also recommend the Mighty Aphrodite and spicy avocado hummus, both of which I got last time. There wasn't really any wait, despite it being quite busy, and everyone who works there is always very friendly. Overall, I would come back here for healthier lunch options, though I will probably start going lighter on the dressing and add-ins, since a salad can quickly get heavy if you add too much stuff."}
{"text":"I visited this location on opening day, which was Thursday, 25Jun.  They were offering free MAD salads all day (10:30am-8pm).  The line was long, but they were well-organized and things moved rather quickly.    I got the Don Quixote salad. They were not allowing people to make any substitution really, but when I told them that I was vegan, they were very accomodating and allowed me to sub the meat for their Grilled Piri Piri Tofu, and instead of cheese I got green onions. I also switched dressings and got the Red Pepper Dressing instead of the non-vegan dressing that comes with it. I love the Red Pepper Dressing! Fresh baby greens, mangos, roasted corn, and avocado with MAD spice were all included in this salad, and it was SO good!   From someone who does NOT fancy tofu, the flavor for theirs is very impressive. I'm a fan!  DEAR VEGANS: There is a print out by the dressings which shows you which ones are vegan. Note: if it says \"Vegan*\" -WITH an asterisk sign, that means the dressing has honey. Pure vegan dressings will not have the asterisk. I suggest checking out their online interactive \"allergen\" menu; you can click everything that you want to omit and they'll produce a qualifying list of items. You can then click on each to see exactly what ingredients are used. FYI.   They also gave you a free drink with your free salad.  I typically do not drink soda, but I was intrigued by the organic fountain sodas they had. I tried the Vanilla Creme and it was quite sweet, yet tasty. I liked it. (Side note for ice connoisseurs, they have crushed ice!)  The salads range from $8-$10 for a regular and $9-$11 for a large, so it's a bit on the pricey side, but as long as they keep providing quality, fresh, and organic (the tofu is organic too) food, I don't mind shelling out a Hamilton every now and again for rabbit food.      This location is located in Tempe Marketplace, near the Harkins Theatre, next door to Cold Stone."}
{"text":"The service was great here. Very helpful staff, and had an incredible selection to choose from. I chose the Cobb salad, and everything tasted very fresh and crisp. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, so we got to enjoy the Phoenix weather and all of the holiday decorations they have out at Tempe Marketplace. Would recommend- a very delicious way to be healthy for the new year! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a quick, healthy bite. I got the Greek inspired Athena salad and it was delish. Very fresh and filling with loads of flavor. Also, they have some really yummy sodas like blueberry and vanilla cream that are amazing.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best salad I've had in a long time! I chose to build my own, so many options and the ginger dressings are amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here for lunch. Overall, bad experience . Girl who took my order was short with me and acted like she didn't want to be there. I wanted a small salad and a 1/2 a sandwich. I was never told that salad came with the sandwich and it's not on the menu anywhere. I order the small size of the \"Edgar Allen Poe\" salad. And 1/2 sandwich with an small iced tea. Total bill was $18. This is a ridiculous amount to pay for salad and 1/2 sandwich! Then I got my meal and realized I had 2 salads... The one I ordered and the one that came with my sandwich! This was very irritating. Also, I love eating healthy and the Edgar Allen Poe salad is very hard to eat. Not very good at all. For my first time here I would have loved some help picking a salad. Why is there NO pictures of the salads? Overall SUPER EXPENSIVE for a salad place and bad service. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else.  Over priced. Long wait. Takes too long to get your food. They have a bar of different veggies but charge extra for each. They even charge extra for onions. They only have cherry tomatoes, no other option.   Spinach, mozzarella wrap was awful. the ingredients weren't mixed together just uneven scoops of each ingredient in a flavorless, paper tasting wrap.  Two stars because the Pancho Villa salad was fine.  There are many other places in same area."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the soup/salad combo from here!  First off, they offer a lot of soups each day.  When I visited there were 4 soups on the menu.  Also, a big bonus is that they had indicators for which soups were vegetarian and which were dairy-free.  All the soups were dairy-free, which was amazing for someone lactose intolerant like me!!  I got the split pea kale soup in my combo.  It was sooo good and flavorful.  Really thick and hearty too.  Plus it came with a free side of pita that made it super filling.  For my salad portion I got the curry chicken salad.  It actually was not my favorite because it had too much chicken and not enough lettuce.  However, if you're looking for a big dose of protein, this salad would be perfect for you!  It especially tasted awesome with a dash of Mad spice on top :)  Next time I think I'd pick their Mad Greens side salad because it came with a lot of greens and different veggies.  Of course I also had to order an iced tea -- they have the best flavors there!  some are sweetened with honey, some with Stevia, and some unsweetened.  So no matter what your preference, they should have something you're looking for.  Another thing to love is that they're frequently offering coupons or discounts or BOGO specials.  Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"Q:  Why did the carrot get embarrassed? A:  Because it saw the chick pea!  I first came to MAD Greens when they invited Yelp Elites to try out their menu.  Since that amazing event, I've been wanting to pop back in.  As if by fate, I saw Dan Long on ABC15 this morning so it was a no brainer.  We'll be eating green for dinner!  As delicious as the Mighty Aphrodite salad was, I wanted to try a different salad.  We ordered a large Don Quixote, the Annie Oakley panini, and the Hummus Trio.  Everything came out fresh and delicious.  I think I'm in love with the Don Quixote salad.  That corn and mango was freakin' amazing and was super refreshing on this humid and rainy night.  Great flavor all around and generous portions.  The panini was also crunchy deliciousness!  I liked how they put the ranch on the side for optional panini-dipping.  Minus a couple slight hiccups where our server gave my salad to the table next to us, everything went smoothly [the patrons at the other table also informed me that my salad was indeed better than her's].  I was a bit confused though whether or not they had given me the regular or the large salad but the server ran off before I could ask.  She also took away our number without giving us our Hummus Trio so I had to wave down the other lost server walking around with our hummus.  No questions were asked when I said it was for us so that was nice.  That trust.  Anyways, while their salads are a bit on the higher end and you can go across the way for a $7 burrito bowl, you pay for local fresh produce!  It's healthier and tasty food that's good for you.  Eat clean and green, y'all!    You are what you eat so you better not be fast, cheap, easy, or fake."}
{"text":"I had MAD Greens today for the 1st time. It was delicious! well, at least my salad was. I got the Mark Twain which has pasta, red bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, feta cheese, and a vinaigrette dressing, the manager suggested spinach so it wouldn't be as heavy and he was right. The spinach gave it a great flavor. All the toppings look fresh at this location too. while I do think the prices are a little high, ($14.XX for a large salad and a drink), the portions were big and I was able to eat half for lunch and save the rest for dinner. which means I got two meals for that price. Staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Bonnie Parker Salad with Steak, smoked cheddar, apples, and spiced pecans ... spicy \"vinaigrette\" dressing that was PERFECT! Very light, not too \"vinegar-y\" and the right amount of heat... i liked their selection of drinks and other offerings too, even though I just ate the salad.. I'd eat here daily if I had one closer to me.. ;) Guess that's a good thing.. but I'll be back! And I'll bring the rest of the fam with me.. haha!"}
{"text":"In love with this place. Their salads are so fresh and tasty. Even though it is rare for me to order the same thing every time at a restaurant (I usually like to try new things) I keep getting their Doc Holiday salad because it is just so darn tasty. On my most recent visit, I ordered it with shrimp instead of the chicken (they are willing to customize anything here) and it was even better. I love asking for a dash of the \"mad spice\" to add a little hot kick to it as well."}
{"text":"The idea of this place is great, but it is very poorly executed.  I got the curry wrap, we got a kids meal for my son, and my wife got a panini. My wrap was essentially lettuce with a little piece of curry chicken salad. Maybe one tablespoon of curry chicken salad.  The girl that took my payment for the order didn't give us our drinks and when I was about to ask her for the drink she just ignored me, looked past me, and started ringing up the next person. Overall it was a bad experience and they need to tighten up their operation if they want to succeed in such a crowded market."}
{"text":"I call this place the home of the $10 salad. It's everything it's hyped up to be... it's fresh, it's good, you will want to come back, you will recommend it... it is just EXPENSIVE. Considering what you get and how much you pay... you end up walking out of there perplexed. Yes, I had a good meal (salad) and a drink and it cost me $13? I am trying to think how many people it could feed if I went to the store and paid $13 and made salads for them... Welp, I guess that is the price you pay for convenience.  Well done Mad Greens, you have me, $13 for a salad and a drink. I'll be back. Thanks in advance."}
